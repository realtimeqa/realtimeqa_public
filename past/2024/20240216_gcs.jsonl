With one of the biggest broods of periodical cicadas, the Great Eastern Brood (Brood X), emerging after 17 years underground, billions of the bugs will fill skies and cover trees in Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Ohio, and eastern Tennessee, according to the U.S. Forest Service.\n\nWhile Brood X awakens, the main colony of cicadas that takes over Iowa every 17 years remains asleep.\n\nMore:No, they won't bite: Here are 7 common myths about cicadas debunked\n\nThe Iowan Brood (Brood III), which covers much of Iowa and parts of Missouri and western Illinois, last hatched in 2014.

The adults live for up to six weeks, during which time they mate and lay eggs on the trees' twigs. After another six weeks, the newly hatched nymphs burrow below ground.\n\nTHE SOUND: The adult males sing to attract female mates, from about 10 a.m. to midafternoon.

And experts say swarms of bugs can cause understandable stress for many people, especially as billions or trillions of the creatures emerge from the ground.\n\nKatherine Brownlowe, a psychiatrist at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, said cicadas can evoke anxieties, particularly for people with sensory overload sensitivities, a phobia of cicadas or an anxiety disorder for a few reasons.\n\n\"There is kind of a discomfort or disgust feeling that's common for most humans around most bugs, Brownlowe said. \"The discomfort we can have is almost evolutionary.\"\n\nThe noise is also a legitimate nuisance. Floyd Shockley, co-leader of the Entomology Department at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History, said spending long periods of time around the bugs without hearing protection can be \"painful.\"\n\nExperts say the bugs aren't dangerous, but the noise and anxiety they can create are real concerns for some people. Here's what to know:\n\nWhat's happening with cicadas in spring 2024?\n\nTwo different groups, or broods, of cicadas, are expected to emerge in the Southeast and Midwest beginning in mid-May and lasting through late June. Brood XIX is expected to emerge in 14 states – including Alabama, Arkansas and Georgia. Brood XIII is expected in the Midwestern states of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa and Wisconsin.\n\nDespite the the noise they produce, the critters are not otherwise harmful to humans and can provide environmental benefits, including a food source for birds, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nA bit of anxiety about the cicadas is normal\n\nIt's normal to feel a little anxious or uneasy as the noise ramps up and huge numbers of unfamiliar big bugs appear, Brownlowe said.\n\n\"But Americans largely shouldn't be afraid,\" she said.\n\nMeanwhile, people who experience sensory sensitives and live in areas where the cicadas will emerge are likely to feel more anxious about the noise from the critters than people without them — and for legitimate reason, said Zoe Gross, a director of advocacy at the national nonprofit organization Autistic Self Advocacy Network.\n\nNoise from the cicadas will be noticeable for those people, including autistic people, she said.\n\n\"It’s much more magnified to you than it might be to someone without this disability,\" Gross said.\n\nAnd people who have difficulty with change will experience a double whammy, with the added noise and an unfamiliar environment when the seasons change, she said.\n\nAre cicadas loud enough to hurt your hearing?\n\nKind of.\n\nThey make a buzzing noise that can be as loud as a lawnmower. But only those who are exposed to large groups of the bugs for longer than 10 or 15 minutes could experience temporary hearing impairments, said Thomas Powers, who lives in New Jersey and provides management consulting to companies within the hearing health industry as the founder of Powers Consulting.\n\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration's legal limit for noise level in the workplace is 90 decibels over the course of eight hours, an average workday in the U.S.\n\nCicadas in large groups can get up to 100 decibels, Powers said. But it's unlikely the average American will get close enough to them or stay near them long enough to experience any sort of hearing loss.\n\n\"By the time you get up to about 100 decibels, you shouldn’t be in that environment for more than 15 minutes,\" Powers said. \"If I think back to cicadas here, well, they’re interesting, but I'm not sure I want to stay up there for 6 to 8 hours listening to them.\"\n\nIn areas where a large number of cicadas have emerged and the males are all singing at the same time the sound can be “impressive,” said Shockley.\n\n“To the point that I’ve been in an area where I had to put earplugs in because they were so loud and so abundant that it was painful,” he said.\n\nWhat can people do about the noise?\n\nThere are ways to tune out the fears before they become limiting to one's everyday life, Brownlowe said.\n\nExperts said best practices include:\n\nExposure therapy: Spending time outside around the bugs can make the experience less uneasy, Brownlowe said.\n\nThinking of the sounds cicadas exude as white noise.\n\nPlaying white noise or music in the background to distract from the noise of cicadas.\n\nWearing earplugs or headphones to lower the noise level.\n\nReading a social story, which is a scenario depicted in photos that can prepare people for an unfamiliar situation.\n\nCicadas 2024:2 broods to emerge together in US for first time in over 200 years\n\nContact Kayla Jimenez at kjimenez@usatoday.com.

When heavy insect and bat activity fades by late summer, bird movements become easier to track and display on easy-to-read forecast maps.\n\nBirders don't associate fall migration with the official fall season because movements can begin as early as mid June for some species, said Cornell’s Andrew Farnsworth.\n\nHow do birds keep warm in winter:Birds can survive frigid winter temperatures.

He rises with the sun and travels up and down his more than 1,000 acres in northwest Indiana, something he has done for decades.\n\nBut this time, he paid particular attention to the way the light played off the stalks of corn and peaked through the trees at the edge of his land.\n\nThis will be the last year that he and his family harvests corn. But Welker will still be a farmer — he’s going to farm the sun.\n\n“We’ve always harnessed the sun, and have enough sun to grow a corn crop,” said 62-year-old Welker, who lives and farms in Starke and Pulaski counties. “But now, we are harvesting it far more efficiently than we’ve ever done before.”\n\nWelker is not alone: He is one of dozens of neighbors who are leasing their land for what will be the largest solar farm in the United States, right here in Indiana. At 13,000 acres — roughly 1,000 times the size of Lucas Oil Stadium — it is aptly named the Mammoth Solar project.\n\nThis project — a partnership between Indiana and Israeli-based Doral Renewables LLC — is expected to bring a roughly $1.5 billion investment into the state over the next five years. It will also mean huge financial gains for the local landowners as well as Starke and Pulaski counties where it’s located.\n\n“This is going to have major benefits,” said Lisa Dan, the executive director of the Starke County Economic Development Foundation. “If we need to be known for something, I don’t mind being known as the solar capital of Indiana and beyond.”\n\nThe project will be completed in three phases. The company broke ground on the first phase in October in a ceremony attended by Gov. Eric Holcomb and Israel’s ambassador to the United States. According to plans, all three phases should be up and running by 2024.\n\n\"It’s an incredibly electrifying day for the state of Indiana,\" Holcomb said in a release. “Knowing Indiana will continue to play a key role in the global energy sector while creating real change in our Hoosier communities is empowering.\"\n\nMillions of solar panels\n\nThe project first began roughly two years ago, and it started with reaching out to landowners, educating them and answering their questions. Mammoth Solar president and co-founder Nick Cohen said he felt that was key.\n\n“Farmers want to look you in the eye and see if you’re serious about this,” Cohen said. “If you don’t do that, then you won’t be able to have a solar farm. You have to connect and show them you will take care of their generational farm.”\n\nThis step was especially important for the company, Cohen said, because it was coming into an area that had effectively banned wind energy through past ordinances. He wanted to make sure the community wasn’t going to kick them out, too.\n\n“The first thing we did was ask the community about their view on solar. It was the number one gating item,” said Cohen, who was optimistic at the response.\n\nOnce the community learned about the potential of this project, Welker said landowners were quick to sign up: “They wanted to do their research, but as soon as they did, they found there really was no downside.”\n\nIn total, about 60 landowners between the two counties will be part of this project — bringing together a total of about 13,000 acres. That said, only about 20% of those acres will actually have panels on them.\n\nMuch of the land has forests and wetlands on them, which all will stay. There also will be a lot of green space for the setbacks from the edge of property lines and farm ditches as well as the area in between panels.\n\nWhile panels will cover about only 2,500 acres, there will be roughly 2.85 million panels across the solar farm — enough to power nearly a quarter-million homes.\n\nScrub Hub: How much of the U.S. carbon emissions come from Indiana? (Hint: It's a lot)\n\nDoral was particularly drawn to this area for landscape. It also has a strong network of existing transmission lines with enough available capacity to take on the power from this project and move it where it needs to go.\n\nIt’s also where power lines for two different grids, MISO and PJM, intersect. That means there were two markets where the company could sell the energy from the solar farm.\n\n“It’s like having two different grain elevators to choose from, to put it in the words of a farmer,” said Welker, who has 1,700 acres in the project, making him one of the biggest farmers.\n\nDoral ultimately chose to sell into the PJM market, which serves the northeast corner of Indiana along with Ohio, Pennsylvania and several other western states. Energy from the first phase that kicked off last month will be sold to American Electric Power, the parent company of Indiana Michigan Power.\n\nMost of the power produced from the solar farm will be used by the homes and businesses around the project. Whatever isn’t used will continue to travel farther along the lines until it’s consumed.\n\n“When it does go somewhere far away, that’s great because it means Indiana farmers are exporting power to other states,” Cohen said.\n\nEconomic and environmental benefits\n\nNot only are landowners getting green energy, but they also are getting big financial gains. The amount of money farmers will get for their land is significantly more than what they would get from either leasing it or farming it themselves, Welker said.\n\nThis will help many people’s family farms survive for at least another generation.\n\n“I’m 62 years old and I have daughters and they are not interested in farming, so it wasn’t difficult for me to make that decision,” Welker said. “And it’s a better use of the land anyways and much more financially rewarding.”\n\nThe funding for this project is coming from private investment and the company itself, Cohen said, without the help of subsidies or tax credits. It will be a huge economic benefit for the individual counties, too.\n\n“Solar is not going to be coming to every area forever,” Cohen said. “These types of projects are a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the main streets of rural communities to come back.”\n\nThere will be an initial influx of hundreds of jobs for the construction and then around 50 permanent jobs to operate the solar farm.\n\nEach county will also see additional tax revenues from these projects, as well as new money from updated tax assessments. That means that both Pulaski and Starke counties will bring in an additional $1 million to $2 million each year for the next couple decades.\n\nFor less-populated rural counties, that new funding represents almost one-fifth of each county’s annual budget.\n\n“My first reaction was holy cow, we just found a leprechaun pot of gold,” said Nathan Origer, Pulaski County’s economic development director. “That money is no small potatoes for a county like ours.”\n\nElectricity:AES wants customers to pay extra as Eagle Valley power plant sits offline for 6 months\n\nOriger said he can see these funds going toward expanding the justice center or upgrading the county courthouse. Dan from Starke County said she hopes the money might be used to build out the county’s public parks and trails system — things that “will help bring more people into the county.”\n\nEither way, they hope it will bring quality of life improvements into the county that wouldn’t otherwise be possible without increasing taxes.\n\nThis change also could mean huge environmental benefits, Cohen said.\n\nBy no longer farming the land, about one billion gallons of irrigation water will be saved each year. Roughly 2,000 tons of carbon emissions from coal will also be avoided annually. There will also be significantly fewer pesticides and fertilizers applied to the land, which often can run off and pollute surrounding waterways.\n\n“Cornfields are not habitat for anything other than corn: We don’t let weeds grow in there and don’t let insects exist above or below ground,” Welker said. “This will be far more environmentally-friendly than actually continuing to farm on this land, I believe.”\n\nIn another effort to bring genetic diversity back to the area, Cohen said they will plant a lot of native pollinator species around the solar farm to encourage more bees, butterflies and wildlife. Welker said he is looking forward to planting a lot of milkweed to help the struggling monarch butterfly population.\n\nThose pollinators will help other farmers in the area, and there also is the potential to grow produce around the panels and have sheep grazing. It’s just the beginning, Cohen said.\n\n“We think we will blaze a trail for this in the Midwestern climate,” he said, “it’s a big deal.”\n\nFuture of renewables\n\nStill, the project hasn’t moved forward without a few obstacles along the way.\n\nThere have been some folks opposed to the project. One of the concerns raised is taking farmland out of production, though Welker said none of this land that will be used for the project is considered prime farmland.\n\nIn fact, much of the corn from this land currently goes to ethanol production. But as several auto-manufacturers announce moves toward being fully electric in just 15 years, Welker said this is a better way of producing fuel for the future.\n\n“So let’s convert some of this acreage to direct electrical production,” the farmer said. “We can only utilize that sun energy for a few months of the year growing corn, but now, even in the winter, we can still be harvesting the sun.”\n\nThe other main worry is the visual change. Some people have said they don’t want to see shiny metal panels replace rolling cornfields.\n\nCohen said that is an easy fix, however. They will plant trees to act as a landscaping barrier to hide the panels. The technology will also be set back quite far from roads — so even people who want to see them will have difficulty spotting them, he added.\n\nThat is the main distinction between solar and wind in these counties, Origer said, and why the community is open to one but against the other. Many residents think wind turbines are much more intrusive on the eye and can’t be easily hidden, in addition to noise and safety concerns.\n\nA similar debate played out in this year’s legislative session. A bill was proposed that would have created some consistent standards across the state for things such as setbacks and noise limits. The goal, the authors said, was to help bring further renewable investments to Indiana.\n\nThis bill was met with strong local pushback, however, arguing that those decisions should stay in the hands of local government. Ultimately the bill failed.\n\nDan said she originally was against the idea of statewide standards, but now sees the potential benefits of having some guidance on how to form local ordinances. Welker said he believes these decisions should be at the most local level: individual landowners. They can say no if they don’t want it on their land, he said, but shouldn’t be able to stand in the way of their neighbors.\n\nWhile the county governments in both Starke and Pulaski have approved the projects and all necessary zoning changes, there currently is an ongoing legal challenge in Pulaski.\n\nCohen said that Doral plans to appeal the case and he remains “highly confident” that they will go to construction on the project’s second and third phases next year. and still remains optimistic they will be able to break ground next year.\n\n“The people want this and we have the will of the community leadership,” Cohen said. “We will get there.”\n\nOriger also echoes that while there may be a few details to work out, it is very unusual to completely overturn the Zoning Board’s ruling.\n\nConstruction on the first phase in Starke County is set to begin in the spring and will take about 18 months. Building the second and third phases in Pulaski County should begin later in 2022 and wrap up in 2024.\n\nWhile Mammoth Solar won’t forever be the biggest solar farm in the country as more projects continue to be proposed, Cohen said, it is putting Indiana on the map now.\n\nBY THE NUMBERS\n\n13,000 — Total acres in the Mammoth Solar project.

By 2018, much of the region had returned to drought status.\n\nA history of Texas aridity\n\nHow bad can it get? History records three particularly devastating droughts within living memory.\n\nDepending on where you lived, the two worst of the past 100 years took place during the 1930s, when the Dust Bowl worsened the misery of the Great Depression, and during the 1950s, when an eight-year stretch of aridity inspired the title of Elmer Kelton's classic novel, \"The Time It Never Rained.\"\n\nA third awful drought during the early 21st century weighs more heavily on the minds of Texans who are younger than, say, 60, and therefore don't personally recall the 1930s or 1950s.\n\nAlthough exacerbated by climate change, this is not a new phenomenon. Humans have found ways to survive droughts since they first arrived in this part of the world some 20,000 years ago, according to the latest archeological research.\n\nDuring the 1500s, the first European to write about Texas, Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, stumbled on an agricultural community near present-day Presidio that had not seen rain in two years.\n\nIn 1822, Stephen F. Austin's colony lost its first corn crop to dry weather.\n\n\"Each decade since then has been marked by at least one period of severe drought,\" reports the Handbook of Texas Online. \"Associated with dry times are grasshopper plagues, brush and grass fires, sand and dust storms, crop failures and depression, livestock deaths, disease resulting from insufficient and impure drinking water, and migrations of citizens from parched territory.\"\n\nBy some estimates, extreme droughts visit Texas about every 20 years; less severe ones every three or four years.\n\nDroughts during the 19th century stunted the growth of several parts of the state, especially West Texas.\n\nIn 1883, for instance, during a wet cycle, railroads punched through West Texas toward the Pacific, while the state government opened up public lands for sale. The double deal drew hopeful farmers and ranchers out west.\n\nMany headed back to wetter climes after the drought of 1884-86.\n\n'These dusty blues are the dustiest ones I know'\n\nYou didn't need to be folk singer Woody Guthrie to sing the blues in the Texas Panhandle — and other parts of the Midwest — during the Dust Bowl of the 1930s.\n\nThe images imprinted on our collective minds by John Steinbeck's \"The Grapes of Wrath\" and Dorothea Lange's striking documentary photography make the Dust Bowl impossible to forget, even if we didn't live through the times.\n\nPreviously, during the 1920s, a rush to cultivate the southern plains — forgetting that parts of this expanse were once called the \"Great American Desert\" — led to the \"great plough-up,\" during which native grasses, which anchored the soil, were replaced with tilled farms that exposed the soil to the wind.\n\nDuring the 1930s, stretches of drought, wind erosion and monster dust storms spread across West Texas, along with parts of New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas and Colorado.\n\nWind erosion peaked in the late 1930s with 68 dust storms in 1936; 72 in 1937; and 61 in 1938.\n\n\"In Amarillo, the worst year for storms was 1935, when they lasted a total of 908 hours,\" reports the Handbook of Texas Online. \"Seven times from January to March, the visibility in Amarillo declined to zero; one of these complete blackouts lasted 11 hours. In another instance a single storm raged for 3½ days.\"\n\n\"Times were rough during the Depression,\" the late Travis County farmer Rubert Ceder told the American-Statesman in 2013. He died in 2016. \"The drought was so bad, we took in just one bale of cotton. If it wasn't for FDR, I don't know what would have happened.\"\n\nCeder felt that the 1930s drought was tougher than the later scorcher of the 1950s.\n\n\"We didn't have fertilizer in the '30s,\" he says. \"Then, you just planted, cultivated and gathered, if anything grew.\"\n\nAs Ceder noted, President Franklin Roosevelt's intervention helped. The Dust Bowl covered 100 million acres by 1935, but had declined to 22 million acres by 1940, thanks to the federal Soil Conservation Service, a New Deal program that oversaw more than 500 Civilian Conservation Corps camps during this period.\n\nEight years during the 1950s with almost no relief\n\nThere's a reason Texas history buffs still read Elmer Kelton's \"The Time It Never Rained,\" besides Kelton's expert depictions of West Texas ranch life, and his portrait of a smart, cantankerous rancher named Charlie Flagg. Kelton, who served as the farm and ranch reporter for the San Angelo Standard-Times as well as Livestock magazine, left us one of the best records of the Texas drought of the 1950s, when in his own words, \"the longest and most severe drought in living memory pressed ranchers and farmers to the outer limits of courage and endurance.\"\n\nDroughts are slow. Not easy to dramatize. Kelton found a way to do so by taking each disaster, triumph and setback as part of rancher Flagg's steadily constricting circumstances.\n\nBetween 1949 and 1957, Texas received up to 50% less rain than usual. Temperatures soared above average. Three years — 1951, 1954 and 1956 — count among the driest in the state's history. The number of Texas farms and ranches was reduced from 345,000 to 247,000, and the state's rural population dropped precipitously.\n\nEconomic losses from 1950 to 1957 were estimated in the tens of billions of dollars.\n\nThe drought ended when an April 24, 1957, storm brought down 10 inches of rain, as well as hail and tornadoes, on wide stretches of Texas within a few hours. The rain continued for 32 days; floods followed.\n\nRural Texas — once at the heart of the state's self-image — never really recovered.\n\n“Shifting economic trends — including the decline of the railroads, decreased cotton production, and the depressions of 1921 and 1932 — contributed to the wane of rural prosperity,” wrote photographer Jim Alvis in his documentary picture book, \"Texas Passing: A Fading Rural Heritage.\" “In many parts of the state, severe drought conditions in the 1930s and again in the 1950s, not to mention major infestations of insect pests such as boll weevil and screwworm, often proved an overwhelming challenge for small farmers and ranchers.”\n\nExtreme drought not a distant memory\n\nThe drought and oppressive heat that peaked in 2011 did not just send folks indoors toward the comfort of air-conditioning; it made planners consider a whole range of options for dealing with future higher temperatures with no increase in rainfall.\n\nThe 2011 drought cost the Texas economy $8.7 billion in livestock and other agricultural losses. Rice farmers downriver of Austin were cut off from Highland Lakes water; they have been again and will not receive a water allotment for the second crop of 2022.\n\nTexas A&M scientists estimated that the number of trees destroyed statewide that year by wildfires — the worst of them the Bastrop Complex Fire during September and October — at more than 300 million.\n\nScientists paid attention. And rang the alarm.\n\n\"Experts warn that a warmer Texas likely will to lead to declines in dairy production, steeper competition for water and spikes in disease,\" environmental reporter Asher Price wrote in the American-Statesman in 2011. \"By midcentury, average temperatures in Texas could increase by 5 degrees over the average temperature in the period between 1976 and 2005. By end of the century, average temperatures could increase by as much as 8 degrees.\"\n\nI remember the 90 days of temperatures in the 100s that year, again in my bones. We lost well-established trees in our garden. A habitual pedestrian, I found that my walking stopped by 11 a.m. and didn't return until the sun was down. The lakes dried up and people stayed indoors with our depressing version of \"seasonal affective disorder.\"\n\nAlthough in mid-July 2022, we are only half way through the six months of normally hot weather here, I note the dread and despair in people's voices when they talk about the heat.\n\nHistory demonstrates that it can get worse. Much worse.\n\nMichael Barnes writes about the people, places, culture and history of Austin and Texas.

At least not in the traditional sense.\n\nGlobal warming bears all the hallmarks of environmental catastrophe: dwindling rivers, raging wildfires, dying animals and more. But those consequences aren't even half the story. Experts say climate change could devastate human health, the economy and national security, making the world a more dangerous place to live and widening the gap between the rich and the poor.\n\nIn many places, people are already feeling those impacts.\n\nClimate-linked heat waves, disease outbreaks and food shortages have already killed an untold number of people. Droughts, hurricanes and wildfires made more likely by climate change have exacted a huge economic toll, as have rising sea levels. A growing body of research indicates that a severe drought helped kindle the Syrian Civil War — just one example of why the Pentagon considers climate change a national security \"threat multiplier.\"\n\n\"From almost any perspective that you choose to look at this from, it makes sense to stop the indiscriminate burning of fossil fuels, to stop our heavy reliance on energy sources from volatile, dangerous parts of the world, to turn toward energy strategies that will be safer, healthier, more sustainable and create more jobs and opportunities,\" said Rep. Jared Huffman, D-San Rafael.\n\nThe Desert Sun spoke with half a dozen experts about how climate change affects human health, the economy and national security. Here's a breakdown of what they said.\n\nClimate change is complicated, but one of its biggest health impacts is easy to understand: As the world gets hotter, more people will get sick or die due to extreme heat.\n\nIn 2014, the National Climate Assessment — a collaboration between a dozen government agencies — released its latest report detailing the effects of global warming in the United States. The report noted that extreme summer heat is already on the rise, and that heat waves \"are projected to increase in frequency, intensity, and duration.\" Across the country, the hottest days could be 10 to 15 degrees Fahrenheit warmer by 2100 if nothing is done to curb greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nTHE CURRENT: Sign up for The Desert Sun's energy and water newsletter\n\nOver the last 30 years, nearly 4,000 people have died due to heat in the United States, according to the National Weather Service. In Russia, a 2010 heat wave killed more than 50,000 people — and it was made three times more likely by climate change, one study found.\n\n\"It's quite likely that heat waves are getting more severe and more frequent because of climate change,\" said Howard Frumkin, dean of the University of Washington's School of Public Health.\n\nAs the world heats up, illnesses that once were confined to the tropics are starting to spread north and south, often because rising temperatures create ideal conditions for the heat-loving insects that carry them. Frumkin pointed to dengue fever and Lyme disease, which he said have taken root in the United States due to changing climate conditions. Some scientists believe global warming will help mosquitoes carrying Zika virus spread further into the United States.\n\nFrumkin predicted that climate change's most significant health consequences won't come from extreme heat or chaotic weather, but rather from damage to agriculture. Rising temperatures are expected to reduce global food production, because some crops don't grow as well in high heat and because rainfall will become more unreliable in certain regions.\n\nLOSING SNOW: What global warming means for water supplies\n\nIn many developing countries, lower food production could mean more deaths from starvation and undernutrition. In countries like the United States, it could mean higher food prices. When food prices have gone up in the past, Frumkin said, poorer Americans have increasingly turned toward cheaper, lower-nutrient foods that contribute to health problems like obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure.\n\n\"We may aggravate our chronic disease problems,\" he said.\n\nLike many of the effects of climate change, reduced food production will hit the world's most vulnerable people the hardest, with poor countries suffering more than rich countries. In the United States, the poor and people of color are expected to experience the worst consequences from global warming.\n\nINTERACTIVE: Where the presidential candidates stand on climate\n\nLinda Rudolph, director of the Climate Change and Public Health Project at the nonprofit Public Health Institute, called global warming \"a double whammy for people of color and low-income communities.\" Those communities already suffer disproportionately from chronic health issues like asthma, heart diseases and diabetes, Rudolph said, making them more vulnerable to smog, wildfire smoke and other air pollutants associated with climate change or the burning of fossil fuels. Agricultural workers face some of the greatest risks, she said, because they spend so much time laboring under the hot sun.\n\n\"If you live in poor-quality housing where you don't have decent screens on windows, you're more susceptible to being bitten by mosquitoes,\" Rudolph said. \"If you're poor and already having a hard time buying enough food at the end of every month, then when food prices go up, you're at greater risk of food insecurity, and at greater chronic disease risk.\"\n\nMany of the power plants that spew planet-warming greenhouse gases also emit local air pollutants like sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury and particulate matter. Cutting carbon emissions, experts say, would also help to reduce those pollutants, which are most prevalent in poor communities.\n\nIt's hard to count the number of deaths directly attributable to global warming. A 2012 report from the international humanitarian group DARA estimated that climate change already kills 400,000 people per year, mostly through hunger and disease. The World Health Organization estimates that by 2030, climate change will be responsible for about 240,000 deaths per year.\n\n\"It's only going to get worse,\" Rudolph said. \"The choices that we make today to reduce carbon pollution from coal plants, or reduce carbon pollution from our cars — we can still make changes that will reduce the magnitude of the longer-term impacts on the health of our children.\"\n\nREAD MORE: The new climate rallying cry: keep it in the ground\n\nClimate change is expected to wreak havoc on our pocketbooks, too.\n\nIt's hard to know how many dollars and cents global warming will cost the world. But some experts have tried to quantify the threat. Among them are researchers working with the Risky Business Project, a bipartisan initiative convened by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, liberal financier Tom Steyer, and Henry Paulson, who served as Treasury secretary under President George W. Bush.\n\nIn a 2014 report, the Risky Business Project found that between $238 billion and $507 billion worth of coastal property will likely be below sea level in the United States by 2100, if current trends continue. There's a small but not insignificant chance that number could reach $701 billion.\n\nThe group also estimated that by 2100, the average American will probably experience between 45 and 96 days each year over 95 degrees Fahrenheit. That heat could reduce the productivity of outdoor workers by as much as 3 percent, the report found, not to mention lead to more deaths. Farm yields could drop as much as 70 percent in parts of the South and Midwest, although some of that loss could be made up by geographic shifts in crop production. Energy demand could shoot up as people use more air conditioning, especially in the Southwest and Southeast.\n\nIn a 2014 essay, Paulson compared climate change to the 2008 financial meltdown. Failing to act on climate, he wrote, would be \"even more serious\" than America's failure to avert the financial crisis.\n\n\"The carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that we emit into the atmosphere today will remain there for centuries, and government will not be able to avert catastrophe at the last minute,\" he wrote. \"It's as if we're watching as we fly slow motion toward a giant mountain. We can see the crash coming, but we're sitting on our hands instead of altering course.\"\n\nMarshall Burke, an economist and professor of Earth system science at Stanford University, has studied the impacts of higher temperatures on labor and agricultural productivity. He co-authored a study last year finding that by 2100, unchecked climate change could make the world 23 percent poorer than it otherwise would have been, in terms of gross domestic product per person.\n\nThe United States would fare worse than the world as a whole, ending up 36 percent poorer than it otherwise would have been, Burke and two other professors found.\n\nThey reached that number by looking at how countries performed economically in hotter years versus colder years from 1960 through 2010, once other factors were removed from the equation. They found that economies generally did worse during hot years, all else held equal. Then they estimated how temperatures will change over the next century, under a scenario where humanity does little or nothing to stem the emission of greenhouse gases.\n\n\"I think people intuitively understand that they feel less productive on hot days. And imagine you now have a lot of those hot days,\" Burke said.\n\nREAD MORE: Why fighting climate change won't destroy the economy\n\nSince most poor countries are already hot to begin with, Burke said, their economies will suffer the most. On the other hand, some rich countries — including Canada and much of Europe — are relatively cold right now, meaning they could actually experience some economic gains.\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders drew scorn from conservatives last year when he said at a Democratic presidential debate that climate change \"is directly related to the growth of terrorism.\" He had previously called climate change the greatest national security threat facing the United States.\n\nNational security experts say it's difficult to compare global warming to more conventional threats, like nuclear proliferation and ISIS. But they agree that global warming has already made America less safe. Rising temperatures, they say, could aggravate conflicts and stoke extremism in already-unstable regions, while simultaneously threatening America's military readiness.\n\n\"The Department of Defense has labeled climate change a 'threat multiplier' in strategic documents. What that means is that it makes other security risks worse,\" said Francesco Femia, co-founder and president of the Center for Climate and Security, a think tank based in Washington, D.C. \"That's the issue, not climate change in competition with terrorism.\"\n\nPUBLIC OPINION: Most Americans say climate is changing, humans to blame\n\nThe idea of climate change as a national security threat is becoming conventional wisdom in military circles. As early as 2003, a report from Bush's Pentagon warned that abrupt climate change could spark \"a desperate need for natural resources such as energy, food and water,\" helping trigger military conflicts. Last year, the Department of Defense issued a more thorough report on the security implications of climate change, finding that it will \"aggravate existing problems — such as poverty, social tensions, environmental degradation, ineffectual leadership, and weak political institutions — that threaten domestic stability in a number of countries.\"\n\nThe biggest security problems could stem from global warming's impacts on water supplies. Studies have found that many of the world's dry regions are getting even drier. Some of those regions — including the Middle East and North Africa — are politically combustible.\n\nExperts point to the ongoing Syrian conflict as an example of how climate change can fuel instability and violence. A brutal drought in the late 2000s — which scientists say was made far more likely by global warming — played a big role in decimating Syria's agricultural sector, Femia said. Crop failures displaced between 1.5 and two million people, he said, many of whom migrated to cities already strained by poverty, failing water infrastructure and an influx of Iraqi refugees.\n\n\"Climate change made conditions worse in the region, and made the likelihood of instability and conflict greater,\" Femia said. \"Those kinds of things are likely to happen more and more in the future as we see increased drying.\"\n\nTHE CURRENT: Sign up for The Desert Sun's energy and water newsletter\n\nMarcus King — an international affairs professor at George Washington University, and former Defense Department official — cautioned that it's hard to draw a straight line between climate change and terrorism. But when global warming contributes to drought, poverty, hunger and forced migration in unstable regions, he said, it \"grows the pool of young men who are susceptible to recruitment by extremist organizations.\"\n\nKing pointed to several places where climate-influenced water scarcity could fan the flames of existing conflicts, including Nigeria, Somalia, Yemen and Egypt, which went through a violent revolution and regime change just five years ago. Egypt could face drought, flooding of farms along the Nile Delta due to sea-level rise, and the polluting of freshwater supplies with salt water — all while the population skyrockets, King said.\n\n\"If you want to look at the various effects of climate change, Egypt could potentially be a worst-case scenario,\" he said.\n\nClimate change also threatens American military infrastructure, reducing the country's readiness for conflict, experts say. Rising seas are encroaching on military bases like Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia — America's largest naval complex — and Camp Thunder Cove, a naval facility on a tiny, low-lying island in the Indian Ocean called Diego Garcia. Training ranges in California could face water shortages and increased wildfire risks as the U.S. Southwest gets drier, King said.\n\nPolicymakers need to take climate change seriously, Femia said. While it's unclear exactly what the future will hold, the outlook definitely isn't good — and the time to start acting is now, he said.\n\n\"We put a lot of effort and political will into stopping the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, which is low likelihood, because the consequences are enormous,\" Femia said. \"With climate change we have a lot more certainty — we know where things are going.\"\n\nSammy Roth writes about energy and the environment for The Desert Sun.

Kay Ivey underwent a scheduled outpatient procedure Friday as she gets set for specialized radiation treatment for cancer, her office said. Ivey announced Thursday that doctors had discovered a malignant spot on her lung. She described the cancer as having been caught early and said it would not interfere with her ability to fulfill her duties as governor. She went to the University of Alabama at Birmingham to have the initial procedure done. The governor’s office has not disclosed the specific type of cancer she was diagnosed as having. The office said the outpatient procedure will enable her to undergo a series of radiation treatments. The 74-year-old Republican said the spot was discovered in a routine exam and later confirmed to be what she called a tiny, isolated malignancy.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: An industry trade group predicts the number of cruise ship passengers in the state will break records in 2020 for the fifth consecutive year. CoastAlaska reports the outlook comes from Cruise Lines International Association Alaska. The projections were announced last week at the annual meeting of Southeast Conference, taking place in Sitka. According to the association’s data, at least 1.44 million cruise ship passengers are expected in Alaska next year. That’s a 6% increase. Cruise ship traffic increased by about 200,000 passengers between 2018 and 2019. Next year, 10 new ships are expected, along with 29 additional port calls. The biggest jump is expected for Hoonah through the Icy Strait Point tourism complex owned by Huna Totem Corp., the village Native corporation for Hoonah.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A home architect Frank Lloyd Wright designed during the last year of his life is going on the auction block. Heritage Auctions announced the Norman Lykes House in Phoenix will be up for bid next month. The home has been on and off the market over the past few years and was last listed at about $2.7 million. The auction house says in a news release that there will be no minimum starting bid at the Oct. 16 auction. Wright designed the home, nicknamed the “Circular Sun House,” before his death in April 1959. The 3,095-square-foot property in the city’s Biltmore neighborhood has three bedrooms and three baths and is on the edge of a mountain preserve. The buyer would also get all the original mid-century modern furnishings.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state Board of Education has voted to return some local control to the city’s schools nearly five years after the state took over the district. The panel on Friday approved a “proposed framework” for the future of the nearly 23,000-student district if it fails to meet the requirements for leaving state control in January. The board voted in January 2015 to take over the district, dismissing the school board and putting the superintendent under state supervision. The proposal calls for the election of a nine-member school board in November 2020, but with some limits on the board’s authority. The board also tabled until October a proposal to no longer recognize the district’s teachers’ union, a plan that drew opposition from educators and parents.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLong Beach: The city has named its new main library after tennis star and women’s rights activist Billie Jean King, who was born and raised in the city. King was at the ceremony Saturday to officially open the Billie Jean King Main Library, a 92,000-square-foot, $42 million building that is part of the redevelopment of the Long Beach Civic Center, the Press Telegram reports. King said: “Today, I’ve come full circle in my return to Long Beach. Without the people of Long Beach, I never, ever would have had the opportunity to launch my tennis career, and travel the world, and have a platform to hopefully make a difference in the lives of others.” King, 75, holds 12 Grand Slam singles titles and is considered the leading driving force behind women’s professional tennis.\n\nColorado\n\nAurora: Protesters marched several miles over the weekend from Denver to an immigrant detention center where dozens of counterdemonstrators were waiting. Police shut down streets and were out in force Saturday as the demonstrators walked from Denver’s City Park to the privately run detention center in Aurora. Protesters and counterprotesters were separated by barricades manned by police in riot gear. The center run by GEO Group has been the scene of multiple protests by people opposed to the Trump administration’s immigration policies and enforcement actions. The Aurora Sentinel reports 100 people participated in Saturday’s march. Other reports said there were dozens of counterprotesters. KUSA-TV reports a protest Thursday near the home of the facility’s director resulted in three arrests.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNewington: Democrats and Republicans alike expressed interest Friday in low-cost federal loan programs to help fix the state’s transportation infrastructure, following months of debate over electronic tolls. It’s a concept Gov. Ned Lamont has been considering as he reboots his stalled transportation improvement plan that had relied heavily on highway tolling and didn’t get enough support in the General Assembly earlier this year. “I think it’s a big step in regards to something that we may be able to get consensus on and something that’s fiscally feasible for the state of Connecticut and something that’s affordable,” said House Minority Leader Themis Klarides, R-Derby, following a closed-door briefing at Connecticut’s Department of Transportation headquarters from the federal Build America Bureau about the available loan programs.\n\nDelaware\n\nGreenville: The state’s first continuing care retirement community will nearly double in size with a $70 million expansion. Country House is breaking ground Monday on 20 cottage homes, 55 apartments and a clubhouse. The construction adds to the more than 150 existing apartments and four cottages at the community near the Delaware Museum of Natural History. The cottages are about 2,100 square feet and feature an open floor plan, covered patio, full kitchen and two-car garage, says Chelsea Clifton, County House’s life engagement director. They’re often taken by couples. After the cottages are built, construction will begin on the luxury apartments and clubhouse. The two-bedroom apartments range from 1,400 to 2,200 square feet. Amenities include an open floor plan and a fireplace.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The newly upgraded elevator at the Washington Monument stopped working just days after reopening to the public following a three-year renovation project. The National Park Service says there was a “brief interruption in service” for about an hour Saturday. Spokesman Mike Litterst said Parks Service staffers resolved the issue, and visitors who were at the top of the 555-foot stone obelisk were able to return to the ground floor using the elevator. First lady Melania Trump cut the ribbon Thursday morning as the monument opened to the public for first time since September 2016. It had been closed to replace the elevator and upgrade security systems. Litterst apologized to visitors for the inconvenience. He said tours were running on schedule later Saturday afternoon.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: The state’s two U.S. senators want Canadian snowbirds to stay a little longer. Sens. Marco Rubio and Rick Scott last week introduced legislation that would allow Canadian visitors to spend eight months a year in the United States, two months longer than is currently allowed. The senators said in a statement that Canadians contribute $6.5 billion each year to Florida’s economy. The legislation would allow Canadian citizens over the age of 50 who either own or rent a residence in the U.S. to remain in the country for up to 240 days each year. It would prohibit the Canadians from working or going on public assistance while in the U.S. Visit Florida, the state’s tourism promotion agency, says 3.5 million Canadians visited Florida last year.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSouth Fulton: The city is beginning the process of changing its name for the second time since its creation in 2017. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports the first elected leaders of South Fulton decided this month to form a committee to come up with name options that could end up on a November 2020 ballot. South Fulton, 20 miles southwest of Atlanta, incorporated in 2017 amid concerns that Atlanta would annex industrial parts of southern Fulton County. The city began its first name change process shortly afterward to avoid being confused with the part of the county that many area residents also refer to as “South Fulton.” The City Council tried to adopt the name “Renaissance,” but Mayor Bill Edwards vetoed it in 2017, citing resident opposition.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: University of Hawaii economists say the state’s economy will likely slow to a near-standstill. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports the University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization is forecasting economic growth will be less than 1% in each of the next three years. Economists say Honolulu’s recent crackdown on illegal vacation rentals will likely hurt. A report by the research organization says weakened consumer spending after two straight years of population declines and concerns about U.S. and global economies will further weigh on growth. The research organization is forecasting a 1.2% statewide decline in visitor arrivals next year and a 0.1% drop in 2021. One strong area is the construction industry. The organization expects “modest” growth in construction over the next several years.\n\nIdaho\n\nShoshone: The state Transportation Department is auctioning one of the state-line “Welcome to Idaho” signs that was recently retired. The 4-foot-by-8-foot sign is covered in stickers, many left by people who pulled off the highway at the Idaho-Nevada border to take a break and snap pictures. The department decided to replace the sign after the sticker buildup became too great. The highest bid was $510 at 3:45 p.m. Thursday, but that quickly jumped to $1,580. The online auction runs through Thursday. The department has placed an alternative sign for people to leave stickers – a large cutout of Idaho next to the new “Welcome to Idaho” sign. So far, it’s working. Within two weeks of being installed, the sticker sign was almost full. The welcome sign was empty.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Pedestrian and motorist safety around trains and railroad tracks will be the focus of this week’s Illinois Rail Safety Week. The Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police announced that the fifth statewide rail safety initiative is being held Sunday through Saturday after Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed a proclamation. In 2018, 86 rail-crossing collisions involving motor vehicles resulted in 26 injuries and 15 deaths. There were 40 incidents that resulted in 18 injuries and 22 fatalities after victims trespassed on railroad property. The chiefs of police and its partners Metra railroad, CN Railroad and Illinois Operation Lifesaver, along with numerous supporting agencies, first responders and railroad companies, will provide educational as well as enforcement activities during the week.\n\nIndiana\n\nValparaiso: The juvenile court for Porter County is partnering with a laboratory to offer genetic testing for young offenders to help see what psychiatric medications might be helpful for them. The (Northwest Indiana) Times reports the county’s juvenile court will collaborate with Valparaiso-based Great Lakes Labs to offer self-styled pharmacogenetic tests to juveniles in the criminal justice system. Those tests examine patients’ genetic codes to determine which medications have a greater chance of being ineffective or causing harmful side effects. Porter County intends to use the screening to address the high rate of mental health disorders among its youth offenders. Officials estimate 70% to 80% of juveniles who enter the court system struggle with mental illness. Porter County juvenile services officials say the testing could be a “game-changer.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state Supreme Court says it’s hired a law firm to conduct an independent investigation into the arrests of two cybersecurity workers who were found inside a closed courthouse and say they were just doing their jobs. The state’s high court said in a statement Friday that it had hired Faegre Baker Daniels, one of the largest law firms in the Midwest. The men were working for Colorado-based cybersecurity company Coalfire when they were arrested inside the Dallas County Courthouse early Sept. 11. The state court administration has said it hired Coalfire to test security of electronic access to court records, not “forced entry into a building.” But the contract between Coalfire and the state seems to outline plans for the company to try to break into two courthouses, as well as the Judicial Branch Building that houses the Iowa Supreme Court.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state is reporting that unemployment dropped to 3.2% in August and was at its lowest rate in more than 20 years. The Department of Labor said Friday that the state gained private-sector jobs during the month and over the past year. Labor economist Emilie Doerksen said the state has seen broad economic growth, and Gov. Laura Kelly hailed the report as good news for Kansas. The department said the unemployment rate declined from 3.3% in July. It was also 3.3% in August 2018. It was the lowest unemployment rate since May 1999. The rate has been below 4% since January 2017. Kansas had nearly 1.18 million private, nonfarm jobs in August, up about 4,200 since July and 17,800 from August 2018. The over-the-year growth was 1.5%.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: NASA has recognized three Bluegrass State companies for supplying critical elements and tools for the rocket boosters of the Space Launch System rocket. A statement from NASA says the companies were given a Space Launch System Program Manager’s Commendation award to recognize excellence in delivering quality products critical to manufacturing the boosters on time. American Synthetic Rubber Co., Eckart and Parker Hannifin were presented the award last week by retired NASA astronaut Col. William “Bill” McArthur on behalf of the agency. NASA and lead contractor Northrop Grumman personnel toured each of the facilities to meet the men and women helping to build parts for the boosters that will be used for the Artemis lunar missions.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: For weeks in August, state and federal biologists worked to rescue endangered fish that had been swept out of the Mississippi River during a flood fight that lasted months. They waded, leaned out of boats and worked neck-deep in water to net pallid sturgeon. The endangered sturgeon and flat-billed, open-mouthed cousins called paddlefish were among untold numbers of fish carried through the Bonnet Carre Spillway while it was open to protect New Orleans levees from high water. Now crews were working to return those they could find to the river. The Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries worked together on the project. The fish they tagged and released included 17 pallid sturgeon, 208 shovelnose sturgeon and about 10 paddlefish.\n\nMaine\n\nCaribou: In the final official days of summer, some leaves were already beginning to turn in far northern Maine. The Maine Office of Tourism says the far north was showing less than 30% color change and less than 10% leaf drop, leaving a long way to go before fall is in full swing. The office says the north usually reaches peak conditions during the last week of September and the first week of October. The rest of Maine will likely start seeing color among the leaves in the middle of October. The office says the coastal part of the state usually peaks in mid- to late October. The office’s fall foliage report says the leaf-peeping season is set to arrive “right on track” this year.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers has asked the Supreme Court to review the case of a local man convicted in a case chronicled on the podcast “Serial.” News outlets report the group filed an amicus brief in the case of Adnan Syed. The brief says Syed was not given a proper opportunity to investigate an unbiased and credible alibi witness. It also says the decision by Maryland’s highest court to deny Syed a new trial and reinstate his conviction in the murder of his ex-girlfriend will affect criminal defendants “far beyond Maryland’s borders.” Syed’s lawyer during the trial, Cristina Gutierrez, failed to contact a woman who said she saw Syed at a library at the time prosecutors say he strangled his ex-girlfriend in 1999.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Area residents can hear one minute of music performed solo just for them as part of a pop-up concert series. The 10 days of free, one-on-one performances called Concert for One began Friday in custom-fitted shipping containers placed on Harvard University’s Science Center Plaza in Cambridge and in Chin Park on Boston’s Rose Kennedy Greenway. The concerts are the brainchild of violist Rayna Yun Chou, who staged similar performances in her native Taiwan in 2016 as a way to make classical music more accessible. She’s one of nearly 60 musicians playing from noon to 6 p.m. daily through Sunday, including pianists, violinists, cellists, clarinetists, a percussionist and at least one solo vocalist. The performances are organized by local performing arts organization Celebrity Series of Boston.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A diver and maritime history buff has found two schooners that collided and sank into the cold depths of northern Lake Michigan more than 140 years ago. Bernie Hellstrom, of Boyne City, Michigan, says he was looking for shipwrecks about 10 years ago when a depth sounder on his boat noted a large obstruction about 200 feet down on the lake bottom near Beaver Island. Hellstrom says he returned to the area in June with a custom-made camera system and discovered the Peshtigo and St. Andrews about 10 feet apart. The ships collided in 1878, but it initially was believed they sank in the Straits of Mackinac in Lake Huron. Madison, Wisconsin-based marine historian Brendon Baillod says he examined old news accounts and other records that placed the wreck near Beaver Island.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: University of Minnesota President Joan Gabel has criticized the hiring of a legislator for a temporary job at the school’s Institute on the Environment. Democratic Rep. Jamie Long, of Minneapolis, resigned from a clean energy research position this month amid questions over whether it was created specifically for him. Long disputed that and denied any wrongdoing. But Gabel said Friday in a letter to the Republican chairman of the Senate Higher Education Committee, Paul Anderson, of Plymouth, that Long’s hiring “put at risk a core value” of university. She says the institute must “avoid even the appearance of partisanship or a conflict of interest.” She says the institute will now hold its hiring practices to a higher standard. Anderson says he appreciates that the university is taking the issue seriously.\n\nMississippi\n\nPascagoula: Improvements are being made to a park on the Mississippi Gulf Coast after an estate left money for the project. WLOX-TV reports that a group called Pascagoula Pride is leading the effort to beautify the city’s Beach Park. The first phase of work includes adding obelisk towers, each with a fence and garden. A new walkway and new signs have already been added. The second phase will include resurfacing and new pavilion roofs, brick work on poles and improvements to restrooms. The work is funded by the estate of Barbara Renfroe. She left a donation to Pascagoula Pride when she died, requesting that some of it go toward Beach Park.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Police are urging people not to leave grenades “just lying around” after the discovery of one led officers to temporarily block off surrounding streets. Police say the modified grenade was found last week in a pile of belongings that appeared to belong to a homeless person. Also in the pile was food, clothing and drug paraphernalia. The grenade then was removed to a secure, off-site location so bomb and arson squad members could investigate further. Police said Friday that it appeared the grenade was live. Surveillance cameras were checked, but police were unable to track down the grenade’s owner or make any arrests. Police said in a tweet: “It should go without saying, but please don’t leave grenades – even inactive ones – just lying around.”\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A woman who is suing the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol after an agent questioned her and a friend for speaking Spanish in a convenience store said Friday that the backlash to their lawsuit has forced them to move away from their small Montana city. Ana Suda and her family have been harassed by neighbors, strangers and even schoolchildren in the city of Havre ever since a video of a Border Patrol agent questioning her and Martha “Mimi” Hernandez was uploaded to YouTube, Suda says. One version of the video has been viewed more than 123,000 times since February. Suda and her two children have been living with relatives in El Paso, Texas, for the past month and a half while her husband – a Customs and Border Patrol employee himself – is seeking a job transfer to join them. “I can’t take it anymore,” Suda says.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The annual Sensory Safari at Lincoln Children’s Zoo will give students with disabilities a chance to explore through sight, sound, touch or smell. The Oct. 2 event is organized by the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, along with the Lincoln Children’s Zoo and the Nebraska Center for the Education of Children who are Blind or Visually Impaired. Stations will include a live fish touch tank; live native reptiles and amphibians; prairie plants; skulls and pelts of Nebraska mammals; birds of Nebraska; live insects and arthropods; smells of nature and many others. The event costs $3.50 per person. Preregistration is required at lincolnzoo.org. Contact Aimee Johns at ajohns@lincolnzoo.org or at 402-475-6741, Ext. 130, for more information.\n\nNevada\n\nHiko: Festivals are over and Earthlings are heading home from the Nevada desert, where people from around the globe took selfies – but didn’t actually “storm” – a remote U.S. military base long the focus of UFO and space alien lore. They left in peace. Authorities reported no overnight incidents at Area 51 base gates and no arrests or disturbances after an “Alienstock” festival ended at the Little A’Le’Inn in Rachel. Emergency services chief Eric Holt says there was one drug-related medical call before dawn. Estimates are the “Alienstock” gathering peaked at about 3,000 people Friday, drawn by an internet invitation to “see them aliens.” Officials say more than 1,000 people made a dusty pilgrimage to the military base gates since Thursday. Six were arrested on misdemeanor charges.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDover: Dover High School is now home to the largest rooftop solar array in the state. New Hampshire Public Radio reports that the array can generate nearly a megawatt of power, enough to meet 40% of the school’s electricity needs. Any excess is sold back to the grid to help lower the school’s energy bill. That process is called net metering, and it is capped at one megawatt for large arrays. Lawmakers this week upheld Republican Gov. Chris Sununu’s veto of a bill that would have raised the cap. Dan Weeks works for ReVision Energy, the company that built Dover High School’s array. He says the limit makes it hard for such projects to be economical.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nStone Harbor: The state has fought hard to build protective sand dunes but may take the unusual step of trimming some large dunes and using the sand to widen the beach in front of them. A decision on the proposal could be made within two weeks. It would appear to fly in the face of strenuous and costly efforts to ensure dunes are in place along most of the state’s coastline. But authorities are considering “harvesting” sand from some dunes in Stone Harbor. That is because some dunes there are considerably larger than minimum standards. And one federal agency says another can’t legally use a traditional sand pumping site. The sand would be used to widen the beach in some areas.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: State education officials want to encourage more high school students to apply for federal financial aid to help pay for college. The initiative was announced Thursday, a day after Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham proposed a scholarship program to bridge the gap between federal aid and state lottery-funded scholarships so more people can afford college. If more students are awarded federal aid, that would lessen what the state would have to pick up through the proposed scholarship program. Officials want to increase the annual statewide rate for federal financial aid applications to 80%. Currently, about 65% of high school students apply. Public Education Secretary Ryan Stewart says by increasing the application rate, New Mexico would be “seeding the soil that will produce thousands more doctors, computer scientists, authors, architects, nurses, artists and teachers across our state.”\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: State officials are hailing the completion of a new $30 million supportive housing complex in the Bronx. The facility, in the Bedford Park neighborhood, includes 82 apartments for low-income families at risk of homelessness as well as adults with disabilities. Known as Webster Green, the facility will connect residents to services including job training and health care intended to help them avoid becoming homeless. Disabled adult residents will be able to access supportive services to help them live independently. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, announced the end of construction Thursday. He said Webster Green is part of a broader $20 billion, five-year effort to increase affordable housing throughout the Bronx, New York City and the entire state.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper has vetoed the annual legislation pitched by Republicans as reducing and streamlining state regulations. The Democratic governor wrote Friday that a couple of provisions in the 25-page Regulatory Reform Act of 2019 threaten public health and safety. Gubernatorial vetoes apply to an entire bill’s content. Cooper cites one item that would alter the state fire code so that doorstep garbage and recycling containers can sit in certain apartment complex hallways temporarily. The governor says that could pose safety risks for residents and emergency responders. The governor also says a provision on septic system permits could hurt public health and threaten clean water. The legislature will get the chance to override the veto. None of Cooper’s eight previous vetoes this year has yet been overridden.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Electric vehicle advocates say the lack of charging infrastructure causes the state to miss out on potential tourism and economic development dollars. The Bismarck Tribune reports electric vehicle owners struggle to plan trips through North Dakota due to “range anxiety,” a term that describes a driver’s concern that his or her car will run out of power before it reaches its destination. North Dakota has at least two dozen chargers, but they all are the slower kind that require hours for a full charge. The state Transportation Department says 187 electric vehicles are registered in North Dakota, up from 141 last year.\n\nOhio\n\nDayton: Wright State Applied Research Corp. says it will be the lead agency in a $49 million effort to strengthen the relationship between the Air Force and businesses and universities. The group says in a release that it’s been selected to lead the U.S. Air Force Academic Partnership and Engagement Experiment. The corporation says the program is meant to “improve connections between the Air Force, academia, and industry across the United States.” Dennis Andersh, the corporation’s president and chief executive, tells the Dayton Daily News the project will be “connecting people together who don’t normally get connected.” Officials say the five-year project will focus on “enhancing academic engagement nationwide” to support the Air Force Small Business program, national defense strategy and the Air Force’s 2030 strategy.\n\nOklahoma\n\nQuapaw: Over 30 bison roaming Grand Canyon National Park’s northern reaches are joining a herd in the Sooner State. Hundreds of the massive animals have made their home at the Grand Canyon in recent years. But park officials say they’re spoiling water sources and harming the landscape. Officials came up with a plan two years ago to reduce the herd partly by corralling the animals and shipping them elsewhere. Thirty-one bison loaded in multiple livestock trailers were shipped to the Quapaw Tribe in Oklahoma on Wednesday. Several other bison were fitted with tracking devices and released back into the park. The bison are descendants of ones introduced to northern Arizona in the early 1990s as part of a crossbreeding experiment.\n\nOregon\n\nRoseburg: Nike was dogged and fast while chasing down a suspected car thief. Named after the Greek goddess of victory and the namesake of the Oregon-based athletic shoe manufacturer, Nike the police dog had his moment Friday after Abigail Wallace was seen driving a stolen car, according to Roseburg Police Sgt. Jeff Eichenbusch. Police stopped the vehicle using a tire-puncturing device. Eichenbusch said Saturday that Wallace and a passenger fled on foot. K9 Nike chased Wallace down an embankment and across a creek. Wallace apparently started to give up, so Nike was called back to his handler. Wallace began running again. This happened twice more. The third time, Eichenbusch said, Nike made a biting capture. Wallace received superficial scrapes and was jailed.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: The city is cleaning up after a massive water main break turned streets into river rapids, required the rescue of people and pets, and closed schools. Pittsburgh Public Schools announced the closure of at least 10 schools Friday because of limited access to water in buildings. Schools in Mount Lebanon and Brentwood Borough were also closed. Pittsburgh police say a 24-inch main broke in the morning, and three people were rescued from two homes. Wendy Gitzen was among the rescued. She says the rushing waters moved her car and a shed about 30 feet away from the house. Police say the break was closed about 11:30 a.m., after about six hours.\n\nRhode Island\n\nCranston: The state Republican Party is changing its primary election process in an effort to boost President Donald Trump’s re-election bid. The Providence Journal reports the state GOP voted Thursday to switch to a “winner-take-all” approach in its local primary. Any candidate claiming more than 50% of the state’s presidential primary vote will now earn all 19 of Rhode Island’s delegates to the 2020 Republican National Convention. Delegates and alternates were previously distributed proportionally among candidates receiving more than 20% of the vote. The newspaper reports Providence Republican City Committee Co-Chair Dave Talan and Republican National Committee member Steve Frias were among the party leaders opposing the move during Thursday’s debate at Shriner’s hall in Cranston.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley is moving back to her native state, re-establishing a home base and also fueling speculation that a return to politics is next on her to-do list. The 47-year-old former governor, who left office in 2017 to join the Trump administration, closed Friday on a home on Kiawah Island, according to Alex Malloy, a spokeswoman for Kiawah Island Real Estate, which operates on the tony golf community near Charleston. Haley’s office confirmed the purchase, saying the family would be splitting time between South Carolina and New York until their son graduates from high school next spring. “South Carolina has always been home for the Haleys, and they couldn’t be more excited to return back to their family and friends in the Palmetto State,” said Haley spokeswoman Chaney Denton.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Supporters of legalizing marijuana in the state have been thwarted at nearly every turn, including an effort to become the 48th state to approve industrial hemp. But backers are doubling down on this year’s election. Volunteers are gathering signatures for two initiated ballot measures. One asks voters to approve medical marijuana, and the other seeks to legalize recreational marijuana. Supporters tried the same approach to get on the 2018 ballot and failed to garner enough signatures. Melissa Mentele, head of New Approach South Dakota, a volunteer group sponsoring the medical measure, says attitudes have changed about benefits for patients. She says organizers this time around have financial support from Marijuana Policy Project, one of two national nonprofits working on the measure.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Four years after the state passed a law requiring a 48-hour waiting period for women seeking abortions, abortion clinics are getting a chance to argue against it in court. Beginning Monday in federal court in Nashville, attorneys for five of the state’s seven abortion clinics will try to prove that the law harms the women it is supposed to help. They must establish that the law, which requires women to make two separate trips to the abortion clinic, imposes an undue burden on Tennessee women. It’s a subjective standard that has caused some waiting period laws to be struck down and others upheld, depending on the specific circumstances of the state. Twenty-seven states require a waiting period between counseling and an abortion, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights. Tennessee is one of 14 states where pre-abortion counseling must take place in person.\n\nTexas\n\nSan Antonio: The top administrator in Bexar County says the jail there is facing a “crisis situation” after guards wrongly released two inmates just hours apart, bringing to at least 12 the number of prisoners mistakenly released this year. County Judge Nelson Wolff on Friday called on Sheriff Javier Salazar to take steps that include replacing the commander who oversees the jail, one of the largest in Texas. Wolff spoke at a news conference a day after two inmates were mistakenly released. One was being held on suspicion of driving while intoxicated, and the other was in jail on a drug charge. Both were later apprehended and returned to the jail. Salazar called the conduct of the guards “totally inexcusable.” Authorities say booking errors, confusion over similar names and other factors have contributed to the erroneous releases.\n\nUtah\n\nPanguitch: A tour bus crashed on a highway running through the red-rock landscape of southern Utah on Friday, killing four people from China and injuring dozens more. The bus rolled onto a guard rail, crushing its roof and ramming the rail’s vertical posts into the cab, Utah Highway Patrol Sgt. Nick Street said. Three women and one man, all from Shanghai, perished in the crash. Five passengers remained in critical condition Friday night, and the death toll could rise, Street said. All 31 people on board were hurt. Twelve to 15 were considered in critical condition shortly after the crash, but several had since improved, Street said. Not everyone was wearing a seatbelt, as is common in tour buses, he said. The crash happened near a highway rest stop a few miles from southern Utah’s Bryce Canyon National Park, an otherworldly landscape of narrow red-rock spires.\n\nVermont\n\nProctor: The owners of a building that once played a key role in the state’s marble industry think the future for the structure could be hemp. Paul Carroccio, of TPW Real Estate Sales and Rentals, tells the Rutland Herald the owners are talking with half a dozen hemp-related businesses about setting up shop in the Vermont Marble Co. building in Proctor. He says he expects to have a tenant by winter. Carroccio’s business bought the 30,500-square-foot building at auction in March. There are no plans to turn the facility into a hemp processing center. Rather, there are other hemp-related operations that might be able to use the building, which was used as a laboratory by a former owner. The growth and processing of industrial hemp is an expanding market for Vermont farmers.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A tavern visited by George Washington and French troops during the Revolutionary War is one of eight new listings placed on the Virginia Landmarks Register. The listings approved Thursday by the Virginia Board of Historic Resources also include a rural village in northern Virginia settled by African Americans before and after the Civil War and a military academy in Southside Virginia established in 1909. The tavern known as the New Kent Ordinary has portions dating back to 1736. Washington visited New Kent Ordinary before and during the Revolutionary War. The tavern continued to operate until the 1930s and underwent a historical restoration in the 1960s. The Department of Historic Resources will forward documentation for the sites to the National Park Service for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nWashington\n\nEverett: Abandoned vessels are polluting the state’s waterways and costing taxpayers. KING-TV reports an abandoned, sinking fishing vessel called Midas in Snohomish County has been in the water for four years, and officials are pulling it out. The Department of Natural Resources says boats are being abandoned faster than they can be removed with resources available. In the Snohomish River near Everett, crews are removing the Midas piece by piece. Around the bend, there’s another half-sunk sailboat on a mudflat. Every day a vessel sits in the river, more contaminants seep into the water system. On Thursday crews removed wood and metal from the river, as oil from the ship was contained as much as possible. Since 2002, Washington’s derelict vessels program has removed more than 850 boats from waterways across the state, with taxpayers footing the bill.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice has issued a ban on most outdoor burning due to drought conditions and reduced water supply levels in some communities. The ban is effective immediately and will remain in effect until conditions improve and Justice rescinds the order. His office said the ban prohibits outdoor burning, including fires built for camping, burning of debris or warming. The news release said the ban is necessary “to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires due to drought.” Some fires are excluded, including those needed for chemical production; commercial land-clearing efforts with necessary permit; training fires with permit under supervision of qualified instructors; commercial outdoor cooking; and liquid-fueled gas fire stoves, grills and lanterns. Division of Forestry Director Barry Cook said there have been 60 fires in September.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The public is getting its first glimpse of a new red panda cub at the Milwaukee County Zoo. Kiki made her first public appearance Friday. She was born in June to father Dash and mother Dr. Erin Curry, who was named after a Cincinnati Zoo reproductive physiologist. The pair had their first cub in June 2018, the first ever born at the zoo. That panda, named Dr. Lily Parkinson, went to the Nashville zoo in April. In the wild, red pandas are found in the mountains of Nepal, northern Myanmar and central China. They are considered to be endangered due to deforestation, poaching and trapping. Researchers estimate there are fewer than 2,500 adult red pandas in the wild. Milwaukee County Zoo supervisor Katie Kuhn says every birth is important so that people can connect with and take steps to help the animals.\n\nWyoming\n\nPinedale: State officials have voted to advance legislation that would enact a corporate income tax. The Casper Star-Tribune reports the Joint Committee on Revenue voted in favor of the bill, leaving its creator to work out incomplete details before the January 2020 budget session. Officials say Republican Rep. Jerry Obermueller submitted a revised version of the bill last week after lawmakers defeated the tax during the last general legislative session. Officials say the bill would impose a 7% corporate income tax on corporations with more than 100 shareholders and diversify revenue streams by taxing big corporations without punishing privately owned businesses and residents. Opponents of the bill say it is potentially unconstitutional, as it could give national chains that are not publicly traded an unfair advantage.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/08/20/red-panda-triplets-paul-simon-miracle-house-news-around-states/39985535/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nHuntsville: The slenderclaw crayfish is barely surviving in northern Alabama. The tiny animal is now known to survive in just two creeks near Sand Mountain, where it burrows under rocks in shallow, slow-moving waters, Al.com reports. The animal lost most of its original habitat when the Tennessee River was dammed to create Lake Guntersville in 1939. And the population is still dwindling. Biologists who study the slenderclaw crayfish are not entirely certain why the population is still declining. More uncertainty surrounds whether the animal will get formal protections from the federal government. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed to list the crayfish as a threatened species, but the change may not be as protective as in the past, due to recently announced changes by the Trump administration.\n\nAlaska\n\nKenai: The Kenai River Foundation hosted its 13th annual Wounded Warriors fishing trip this month, bringing 68 active-duty soldiers stationed in the state down to the Kenai Peninsula to fish for salmon on the river. The trip is free for the soldiers and is made possible thanks to donations from sponsors including the Central Peninsula Hospital, Alaska Communications, Fairweather, LLC, Price Gregory International and Siemens Building Technologies. Professional fishing guides volunteered their services for the two days, and riders from several chapters of the American Legion provided a military escort for the buses that brought the soldiers primarily stationed at the Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson to and from Anchorage.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: State lawmakers could make cities pay for raising the minimum wage. A new law that takes effect Aug. 27 requires the state to calculate the cost to Arizona’s government when cities and counties raise the minimum wage above the statewide rate. If the state has to pay more for services in those communities because of a higher minimum wage, legislators could force local governments to cover the additional costs. Proponents of the measure argue it is only fair after Flagstaff voters elected in 2016 to raise the minimum wage above the state’s rate, in turn requiring government contractors to increase pay for some low-wage workers. But others view it as an effort by the Republican-controlled Legislature to curtail the power of local governments.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: Officials say two more medical marijuana dispensaries are expected to open in the state’s northwest this year. Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration spokesman Scott Hardin says both dispensaries will be in Fayetteville. They’ll join the region’s first dispensary, The ReLeaf Center, which opened earlier this month in Bentonville, and another called The Source, which opened last week in Bentonville. The two Bentonville dispensaries are the seventh and eighth to open in the state since voters legalized the use of medical marijuana in 2016. The state has licensed 32 dispensaries to sell medical marijuana. The Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports that the state had issued more than 19,000 patient or caregiver cards as of Friday.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSanta Barbara: Scientists have installed an underwater sound system they hope will reduce collisions between whales and ships in the Santa Barbara Channel off Southern California. A listening station on the channel floor is able to capture whale calls as far away as 30 miles, the Los Angeles Times reports. That device is connected by cable to a buoy floating above that transmits data by satellite to scientists on shore. From there, captains can be alerted to slow their ships down or reroute. It’s the latest attempt to prevent ships from running into whales in the channel, where cargo vessels in and out of the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach cross feeding grounds of endangered blue, fin and humpback whales.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: The Environmental Protection Agency has announced the North Front Range region missed its air quality standards deadline. The EPA is expected to mark the nine-county region that includes Denver County in serious noncompliance with a federal standard. Experts say this region has high concentrations of ground-level ozone and smog that could lead to respiratory health issues and heart disease. Officials say the Air Quality Control Commission passed a zero-emission vehicle standard Friday in the region to reduce the effects. Experts say air quality improved on average over the past decade despite the announcement, and the region has plans to adopt more regulations for emission-producing industries.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWilton: The town has halted guardrail improvements following complaints about the look of new, steel barriers on some residential streets. Wood and wire guardrails traditionally have lined the roads in Wilton, a Fairfield County town on the line with New York state. First Selectwoman Lynne Vanderslice imposed a moratorium on upgrades this month after residents raised issues with the aesthetics of the steel replacements. The town had been installing steel guardrails in sections, such as along bends and near culverts, on two roads where the old guardrails were showing their age. Public works officials say the moratorium will provide an opportunity to conduct engineering studies and assess alternative guardrail styles and whether guardrails are even needed on those roads.\n\nDelaware\n\nDewey Beach: Busted boats and outdated laptops are among 2,000-plus items that will be going to auction next month as town officials try to wipe away the scars from participating in a military surplus program. The goal for now, Mayor T.J. Redefer says, is to get the number of items as close to zero as possible to help to rebuild the community’s trust in the government. The stockpile is cited in a federal lawsuit regarding public access to a report on the program, which had found there was little town oversight and questionable accounting. The surplus items were requested by Dewey Beach police working with the Law Enforcement Support Office program, which helps local agencies reuse Department of Defense equipment. The only cost is shipping and transportation of the items, but sometimes the available items look better online than in person, Redefer says.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Confidential documents show the former chairman of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority sought to limit an ethics investigation and prevent its findings from being made public. The Washington Post reports Jack Evans’ actions are detailed in investigative documents obtained from WMATA’s ethics committee. Records show Evans threatened the jobs of a board lawyer and secretary while trying to hide the findings of an ethics probe, which found he failed to disclose a profitable conflict-of-interest. Evans’ lawyer, Mark Tuohey, says Evans never intended that anyone be fired. Clarence C. Crawford, who chaired the ethics committee, made the findings public at the request of state and local officials. Evans resigned his transit job days later but remains a city councilman.\n\nFlorida\n\nDavie: The state’s iconic palm trees are under attack from a fatal disease that turns them to dried crisps in months, with no chance for recovery once they become ill. Spread by a rice-sized, plant-hopping insect, lethal bronzing has gone from a small infestation on the Gulf Coast to a nearly statewide problem in just over a decade. Tens of thousands of palm trees have died from the bacterial disease, and the pace of its spread is increasing, adding to environmental woes of a state already struggling to save its other arboreal icon, citrus trees, from two other diseases. Florida’s official state tree – the tall, broad-leafed sabal palm – is especially susceptible, and Florida nurseries, businesses and homeowners are taking a financial hit as they scrap infected palms. Some preventive measures can be taken, but once infected, uprooting the tree is the only practical solution.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Experts say the state is among those most at risk of its residents not being counted accurately in the 2020 census. The Urban Institute says children under the age of 5 are especially at risk of being undercounted due to Georgia’s changing demographics. WABE Radio reports that nationwide, 4.5 million children live in areas that are difficult to count for the 2020 census. Statewide, 22% of Georgia’s population lives in areas considered hard to count. The radio station reports there are several reasons why so many Georgia children are difficult to count: They are often in young families, immigrant families and multigenerational homes.\n\nHawaii\n\nAuwahi: Musician Paul Simon has joined environmentalists attempting to reinvigorate a woodland by planting a tree during a ceremony on Maui. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported Friday that the celebrated singer-songwriter joined Auwahi Forest Restoration Project volunteers seeking to revive the area’s plant life. Simon helped plant a lama tree and participated in chants with the group following a helicopter tour. The part-time Maui resident performed two environmental benefit concerts at the Maui Arts & Cultural Center earlier in the week that drew more than 8,000 attendees. Simon plans to donate his proceeds to the Auwahi project and Hawaii environmental group Kuaaina Ulu Auamo. Simon was put in contact with the environmentalists after visiting Hoolawa Farms in Haiku to view a rare kanaloa plant, one of only two in existence.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Federal officials have approved two open-pit phosphate mines that include environmental protections intended to prevent the type of pollution caused by past phosphate mining in the area. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management says it approved the Caldwell Canyon Mine project in Caribou County, about 13 miles northeast of Soda Springs. Bayer subsidiary P4 Production will develop the mines on three phosphate leases. Bayer acquired agricultural giant Monsanto, which previously mined the area, for $63 billion last year. The area contains one the nation’s most abundant deposits of phosphate ore that’s turned into fertilizer needed by farmers to grow food. Idaho-based Simplot also has a mine in the area. But the area also contains Superfund sites because of pollution from past phosphate mining.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum has received more than $400,000 in grants for a project that aims to publish every document written by the nation’s 16th president. The Springfield-based library says the Papers of Abraham Lincoln project was awarded up to $350,000 from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The National Historical Publications and Records Commission awarded the project $87,125. Alan Lowe, executive director of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, says the grants show that experts in the field are confident the project “is on the right path to fulfill its important mission.” The project launched online in 2018. It gives people access to documents from private collections and archives held around the world.\n\nIndiana\n\nBloomington: The new home of Indiana University’s art school will be modeled after an unbuilt fraternity house a famed modernist architect designed in the 1950s. IU’s trustees recently approved construction of the $10 million Mies van der Rohe Building. When completed in 2021, it will bring the Eskenazi School of Art, Architecture and Design’s programs together within one building. The Herald-Times reports the 10,000-square-foot structure will be made of limestone, steel and glass, with second-floor windows spanning floor to ceiling. Ludwig Mies van der Rohe was a German-born architect known for his “less is more” approach emphasizing open space and industrial materials. He designed a fraternity house for Phi Lambda Phi in the early 1950s, but it went unbuilt. The new building will be similar to his design, with modern upgrades.\n\nIowa\n\nFort Dodge: Robert Wolf has about 250 boxes of rock samples sitting in his garage waiting for a crew from the University of Iowa to come pick them up with a 20-foot truck. The collection took the better part of 30 years to find. Each rock sample has a number and is recorded in a log book that tells what it is, where it was collected and when he found it, The Messenger reports. And the collection is all Iowan. “There’s a sample of every formation in Iowa,” he says. “There are 350 rock units in and around Iowa. I have all the families and 95% of the members. That’s what makes this collection unique. It’s a good representation of the state of Iowa.” What makes his collection valuable and of interest to a university is that it’s properly cataloged. Without the information Wolf recorded, it’s just a big pile of rocks.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: State education officials are expressing concern after a recent survey found more than 1,000 motorists illegally passed stopped school buses in one day. The Topeka Capital-Journal reports a task force is expected to make recommendations during the next legislative session on how to reduce the number of violations. In the April survey, 220 districts in Kansas that use 3,300 school buses reported 1,040 violations by motorists. That compares with April of 2018, when 214 districts operating 3,347 buses documented 1,030 infractions. Jim Porter, the southeast Kansas representative on the Kansas Board of Education, noted the sample included only three-fourths of the state’s districts.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Tourism officials say more people visited the state in 2018 and spent more money. Officials say visitor trips to and within the state topped 71.6 million last year, and visitor spending rose to nearly $7.6 billion, up nearly 4% over the prior year and a 21% increase since 2013. The figures are the result of a study from Tourism Economics, the state Department of Tourism’s new research partner. Using the Tourism Economics model, officials say the industry’s economic impact in Kentucky went from $10.9 billion in 2017 to $11.2 billion in 2018, generating more than 94,500 jobs and $787 million in state and local taxes. The tourism department says it continues to build on Kentucky’s signature tourism industries of horses, bourbon, music, arts, outdoors and culinary to reach new audiences.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Three days of public events will honor former Gov. Kathleen Blanco, the state’s first female governor, who died after a years­long struggle with cancer. The Democrat who led Louisiana during hurricanes Katrina and Rita will be memorialized Thursday at an interfaith service in downtown Baton Rouge at St. Joseph’s Cathedral. Her casket then will be taken to the Louisiana Capitol, where Blanco’s body will lie in Memorial Hall for public visitation. On Friday, mourners in Louisiana’s Acadiana region can attend a prayer service for the former governor in Lafayette at St. John the Evangelist Cathedral. Blanco’s funeral Mass will be Saturday in Lafayette, followed by a private burial service. Blanco died Sunday. She was 76.\n\nMaine\n\nOrono: Nature lovers who encounter fluttering butterflies might also be able to contribute to research about the colorful insects. Researchers at the University of Maine say residents can use a mobile app called the Monarch Model Validator to provide details about areas where butterflies are likely to be found. They plan to use the data as part of a model designed to predict the location of monarch butterfly nesting sites. The UMaine researchers say monarch butterflies begin a 3,000-mile migration south every fall. They also say the number of monarchs that complete the migration has fallen by 90% in the past two decades. App users will be able to answer a short survey and provide photos. They’ll be able to head to predetermined sites or find locations of their own.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Lawyers for a man whose murder conviction was chronicled in the hit podcast “Serial” are asking the Supreme Court to step into the case. Lawyers for defendant Adnan Syed said in court papers Monday that the justices should order a new trial for Syed and reverse a Maryland court ruling against him. Syed claims his trial lawyer violated his constitutional right to competent representation because she failed to investigate an alibi witness. Syed is serving a life sentence after he was convicted in 2000 of strangling 17-year-old Hae Min Lee and burying her body in a Baltimore park. Syed and Lee were high school classmates who had dated. In its debut 2014 season, the “Serial” podcast shined a spotlight on the case that led to renewed court proceedings.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The memorial to the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing is complete. Three stone pillars representing the three people who died at the finish line were installed Monday, marking the final step of the $2 million project, which took four years to plan and develop and underwent significant redesigns and other delays. Bolivian-born sculptor Pablo Eduardo said it was important that the final work reflect the hopes and expectations of families who lost loved ones. The monument includes four bronze and glass spires installed last month to illuminate the site. Cherry trees to bloom each April have also been planted, and two bronze bricks have been set in the sidewalk to honor the police officers killed in the bombing’s aftermath. The pillars installed Monday were gathered from places around Boston significant to the bombing victims.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A copy of the original land contract for Motown Records’ Hitsville U.S.A. will be unveiled as part of the music company’s 60th anniversary celebration. Officials with the Motown Museum, located where Berry Gordy Jr. launched his music empire, say they will share the rarely seen document via Facebook at 3 p.m. Tuesday. That coincides with the 1959 date that Gordy purchased the house on West Grand Boulevard. Museum CEO and Chairwoman Robin Terry called it “the start of a journey that would ultimately rock the world.” The event is part of a series of “archive dives” this year to coincide with milestone dates. The Supremes, the Miracles, Martha and the Vandellas, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder and many others recorded hits there before Motown moved in 1972 to California.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: Almost 90 musical acts will descend on the city this week for the Common Roots Festival, performing myriad styles on 12 different stages. The festival, now in its third year, was originally conceived as a way to breathe life back into downtown venues, restaurants and businesses during a major street construction project in 2017. Although that project has been completed, the volunteer team behind the festival has continued the mission to bring folks to downtown St. Cloud. “Downtown is now under a deluge of construction again, and we are hearing from business folks in that area that it is affecting business. So we’re right back where we started three years ago,” says festival coordinator Dawn Yilek. It all kicks off Wednesday at 5 p.m. at Beaver Island Brewing Company.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A group that advocates limited government is suing the state over its licensing requirement for people who earn money by plucking eyebrows with thread. Mississippi Justice Institute filed the lawsuit Monday on behalf of Dipa Bhattarai, a University of Mississippi graduate student. She grew up in Nepal, where she learned the technique of using a single strand of cotton thread to remove hair. Mississippi requires people who receive money for eyebrow threading to earn an esthetician’s license. The license requires training and exams, but none of the training deals with threading. The Mississippi Board of Cosmetology shut down Bhattarai’s business, and she wants to reopen it. She says she started earning money by threading eyebrows while she was a student at Mississippi University for Women in Columbus. “It’s going to sound cliche, but I just started my business with $240,” Bhattarai says.\n\nMissouri\n\nSedalia: Authorities are looking for an inmate who escaped from a crew that was helping to clean up after the Missouri State Fair came to an end for the year. Department of Corrections spokesman Karen Pojmann says 34-year-old Shannon Dewayne Watts, of Springfield, was reported missing about 12:45 a.m. Monday when he didn’t return to a van to head back to the Tipton Correctional Center. He was serving a 15-year sentence there for charges that included burglary, resisting arrest and tampering with a motor vehicle. The search was expanded beyond the nearly 400-acre fairgrounds in Sedalia several hours later when law enforcement couldn’t find Watts. He is described as 6 feet tall and 195 pounds. The 11-day fair began Aug. 8 and ended Sunday night.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: A University of Montana art historian has called for a new state flag after receiving a top research award. The Missoulian reports Hipolito Rafael Chacon announced the idea Thursday to redesign the state’s identity with a new flag. Officials say his research received an award last month from the International Congress of Vexillology, a worldwide association of flag researchers. Officials say the design originated from just the seal because Montana troops needed a banner to carry in the Spanish-American War. Officials say the Legislature added the name of the state in 1981. Chacon says a public design competition could be the best way to select a new design. Experts say former historians tried to change the design decades ago, but state officials laughed at the idea.\n\nNebraska\n\nWinslow: Residents of this tiny community who are reeling from flooding this year are considering whether to move their entire town uphill. The Omaha World-Herald reports that the swollen Elkhorn River flowed in mid-March over a levee built to protect Winslow, damaging almost all 38 homes and 10 other buildings in the Dodge County town. Town leaders have proposed moving Winslow out of the flood plain to a new site, possibly a hilltop about 2 miles away. Town officials say that if residents stay, they’ll be at the mercy of the river. Zachary Klein, a village trustee and the volunteer fire chief, says the move could take two years. Klein says funding is available from federal, state and local sources.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Health officials in the city are using the word “outbreak” to describe a sharp spike in hepatitis A cases reported mostly among homeless people and drug users. The Southern Nevada Health District reports that in seven months from November to June, it counted 83 cases of the virus that causes liver damage and can lead to death. That’s far more than the 58 cases reported in 2016, 2017 and 2018 combined. The district says more than 80% of reported patients were people without a permanent place to live, and 92% use drugs, some intravenous. The district has begun posting weekly outbreak updates on its website. Hepatitis A is most often transmitted through consumption of water or food contaminated with feces.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDurham: A University of New Hampshire researcher says oyster production in the state is only a small fraction of what it could be. Ray Grizzle, research professor of biological sciences, says the total number of farms is probably nearing the maximum for the Little Bay area, but production isn’t yet. USDA data in the 2017 Census of Agriculture says the state has 32 commercial mollusk operations in Strafford and Rockingham counties representing $419,000 in sales. Most of them are oyster farming. New Hampshire only had two licensed oyster farms when Grizzle began conducting research about 10 years ago. Grizzle, who’s with the university’s New Hampshire Agricultural Experiment Station, says some farms have included improved farming methods and marketing networks that involve wholesalers as well as directly selling to local chefs.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: The mayor says it could take another month before additional testing is completed on lead levels in the city’s water supply. That means residents in affected neighborhoods will have to continue receiving bottled water. Mayor Ras Baraka’s comments on a radio show Sunday were first reported by Politico. Newark began distributing bottled water a week ago after lead levels tested high in a few homes even though residents have been given water filters. About 14,000 homes are affected. In addition, a federal judge is expected to rule this week on an environmental group’s effort to force Newark to distribute water to thousands more residents who are served by a different water system. The Natural Resources Defense Council says those residents also are at risk from excessive lead levels.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLos Alamos: Officials at Los Alamos National Laboratory say they have plans for $13 billion worth of construction projects over the next decade at the northern New Mexico complex. They outlined their plans at a recent meeting attended by hundreds of representatives of construction firms from around the country. Most of the projects are related to the lab’s assignment to ramp up production of key nuclear weapon components known as plutonium cores. Other work would be aimed at serving a growing workforce, such as housing projects, parking garages and a potential new highway that would reduce commute times from Albuquerque and Santa Fe. Lab Director Thomas Mason tells the Albuquerque Journal the lab currently has 1,400 openings and plans to add another 1,200 jobs to its workforce of 12,000 by 2026.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: State officials are asking the public to help choose a new license plate design. Gov. Andrew Cuomo says people can vote on the governor’s website for one of five plate designs. Four of the designs include the Statue of Liberty, while one features the Mario M. Cuomo Bridge over the Hudson River. Voting runs through Sept. 2. The design with the most votes will become available in April. The new ones will replace the state’s blue-and-white plates, most of which are more than 10 years old. As vehicle owners renew their registrations, owners with license plates 10 years old or older will be issued new plates for a $25 fee. Once the new plates become available, the Department of Motor Vehicles also will stop issuing the newer blue-and-gold plates.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper’s administration is proposing a plan to reduce greenhouse gases. The News & Observer of Raleigh reports that the plan calls for cutting greenhouse gases from electricity production by 60% to 70% of 2005 levels by 2030, with a goal of getting to zero emissions by 2050. The state Department of Environmental Quality says North Carolina already has made progress toward cutting emissions, which are 34% lower than 2005 levels. Some of the plan’s suggestions include requiring the retirement of coal power plants and requiring utilities to increase use of renewable energy. It also suggests setting carbon dioxide budgets or carbon caps, or a combination of those approaches. The proposal stems from an executive order Cooper signed last year.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nWilliston: A landfill north of the city could soon become the first facility in the state to accept higher levels of radioactive oil-field waste under new state regulations. The Bismarck Tribune reports Secure Energy Services is seeking permits allowing it to dispose of radioactive material at its 13-Mile Landfill, which already accepts other types of waste generated by oil development. The Health Department increased the allowable concentrations of technologically enhanced radioactive material to be disposed of at approved landfills from 5 picocuries per gram to 50 picocuries per gram in 2016. Picocuries are a measure of radioactivity. The change was controversial at the time, drawing lengthy hearings and a lawsuit from environmental groups.\n\nOhio\n\nCanton: Eighty years after Rhoda Wise first claimed she was a receiver of Christian miracles, people are still visiting her home to see for themselves. Busloads of the faithful and curious come to Wise’s home in Canton to see the room where it is believed she was cured of a terminal illness and regularly was visited by Jesus Christ. The small wood-frame house is an unlikely Roman Catholic shrine nestled in a frayed neighborhood next to a nine-hole golf course. But every year it attracts visitors from all over the world. Visitor numbers are getting a boost this summer thanks to the local Roman Catholic diocese formally petitioning the Vatican to have Wise declared a saint. Wise died in 1948 at age 60.\n\nOklahoma\n\nCushing: Officials have closed a recreational lake while they monitor a dam breach in the area. City Manager Terry Brannon said Sunday that a breach has been detected in a concrete structure beneath the dam at Cushing Lake near this city about 55 miles northeast of Oklahoma City. Officials say the breach is allowing water to pass unrestricted, but the flow remains controlled, meaning there hasn’t been a complete dam failure. Owned by the city of Cushing, Cushing Lake is about 9 miles west of Cushing, an oil hub with 300 storage tanks. Officials say the area affected by the breach includes fields and livestock but no structures. Authorities say police are notifying property owners and others with livestock downstream of the dam.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde have finalized their purchase of the former Blue Heron paper mill site at Willamette Falls. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports the site that was once home to the Charcowah village of the Clowewalla now belongs to the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde. The 23-acre property is located within the tribes’ ancestral homelands and holds significant historical and cultural importance for the Grand Ronde. Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde chairwoman Cheryle A. Kennedy says they have reclaimed a piece of their homeland and are resurrecting their role as caretakers to Willamette Falls. The area is part of the lands ceded to the United States government under the Willamette Valley Treaty of 1855. Following the treaty, tribal members were forcibly removed from Willamette Falls and relocated to Grand Ronde.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nSpringettsbury: It’s been three years since the last archaeological dig on farmland in this township to find remains from a Revolutionary War prison camp. A new dig started this month on a 4-acre area, and archaeologists and volunteers hope to uncover evidence that would help reveal the exact location of Camp Security. A few 18th-century items, such as wrought iron nails and Westerwald stoneware, have turned up, but “nothing yet that screams site,” says John Crawmer, lead archaeologist for the Friends of Camp Security. During the Revolutionary War, colonists held British prisoners of war from the Battle of Saratoga and the Siege of Yorktown at Camp Security from 1781 to 1783. It’s believed to be the last known Revolutionary War prison camp to remain undisturbed in the country. The public can visit the site Aug. 27 to learn more about the archaeological work.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Advocates for gun control demanded reforms at a gathering over the weekend. The Rhode Island chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America staged a rally Saturday to honor victims of the latest U.S. mass shootings and call for tougher gun legislation. Several dozen people attended the event. Some of the signs they held said “Disarm Hate,” “Enough” and “No One Needs a Weapon of War at Home.” Organizers say they’re pressing for a strong federal “red flag” bill to allow seizure of weapons in certain cases and legislation requiring background checks on all gun sales. Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America describes itself as a grassroots movement fighting for public safety measures that can protect people from gun violence.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: A major building at the College of Charleston is set for a $50 million overhaul. The Post and Courier reports the state’s Joint Bond Review Committee agreed last month to borrow $45 million to renovate the university’s main arts building, the Albert Simons Center. Another $5 million will come from a one-time state appropriation. Architects are still designing the building’s new exterior. A previous renovation planned in the mid-1990s stalled amid exterior design disputes. School of the Arts Dean Valerie Morris says the renovation will create a black box theater for student productions, plus upgraded classrooms, bathrooms, and heating and cooling. Mold problems are promised to be fixed. Work could begin in summer 2020, with the art school temporarily relocating. The overhaul could be complete by fall 2022.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The U.S. Department of Agriculture says farmers in the state were unable to plant more than 3.8 million acres this year, the highest number in the nation. KSFY-TV reports the tally includes 2.8 million unplanted corn acres and nearly 851,000 acres for soybeans. The USDA says the total number of unplanted acres nationwide was more than 19 million acres, the highest since the agency began reporting those figures in 2007. Many states across the Midwest were hit hard by flooding this spring, leading to fields being too wet for farmers to plant.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The University of Memphis has launched a new initiative in hopes of raising graduation rates among its black male students, the school announced Monday. The African American Male Academy will start with a group of black male students in middle school and pair them with peer and faculty mentors, provide textbooks and other educational supplies, and give them access to early academic and career preparation. “Most students are in good academic standing when they leave the U of M before graduation – they leave for financial reasons,” university officials wrote in a statement announcing the program, adding that 60% of its students work more than 20 hours a week and have to help provide for their families. Students inducted into the academy will also be informed of scholarship programs and other “culturally responsive” initiatives meant to keep them in school and make their educations more affordable.\n\nTexas\n\nKemah: The Galveston Bay Foundation has seen the first structure go up on 30 acres of bayfront land it acquired in 2016. The Galveston County Daily News reports a pavilion designed and built by students from the University of Texas School of Architecture’s Gulf Coast DesignLab will be used to host as many as 75 students at a time in grades five to 12 from across the upper Texas coast region, helping them learn on-site about Galveston Bay’s wildlife, organisms, natural habitat and environmental threats. In June, DesignLab, an advanced studio design class, reached out to the foundation, offering its services. This motnh the architecture students went to Kemah and built the pavilion over a period of weeks. They put the finishing touches on it last week. A dedication is planned for Saturday.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A report says more women in the state are earning STEM-related degrees, but completion rates are still behind the national average. The Deseret News reports the Utah Women & Leadership Project released a study this month showing an additional 467 women graduated with science, technology, engineering and math degrees from 2012 to 2017. Officials say the 1% increase could be higher, but gender stereotypes have been attributed to women switching disciplines more frequently than men. Officials say girls who are introduced to women in STEM careers have increased their chances of engaging in a STEM curriculum by more than 60%. Officials say of the 44% of women in the workforce in Utah, there are a “particularly low” number of women who continue on to work in STEM industries.\n\nVermont\n\nWoodbury: The state Fish & Wildlife Department is seeking volunteers to become “Let’s Go Fishing” instructors who can pass on the fishing tradition to the next generation of Vermonters. The department will be hosting a one-day training workshop for new instructors Sept. 14 at the Buck Lake Conservation Camp in Woodbury. Instructors in the “Let’s Go Fishing” program organize and instruct clinics in their communities for young people and their families. The training workshop will give volunteers the basics of how to teach a basic fishing clinic. They will also learn about fishing ethics, aquatic ecology, fisheries management, habitat conservation and tackle craft. There is no charge, but pre-registration is required. Information can be found on the department’s website.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: The Virginia Zoo has announced the birth of red panda triplets. The zoo in Norfolk announced Monday that the triplets were born two months ago and are thriving in a climate-controlled den that’s out of sight from the public. Zoo veterinarian Collen Clabbers says red panda triplets are a “unique situation” for the endangered species from Asia. But she says the mother is “doing a great job.” The two males and one female were born to mother Masu and dad Timur. The cubs will live in the red panda exhibit after zoo staff members feel the little ones can navigate the exhibit’s trees and other features. The zoo is auctioning naming rights in support of red panda conservation. Bids can be placed online.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: The last four members of a wolf pack that preyed on cattle in a rural area of the state bordering Canada have been killed by state hunters, prompting protests from environmental groups. The four wolves were part of a pack that originally had seven members and attacked cows, killing or wounding them 29 times since 2018 and nine times over the past month, the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife said in a statement Friday. Agency director Kelly Susewind authorized the killings of the remaining pack members July 31. Environmental groups opposed the killings, which they contended benefited one ranching operation in Ferry County in the remote Kettle River Range. Hunters for the state Department of Fish and Wildlife who were inside helicopters tracked down and shot the wolves from the air Friday, agency spokeswoman Sam Montgomery says.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Mountain Valley Pipeline has suspended some construction activities that could affect threatened or endangered species. WVPR-FM reports pipeline officials sent a letter last week telling federal regulators about the voluntary suspension in areas where construction could affect protected bat and fish species. The move follows a lawsuit filed by the Sierra Club and other environmental groups last week that challenged approvals by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Conservation groups are asking the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to toss two key permits issued to the 303-mile natural gas pipeline in Virginia and West Virginia. The 4th Circuit last month threw out the same Fish and Wildlife approvals for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. Regulators say the pipeline may not resume the suspended construction without first seeking approval.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Two Native American tribes in the state are receiving federal grants for renewable energy projects that tribe members say will help reduce costs and lead to energy independence. The Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa in Odanah received a nearly $1 million grant, and the Forest County Potawatomi Community in Crandon got a grant for more than $1.5 million. Wisconsin Public Radio reports the grants will be used to install solar panels at tribal buildings. The move is expected to save the tribes millions of dollars in energy spending over the next 25 years. The Wisconsin tribes are among 12 nationwide that received a total of 14 grants from the federal Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs worth a total of $16 million.\n\nWyoming\n\nPowell: Wildlife officials say fewer grizzly bears have been euthanized this year in Yellowstone National Park compared to previous years. The Powell Tribune reports the U.S. Geological Survey says nine grizzlies were euthanized in Wyoming this year, but the number could increase before the bears go into hibernation in December. Officials say the Wyoming Game and Fish Department killed a record-high 32 grizzly bears in 2018, including 17 by mid-August last year. Officials say grizzly bears are euthanized to manage conflicts at the park that spans across Wyoming, Montana and Idaho. Wildlife officials say three bears have also died in automobile collisions. Officials say they encourage people in the region to carry some type of defense in case of an encounter.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/05/27/elk-wildfire-rescue-escaped-bison-captured-diseased-raccoons-news-around-states/50289405/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuscaloosa:The city’s annual Memorial Day program, which is free and open to the public, will be held at 9 a.m. Monday at Veterans Memorial Park in front of University Mall. Forrest Fitts, chairman of the Alabama Marines Foundation, will be the guest speaker. John Merkle, director of the Tuscaloosa VA Medical Center, and David Blair, director of the University of Alabama Office of Veteran and Military Affairs, are also scheduled to speak. Audrey Watts and Clara Parker of the Alabama Choir School will sing the national anthem and student cadets from Paul W. Bryant High School Junior ROTC will present the colors. At the end of the ceremony, participants will place a wreath at the Military Order of the Purple Heart Monument.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: An aircraft crashed while attempting to land on a rural Alaska airstrip lined by trees, injuring all four people on board. Three people seriously injured in Tuesday’s crash at Dry Bay airstrip were sent to hospitals in Anchorage. A fourth person with minor injuries was treated in the nearby southeast Alaska community of Yakutat, the Coast Guard said in a statement. The names of those injured weren’t immediately released.\n\nArizona\n\nCasa Grande: Two women were arrested after about 500,000 fentanyl pills were found in an SUV pulled over for speeding on Interstate 10 in Arizona, police said. The pills were found concealed in collagen supplement bottles on Monday during a search that also turned up a handgun and a large amount of cash, police said. Martha Lopez, 31, and Tania Luna Solis, 30, were arrested on suspicion of crimes including possession of a narcotic drug for sale, according to police. Court records didn’t list attorneys who could comment on behalf of the women, who are from Phoenix. Two children in the vehicle were turned over to state child protection officials, police said.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: University of Arkansas-Fort Smith Chancellor Terisa Riley named Shadow JQ Robinson as the next provost and vice chancellor of academic affairs, effective July 1. Robinson, raised in rural Kentucky in the heart of the Appalachian Mountains, said the Ozarks feel like home. And because of the work of those who came before him, he said, the campus and its position in the higher-education landscape feel inviting and inspiring. Robinson currently serves as the Dean of the College of Engineering and Natural at the University of Tennessee-Martin, where he provides academic, administrative and financial leadership to more than 100 faculty and staff, with an annual budget of more than $6 million.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: A gun and a loaded magazine were found in a second-grade student’s desk after other students alerted the staff that a classmate had brought the weapon, officials said. The incident happened Tuesday at Edward Kemble Elementary, the Sacramento City Unified School District said in a statement to families. School staff called police “who secured the weapon and opened an investigation,” the statement said.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins:City Council members are coalescing around a potential ballot measure to increase their pay and benefits. Many details remain to be determined, including the magnitude of the proposed pay increase, when it would take effect and how compensation would be adjusted over time. But at a council work session on Tuesday, most council members expressed initial support for a November ballot measure, saying higher pay for council members could make council candidacy more feasible for a more diverse slate of community members. Council members currently make about $893 a month, or $10,712 annually. The mayor earns $1,340 a month, or $16,074 annually. Their pay is adjusted each year based on the consumer price index and has increased by about 80% since 1998. Council members don’t qualify for the health insurance provided to city employees.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNorwich: The city is interested in maintaining the docks at Howard T. Brown Memorial Park, but it will cost a little more to do so. The city is expected to make another 20% contribution to repairing the docks at the park as a part of the city’s American Rescue Plan Act funds, scheduled to be approved June 6. Although the original repairs focused on compliance with the federal Americans with Disabilities Act and replacing an unsafe platform, additional money will focus on repairing the pilings that have been deteriorating, after being underwater for almost 30 years.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:Lt. Gov. Bethany Hall-Long said she supports the legalization of marijuana, showing a major chasm with Gov. John Carney, who on Tuesday vetoed a bill to legalize possession of up to one ounce of marijuana by adults for recreational use. Hall-Long did not comment on the governor’s veto or if a recreational marijuana industry should be created in Delaware. Many in Delaware have speculated that Hall-Long could run for governor in 2024. Carney is in his second term as governor and cannot run for re-election.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:After a mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, organizers of the March for Our Lives are planning to march in D.C. on June 11 to demand gun control legislation and universal background checks from lawmakers, WUSA-TV reported. The original march took place on March 26, 2018, in response to the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The Florida House of Representatives gave final passage to sweeping property insurance legislation that creates a $2 billion reinsurance fund and rewrites rules on coverage denials and attorney fees, as lawmakers attempt to stabilize rising rates and insurer losses. The legislative package now awaits the signature of Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Gov. Brian Kemp is suspending Georgia’s motor fuel tax for six more weeks. Kemp signed an executive order Thursday extending the tax break through July 14. Kemp used the announcement to again blame Democratic President Joe Biden for high gas prices. Kemp signed a law in March that passed with broad bipartisan support suspending the state’s gas tax through May 31. But with pump prices climbing again, Kemp signaled in recent days that he would extend the relief. Under state law, Kemp can suspend taxes by executive order as long as state lawmakers ratify the action the next time they meet. Kemp abated gas taxes in 2021 during a pipeline shutdown, and former Gov. Nathan Deal suspended gas taxes multiple times. Georgia’s gasoline price normally includes a federal tax of 18.4 cents per gallon and a state tax of 29.1 cents per gallon. A number of cities and counties also charge taxes. Federal taxes on diesel fuel are 24.4 cents per gallon, and Georgia’s tax on diesel is 32.6 cents per gallon.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Catherine Payne, the head of the Hawaii Board of Education, said it’s time to consider developing a public school policy on preparing for active shooter scenarios. Payne spoke after a gunman killed 19 fourth-graders and their two teachers at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas on Tuesday. Payne’s time as board chairperson ends next month. She said she expects the new chairperson, to be named by Gov. David Ige, to direct the state Department of Education to assess and report on school preparations and safeguards regarding shootings.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A Washington man is dead after a boating accident on the Middle Fork of the Salmon River in Custer County. Robert Gray, 63, of Mill Creek, Washington, was floating on the river Tuesday afternoon “when his raft struck a log jam, throwing him into the water,” according to a news release from the sheriff’s office. The accident took place about 2:30 p.m. MDT near the Boundary Creek boat launch, northwest of Stanley. About noon Wednesday, Custer County Search and Rescue located a body matching Gray’s description by helicopter, submerged in a log jam downstream from Boundary Creek, the release said. Gray’s body was still in the river, as rescuers have determined the river is too dangerous for retrieval, the release said.\n\nIllinois\n\nWauconda: A bison that escaped a suburban Chicago farm in September and had been living in the wild since was recaptured Wednesday, officials said. The 1,300-pound bison some had come to know as Tyson ran off while being delivered to the Milk and Honey Farmstead in Wauconda, and officials said they believe she settled in Lakewood Forest Preserve in early April. Forest preserve officials brought in Loose Cattle Caught to help with her capture, and she was found early Wednesday and tranquilized enough to slow her, officials said. The bison is healthy and under observation. Loose Cattle Caught is working to contact her owner.\n\nIndiana\n\nPorter: A federal appeals court has declined to disturb an Indiana Supreme Court ruling, later codified into Indiana law, which declared that Lake Michigan’s shoreline is – and always has been – owned by the state for the public’s use. In Wednesday’s 3-0 decision, the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago said the three lakefront property owners in the town of Porter who claim their holdings include a private beach lack standing to challenge Indiana’s high court ruling and statute in federal court.\n\nIowa\n\nJohnston: A central Iowa business is being sued in federal court for allegedly claiming that its Chinese-made products, which collect data on crucial infrastructure that’s buried underground, are produced in the United States. Digital Control Inc., or DCI, which is based in the state of Washington, is suing Underground Magnetics of Johnston in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa. The Johnston company is accused of trademark and patent infringement, unfair competition and false advertising. DCI claims the central Iowa company holds itself out as a manufacturer when it is “a sales arm of a Chinese company manufacturing its products in China.”\n\nKansas\n\nLarned:A lawsuit filed Thursday alleges long wait times at Larned State Hospital are unconstitutional and are inflicting mental and physical harm on those who are incarcerated. The complaint, brought in federal district court by the ACLU of Kansas, National Police Accountability Project and a Kansas City, Mo., law firm, said individuals are frequently waiting nearly a year in jail for an evaluation to determine if they are competent to stand trial. And patients determined unfit to stand trial also will have prolonged waits if they must be sent back to Larned for care so they might become competent to be tried. While individuals are sitting in jail, their criminal proceedings are paused. They are unable to access psychiatric treatment and are often placed in solitary confinement, something ACLU legal director Sharon Brett said is “cruel and unusual punishment.”\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: An apartment complex in eastern Jefferson County has discriminated against potential tenants based on their race and source of income, according to a report from the Louisville Metro Human Relations Commission. Terraces at Forest Springs, managed by St. Louis-based Michelson Realty Company, twice discouraged Black renters with federal housing vouchers from applying to the complex, located near Anchorage, while encouraging white tenants with vouchers to apply, according to a complaint that was validated by human relations employees. Michelson Realty has denied it discriminated against tenants. It will soon face a hearing before a representative from the Kentucky Office of the Attorney General.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Spanking a student in Louisiana schools would be forbidden unless school officials have written permission from the child’s parent, under legislation approved Wednesday by the state House. The bill by Rep. Stephanie Hilferty, a Metairie Republican, had started out as a ban on corporal punishment in schools. As amended on the House floor, the bill would prohibit the spanking of a child in an elementary or secondary school unless the child’s parent or guardian has signed a consent form permitting corporal punishment. The bill passed 70-28 and goes next to the Senate, where it will need to get through a committee hearing and a floor vote before the current session’s adjournment deadline on June 6.\n\nMaine\n\nHollis: Some nature advocates are worried that Maine residents are killing the wrong caterpillar as they seek to wipe out an invasive species that causes a rash with its toxic hairs. The browntail moth caterpillar is an invasive pest that can cause a rash and respiratory distress in humans. They’re expected to be especially bad this year because of weather conditions. Destroying the caterpillars’ nests is one way to mitigate their spread. However, some residents are destroying the nests of Eastern tent caterpillars, which are a different species, the Bangor Daily News reported. Tent caterpillars serve as important forage food for Maine birds, Maine Audubon said. Unlike browntail moths, they’re native to North America. As for browntail moths, it’s too late to destroy their nests because they’re no longer occupied at this time of the year, said Jim Dill, pest management specialist with University of Maine Cooperative Extension.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury:A raccoon has tested positive for canine distemper, and several others are showing symptoms near the bayside campgrounds at Assateague Island National Seashore. The highly contagious virus doesn’t affect humans, but dogs and other small mammals, such as foxes, skunks and river otters, can become infected. It’s transmitted through saliva, urine, feces and respiratory secretions, according to Cornell University Wildlife Health Labs. Symptoms begin 10 to 14 days after infection and include discharge from the eyes and nose, difficulty breathing, fever, coughing and pneumonia. Park officials recommend campers ensure their dogs have a current distemper vaccine and be kept on a 6-foot leash at all times.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nCambridge: The flood of disinformation that is spread and amplified on social media represents a threat to fragile democracies, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said during the keynote speech at Harvard University’s commencement, exhorting graduates to do their part of fight it.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: A federal appeals court dismissed a Catholic school’s challenge to Michigan’s 2020-21 mask order. The Whitmer administration policy during the COVID-19 pandemic was dropped about a year ago, making the lawsuit moot, the court said. The appeal was heard by 17 judges at the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. It was a rare step; most appeals are heard by three-judge panels. Resurrection School in Lansing and some parents sued in 2020, saying a state mask order violated the free exercise of religion, among other objections. A federal judge, however, ruled in favor of the state and declined to suspend the policy with an injunction. The statewide mask order ended in June 2021. Any subsequent school mask mandates came from local health departments.\n\nMinnesota\n\nAitkin: A space heater might have been involved in a fire that killed a couple and their young grandson in Aitkin County, sheriff’s officials said. The fire broke out in a trailer home early Sunday in Wealthwood Township north of Lake Mille Lacs. Authorities said sheriff’s deputies and firefighters arrived, and once the flames were extinguished, they located the three bodies in the charred debris. Officials identified the victims as 69-year-old Jeff Cleys, 55-year-old Michelle Cleys and 6-year-old Grant Diehl, of Deerwood.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A preliminary snapshot of third graders’ literacy proficiency in Mississippi showed a passing rate nearly the same as before the COVID-19 pandemic, the state education superintendent said Thursday. The statement said 73.9% of 31,068 students passed the test for the 2021-22 school year. That’s compared to 74.5% in 2019, the last normal school year, when 34,998 students took the initial test. State law requires Mississippi third graders to pass a reading assessment to qualify for promotion to the fourth grade.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Police are searching for a driver of a stolen pickup truck they said fatally hit a pedestrian as it fled from officers. The chase began Wednesday afternoon on Kansas City’s east side when officers spotted the stolen pickup and tried to pull it over, police said in a news release. The truck fled, ramming a patrol car in the process. Police said the officers called off the chase as the truck entered the northbound lanes of Interstate 435 traveling southbound. Less than a minute later, police found the body of a man in the road who appeared to have been hit by the fleeing truck. The truck was found a short distance away, and a woman who was a passenger in the truck was arrested. The driver of the truck fled on foot and, despite a search involving helicopters and police dogs, was not found, police said. The name of the pedestrian killed was not immediately released.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings:Conservative minister Jordan “JD” Hall admitted he fabricated a story about a transgender Native American lobbyist allegedly berating a state senator so badly that he sought the protection of the Montana Senate’s sergeant-at-arms. In a libel case that has been ongoing for more than a year the minister admitted that he fabricated the story and apologized to Adrian Jawort, a lobbyist who testified on many issues related to Native Americans. The settlement and a potential $250,000 claim was reached as Hall is going through the bankruptcy process, seeking protection from a libel case, as well as discharging attorney’s fees he racked up during the libel fight. Two weeks ago, Hall was arrested on charges of driving under the influence and illegally carrying a concealed weapon, to which he has pleaded not guilty.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A man was sentenced to 70 years to life in prison Wednesday for the shooting death of a police officer in 2020. Felipe Vazquez, now 19, shot Officer Mario Herrera when he tried to escape from police who were serving an arrest warrant for him at his Lincoln home. Vazquez was wanted in the stabbing death of 36-year-old Edward Varejcka months earlier. Vazquez was sentenced to another 59 to 86 years for attempted assault on a second officer, escape and four gun charges, the Lincoln Star reported. He will not be eligible for parole for about 70 years. Vazquez was convicted in March.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Gambling in Nevada continued a 14-month hot streak in April and a return of international flights boosted travel nearly to levels seen before the coronavirus pandemic began more than two years ago, according to Las Vegas airport and state casino revenue reports. The state Gaming Control Board said the $1.13 billion that casinos statewide reported winning last month represented the best April ever for the state, Clark County and the Las Vegas Strip. Nevada casinos have now reported winning at least $1 billion every month since March 2021.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A man pleaded guilty in federal court to defrauding government programs that were intended to provide assistance related to the COVID-19 pandemic. George Adyns, 51, of Sandown, who was chief financial officer of several companies in Plaistow, directed employees in March 2020 to file for state unemployment benefits while continuing to work, prosecutors said. The state paid more than $49,000 in fraudulently obtained benefits. Adyns also fraudulently obtained loans totaling more than $135,000, prosecutors said. He’s scheduled to be sentenced on Aug. 31 on a wire fraud charge.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: One month into existence, New Jersey’s recreational marijuana market has done $24 million in sales and regulators on Tuesday voted to grant permits to nearly a dozen new recreational cannabis retailers in their first public meeting since the market opened to the public last month. How long before the new dispensaries open, though, isn’t known, and there will be additional regulatory hurdles before the new shops start selling to adults 21 and over.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Firefighters rescued an abandoned newborn elk calf found amid the ashes of the nation’s largest wildfire as calving season approaches its peak in New Mexico and fires rage across the American West. Missoula, Montana-based firefighter Nate Sink said he happened upon the motionless elk calf on the ground of a fire-blackened New Mexico forest as he patrolled and extinguished lingering hot spots. “The whole area is just surrounded in a thick layer of ash and burned trees. I didn’t think it was alive,” said Sink, who was deployed to the state to help contain a wildfire that by Wednesday had spread across 486 square miles and destroyed hundreds of structures. The 32-pound singed bull calf, dubbed “Cinder,” was taken for care to a nearby ranch and is now regaining strength at a wildlife rehabilitation center in Espanola, north of Santa Fe. Veterinarian Kathleen Ramsay at Cottonwood Rehab said she paired Cinder with a full-grown surrogate elk to be raised with as little human contact as possible. Ramsay said the calf hopefully can be released into the wild in December after elk-hunting season. The strategy has worked repeatedly with elk tracked by tags as they rejoined wild herds.\n\nNew York\n\nEast Greenbush: Gov. Kathy Hochul proposed raising the age to 21 for purchasing the type of firearms used in recent mass shootings in Buffalo and Texas, and possibly for other weapons, as well. The Democrat said she wants to work with the state Legislature to raise the legal purchasing age for AR-15-style rifles. Only six states - California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Vermont and Washington - require buyers to be at least 21 instead of 18 to purchase rifles or shotguns, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Those states have the same higher age limit for handguns, while a few other states have no age limits at all for any firearm, the gun-control advocacy group says. New York City already, by local law, prohibits anyone under age 21 from possessing any firearm, with some exceptions for people engaged in military drills or competitions, or while under the supervision of a permitted gun owner.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWilmington: A former dean at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington is returning to the school as its chancellor, officials said. Aswani Volety, serving as provost and vice president for academic affairs at Elon University, was elected unanimously by the UNC Board of Governors during its meeting in Chapel Hill. Volety replaces Jose Sartarelli, who is retiring in June after seven years as UNCW’s chancellor. Volety is the former dean of UNCW’s College of Arts and Sciences and former executive director of UNCW’s Center for Marine Science. He spent five years at UNCW from 2014 to 2019 before serving as the chief academic officer and chief operating officer at Elon University, according to a news release. UNCW, which is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year, has an enrollment of more than 18,000 students.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Developers want to build a $390 million wind farm in south-central North Dakota. The state Public Service Commission has scheduled a hearing in late June for Badger Wind, a project under development by Orsted Onshore North America. The company is proposing a 74-turbine farm west of Wishek. It would have a generating capacity of 250 megawatts, which is comparable to powering 70,000 homes, the Bismarck Tribune reported. Orsted Onshore plans to start construction in September if it receives the necessary permits. The project would be completed late in 2023. Badger was still looking for an entity to purchase the wind farm’s output when it filed its application with the PSC in February.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Republican state lawmakers have fast-tracked a fall ballot measure that would expressly prohibit noncitizens from voting in local elections. The proposed noncitizen voting ban – which emerged just last week and cleared the Ohio House 68-28 on Wednesday – stands to ignite GOP voters ahead of this year’s midterm elections, when Republicans hope dissatisfaction with Democrats in Washington will help them regain control of Congress and win overwhelming Statehouse majorities. The push comes as some places in the country have begun to allow legally documented, voting-age noncitizens to cast ballots. It’s legal in New York City in races for mayor, City Council and other municipal offices; and in San Francisco for school board races – but not for positions such as president, governor or U.S. House members. The Ohio constitutional amendment moves next to the state Senate, where it needs a similar three-fifths majority to advance to the November statewide ballot.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt has signed a bill requiring public school students to use only the bathroom of the sex listed on their birth certificate. About a dozen conservative states have passed laws regarding transgender use of bathrooms, transgender participation in school sports, and gender-affirming treatments or surgery for young people. The bill passed overwhelmingly in the Republican-controlled House and Senate last week, and Stitt signed it on Wednesday.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:Some customers of Pacific Power would see their power bills increase 14% if a plan proposed by the company is approved. In the plan filed with the state, the utility is asking for an $84 million yearly increase in rates for customers in Oregon, a 6.8% increase. But that increase would impact different types of customers in different ways. The average residential bill is $91.89 for customers in single-family homes using 900 kilowatt hours per month. The company’s request would increase that to $104.90 per month. That would be a 14.2% increase. Also, multifamily homes that use an average of 600 kilowatts per month would see their bills increase $6.97 per month, an 11% increase, under the proposal.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nWolf Creek: State police said they have solved the slaying of a Chicago man whose burning body was found 42 years ago near Interstate 80 in a northwestern town. Edwin Rodriguez was identified through the use of DNA testing and genealogy tools, authorities announced Wednesday. Rodriguez was 18 when he and a family friend, Nestor Quintanal, left Chicago for Florida in the fall of 1980, and Rodriguez’s family never heard from him again. His burning body was found Nov. 6, 1980, near Interstate 80 in Wolf Creek. Authorities said Quintanal – who died in Florida in 2002 at the age of 71 – is believed to have killed Rodriguez, who had third-degree burns on 70% of his body. A possible motive for the killing was not disclosed. The Mercer County District Attorney’s office paid for state police to have an advanced DNA analysis performed, and in 2007 the office secured a DNA profile of the victim through evidence collected at the autopsy. In January 2019, the profile was sent to a lab for DNA phenotype testing and a genetic genealogy screening. The testing linked the body to a first cousin of Rodriguez, authorities said. Police reached out to the individual, who was able to confirm the victim was Rodriguez. His remains have since been returned to his family in Chicago.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence:Roman Catholic Bishop Thomas Tobin of the Providence diocese sparked internet fury by suggesting Catholics boycott a classic North Kingstown donut shop over its collection of donations to Planned Parenthood. In response, Allie’s said each month, it allows an employee to select an organization for which to collect donations at checkout. Planned Parenthood was chosen for May. Allie’s said it has raised money for many other organizations, including Ronald McDonald House of New England, the North Kingstown Food Pantry, T.A.P.S., Friends of Exeter Animals, Project Sweet Peas and the J. Arthur Trudeau Center. Reached by The Providence Journal, the diocese said Tobin wouldn’t be saying anything other than his tweet.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: South Carolina jurist Michelle Childs – recently under consideration for a slot on the U.S. Supreme Court – was confirmed on a 17-5 vote by the Senate Judiciary Committee for a spot on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. It now goes to the full Senate for a vote. Childs, 56, has been a federal judge on South Carolina’s District Court for more than a decade. Earlier this year, she was on a shortlist of candidates being considered by President Joe Biden for an upcoming vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court, given the pending retirement of Justice Stephen Breyer.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: Ellsworth Air Force Base has broken ground for the first of three dozen major projects that will support the incoming long-range B-21 bomber. The 95,000-square-foot Low Observable Restoration Facility, or LO, will have “specialized equipment to ensure that the free world’s next generation stealth bomber is sustained and maintained,” said Gen. Anthony Cotton, Air Force Global Strike Commander. 28th Bomb Wing Commander Col. Joseph Sheffield called the event not only a great day for South Dakota, but also for the United States. U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson called the B-21 an important part of this nation’s military history.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A state report said nearly half of Tennessee public high school seniors in the class of 2021 did not attend college or technical school right after graduating. The Tennessee Higher Education Commission report said the college-going rate has dropped from 63.8% for the 2017 class to 52.8% for the 2021 class. Officials pointed to the COVID-19 pandemic while noting a drop of 9 percentage points from the 2019 class to the 2021 class. Nationally, freshman enrollment dropped 9.2% between 2019 and 2021, according to the National Student Clearinghouse Current Term Enrollment Estimates.\n\nTexas\n\nManor: Four people were detained in connection with a threat made against Manor High School, police said Thursday. Officers at about 9:25 a.m. conducted what they called a high-risk stop of a vehicle entering the Manor High School campus, police said. Four people were detained, and police said two of them are suspects in two recent threats against Manor students. Just before midnight Thursday, Manor police had said they were investigating a social media post that showed a hunting rifle with a male voice saying “(expletive) Manor.” The post had Thursday’s date in the caption. Authorities were told the video was sent to several Manor middle school students earlier that day, but officers have not yet confirmed if that is true.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:Another poor spring runoff has exacerbated Utah’s ongoing drought problem, with nearly every part of the state now rating as under “severe” or “extreme” drought, water officials said Thursday. The statewide “snow water equivalent,” or how much water melted off Utah’s mountains and poured into its streams and reservoirs, ended up at about 75% of normal this year, according to a new report from the state Division of Water Resources, leaving 99.86% of the state under those two categories of drought. The dry conditions were likely to lead to another year of limited restrictions and other efforts to curb water use while also drying out vegetation and making the state more susceptible to wildfires. Eighteen of Utah’s largest 45 reservoirs were below 55% of available capacity as of Thursday, with overall statewide storage at 63% of capacity. This time last year, reservoirs were about 67% of capacity. Great Salt Lake was expected to drop to a new historic low.\n\nVermont\n\nEast Burke: Canadian mountain bikers are back again in the Northeast Kingdom after a two-year absence when the border was closed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, said Abby Long, executive director of the Kingdom Trails Association. “In the past about 38% of our trail users were our neighbors to the north,” Long said in an email. “We missed welcoming our Canadian trail users for the past two years.” Kingdom Trails, comprising more than 100 miles of mountain bike trails across the properties of 104 private landowners, has become a national draw for mountain bikers traveling to the Northeast Kingdom and the towns of Burke, Lyndonville, Kirby and East Haven. Long said the trail system creates an estimated $10 million economic impact every year – when there’s not a pandemic.\n\nVirginia\n\nVerona: The Blue Ridge Area Food Bank is participating in the USDA's Summer Food Service Program, sponsoring six locations starting Tuesday, helping to ensure that children across the region have access to nutritious food. One-in-12 children in the Food Bank service area are food insecure, according to the Blue Ridge Area Food Bank. The Summer Food Service Program is designed to reach children who might not get nutritious meals at home over the school’s summer break. Students receiving free or reduced-price meals at school are at particular risk.\n\nWashington\n\nMoxee: Yakima County Hearing Examiner Gary Cuillier approved a conditional-use permit for the Black Rock Solar Energy Project, a photovoltaic solar power facility to be located 20 miles east of Moxee on both sides of State Route 24, the Yakima Herald-Republic reported. The project will feature 264,000 solar panels spread over a 1,060-acre site north of the Rattlesnake Hills and roughly 8 miles south of the Columbia River as it flows into Benton County and past the former Hanford nuclear reactor site.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nSouth Charleston: A Pennsylvania resident caught a record carp while fishing from the bank of Summersville Lake in West Virginia, regulators said. Ayden Minick of Mount Pleasant, Pennsylvania, caught and released the carp on May 7, the Division of Natural Resources said in a news release. It measured by a DNR fisheries biologist at 41.2 inches long, breaking the record of 41 inches caught in 1988 by Charles Cook at Stonecoal Lake. The carp weighed 45 pounds, which was just short of the record of 47 pounds set in 1998 in a Preston County farm pond.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Rising material prices and legal expenses are expected to add nearly $50 million more to the cost of a power transmission line being built across southern Wisconsin. American Transmission Co., ITC Midwest and Dairyland Power Cooperative are building the 345-kilovolt Cardinal-Hickory Creek transmission line that would run more than 100 miles from Dane County to Dubuque County in Iowa. The utilities have notified the Wisconsin Public Service Commission that the overall cost of the project is now expected to top more than $500 million, Wisconsin Public Radio reported. In the filing, the utilities cited considerable increases in the cost of steel, conductors, insulators and other materials.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney said Wednesday she tested positive for the coronavirus and planned to work through minor symptoms she said she was experiencing. The Republican’s diagnosis came amid a nationwide surge in new coronavirus cases and reports of positive tests from Cheney’s congressional colleagues, including North Carolina Democrat David Price, who tested positive last weekend.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/27"}]}
{"question_id": "20240216_1", "search_time": "2024/02/17/00:13", "search_result": [{"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/03/politics/joe-biden-abortion-draft-opinion/index.html", "title": "Biden's political and personal evolution on abortion on display after ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWhen President Joe Biden received a telephone call from his chief of staff late Monday alerting him to a near-unprecedented leak of a draft Supreme Court opinion, he decided not to act right away.\n\nThe court had yet to verify the authenticity of the document. Its disclosure reflected a seismic breach in the body’s traditions. And its contents, if true, were extraordinary: A sweeping rejection of the right to abortion that had been guaranteed to American women for nearly half-a-century.\n\nOvernight, Biden and his aides took time to craft a response to the draft ruling. As Tuesday began, the President huddled in the Oval Office with that chief of staff, Ron Klain, and other senior advisers at the White House and signed off on a three-point written statement warning “basic fairness and the stability of our law” were at stake if the ruling came to pass. An hour later, after a staffer called him in the presidential limousine to say Chief Justice John Roberts confirmed the draft was real, Biden walked to cameras to reiterate his fears.\n\n“If this decision holds, it’s really quite a radical decision,” he said on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews. He recited a litany of “basic rights” he said could now be undercut should the draft ruling be ordered: “Who you marry, whether or not you decide to conceive a child or not, whether or not you can have an abortion” were all now at stake, he warned.\n\nFor Biden, the moment punctuated a personal and political evolution on an issue now poised to become central for his administration and party. In his statements, Biden urged Congress to codify into law the right to abortion established by Roe v. Wade – a court decision he once decried as going “too far.”\n\nComing weeks before a formal decision from the court had been expected, the leak dramatically accelerated plans to confront the issue through executive actions and on the campaign trail. For the millions of women who supported Biden during his presidential campaign in part based on his vow to protect their reproductive rights, it will be a decisive moment for the President to prove his willingness to fight for those protections.\n\n‘A seismic thing’\n\nAs he orders his staff to prepare options for when the ruling is made official, Biden’s team is looking ahead to what this news will mean for Democrats heading into November’s midterms elections, when both chambers of Congress could revert to Republican control.\n\nOne Biden adviser said they expect and hope the news will result in many people channeling their “energy and rage” into voting for candidates in November who are supporters of ​legal abortion rights.\n\n“This will have an extraordinary galvanizing force with some of the very Americans who don’t always turn out or weren’t really looking to the midterms yet,” the adviser said. “This is a seismic thing coming out of the Supreme Court, and it’s going to take a seismic movement in response … to elect more pro-choice elected officials.”\n\nThe adviser pointed to young people, people of color, women, independents and suburban women as groups that they expect the opinion draft to galvanize. If social issues have largely been “abstract” so far, “this is no longer going to be abstract,” the adviser said. “This is going to be real.”\n\nThey cautioned that the development doesn’t alter the significant headwinds Democrats face heading into November. But this Supreme Court draft ruling will now be one of the several issues Biden and other top officials discuss publicly as they increasingly attempt to draw a contrast between Democrats and a Republican Party that Biden has recently begun describing as moving into extreme territory.\n\n“I think that in some ways the Republican Party is like the dog that caught the bus here, because they have been campaigning for decades an overturning Roe,” Sen. Tina Smith, a Minnesota Democrat, said Tuesday on CNN. “Now they’re on the verge of realizing their goal, and they are dramatically out of step with the American public. And I believe there will be consequences for that.”\n\nA complicated issue for Biden\n\nAbortion is a charged issue for a president who has witnessed up close the changing politics of abortion over the half-century span of his career. Long one of the Democratic Party’s most moderate voices on abortion, Biden has reckoned with personal qualms rooted in his Catholic faith.\n\nHe said early on in his career that while he supported individuals’ right to an abortion, he opposed federal funds paying for them. Later, he backed Republican efforts to ban so-called “partial-birth abortions,” a non-medical term describing rare late-term procedures, and said he would have liked to go further in restricting them.\n\nIn 2006, two years before he was elected vice president, he told an interviewer he did “not view abortion as a choice and a right.” A year later, he spelled out his internal conflict in an appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”\n\n“I was 29 years old when I came to the United States Senate, and I have learned a lot,” he said. “I’m a practicing Catholic, and it is the biggest dilemma for me in terms of comporting my religious and cultural views with my political responsibility.”\n\nHe still mostly avoids using the word “abortion” in public, preferring vaguer terms like “a woman’s right to choose” instead. When he used the word Tuesday, it was the first time he’d said it out loud since becoming president last year – even though the right to have one had come under increasingly dire threat in the months since he took office.\n\nAt the same time, his public positions have moved significantly over time, a shift that mirrors a Democratic Party that has mostly stopped shying away from abortion as a galvanizing political issue. As a candidate in 2019, Biden reversed his long-held support for an amendment preventing federal funds from being used for abortions after being confronted by campaign advisers, who felt the view wasn’t politically tenable.\n\nAs president, Biden has taken some steps to reverse restrictive abortion rules from the Trump era, including the “Mexico City Policy” banning US funding of international organizations that perform abortions. He’s also removed anti-abortion restrictions on federal funding going toward health services for low-income Americans.\n\n‘We have been saying the sky is falling’\n\nStill, abortion is far from the driving issue of Biden’s administration. Biden has used most of his time in office focusing on other areas, from containing the coronavirus pandemic to supporting Ukraine in its battle with Russia to shoring up the economy. Even as states began passing restrictive laws all but eliminating abortions, the issue did not rise to the top of Biden’s agenda.\n\n“We have been saying the sky is falling, and I think what happened with this opinion being leaked last night – if it indeed is the close to the final opinion – was finally a demonstration that we were closing what we have been calling the believability gap,” said Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of America.\n\nShe said as supporters of abortion rights begin to realize those protections are now threatened, they will look to elected officials, including Biden and members of Congress, to take action.\n\n“We will be holding everybody accountable for what is within their purview to do right now,” she said. “I think that the administration, both the President and the vice president, issued strong statements today condemning what this draft opinion indicated and calling for a federal solution.”\n\nBehind the scenes, Biden’s advisers have been developing plans for the day Roe is overturned, including convening roundtables with state lawmakers to discuss the issue and solicit ideas in recent weeks.\n\nThe options include executive action that could make it easier for women to travel to receive abortions in states where they are still legal or expanding access to medication abortion through the mail. Some advocates have also suggested leasing federal land for abortion clinics, bypassing state laws that restrict them.\n\nBiden’s administration has been working for months in preparation for the expected decision by the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, though he hasn’t spelled out in any detail what options could be taken to mitigate the effects of such a ruling.\n\nThe work has occurred through the White House Gender Policy Council and the White House Counsel’s office, and Biden said in his statement Tuesday that his administration “will be ready when any ruling is issued.” Biden also warned that the draft opinion could suggest that “a whole range of rights” – not just access to abortion – could ultimately be weakened.\n\nIn public, the White House has focused primarily on urging Congress to write the right to abortion into law, a strategy that has little likelihood of succeeding in an evenly split Senate. Biden was non-committal Tuesday when asked whether he would support scrapping the legislative filibuster to allow for easier passage.\n\n“I’m not prepared to make those judgments now,” he said.\n\nOther Democrats say there is little time or space for such deliberation as millions of women face the growing likelihood they won’t have access to abortion.\n\n“I think this is where all Democrats should be,” Warren said on CNN. “I’ve made this argument; I’ve been making this argument for years. In a democracy, it makes no sense, it is antidemocratic to let a minority continue to control the United States Senate.”", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak Mj Lee", "Kevin Liptak", "Mj Lee"], "publish_date": "2022/05/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/21/politics/joe-biden-reelection-2024-trump-republican/index.html", "title": "As Joe Biden ramps up for a Trump rematch, Democrats worry he'd ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nTop Democrats see Republicans’ unenthusiastic greeting of Donald Trump’s third White House bid with a combination of schadenfreude and perhaps some other German word for terrifying, unintended consequences: They love seeing the former president struggle, but privately some tell CNN they worry this could lead to a more difficult 2024 campaign against a younger, fresher Republican.\n\nPresident Joe Biden heads into Thanksgiving for the first of several stretches with family members whose advice he’ll seek on whether to launch another campaign. He has privately and publicly signaled that he sees Democrats’ better-than-expected midterm results as an endorsement of him running for a second term – and he’s reveling in how many in his party seem to be agreeing with him.\n\nBiden and his aides believe that even with a potential recession looming next year, his reelection argument will grow stronger. They say voters will start to feel the benefits from the implementation of laws the president has signed over the past two years. They think House Republicans flexing their narrow hold on power through government shutdowns and debt ceiling showdowns to try to force repeals of those same laws will help them even more.\n\nAccording to CNN’s conversations with 24 Democratic elected officials, top operatives and Biden aides, the past two weeks have left them more confident that Biden would be their best bet to beat Trump in 2024. Some say they miscalculated how much appeal Biden continues to hold. Others now realize voters see him as a likable enough bulwark against extremism and a decent man, who can be a standard-setting, consensus choice amid historic polarization. Several onetime opponents say they’ve come around to thinking that maybe his approach in not responding with rage to the people raging at him has been more effective with voters.\n\n“What he did translated more with voters than favorability ratings, and that’s important for Democrats to remember as we go forward,” said North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, adding that after talking to Biden on the election night call he received as chair of the Democratic Governors Association, he’d be “surprised” if the president doesn’t run again.\n\nWhen asked, though, how they’d feel about Biden’s chances against Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis or other Republicans who could make a generational argument without the baggage Trump brings, many Democrats’ voices tend to tighten. “Not great,” said one top operative. “Uneasy,” said two others, in separate conversations.\n\nOthers point out that nearly all of Democrats’ key midterm victories were narrowly won, leaving them worried about how little room for error there likely will be next time.\n\nFour Democratic members of Congress, asking not to be named to speak candidly, estimated that at least half of their colleagues would pick someone other than Biden as their 2024 nominee – if they could vote by secret ballot.\n\nAll four also said that if there were a second question about whom they’d want instead, the votes would be all over the place – with several noting that one of the strongest arguments for Biden running is that it would help Democrats avoid a chaotic primary and give their bench time to gain more experience before the 2028 election.\n\nMinnesota Rep. Dean Phillips, the first Democrat in Congress to call for Biden not to run, said that regardless of his respect for the president, the midterm results or where Biden’s popularity lands, the party needs to “create pathways for new generations of leaders.”\n\n“There’s a pragmatic element of this too. I believe the country will be in a place where they’ll be looking for a new generation as well,” said Phillips, whom several colleagues note has become the person voicing feelings others are keeping private.\n\nColorado Sen. Michael Bennet, one of the few Democrats running in 2022 who appeared at an event with the president and scored an unexpectedly big reelection win in the onetime swing state, had long talked about how the best argument for another Biden campaign was that he could beat Trump again.\n\nAsked after Trump’s announcement if he’d be as confident in Biden against another Republican, Bennet dodged.\n\n“I just think that’s too contingent a question to answer,” the senator said.\n\nA few weeks ago, when many expected significant House losses for the party, Phillips was one of multiple Democrats predicting that the election aftermath would include more and louder calls for Biden to step aside. Phillips acknowledged last week that those calls haven’t come but attributed that more to the “culture of deference” in Congress than to renewed support for Biden.\n\n“It’s a little bit like when Trump was president, and none of the Republicans would say what they really thought on the record,” said one Democratic strategist.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Ann McLane Kuster also expressed doubts about Biden running for reelection as she campaigned in New Hampshire. Back in Washington after winning a sixth term by a wider-than-anticipated margin, she said she’s still not convinced.\n\n“I’m still in a wait-and-see, and I think a lot of people are,” Kuster said, noting that she has “been a Biden fan since she I was pregnant with my son, who was just sworn into the New York Bar.”\n\nAsked how she’d feel about Biden going up against a Republican who was younger and fresher than Trump, Kuster initially responded with a long “Hmmmmm.” She said she’s less concerned about that because she believes if Biden does run, that will drive Republicans to Trump, while if Biden doesn’t, that will drive them away from Trump.\n\n“It is an easy thing for people to underestimate Joe Biden – and they’ve been doing it and being wrong for a couple of election cycles now,” said one Biden adviser. As for those who still have doubts, “there are some Democrats who aren’t happy unless they can be anxious about something,” the adviser added.\n\nIncoming members of Congress who won their seats this year are among the most openly enthusiastic about a Biden reelection campaign.\n\n“I think he’s the guy who can beat anybody,” said California Rep.-elect Robert Garcia, who’s close with both the West Wing and Vice President Kamala Harris. “Presidents get reelected if they’re successful and if the American people want them back, and to me there is nothing in the president’s first two years that points to that he shouldn’t run again.”\n\nMaxwell Frost, the 25-year-old Florida Democrat who is the first member of Generation Z (those born after 1996) elected to Congress, said he was supporting Biden too, minutes after borrowing a tie to make his first visit to the House floor to watch 82-year-old House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announce she’d be stepping down from leadership.\n\n“He’s been unafraid to put forth bold, transformational ideas and policies, and that’s really what excites young voters,” Frost said, citing the infrastructure deal and the health care, tax and climate package dubbed the Inflation Reduction Act. Asked whether he was concerned about a potential generational contrast with Biden if the Republicans back someone other than Trump, Frost said, “I’d say good luck with whoever they put up.”\n\n“It doesn’t matter” who the Republican nominee is, argued Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford, fresh off his own reelection in a swing state that Biden won narrowly in 2020. “The Biden-Harris administration will carry Nevada and will carry the country again.”\n\nDrawing a contrast with Trump\n\nAfter a strategy of not even saying Trump’s name at all in his first year and then pounding on Trump by name throughout the midterm campaigning, the president is expected to revert to talking about his predecessor “sparingly,” an adviser said. What Biden and aides will do, though – like with the new section of the White House website touting administration achievements, which was launched last week a few hours before Trump’s presidential announcement – is emphasize their record in contrast with Trump’s rhetoric.\n\nA Trump rematch might be easier, several Democratic operatives involved with the preliminary thinking said, because they’d know how to go about it. They hope that one lesson of the midterms is Democrats’ ability to make voters see many leading Republicans as extreme and tainted by Trump.\n\nAs they wait on a Biden decision that they expect to drag into at least January, and with members of the president’s own Cabinet divided on whether he’ll go through with a launch, aides are planning to head into next year with events and travel to showcase now-tangible achievements.\n\n“There’ll be a bridge built that wasn’t built this year, more of the impact of prescription drug benefits will be felt,” said Democratic Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, an early and consistent Biden supporter.\n\nEarly planning is also underway for a string of state dinners, starting with one scheduled for December 1 to honor French President Emmanuel Macron, both to highlight what the White House says is Biden’s reasserting of American global leadership and to demonstrate another notch toward a post-pandemic normal.\n\nMeanwhile, aides are also gearing up for two years of trying to frame every move by the new House Republican majority as extremist overreach, including undermining the legitimacy of any investigations in the eyes of the media and the public. They’re counting on House Republicans who face tough reelections in 2024 to themselves back away from some of the biggest threats, such as impeaching the president. And as personally painful as any Republican inquiries of Biden’s son Hunter will be for the president, aides believe that the politics will boomerang in their favor by making Republicans look like they’re chasing conspiracy theories down rabbit holes rather than governing and by making Biden seem empathetic in a way that has consistently been his greatest strength.\n\n“The last two Democratic presidents lost the House – by far more than Biden did – and in both cases, that provided a powerful reelection foil,” said a person familiar with White House thinking. “We are dealing with a much more extreme Republican Party than they were. … But Biden does not provoke the Republican base in the way that other national Democrats have.”\n\nAge vs. ‘wisdom and experience’\n\nRepublican attempts to make Biden an anchor to Democratic midterm candidates by saying his name and flashing his image in ads about inflation, border control or gas prices don’t seem to have been decisive for independents and swing voters. Biden’s greatest weakness has repeatedly proved his greatest strength, several Democratic strategists said: People don’t feel strongly about him. There are few T-shirts with his face on them or flags with his name on them, but he also doesn’t inspire passionate hate. As Republican operatives tend to admit, voters’ sense of him is so well established that it’s hard to make anything stick to him.\n\nWhat does stick, in focus group after focus group: his age – he turned 80 on Sunday – and the sense that he’s not up to the job. One place where that caused problems: Pennsylvania, where Democratic Senate candidate John Fetterman was seen as independent from Biden – until the aftermath of his stroke. Then, focus groups noted, voters began to draw connections between the two men related to their physical fitness for office. (Fetterman, however, was able to overcome enough of those perceptions to help his party flip an open seat.)\n\nBiden “has his work cut out for him in terms of having folks believe he can command this job for four more years,” said one person familiar with the focus group findings.\n\nSome Democratic politicians and operatives shudder imagining a younger Republican nominee campaigning around the country at multiple stops a day, bounding onstage and reinforcing the skepticism that’s already in voters’ minds. These Democrats say their solace is fantasizing about Trump failing to snag the GOP nomination and then sabotaging the Republican nominee’s campaign, out of spite.\n\nBiden’s inner circle has seen the focus group data and has heard the same complaints. They’ve also seen how those concerns faded over the summer, as Biden signed more bills. That mattered for other Democrats too, with Rep. Dan Kildee, who just won a tight reelection race in Michigan, saying that people connecting with those legislative successes “got me over the finish line.”\n\nKildee said he believed Biden would be strong against Trump in Michigan, which Trump won by less than half a point in 2016 but Biden carried by 3 points in 2020. As for how he’d fare against another Republican, “there’s too many chess moves between now and then to figure that out yet,” Kildee said.\n\nAfter how unpredictable the factors shaping the 2020 and 2022 elections were, Biden’s circle doesn’t see a point in trying to guess exactly what he’d be campaigning on by the end of 2024. But the Biden adviser touted the president’s “wisdom and experience,” saying that had “allowed him to achieve an extraordinary legislative record and extraordinary record of global leadership in the first two years of his term.”\n\n“I don’t see anybody else that’s stronger. With all the things he’s doing, I don’t care how old he is,” said Eileen Reyes, a former Pete Buttigieg supporter from Luzerne, Pennsylvania, speaking ahead of Biden’s joint rally with Barack Obama in Philadelphia the Saturday night before the election.\n\nStephanie Schlatter, a lawyer in Washington who wore her old Biden-Harris white T-shirt to the celebratory speech Biden delivered at a Washington theater two days after the midterms, agreed.\n\n“My parents are older than he is, and they’re still whooping it up,” she said. “People are starting to come back from the nastiness, and they’re starting to see results.”", "authors": ["Edward-Isaac Dovere"], "publish_date": "2022/11/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/20/politics/joe-biden-80th-birthday/index.html", "title": "Joe Biden celebrates his 80th birthday | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden turns 80 years old on Sunday, becoming the first octogenarian to ever serve in the highest office of the United States.\n\nThe unique milestone of Biden’s birthday comes as the president faces speculation about whether he will mount a reelection run and dredges up questions about whether he’s too old to serve another term.\n\nThe president celebrated his birthday in Washington with a brunch hosted by first lady Jill Biden, according to White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.

There was also the lukewarm political support his slightly younger predecessor, Donald Trump, received when he announced his recent decision to run for president in 2024.\n\nBut Biden has not been able to shake voters’ apprehensions about his age, with rhetorical gaffes and literal stumbles at times reinforcing concerns about his health and mental acuity.\n\nBiden would be an unprecedented 86 years old by the end of his second term if he were to run and win his reelection. By comparison, some of the oldest past living presidents still had years on Biden – Trump left office at the age of 74 and Ronald Reagan left office after his two terms at 77 years old.\n\nThe president, for his part, maintains that voters concerned about his age should see his record of accomplishments since taking office.\n\n“Well, they’re concerned about whether or not I can get anything done. Look what I’ve gotten done,” Biden told CNN’s Jake Tapper in October. “Name me a president in recent history that’s gotten done as much as I have in their first two years.”\n\nBiden said last month that while he has not made a formal decision about running for reelection in 2024, it is his “intention” to do so. But he’s long said it’s a decision both he and his family will decide on together. And Saturday’s wedding marks a kickoff of sorts for the tight-knit Bidens to begin earnest discussions over whether their patriarch should seek a second term.\n\nAnd the president isn’t the only Washington power reckoning with pressures to bow out. On the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, Nancy Pelosi, 82, recently announced plans to step down as House speaker, celebrating Democrats ushering in a new generation of leadership.

The club also planned to hold a drag brunch and a drag show on Sunday for Transgender Day of Remembrance. The club’s website now says it will be closed until further notice.\n\nGov. Jared Polis ordered flags lowered to half-staff at all public buildings statewide to honor the victims of the mass shooting beginning Monday until Saturday, according to a news release from his office.\n\n“Flags will be lowered for 5 days to remember each of the 5 individuals who lost their lives in this senseless tragedy,” the release read. “To further honor and remember the victims and those injured in this tragedy, the Polis-Primavera administration will also be flying the Pride flag at the Colorado state capitol for the next five days.”\n\nThe shooting came as the calendar turned to Transgender Day of Remembrance on Sunday and is reminiscent of the 2016 attack at an LGBTQ nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in which a gunman who pledged allegiance to the Islamic State killed 49 people and wounded at least 53.\n\nColorado has been the site of some of the most heinous mass shootings in US history, including the 1999 shooting in Columbine High School and the 2012 movie theater shooting in Aurora. Colorado Springs was the site of mass shootings at a Planned Parenthood in November 2015 that left three dead and at a birthday party last year that left six dead.\n\nAccording to data from the Gun Violence Archive, there have been more than 600 mass shootings in the United States so far this year, defined as an incident in which at least four people are shot, excluding the shooter.\n\nHow the shooting unfolded\n\nJoshua Thurman told CNN affiliate KOAA he was inside the club dancing when he heard gunshots and saw a muzzle flash.\n\n“I thought it was the music, so I kept dancing,” he said. “Then I heard another set of shots, and then me and a customer ran to the dressing room, got on the ground and locked the doors and called the police immediately.”\n\nThurman said he heard the sounds of more gunshots, people crying and windows being shattered. When he came out, he saw bodies lying on the ground, broken glass and blood, he said.\n\nThe violence lasted just minutes. Police received numerous 911 calls starting at 11:56 p.m., officers were dispatched at 11:57 p.m., an officer arrived at midnight and the suspect was detained at 12:02 a.m., police said. A total of 39 patrol officers responded, police said, and Fire Department Captain Mike Smaldino said 11 ambulances went to the scene.\n\nA gunman killed at least five people at a LGBTQ nightclub in Colorado Springs before patrons confronted and stopped him, police say. Rosa Flores/CNN\n\nAuthorities initially said 18 people were injured but later adjusted that total up to 25. Nineteen of the 25 injured had gunshot wounds, Colorado Springs Mayor John Suthers told CNN’s Jim Acosta Sunday. Based on communication with medical personnel, Suthers said he expects the injured victims to survive and the community is “crossing our fingers” for no more fatalities.\n\nThe suspect is being treated at a hospital, police added. Officers did not shoot at him, police said.\n\nJoseph Sheldon told CNN affiliate KRDO he visited the club Saturday night to drop off a friend about 10 minutes before the gunman opened fire.\n\n“This is a bar I’ve gone to multiple times in my life since I became the age of 18. A lot of these people at the bar are friends, they are family, a lot are people I’ve become close to,” he said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Colorado Springs mayor says 'heroic' individuals subdued shooter with his gun 01:04 - Source: CNN\n\n“Whether it’s a hate crime or not, it’s hard to see that this is going on, that this happened in my community, that this happened at a place that I’ve gone to and felt safe, that this happened at a place where if I stayed 10 more minutes, I would have been right in the middle of it.”\n\nClub Q was safe space for LGBTQ community\n\nA general view of Club Q as police respond to a mass shooting there on November 20, 2022. Kevin Mohatt/Reuters\n\nColorado Springs, the state’s second-most populous city with just under 500,000 residents, is home to a number of military bases and is the headquarters for Focus on the Family, the conservative Christian group that says homosexuality and same-sex marriage are sins.\n\nClub Q opened in 2002 and was, until recently, the only LGBTQ club in the city.\n\n“Proudly queer Club Q has stood as a bastion of the LGBTQ community where others have fallen,” 5280 magazine reported in a story last year. “It’s where LGBTQ folks go for drag performances, dance parties, and drinks, and it supports the community with event sponsorships, pride celebrations, charity drives, and more. While the club has recently shifted to offering more low-key ‘dinner and a show’ vibes before 10 p.m., it’s still known as the place for queer young adults to go and get their dance on.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Bartender tried to escape club. He unexpectedly saw gunman on the ground 01:24 - Source: CNN\n\nIn a July 2020 interview with Colorado Springs Indy, Club Q owner Nic Grzecka explained why he and his business partner opened the establishment.\n\n“The whole idea of this place (Club Q) is to have a safe place – to get a permanent one in the city,” Grzecka said.\n\nHe and his business partner toured other successful LGBTQ spaces and noted a common theme: “They were gay as hell,” Grzecka told the outlet. “They had go-go dancers and drag queens and bartenders in jockstraps. We knew we had to be gay as hell (to survive).”\n\nThe venue also hosts events for people of all ages, including brunch and planned an upcoming Thanksgiving event.\n\nBouquets of flowers and a sign reading \"Love Over Hate\" were left near Club Q on Sunday, November 20, 2022. Jason Connolly/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLifelong Colorado Springs resident Tiana Nicole Dykes called Club Q “a second home full of chosen family.”\n\n“I’m there every other week if not every single week. This space means the world to me. The energy, the people, the message. It’s an amazing place that didn’t deserve this tragedy,” Dykes told CNN on Sunday. “Something like a mass shooting at an LGBT+ safe space is damaging beyond belief. There’s feelings of disrespect, disbelief, and just pure shock. Nobody ever thinks it’s gonna happen to them, and sometimes it does.”\n\nTim Curran, a copy editor for CNN’s “Early Start,” is a regular at Club Q with his boyfriend when he visits his family in Colorado Springs.\n\n“It’s a very warm, welcoming space, definitely a big step up for diversity in the Springs,” Curran told CNN.\n\nJewels Parks, who has been in the Colorado drag scene for over a year and performs under the drag name Dezzy Dazzles, said Club Q was a community, a family and a space where the outside world’s cruelty was not welcome.\n\n“Club Q, along with all of the other LGBTQIA+ bars, represent a safe space for a community that has felt unsafe and rejected for most of their lives,” Parks told CNN. “In a world that can be so dark and so angry, it’s that one place that feels like home. We’re able to unwind, forget about our troubles with work, family, society. Because of Club Q, we’re able to make friends that turn into family and be accepted for our true selves.”\n\n“The LGBTQIA+ community has undergone so much bigotry and hatred already. To have our safe place ripped from us and to lose members of our community is a whole other type of hurt,” Parks added.\n\nAntonio Taylor, a drag queen who was born and raised in Colorado Springs, told CNN they discovered Club Q in 2020, when they saw their first drag show. Taylor, who recently came out as bisexual, said a whole new world opened up for them – a world where they were not only safe, but truly loved.\n\n“The people there made me feel like I was a part of a family. Seeing so many people out and proud about themselves definitely influenced me to be my true self,” Taylor told CNN, adding that Club Q and its community helped them feel ready to come out.\n\n“This was one of the places where I didn’t have to worry about looks or people hating me for who I am,” they said. “I’m sick to my stomach that the one place where I knew I was safe has been made unsafe.”\n\nShenika Mosley, a 14-year patron of Club Q, said the shooting took away the nightclub’s “good energy.”\n\nMosley has frequented Club Q since 2009 and would find herself on its doorstep “anytime I wanted to get away and go have fun. It just had good energy … never bad energy. We’ll never be able to have that ever again.”\n\nLily Forsell had a similar sentiment, saying she had been celebrating her 18th birthday at the club and left just before shots rang out. She said she remembers the scene on the dance floor as she was leaving: dozens of people laughing, singing and dancing.\n\n“Looking at that dance floor is going to be a completely different feeling, now that we know what happened to 30 people on that floor,” Forsell told CNN. “I keep all of the drag queens in my heart. They made it out safely, but two of them, who I had first met last night, had to walk out of the building past the horrific scene, their friends injured or killed on the ground.”\n\nPolice investigating suspect’s past\n\nAldrich was arrested in June 2021 in connection with a bomb threat that led to a standoff at his mother’s home, according to a news release from the El Paso County Sheriff’s Office at the time and his mother’s former landlord.\n\nTwo law enforcement sources confirmed the suspect in the nightclub shooting and the bomb threat were the same person based on name and date of birth.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Club Q shooting suspect was previously arrested, police revealed 03:45 - Source: CNN\n\nVideo obtained by CNN shows Aldrich surrendering to law enforcement last year after allegedly making a bomb threat. Footage from the Ring door camera of the owner of the home shows Aldrich exiting the house with his hands up and barefoot, and walking to sheriff’s deputies.\n\nAldrich was arrested that month on charges of felony menacing and first-degree kidnapping, according to the El Paso release.\n\nSheriff’s deputies responded to a report by the man’s mother that he was “threatening to cause harm to her with a homemade bomb, multiple weapons, and ammunition,” according to the release. Deputies called the suspect, and he “refused to comply with orders to surrender,” the release said, leading them to evacuate nearby homes.\n\nSeveral hours after the initial police call, the sheriff’s crisis negotiations unit was able to get Aldrich to leave the house, and he was arrested after walking out the front door. Authorities did not find any explosives in the home.\n\nLeslie Bowman, who owns the house where Aldrich’s mother lived, provided CNN the videos. Bowman said Aldrich’s mother rented a room in the house for a little over a year. Aldrich would “come by and visit his mom and hang out in her room,” Bowman said. She described Aldrich as “not very sociable.”\n\nOne time, Bowman said, Aldrich got angry at her during an argument about a bathroom toilet not working, and slammed a door in her face.\n\n“That was the only time he was aggressive or angry towards me,” she said.\n\nAttempts by CNN to reach Aldrich’s mother for comment were unsuccessful.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how the bomb threat case was resolved, but the Colorado Springs Gazette reported that the district attorney’s office said no formal charges were pursued in the case. The district attorney’s office did not respond to a request for comment from CNN.\n\nAldrich also called the Gazette in an attempt to get an earlier story about the 2021 incident removed from the website, the newspaper reported. “There is absolutely nothing there, the case was dropped, and I’m asking you either remove or update the story,” Aldrich said in a voice message, according to the Gazette.\n\nPoliticians offer support to LGBTQ community\n\nColorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat and the nation’s first openly gay governor, issued a statement Sunday calling the attack “horrific, sickening and devastating” and offered state resources to local law enforcement.\n\n“We are eternally grateful for the brave individuals who blocked the gunman likely saving lives in the process and for the first responders who responded swiftly to this horrific shooting,” he said. “Colorado stands with our LGTBQ community and everyone impacted by this tragedy as we mourn together.”\n\nPolis told CNN’s Jim Acosta there are only two gay bars in Colorado Springs, and Club Q was one of the main venues.\n\n“Everyone knew it. I knew it, knew this venue. It’s just shocking. That’s still setting in for people. But I know we’re going to bounce back. We’re showing love for one another. We’re showing healing for one another,” the governor said.\n\nColorado’s two US senators, both Democrats, offered condolences in statements and said more should be done for the LGBTQ community.\n\n“We have to protect LGBTQ lives from this hate,” Sen. John Hickenlooper said.\n\n“As we seek justice for this unimaginable act, we must do more to protect the LGBTQ community and stand firm against discrimination and hate in every form,” Sen. Michael Bennett said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden also issued a statement saying he was praying for the victims and their families.\n\n“While no motive in this attack is yet clear, we know that the LGBTQI+ community has been subjected to horrific hate violence in recent years. Gun violence continues to have a devastating and particular impact on LGBTQI+ communities across our nation and threats of violence are increasing,” Biden said in the written statement.", "authors": ["Eric Levenson Michelle Watson Andy Rose Amir Vera", "Eric Levenson", "Michelle Watson", "Andy Rose", "Amir Vera"], "publish_date": "2022/11/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/28/politics/joe-biden-2022/index.html", "title": "Biden and his team feeling vindicated by a 2022 turnaround built on ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden spent hours during his first foreign trip behind closed doors, attempting to reassure a shaken group of US allies that America was back. It was clear, he later told advisers, just how much work remained to convince them of the durability of that commitment.\n\nEighteen months after those meetings in Europe, Biden departed Washington on Tuesday for his year-end vacation, riding the momentum of historic legislative success and the defiance of political gravity that has reshaped the expectations for the critical months – and decisions – ahead. It’s a moment that Biden never seemed to doubt would come, even as his party – and some inside the White House – questioned or outright urged a change in approach to address political and economic headwinds driven primarily by soaring inflation that threatened to drag down his presidency.\n\nDuring those 2021 meetings in England and Belgium, Biden found a group of allies genuinely shaken by the January 6 insurrection and the events that led to it. But the president tried to reassure them that the visceral divides that culminated in the violence that day would heal and the bleak moment in US politics would pass.\n\nHe was met with polite appreciation from his foreign counterparts. But the deep skepticism served only to underscore his commitment to a belief that sat at the heart of a pledge that was often pilloried during the campaign as naïve. The only real reassurance, Biden would note, was delivering on what he’d promised.\n\n“That’s why it’s so important that I succeed in my agenda, whether it’s dealing with the vaccine, the economy, infrastructure,” Biden told reporters in Brussels shortly before he boarded Air Force One for a flight to Switzerland and a sit down with Russian President Vladimir Putin. “It’s important that we demonstrate we can make progress and continue to make progress. And I think we’re going to be able to do that.”\n\nThe moment provided a brief window into the president’s high-stakes theory of the case – one that appeared exceedingly aspirational given his party’s narrow congressional majorities and staunch GOP opposition. But even as this year began, Biden and his team were grasping to break free of a series of crises and the cornerstone of his agenda – a sweeping bill that included numerous administration priorities – appeared in shambles.\n\nBiden’s anticipated final major action before the end of 2022 serves as an almost poetic coda for his first two years. The $1.7 trillion bipartisan spending package he will sign will lock in key funding priorities and include an overhaul of the law his predecessor cited in the lead up to the January 6 riot.\n\nThe turn from aspirational goals to palpable accomplishments – highlighted over the last several months by Biden’s travel to major corporate groundbreakings in states like Ohio, Arizona and Michigan – underpins the sharp reversal for the White House. That turnaround serves as evidence of Biden’s steely belief in his strategies and policy proposals –an approach deeply rooted over his decades in public service.\n\n“One thing that is foundational with him is if he says he’s going to do something, he does it,” Steve Ricchetti, one of Biden’s closest and longest-serving advisers, told CNN in an interview, underscoring an approach that has been defined by steady, and at times stubborn, persistence.\n\nSimple as it may seem, a campaign promise or commitment has tipped internal debates on policy decisions more than once, one White House official noted.\n\nBiden’s closest confidants also stress that it’s a perspective that is instructive as the White House prepares for the dramatically reshaped Washington that will confront him upon his return from his family vacation to the US Virgin Islands.\n\n“The whole idea of showing people government can work – we were mocked for that in some corners,” a Biden adviser said. “That’s literally what’s happening now.”\n\nThere are still clear challenges ahead. Inflation remains high even if its grip appears to be easing. Biden’s advisers expect economic growth to slow in the quarters ahead, though they remain cautiously optimistic a recession can be avoided.\n\nBiden’s approval ratings, while ticking up, remain low and his age remains a real, if less publicly addressed, concern held by Democrats as they wait for an official decision about whether he will seek reelection.\n\nBut Biden’s overarching approach has guided the early-stage planning for the legislative and political implications of a new House Republican majority and served as the basis for aides already working through the outlines of the State of the Union address that will come early next year.\n\nIt’s also a defining element of the structure and message planning of a nascent campaign that has taken shape over the last several months and accelerated. Biden’s senior team has become increasingly confident that a reelection campaign will be green lit in the weeks ahead.\n\nWhite House officials view the political salience of his agenda as both an underappreciated element of their ability to defy the expectations of sweeping GOP gains in the midterms and as a critical piece of what comes next. The prospect of divided government – and the exceedingly narrow legislative pathway it brings – has limited effect on an agenda that is now in the implementation phase.\n\n“It forms the foundation for even stronger achievements as the nation heads into the New Year,” Mike Donilon, the White House senior adviser and long-standing member of Biden’s inner circle, wrote in a political memo circulated to allies this month.\n\nBiden, advisers said, has laid down strict directives to senior aides and Cabinet officials about the necessity of efficient implementation in the months ahead.\n\n“It’s not subtle,” a senior administration official said of the message from the top. “We have to get it right and in the moments we don’t, we damn well be ready to explain it – and fix it.”\n\nLong-held principles put into action in 2022\n\nFor Biden’s tight-knit and long-serving advisers, this is a moment that both vindicates and validates core elements of a campaign and presidency that at various points were dismissed, underestimated or at some points even mocked.\n\n“A lot of people told him that this wouldn’t resonate, or that it wasn’t the message, or that it’s outdated,” Stef Feldman, the longtime Biden aide who served as the 2020 campaign policy director before following him to the White House, told CNN.\n\nBiden viewed his infrastructure proposal, in particular, as a central policy plank of his campaign as Democratic primary opponents raced to outdo one another with transformational progressive proposals – none of which included a viable way to pass a bitterly divided Congress.\n\nBiden and his economic advisers zeroed in on an intensive manufacturing and supply chain agenda that grew more aggressive and transformational as a once-in-a-century pandemic gripped the country. They saw it as the key to reverse the accelerants at the heart of the atmosphere that created the opening for Donald Trump to reach the Oval Office.\n\n“This was the right moment for his theory of the case,” Feldman said. “He could apply the principles that have really guided him throughout his whole career.”\n\nThose principles have largely stayed with Biden through his time as a senator and vice president and were refined during the critical two years spent out of office as he weighed yet another run for the presidency.\n\n“Ever since I’ve talked to the president about the economy, he’s distinguished between the short-term and the long-term, between consumption and investment,” said Jared Bernstein, Biden’s chief economist as vice president who now sits on the Council of Economic Advisers. “These have always been foundational to his economic thinking.”\n\nThe animating principles of Biden’s 2020 campaign hardly diverged from the key themes outlined by Donilon, Biden’s in-house mind-meld, in the 22-page memo he drafted in early 2015 as the then-vice president weighed jumping into the 2016 race.\n\nFrom think tanks to business schools to Davos, Biden took the role of a kind of middle class evangelist, pressing for the pursuit of policies that addressed short-term incentives that had driven jobs away and wages down. Those speeches and discussions served as a roadmap of sorts for an agenda that is now largely law. They detailed major infrastructure investments and a incentivizing research and development that had atrophied. There were broad outlines of nascent ideas to connect hollowed out manufacturing centers and communities to new opportunities. Biden proposed changes to the tax code that tracked near where his administration would eventually land as it sought to finance spending plans.\n\nEven the anecdotes from the period – whether the one about Chinese leader Xi Jinping and American “possibilities” or his father’s sayings about the dignity of work, or the importance of “breathing room” – are the same that populate his speeches as president.\n\nRicchetti, who as counselor to the president helped lead the White House legislative effort, pointed to a clear “through-line” from Biden’s days as a senator, through his time as vice president and during the first two years of Trump’s presidency.\n\nBiden wrote a book detailing his decision not to run for president as he dealt with the pain of his son Beau’s fight with, and eventual death from, brain cancer. That process and the book tour that followed are viewed by Biden’s inner circle as an essential experience in the eventual decision to run in 2020.\n\n“Much of what we prioritized at that time we took with us and used as the foundation,” Ricchetti said of the years leading up to the campaign.\n\nA legislative window opens at the opportune moment\n\nIf the effort to turn that foundation into a coherent policy agenda was accelerated and expanded in the final months of the campaign, it was turbocharged during a transition that saw Democrats take control of the Senate majority.\n\nOfficials structured the infrastructure, manufacturing, research and development, climate and equity proposals into interlocking pieces, designed to work in tandem even if they were eventually scaled back during the legislative process.\n\n“At the core of this strategy was that the power of it is that these things work together,” National Economic Council Chairman Brian Deese, one of the architects of the package, said in an interview.\n\nWhat the proposals – particularly across industries and policy priorities tied to climate and manufacturing – also represented was a dramatic shift in what had become an entrenched, if not monolithic, economic orthodoxy. Biden would oversee the most consequential pursuit of an industrial policy strategy in decades. He’d do so in many cases with Republican support.\n\nTo be clear, subscribing to the term “industrial policy” still isn’t universally embraced. Even Deese, who has driven and defined its core elements, prefers “Modern American Industrial Strategy.” In its simplest form, it’s the idea that “if you do public investment in a thoughtful way, what you’ll actually do is crowd in private investment,” Deese said.\n\nDeese likes to point out its roots in the American economy can be traced to Alexander Hamilton.\n\nBut the convergence of factors that led it to once again gain broader, and bipartisan, traction was in many ways tailor-made for Biden.\n\nA resurgence in research and development funding. Significant public investments designed for critical areas of national and economic security. The elevation of labor unions and a focus on creating the conditions to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US.\n\nOn their face, these issues are politically popular and hardly exclusive to Biden. They’re also exceedingly difficult to turn into policy. At least until the pandemic.\n\n“There’s a cost associated with industrial weakness,” Deese said. “The pandemic laid bare something that had been the case for years.”\n\nThat was true for semiconductors – the tiny chips essential for everything from cars and washing machines to advanced weapons systems – that drove the bipartisan urgency behind the $280 billion CHIPS and Science law. Sen. Todd Young, an Indiana Republican up for reelection in 2022, drove the effort on Capitol Hill – something that underscored the salience of an issue that scrambled traditional political dynamics.\n\nFor Young, who had pressed for legislation tied to the issue in the year before Biden entered the White House, it was less about embracing a broader shift in economic policy and more about addressing the fact China had pursued exactly that for a decade or longer. Young was one of 17 Senate Republicans who voted to advance the eventual law that has driven new private sector investment or commitments in the last several months.\n\nThe pandemic. The rise of China as key feature of policy making in both parties. A president animated by the idea of long-term economic incentives crafted to connect workers and communities left behind for decades.\n\n“These policy insights might not have come to fruition were it not for a confluence of events,” Bernstein acknowledged.\n\n‘Better positioned’\n\nTed Kaufman has a simple explanation for Biden’s approach and the places where it paid off after two years.\n\n“There’s a confidence that comes from knowing what you’re doing,” said Kaufman, the former Delaware senator, longtime Biden Senate chief of staff and one of the president’s closest friends. “This is a guy who is so incredibly well qualified to be president because of experience.”\n\nAs to why that experience has rarely been rewarded by voters, Kaufman had another simple explanation.\n\n“It’s hard because you have a record,” he said.\n\nIn a way it’s both an implicit acknowledgment of the unprecedented factors – most notably Trump, but in some ways the pandemic as well – that created an opening to the presidency for Biden. Another incumbent, or another moment, and advisers note that it wouldn’t be a question of if Biden would win. He wouldn’t have even run.\n\nInstead, as he weighs running for reelection at age 80, he enters the final two years of this term with much of his agenda now law. Core elements of that agenda were driven by bipartisan consensus. Even Biden’s final bipartisan achievement of the year – the $1.7 trillion spending package – includes an initial $500 million to seed the technology and innovation hubs created by the CHIPS and Science Act in parts of the country outside of traditional tech sectors.\n\nWhile Democrats narrowly lost their House majority in the midterm elections, the party expanded its Senate majority by a seat.\n\nPerhaps most critically for Biden, the voters sharply reject some of the most extreme voices parroting 2020 election lies in critical races for governor and secretary of state.\n\nIn the months leading up to the midterm elections, Biden had started regularly recounting the experience with his foreign counterparts on that first foreign trip in an effort to underscore the stakes.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, after his travel to Indonesia for the G-20 Summit, he was ready to provide an updated version as he stood against the backdrop of a new factory in Arizona to celebrate the announcement by a Taiwanese chip maker of what would mark one of the largest foreign investments in US history.\n\n“What was clear in those meetings is the United States is better positioned than any other nation to lead the world economy in the years ahead if we keep our focus,” Biden said.", "authors": ["Phil Mattingly"], "publish_date": "2022/12/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/15/politics/jill-biden-2024-campaign/index.html", "title": "Jill Biden makes a tidal shift from her thoughts on another run at the ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden, despite being so worn out from a recent circuit of White House events that she lost her voice, is now seriously looking ahead to her husband running for reelection in 2024. That’s a tidal shift from her position just three months ago.\n\nSeven people familiar with Biden’s thinking told CNN that her private conversations about another run now match her publicly enthusiastic persona, as well as the sentiments of President Joe Biden.\n\nThe first lady was still mostly skeptical as of early fall – “not a proponent,” as one person familiar with her thinking told CNN. But in the month since the November midterm elections, in which Democrats defied the fate of most parties of first-term presidents, friends noted a change.\n\nJill Biden is now “all in” on the idea, according to a person who works with the East Wing.\n\nEven though the last several weeks of high-profile events have left her “exhausted,” said another person, “she has begun to say the quiet part out loud.”\n\nAt a town hall the other day, for example, Biden empathized with parents and grandparents about holiday stress, lamenting the demands on her own time.\n\n“This time of year is busy, to say the least,” she said. “I know that you probably have holiday shopping to do, cards to address or cookies to bake. … It’s not easy, is it? Sometimes all these feel like a full-time job, on top of volunteering or organizing or your real full-time job.”\n\nAs soon as her remarks were over, she tagged out and let other speakers finish the event while she hustled to the next task.\n\nThe Biden family conversations about 2024 were supposed to be on track for Christmas, however, CNN has learned from three of the people familiar that the clan is not expected to be in the same place all at the same time this year, making convening for a debate or a consensus more complicated.\n\n“She’ll be at the White House for Christmas. They will be joined by members of their families,” said Vanessa Valdivia, Jill Biden’s press secretary, who declined further comment on family discussions.\n\nThe West Wing has long been in “he’s running” mode, with a political operation for 2024 already in the works. It’s an apparatus that has had to get started out of necessity before an official announcement. “As the president has said, he intends to run for reelection and that is something both Dr. Biden and the family fully support,” a senior adviser to Jill Biden told CNN.\n\nRecent polling, however, suggests a large swath of the Democratic Party may not be eager to see the president run again. A new CNN poll shows 59% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say they’d like to see someone other than Joe Biden at the top of the ticket in 2024 – similar to the percentage of Republicans and Republican-leaners (62%) who say they’d prefer to see their party nominate someone other than former President Donald Trump. At the same time, though, when pressed, a majority of Democratic-aligned voters with opposition to Biden as their party’s nominee say they would vote for him in a general election if he won their party’s primary.\n\nThe first lady, and she alone, has the full weight of kibosh; she can still stop what seems inevitable in a political calculus if she has concerns about her husband’s age or how another run would affect his legacy or their family. She has been a “no” vote on his higher office aspirations before – most notably in 2004, and again in 2015.\n\nAnother presidential campaign would mean more for her, too. Joe Biden’s reelection plan, if he runs, will depend heavily on his wife’s involvement. Her likability in purple and red states, as well as her own energy and endurance, are crucial to his game plan, said two people with insight into the 2024 campaign strategy. It was Jill Biden, not the president, who barnstormed more than a dozen states in the midterms, chalking up at least 39 appearances at fundraisers and speaking engagements to support candidates up and down the ballot. Asked if the first lady is prepared to hit the trail even harder for a 2024 bid, the senior Biden adviser told CNN, “She is ready and fully supportive.”\n\nBut heading into her holiday break, Biden is coming off a physically and emotionally taxing period, said those who know her. Though still leaning into the presumption a second term is in the cards, the last two weeks have nonetheless run her ragged with the obligatory duties that the often-introverted first lady finds most draining, sources close to her said.\n\nIn addition to the recent wedding of her granddaughter, and the administration’s first State Dinner, hundreds of invited guests have been streaming through the White House over the last several days for dozens of holiday parties. On Wednesday, Biden and the president hosted yet another large-scale social event, a formal dinner in the East Room of the White House, for African nation leaders and their spouses in Washington this week for a summit. Jill Biden was also charged with planning and hosting events for the spouses on Wednesday and Thursday, when a luncheon at the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture will occupy a chunk of her day.\n\n“She still has laryngitis, and is hoarse,” said a source familiar with the first lady’s rigorous schedule, alluding to Biden’s noticeably altered voice at speaking engagements this week. “She had three back-to-back parties on Saturday alone.”\n\n“It has been a busy month,” said Elizabeth Alexander, her communications director, when asked by CNN about Biden losing her voice.\n\nThat voice is the most influential to her husband’s decision making and thus will have to be the loudest when the time does come for him to announce his plans for 2024.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden arrive with Vice President Kamala Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff for a bill signing ceremony for the Respect for Marriage Act on Tuesday, December 13, 2022, on the South Lawn of the White House. Patrick Semansky/AP\n\nFirst lady veto power\n\nJoe Biden is buzzing from Democrats’ midterm performance – they retained the Senate and held off Republicans from a red wave in the House – some improving economic data, successful Asia summits and the release of Brittney Griner. He is telling people he has what it takes more than ever to go up against Trump – or whoever the ultimate GOP nominee may be.\n\nThough more squarely in the “we’re doing it” corner than she was even three months ago, Jill Biden still considers whether her husband, now 80, is up for a bruising battle, according to those familiar with her thinking.\n\n“[Jill Biden] is the one more aware of how the last few years have affected Joe [Biden,]” noted a person with ties to the Biden family. “We – collectively, as a country – all know the age issue, sure. But she’s the one who is consistently able to analyze it.”\n\nThe senior Biden official said the first lady has “zero concerns” about the president’s schedule and stamina.\n\nJill Biden is also the tender of Joe Biden’s legacy. Like so many first ladies before her, she can look down the road to what’s coming, how ready her husband is for it and what the best-case scenario may be. For the last two years, whenever the topic of a second term arose, she spoke of it as an inevitability, said those who have spent time working with her. She would default to saying things like “after the reelect” or “in the second term.”\n\nBut a deeper analysis of what that would mean for Joe Biden’s legacy has only come more recently for the first lady, said others who have had more insight into conversations.\n\nLast month, Biden’s big birthday made him the first octogenarian president of the United States. Jill Biden, 71, doesn’t want that to be the marker that leads every article and analysis about her husband after he has departed the Oval Office, friends and associates said.\n\nShe wants his political successes – current and future – to supersede the image of a frail and aged commander in chief.\n\nBut she’s still uncertain how to shift that narrative in practice. “She is not convinced whether four more years will help or hurt,” said one of the people who know her, discussing the potency of the age issue.\n\nJoe Biden’s timeline for an announcement on his future might not wait for the first lady to reconcile the problem.\n\n“The president will make that decision. I expect it shortly after the holiday,” said Ron Klain, Biden’s chief of staff, at a Wall Street Journal summit earlier this month. “I expect his decision will be to do it.”\n\nThe president has teased an announcement for months now, publicly saying he intends to run for reelection, often adding in the next breath he will discuss it with his wife and family first.\n\nKeeping it in the family\n\nJill Biden is keenly aware of the influence she has had on her husband’s political trajectory. And this decision, while perhaps easier for Joe Biden to make as an incumbent, is no less hinged upon the blessing of the first lady. Jill Biden, as “Nana” to her grandchildren and matriarchal keeper of normalcy and tradition, has her eye on what a second term could mean for them, said the people who know her.\n\n“She has always had one foot in Delaware, and she’s the one who thinks about every possible scenario that could play out for her family,” said someone who has known her for several years. As she crosses from “highly possible” into “certainty” territory for 2024, Biden is considering how the campaign could impact her son, Hunter Biden, who has long been a target of the president’s political opponents, and could face more investigations into his business dealings with a GOP-led House. She wants to mitigate as much as possible the strain a campaign could have on her children, and, by extension, her grandchildren, several of whom are either on the cusp of entering adulthood or already there. (With the exception of Hunter Biden’s son, Beau, who is 2.)\n\n“This is, ultimately, a family decision,” Joe Biden said at a news conference last month. “I think everybody wants me to run, but we’re going to have discussions about it.”\n\nAsked by members of the media a couple of weeks later over Thanksgiving – a holiday he spent with Jill Biden, Hunter Biden and his wife and son, and Ashley Biden, in Nantucket, Massachusetts – how those family discussions about 2024 were coming along, the president said they weren’t. “We’re not having any. We’re celebrating,” he responded.\n\nWith the clock on the 2024 announcement ticking, Jill Biden has one more shot at away-from-Washington alone-time with her husband, when she could wrap her head around what “all in” actually entails.\n\nThe couple heads to the warmer climes of St. Croix between Christmas and New Year’s; laying in the sun with a book is a favored activity for the first lady.\n\n“Well, I – my guess is – I hope Jill and I get a little time to actually sneak away for a week,” the president said at his November post-election news conference at the White House, where Jill Biden sat in the front row. “And my guess is it would be early next year we make that judgment.”", "authors": ["Kate Bennett"], "publish_date": "2022/12/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/05/politics/biden-midterms-pennsylvania-wisconsin/index.html", "title": "Biden tests his political strength in return to the campaign trail | CNN ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden has been celebrating Labor Day in Pittsburgh on-and-off for more than a decade, twice using the city’s parade as a testing ground while he contemplated a presidential run.\n\nWhen he returned to the city Monday, other races were front and center, including Pennsylvania’s increasingly nasty Senate contest. Yet over the coming weeks, Biden’s own political strength will be put to the test as he embarks upon his most intensive in-person politicking since before the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIn Wisconsin and Pennsylvania on Monday, Biden heralded his economic record at events with union crowds. But he also hit back at “extreme” Republicans he deemed “Trumpies” as he endeavors to render the upcoming vote not just a referendum on his own record but a choice between himself and the chaos cultivated by former President Donald Trump.\n\nIn Pittsburgh, Biden referred to his predecessor simply as “the former, defeated, President.”\n\n“It’s clear which way he wants to look,” he said. “It’s clear which way the new MAGA Republicans are. They’re extreme.”\n\n“Trump and the MAGA Republicans made their choice,” he added later. “We can make ours: We can choose to build a better America or continue down this sliding path.”\n\nEarlier, in Wisconsin, Biden sought to differentiate between traditional Republicans and those who have rallied behind Trump.\n\n“I want to be very clear up front. Not everyone Republican is a ‘MAGA Republican.’ Not every Republican embraces that extreme ideology. I know, because I’ve been able to work with mainstream Republicans my whole career,” Biden said at Laborfest in Milwaukee to a cheering crowd of union workers.\n\n“But the extreme MAGA Republicans in Congress have chosen to go backwards, full of anger, violence, hate and division,” he said. “But together we can and we must choose a different path: forward.”\n\nDemocrats hope to flip two Republican-held Senate seats in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, and their success or failure will be viewed as a key indicator of the party’s – and Biden’s – political power ahead of the 2024 presidential contest.\n\nBiden’s own political future was the subject of anxious speculation over the summer as the 79-year-old President suffered low approval ratings and a string of setbacks. Biden’s intentions remain a lingering question, though he insists he plans to run again.\n\nPittsburgh was where Biden headed in 2015 and 2018 as he considered previous presidential runs. Marching in the city’s parade those years, he was met with enthusiastic calls of “run, Joe, run.”\n\nOn his visit Monday, Biden swapped the parade for a union picnic with members of the United Steelworkers. He mingled with the crowd for a stretch before his speech, tossing a beanbag with kids and taking photos.\n\nBefore emerging into the crowd, Biden met privately with Democratic US Senate candidate, Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, who suffered a stroke earlier this year that took him off the campaign trail, in their first face to face of the campaign.\n\nFor much of the summer, it remained an open question whether Biden would be a welcome guest with Democrats or shunned by candidates looking to separate themselves from a historically unpopular president.\n\nWhen Biden visited Cleveland in July to deliver an economic speech, Ohio’s Democratic Senate candidate, Rep. Tim Ryan, declined to attend. He opted to campaign in another part of the state instead.\n\nOther Democratic candidates declined to say explicitly whether they wanted Biden to join them on the campaign trial in the fall.\n\n“I will welcome anybody to come to Arizona, travel around the state at any time. As long as I’m here, if I’m not up in Washington in session, and talk about what Arizona needs,” Sen. Mark Kelly, running for reelection in Arizona, said on CNN, stopping short of directly asking Biden to come.\n\nOn Monday, some Democratic candidates appeared eager to appear with Biden. In Milwaukee, he appeared with Gov. Tony Evers, the Democratic incumbent running for reelection against Trump-backed Republican Tim Michels. The Democratic Senate candidate, Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, did not appear with Biden, though the President advocated for him during his speech.\n\nWhen Biden spoke last week in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Attorney General Josh Shapiro, appeared alongside him. And Fetterman’s team confirmed nearly as soon as the White House announced Biden’s trip to Pittsburgh that he would be meeting with the President.\n\nDuring their meeting Monday, which lasted about 15 minutes, Fetterman pushed for Biden “to use his executive authority to begin the process of rescheduling marijuana,” according to a readout provided to CNN by Fetterman spokesman Joe Calvello.\n\nThey also discussed infrastructure and “the urgent need to ‘make more stuff in America,’ strengthen and expand labor unions, and put more power directly into the hands of American workers,” Calvello added.\n\nWhen the two men emerged from the union hall together, Fetterman raised his arms and pumped his fists. But when Fetterman spoke ahead of Biden, he used the opportunity to lambast his Republican opponent, Dr. Mehmet Oz, for owning multiple homes and preparing crudités without mentioning the President.\n\nThe unofficial kickoff to the midterm campaign season has coincided with a string of policy successes for Biden and his party, easing some of the Democratic pressure surrounding the President’s leadership and political acumen.\n\nBiden hopes to use his recent victories to boost Democrats and avoid what once was viewed as an inevitable midterm drubbing. He is also betting the reminder to voters of the dysfunction surrounding Trump will benefit Democrats in November.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Biden chastised the state’s incumbent Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, a top Trump ally, for downplaying the January 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol, where Trump’s supporters sought to disrupt the electoral vote count.\n\n“Sen. Johnson said it was by and large a peaceful protest,” Biden said. “Have you seen the videos what happened that day?”\n\nSpeaking in Pennsylvania later, Biden questioned the patriotism of Trump-supporting Republicans who have questioned the results of the 2020 election.\n\n“You can’t say you love the country, when … you either win, or you have been cheated,” he said. “And that’s where we are now.”\n\nBiden’s advisers have laid plans for the President to travel two or three times a week in the run-up to the November vote. Because his presidential bid was hampered by the pandemic, Biden has not aggressively campaigned in-person since he was competing in the Democratic primary in early 2020.\n\nAt campaign-style events over the past two weeks, Biden has demonstrated an eager willingness for the trail. During a fiery rally in Maryland, he excoriated Republicans for standing in the way of his agenda, which he touted as transformational for middle class Americans.\n\nLater, during an official event in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, Biden called for tougher new gun laws, including a ban on assault weapons, and accused Republicans of fealty to the gun lobby.\n\nAnd speaking at Independence Hall in Philadelphia last week, in what was an official White House event despite the political message, Biden issued a dire warning about “MAGA Republicans” seeking to undermine American democracy, a speech he’d been contemplating for months as he grew increasingly concerned at Trump’s hold on the GOP.\n\nMonday’s events signaled a return to a more consistent theme for Biden: The importance of organized labor in building the middle class and strengthening worker protections. Biden’s endorsement from key unions have helped fuel his many political campaigns, support he is consistently looking to repay.\n\nIn memos and strategy documents prepared over the month of August, Biden’s team spelled out their dual-track midterm message: framing Republicans as extremists and promoting his own list of accomplishments.\n\nHis stop in Pittsburgh marked his third visit to the commonwealth in the span of a week, and his 16th stop in the Keystone State since taking office.\n\nAt his own rally in Wilkes-Barre over the weekend, Trump sought to boost his endorsed candidates but spent much of his speech railing against Biden and the FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago estate.\n\nTrump labeled Biden an “enemy of the state” in his speech, delivered near Biden’s hometown of Scranton.\n\nIn Boston, meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris echoed Biden’s message drawing contrasts with what the White House describes as “extremist” Republicans.\n\n“Every day, workers fight to move our country forward. And yet, we must recognize that there are those in Congress who are fighting to drag us back. In Congress, in statehouses across our nation, extremist, so-called leaders are fighting to turn back the clock,” she said during remarks to the Greater Boston Labor Council’s annual breakfast.\n\n“Let’s not let extremist so-called leaders turn back the clock. We know what’s at stake, we know what we stand for, we know when we fight, we win, we love our country, and all of this is worth it,” she said.\n\nThis story has been updated with further developments on Monday.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/18/politics/joe-biden-abortion-speech/index.html", "title": "Biden promises abortion rights law as Democrats try to rally voters ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Tuesday made a major promise on a push to put abortion rights into law as his party looks to seize on the politically divisive issue in the final push ahead of the midterm elections.\n\nAt an abortion-rights-focused speech at a Democratic National Committee event on Tuesday, Biden said that if Democrats elect more senators and keep control of the House in the midterms then he’d make abortion a top issue.\n\n“The court got Roe right nearly 50 years ago and I believe the Congress should codify Roe, once and for all,” Biden said.\n\nHe then implored voters to elect more Democrats in order to make sure that bill could pass.\n\n“If we do that, here’s the promise I make to you and the American people: The first bill I will send to the Congress will be to codify Roe v. Wade. And when Congress passes it, I’ll sign it in January, 50 years after Roe was first decided the law of the land,” Biden added.\n\nDating back to the 2020 campaign, Biden has called for codifying Roe v. Wade, which had guaranteed a federal constitutional right to abortion. The Supreme Court overturned it earlier this year, transforming access to reproductive health care in the country. It is unclear how politically effective such a promise of prioritizing such a bill will be, given that Democrats have an intensely tough battle in November to keep both the Senate and House.\n\nBiden has not been able to fulfill that campaign promise in part because he needs more than just a simple majority in the Senate to overcome the chamber’s filibuster rules. While Biden has voiced support for ending the 60-vote threshold to codify abortion rights, Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona remain opposed to such a carveout. Biden has previously said he would need at least two more Democrats elected to the Senate to change the filibuster rules and pass abortion rights legislation.\n\nBiden’s promise to prioritize abortion in the new legislative term is an indication he is exhausting executive steps to protect those rights, even as some activists call for more action. The White House was accused of being caught flat-footed on the issue in the spring, despite a draft of the opinion striking down Roe v. Wade leaking more than a month before it was officially decided.\n\nBiden has signed an executive order defending the ability to cross state borders to obtain an abortion, sought to ensure access to medication abortion and issued a reminder to universities last month that they cannot discriminate on basis of pregnancy. But he has stopped short of declaring a public health emergency, which some activists have called for, and ruled out other options like allowing use of federal lands for abortion.\n\nThe White House has been skeptical that some of those steps would prove effective, and has been wary of provoking legal battles. Even before the Supreme Court ruled, White House officials were open in acknowledging there was little they could do to unilaterally restore the nationwide right to abortion.\n\nInstead, Biden and other top officials have cast abortion rights as a moral question to voters.\n\nIn remarks at the DNC event at Howard Theatre in Washington, DC, Biden spoke broadly about what he sees as the choice voters confront in the midterms between Republicans who are pushing for a national abortion ban and going after doctors who perform abortion services, versus Democrats who want to codify Roe v. Wade.\n\nAn official also said that the context they want to keep making clear with Biden’s speech Tuesday is that “nearly half the states in the United States have either passed a ban on abortion or will shortly and in many states, abortion is already banned even in cases of rape and incest.”\n\nSince the Supreme Court ruling earlier this year, Democrats have hoped that abortion rights would galvanize and mobilize voters and have seen some signs of this dynamic.\n\nFor example, 50% of registered voters in a recent Kaiser Family Foundation survey said the Supreme Court’s decision has made them more motivated to vote next month – up 7 percentage points from July, when the same question was asked just a few weeks after the ruling came down. About half of voters in states with full abortion bans also said their states’ abortion laws have made them more motivated to vote.\n\nWomen are especially motivated by the Supreme Court decision, the new survey found: About 3 in 5 women ages 18 to 49 who said they are more likely to head to the polls next month cited the overturning of Roe as a motivating factor.\n\nHowever, a recent CNN/SSRS poll found that the economy remains the central focus for voters, with 90% of them saying it was extremely or very important to their vote. Fewer – 72% – said the same about abortion.\n\nAnd a New York Times/Sienna poll showed that likely voters see the economy (26%) and inflation (18%) as the most important problem facing the country, with just 5% picking abortion as their top issue.\n\nThe economy and inflation take on added importance in competitive congressional districts. While 59% of registered voters nationally called the economy extremely important to their vote, that rose to 67% in those districts, and the share calling inflation that important rose from 56% to 64%.\n\nAbortion has been a complicated issue for the President, who has witnessed the changing politics around it over the half-century span of his career and reckoned with personal qualms rooted in his Catholic faith. As a candidate in 2019, Biden reversed his long-held support for an amendment preventing federal funds from being used for abortions.\n\nAs his administration unveiled new steps to enhance abortion protections earlier this month, Biden said he would not “sit by and let Republicans throughout the country enact extreme policies.”\n\nThe White House has seized on a proposal from Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina that would impose a federal ban on most abortions at 15 weeks of pregnancy. At a Democratic fundraiser in New York City last month, the President described Graham’s bill as emblematic of Republicans becoming “more extreme in their positions.”\n\nAs the midterm elections approach, Biden has argued that voters need to elect more Democrats in order to codify the protections of Roe v. Wade into law. He’s also pledged to veto any bill that would ban abortions on the federal level if Republicans take control of Congress.\n\nMore than a dozen states have seen abortions bans come into effect since the Dobbs ruling, affecting nearly 30 million women of reproductive age.", "authors": ["Mj Lee Jeremy Diamond Kevin Liptak", "Mj Lee", "Jeremy Diamond", "Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/10/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/02/politics/biden-speech-democracy-dc/index.html", "title": "Biden sends a stark warning about political violence ahead of ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Wednesday delivered a stark warning to Americans that the future of the nation’s democracy could rest on next week’s midterm elections, an urgent appeal coming six days before final ballots are cast in a contest the president framed in nearly existential terms.\n\n“We can’t take democracy for granted any longer,” the president said from Union Station in Washington, blocks from the US Capitol where a mob attempted to interrupt the certification of the 2020 election.\n\nIt was a sharp message to Americans considering sitting out next week’s congressional elections that the very future of the country was at stake. Biden suggested the preponderance of candidates for office at every level of government who have denied the results of the last presidential contest was red-flashing warning signal for the country.\n\n“As I stand here today, there are candidates running for every level of office in America – for governor, for Congress, for attorney general, for secretary of state who won’t commit to accepting the results of the elections they’re in,” Biden said. “That is the path to chaos in America. It’s unprecedented. It’s unlawful. And it is un-American.”\n\nBiden’s speech placed blame for the dire national situation squarely at the feet of his predecessor, Donald Trump, accusing the former president of cultivating a lie that has metastasized into a web of conspiracies that has already resulted in targeted violence.\n\n“This intimidation, this violence against Democrats, Republicans and non-partisan officials just doing their jobs, is the consequence of lies told for power and profit, lies of conspiracy and malice, lies repeated over and over to generate a cycle of anger, hate, vitriol and even violence,” Biden said. “In this moment, we have to confront those lies with the truth, the very future of our nation depends on it.”\n\n“American democracy is under attack because the defeated former president … refuses to accept the will of the people,” Biden said.\n\nThe speech – a political event hosted by the Democratic National Committee, not the White House – underscored the points Biden has been making for weeks since a prime time speech in Philadelphia. Yet it diverged from the central focus of Democrats’ closing midterm message, which has been a brighter portrait of economic recovery.\n\nBiden’s message Wednesday was anything but optimistic, even as he remained hopeful that Americans would reject the menacing forces he described. Aides said Biden was propelled to deliver the address after an attack last week on the husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi by an intruder who, according to his social media, wallowed in right-wing conspiracies, including about election fraud.\n\nBiden made sure to note that most Americans, and even most Republicans, would not resort to violence. But he said those who would have outsized influence.\n\n“I believe the voices excusing or calling for violence and intimidation are a distinct minority in America,” Biden said. “But they’re loud and they are determined.”\n\nBiden and his team had been contemplating giving a speech on the topic of democracy for some time, but their decision-making in recent days had been shaped by what they’ve viewed as a surge in anti-democratic rhetoric and threats of violence. But the attack on Paul Pelosi deeply alarmed Biden and his top advisers; the shocking home intrusion and attack on Pelosi landed the 82-year-old in the hospital for surgery and he has since been recovering from a skull fracture, among other injuries.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Prosecutors: Attacker woke Pelosi, stood by his bedside 03:07 - Source: CNN\n\nAdvisers said ahead of the speech that Biden felt that it would be important for him to directly condemn these kinds of threats and acts of violence.\n\nThe theme of protecting the soul of the nation – and the pillars of the country’s democratic system – were central to Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign. The president has since spoken about these topics throughout his presidency, but Wednesday’s speech marked an effort to emphatically underscore what is at stake heading into the midterms.\n\nDefense of democracy has been an animating feature of Biden’s thinking this political season and has emerged more abundantly in his off-camera conversations with Democrats. The day before his speech in Washington, Biden warned a group of Democratic donors in Florida that “democracy is on the ballot” this year – and offered something of a preview of his message for a day later.\n\n“How can you say that you in fact care about democracy when you deny the existence of a win? The only way you could win is either you win or the other guy cheated,” he said at the event, held in an oceanfront backyard of a mansion in Golden Beach, Florida.\n\n“This has not happened since the Civil War. It sounds like hyperbole, but it hadn’t happened since then, as bad as it is now,” he said.\n\nBiden’s Civil War reference hardly appeared coincidental; he was seen this week carrying a copy of historian Jon Meacham’s new book, “And There Was Light: Abraham Lincoln and the American Struggle,” which explores how America’s 16th president confronted secession and threats to democracy.\n\nMeacham is an informal adviser to Biden and has helped write some of his most high-profile speeches.\n\nBiden previously laid out the stakes two months ago, traveling to Philadelphia, where he delivered an urgent rebuke of Trump and those aligned with his attempts to undermine democracy.\n\n“As I stand here tonight, equality and democracy are under assault,” Biden said at the time. “We do ourselves no favor to pretend otherwise.”\n\nBiden starkly warned at the time about what he called “an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic.”", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak Mj Lee Betsy Klein Phil Mattingly", "Kevin Liptak", "Mj Lee", "Betsy Klein", "Phil Mattingly"], "publish_date": "2022/11/02"}]}

Being the mother of democracy gives India the inherent power to scale new heights.”\n\nModi’s words came as millions celebrated 75 years of Indian independence since the stroke of midnight on August 15, 1947 that ended nearly 200 years of British colonial rule.\n\nAt the time, India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru said the country was on a path of revival and renaissance.\n\n“A moment comes, which comes but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new,” Nehru said. “When an age ends, and when the soul of a nation, long suppressed, finds utterance.”\n\nSeventy-five years later, the India of today is almost unrecognizable from that of Nehru’s time.\n\nSince gaining independence, India has built one of the world’s fastest growing economies, is home to some of the world’s richest people, and according to the United Nations, its population will soon surpass China’s as the world’s largest.\n\nBut despite the nation’s surging wealth, poverty remains a daily reality for millions of Indians and significant challenges remain for a diverse and growing nation of disparate regions, languages, and faiths.\n\nWomen in traditional attire participate in a rally to mark the 75th anniversay of India's Independence Day in Mumbai, India, on August 14, 2022.

And the Indian diaspora has spread far and wide, studying at international universities and occupying senior roles in some of the world’s biggest tech companies, including Google chief executive Sundar Pichai, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Twitter boss Parag Agrawal.\n\nMuch of this transformation was prompted by the “pathbreaking reforms” of the 1990s, when then Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao and his Finance Minister Manmohan Singh opened the country to foreign investment after an acute debt crisis and soaring inflation forced a rethink of socialist Nehru’s model of protectionism and state intervention.\n\nThe reforms helped turbocharge investment from American, Japanese and Southeast Asian firms in major cities including Mumbai, the financial capital, Chennai and Hyderabad.\n\nThe result is that today, the southern city of Bengaluru – dubbed “India’s Silicon Valley” – is one of the region’s biggest tech hubs.\n\nAt the same time, India has seen a proliferation of billionaires – it is now home to more than 100, up from just nine at the turn of the millennium. Among them are infrastructure tycoon Gautam Adani, whose net worth is more than $130 billion, according to Forbes, and Mukesh Ambani, founder of Reliance Industries, who’s worth about $95 billion.\n\nBut critics say the rise of such ultra-wealth highlights how inequality remains even long after the end of colonialism – with the country’s richest 10% controlling 80% of the nation’s wealth in 2017, according to Oxfam. On the streets, that translates into a harsh reality, where slums line pavements beneath high-rise buildings and children dressed in tattered clothes routinely beg for money.\n\nBut Rohan Venkat, a consultant with Indian think tank Centre for Policy Research, says India’s broader economic gains as an independent nation shows how it has confounded the skeptics of 75 years ago.\n\nSlums line the shore near the up-market neighborhood of Cuffe Parade, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. Education Images/Universal Images Group/Getty Images\n\n“In a broad sense, the image of India (post independence) was that it was an exceedingly poor place,” said Venkat.\n\n“Certainly the image of India (to the West) was heavily overlaid by Orientalist tropes – your snake charmers, little villages. Some of these were not entirely off the mark … but a lot of it was simple stereotyping.\n\nSince then, India’s trajectory has been “exceptional,” Venkat said.\n\n“To witness the largest transfer (of power) from an elite ruling the state, to now becoming a complete universal franchise … we are looking at an incredible political and democratic experiment that is unique.”\n\nRise of a geopolitical giant\n\nFor years after independence, India’s international relations were defined by its policy of non-alignment, the Cold War era stance favored by Nehru that avoided siding with either the United States or the Soviet Union.\n\nNehru played a leading role in the movement, which he saw as a way for developing countries to reject colonialism and imperialism and avoid being dragged into a conflict they had little interest in.\n\nThat stance did not prove popular with Washington, preventing closer ties and marring Nehru’s debut trip to the US in October 1949 to meet President Harry S. Truman. During the 1960s the relationship became further strained as India accepted economic and military assistance from the Soviets and this frostiness largely remained until 2000, when President Bill Clinton’s visit to India prompted a reconciliation.\n\nToday, while India remains technically non-aligned, Washington’s need to balance the rise of China has led it to court New Delhi as a key partner in the increasingly active security grouping known as the Quad.\n\nIndian Border Security Force soldiers hold the national flag during a motorbike rally ahead of the 75th anniversary of country's independence at the India-Pakistan border outpost in Panjgrain, about 60km from Amritsar on August 10, 2022. Narinder Nanu/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe grouping, which also includes Japan and Australia, is widely perceived as a way of countering China’s growing military and economic might and its increasingly aggressive territorial claims in the Asia Pacific.\n\nIndia, meanwhile, has its own reasons for wanting to counterbalance Chinese influence, not least among them its disputed Himalayan border, where more than 20 Indian troops were killed in a bloody battle with Chinese counterparts in June 2020. In October, the US and India will hold a joint military exercise less than 100 kilometers (62 miles) from that disputed border.\n\nAs Happymon Jacob, an associate professor of diplomacy and disarmament at the Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, put it: “India has been able to assert itself on the world stage because of the nature of international politics today and the political and diplomatic military capital that has been put in place by previous governments.”\n\nPart of India’s growing geopolitical clout is due to its growing military expenditure, which New Delhi has ramped up to counter perceived threats from both China and its nuclear-armed neighbor, Pakistan.\n\nFollowing their separation in 1947, relations between India and Pakistan have been in a near constant state of agitation, leading to several wars, involving thousands of casualties and numerous skirmishes across the Line of Control in the contested Kashmir region.\n\nIn 1947, India’s net defense expenditure was just 927 million rupees – about $12 million in today’s money. By 2021, its military expenditure was $76.6 billion, according to a report from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute – making it the third highest military spender globally, behind only China and the US.\n\nAmbitions on the world stage\n\nOutside economics and geopolitics, India’s growing wealth is feeding its ambitions in fields as diverse as sport, culture and space.\n\nIn 2017, the country broke a world record when it launched 104 satellites in one mission, while in 2019, Prime Minister Modi announced that India had shot down one of its own satellites in a military show of force, making it one of only four countries to have achieved that feat.\n\nLater that year, the country attempted to land a spacecraft on the moon. Though the historic attempt failed, it was widely seen as a statement of intent.\n\nA child touches a model of Indian mission to the moon. Pallava Bagla/Corbis News/Getty Images\n\nLast year, the country spent almost $2 billion on its space program, according to McKinsey, trailing the biggest spenders, the US and China, by some margin, but India’s ambitions in space are growing. In 2023, India is expected to launch its first manned space mission.\n\nThe country is also using its growing wealth to boost its sporting prospects, spending $297.7 million in 2019 before the spread of Covid-19.\n\nNeeraj Chopra at the medal presentation ceremony after winning the gold medal in the men's javelin competition during Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympic Games on August 7th, 2021. Tim Clayton/Corbis/Getty Images\n\nThe Indian Premier League – the country’s flagship cricket tournament launched in 2007 – has become the second most valuable sports league in the world in terms of per-match value, according to Jay Shah, secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, after selling its media rights for $6.2 billion in June.\n\nAnd Bollywood, India’s glittering multibillion dollar film industry, continues to pull in fans worldwide, catapulting local names into global superstars attracting millions of followers on social media. Between them, actresses Priyanka Chopra and Deepika Padukone have almost 150 million followers on Instagram.\n\n“India is a strong country. It’s an aggressive player,” said Shruti Kapilla, a professor of Indian history and global political thought at Cambridge University.\n\n“In the last couple of decades, things have shifted. Indian culture has become a major story.”\n\nChallenges and the future\n\nBut for all of India’s successes, challenges remain as Modi seeks to “break the vicious circle of poverty.”\n\nDespite India’s large and growing GDP, it remains a “deeply poor” country on some measures and that, consultant Venkat said, is a “tremendous concern.”\n\nAs recently as 2017, about 60% of India’s nearly 1.3 billion people were living on less than $3.10 a day, according to the World Bank, and women still face widespread discrimination in the deeply parochial country.\n\nViolence against women and girls has made international headlines in a country where allegations of rape are often underreported, due to the lack of legal recourse for alleged attackers through a legal system that’s notoriously slow.\n\n“Many of India’s fundamental challenges remain what they were at the time of independence in some ways, at different parameters and scale,” Venkat said.\n\nIndia is also on the front line of the climate crisis.\n\nRecent heat waves – such as in April when average maximum temperatures in parts of the country soared to record levels and New Delhi saw seven consecutive days over 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) – have tested the limit of human survivability, experts say.\n\nAnd it’s the country’s poorest people who are set to suffer the most, as they work outside in oppressive heat, with limited access to cooling technologies that health experts say is needed to contend with rising temperatures.\n\nAnd as the heat rises on the land, political pressure has grown with fears that the secular fabric of the country and its democracy are being eroded under the leadership of Modi, whom critics accuse of fueling a wave of Hindu nationalism that has left many of the country’s 200 million Muslims living in fear.\n\nMany states run by his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have introduced legislation critics say is deeply rooted in Hindutva ideology, which seeks to transform India into the land of the Hindus. And there has been an alarming rise in support for extremist Hindu groups in recent years, analysts say – including some that have openly called for genocide against the country’s Muslims.\n\nAt the same time, the arrests of numerous journalists in recent years have led to concerns the BJP is using colonial-era laws to quash criticism. In 2022, India slipped to number 150 on the Press Freedom Index published by Reporters Without Borders – its lowest position ever.\n\n“The challenges now are about India’s nature of democracy,” Kapilla said. “India is going through a major, contentious change at the fundamental political level.”\n\nSeventy-five years on, Nehru’s observation that “freedom and power bring responsibility” continue to ring true.\n\nIndia’s first 75 years ensured its survival, but in the next 75 years it needs to navigate immense challenges to become a truly global leader, and not just in terms of population, said Venkat, from the Centre for Policy Research.\n\n“Although (India) may end up being the world’s fastest growing major country over the next few years, it will still be miles behind its neighbor in China, or getting close to what it had hoped to achieve at this point, which was double digit growth.”\n\n“So the challenges are immediate and all over the place, chief among them being how to ensure its prosperity,” Venkat said.", "authors": ["Rhea Mogul"], "publish_date": "2022/08/14"}]}

Rounding out the top 10 behind the U.S. among 137 countries are Singapore, the Netherlands, Germany, Hong Kong, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Japan and Finland.\n\nThe U.S. moved up from third place last year. It lost its top status during the financial crisis and recession of 2007-09, and fell as low as No. 7 in 2012-2013 before steadily climbing the past few years.\n\nAmong the country’s biggest strengths are its ability to innovate, which relies on close collaboration between businesses and universities in research and development, says Daniel Gomez Gaviria, the forum’s head of competitiveness research and author of the report. Innovation has loomed as an increasingly more significant factor in the global economy in recent years, he says.\n\nMore:Small firms seek level playing field in tax reform\n\nMore:Why the U.S. economy lags: It's the politics, stupid\n\nMore:Economists see slower growth for U.S. than Trump does\n\n“The big strength of the U.S. is its innovation and business sophistication,” which refers to the efficient ways the country makes products and delivers them to customers, Gaviria says. The U.S. moved up to seventh and sixth places, respectively, in market efficiency and technological readiness, the report says.\n\nThe nation’s ranking was also lifted by the forum’s spring CEO survey, which appeared to reflect more optimism based on President Trump’s plans to cut taxes and regulations. Tax rates and tax regulations are still the two biggest problems identified by the CEOs.\n\nBut while the nation advanced in health and primary education (from 29 to 19) and in the strength of its institutions (from 27 to 20), it remains relatively weak in those categories. Institutions include areas such as the burden of government regulation, government corruption, public trust in politicians and corporate ethics.\n\nThe U.S. also fell 12 spots to 83 in its macroeconomic environment. While the country still has the world’s most prosperous economy, it’s weighed down by the level of government debt and its credit rating, among other factors.\n\nIn its broader analysis of the global economy, the forum said that 10 years after the global financial crisis, capital requirements have helped make banks sturdier, but they haven’t fully recovered. There’s still too much private-sector debt and the top global banks hold a disproportionate share of financial assets, with concentration “continuing to increase in the United States, China and some European countries.”\n\nIn the U.S. a “new wave of deregulation appears to be underway,” as the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress seek to dismantle major portions of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. Meanwhile, nonperforming loans are rising in Asia. And as a result of high public debt and low interest rates, governments and central banks “have less flexibility to respond to crises than they did 10 years ago.”\n\nAnd while innovation in emerging markets, particularly Asia, is rising, many consumers aren’t yet realizing the benefits, the study says.\n\nThe report also encourages countries, especially those in Europe, to continue passing labor market reforms that make it easier to hire and fire workers, for example, which can boost the economy and lower unemployment. Such changes need not curtail worker protections, the report says.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/09/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personal-finance/susan-tompor/2023/03/13/comerica-bank-stocks-silicon-valley-bank/70002242007/", "title": "Comerica, other bank stocks hit after Silicon Valley Bank failure", "text": "The Federal Reserve, the U.S. Treasury and the FDIC joined forces Sunday evening to engineer a swift \"Top Gun\" move to shoot down any threat to the economy and U.S. banking system.\n\nFriday's dramatic collapse of tech lender Silicon Valley Bank — the nation's 16th largest bank but hardly a household name in the heartland — put Washington on high alert. Suddenly, regulators, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., faced the largest bank failure since the 2008 financial meltdown.\n\nPolicymakers needed to act quickly to \"forestall a loss of confidence in the banking system and stem any bank runs,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's.\n\nZandi called the troubles that led to the sudden failure at Silicon Valley Bank \"largely idiosyncratic to the bank.\" Yet the bank's failure, he said, \"threatened to set off a classic run on the entire banking system as depositors lost faith in the system.\"\n\nOn Monday morning, Zandi said he did not think that Silicon Valley Bank's failure will cause difficulty for American households overall, thanks to the aggressive policy response Sunday.\n\nMore:Silicon Valley Bank assets seized by FDIC in largest bank failure since 2008\n\nMore:Online savings accounts, CDs are tempting while interest rates are high\n\nMore:Don't panic: The 'too big to fail' banks – yes, likely your bank – have ample liquidity\n\nThe emergency measures taken reassured much of Wall Street on Monday but no doubt raised questions about what's next as experts digest what went wrong in California.\n\nYou don't know what you don't know when Wall Street hits a pothole like this one, especially one involving banking. The monumental savings and loan crisis evolved rather slowly over time in the 1980s but ultimately was dubbed one of the contributing factors in triggering the 1990-91 recession.\n\nMany say the Federal Reserve, which meets next week, could put further rate hikes on hold for a bit in light of this latest uncertainty.\n\nThe stock market did not collapse in early trading Monday, though bank stocks felt serious pain. Auto stocks got hit a bit harder than the rest of the market, too.\n\nComerica had fallen by 40.55% in trading at one point Monday morning but it regained some ground.\n\nComerica closed at $42.54 a share, down 27.67% or $16.27 a share.\n\nHuntington Bancshares saw its stock fall 16.83% Monday to close at $11.12 a share, down $2.25 a share.\n\nAlly Financial fell 10.73% on Monday and closed at $23.05 a share, down $2.77 a share.\n\nAuto stocks did far better than regional banks but still fell slightly early Monday on economic fears.\n\nFord closed at $12.03 a share Monday, down 7 cents a share or 0.58%.\n\nGeneral Motors closed at $35.76 a share, down 76 cents or down 2.08%.\n\nStellantis closed at $17.35 a share, down 25 cents or down 1.42%.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down slightly Monday after trading in positive territory for much of the day. The Dow closed at 31,819.14 points, down 0.28% or 90.50 points.\n\nDavid Whiston, a senior autos equity analyst for Morningstar Inc., said he did not see any impact to the auto industry's efforts to build and sell more electric vehicles as a result of the troubled banking situation. He noted that general fears of uncertainty could be driving Monday morning's decline for auto stocks.\n\nBank stocks will feel pressure as investors try to figure out how deep the problems might be for some other lenders, as the economy deals with inflation and the uncertainty triggered by the collapse at Silicon Valley Bank, which is based in Santa Clara, California.\n\nDavid Sowerby, managing director and portfolio manager for Ancora Advisors in Bloomfield Hills, said a few factors seem to causing significant drops Monday in Comerica's stock price, including concerns about the bank's exposure to Northern California's tech economy. The Federal Reserve said it is creating a new program to safeguard banks affected by the market instability of the Silicon Valley Bank failure.\n\nRegulators took emergency moves to protect all deposits at Silicon Valley Bank, enabling depositors to access their money Monday. Shareholders and certain unsecured debtholders will not be protected.\n\nRegulators also said additional funding will be made available to eligible depository institutions to help assure banks are able to meet the needs of all their depositors.\n\nOne trouble spot for Silicon Valley Bank was what experts call an \"asset-liability mismatch.\" Loans are an asset for banks and Silicon Valley Bank had made a heavy bet on longer-term mortgage securities with more than 10 years to maturity. As interest rates rose, those securities lost value. The building buzz about the bank's troubles ulitimately led to customers trying to withdraw $42 billion last Thursday, causing a run on the bank.\n\n\"The precipitous deposit withdrawal has caused the bank to be incapable of paying its obligations as they come due, and the bank is now insolvent,\" according to a California regulatory filing Friday. Regulators shut the bank Friday.\n\nSome called it \"a hysteria-induced bank run\" in the venture capital community, according to a CNBC report.\n\nNow, as is often the case in these things, everyone wonders: Who is next?\n\nSowerby noted that the ongoing concern is how other banks have deployed their asset liability management as interest rates have risen. What's the impact of higher rates on the market value of assets, such as mortgages and U.S. Treasuries?\n\nAnd Sowerby said there's another important question: How \"sticky\" are deposits? Does a bank have savers who have money in 12-month to 36-month certificates of deposit that cannot easily leave the bank without penalty? Or, Sowerby asked, are they dealing with a large amount of more liquid deposits, which are rate sensitive and can leave the bank quickly?\n\nRegional banks, such as KeyCorp, Comerica, Fifth Third and Huntington, saw stocks tumble into double-digit losses in trading Monday over growing concerns about the health of such players next to giant banks, such as JPMorgan Chase, which was down only 1.62% Monday afternoon in trading.\n\nDaniil Manaenkov, U.S. forecasting specialist for the U-M Research Seminar in Quantitative Economics, said that some numbers peg potential banking debt portfolio losses from sharply higher rates at around $620 billion, based on FDIC data.\n\nWhile that can sound large, he said, the extent of the problems could be much smaller. The full number is only relevant, he said, if there’s an unabated bank run that prompts banks to suddenly sell at a loss securities that would have been held to maturity.\n\nHe blamed much of the problem on economic policy during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“Too much money injected into the economy simultaneously increased deposits, drove short-term rates to zero, and reduced demand for loans. So, banks just did a ton more of the 'maturity transformation' — borrowing short, investing long,” Manaenkov said.\n\nSilicon Valley Bank’s portfolio was a lot more exposed to the tech sector, he said, which has been hurting for about a year.\n\nManaenkov said tech has been one of the few sectors to come under stress in this economy. But he said other areas, perhaps warehousing or commercial real estate loans, could face issues if regulators do not succeed in calming the markets.\n\nWhat does FDIC insurance cover typically?\n\nIndividual savers, of course, have more reason to start paying careful attention to how much money they keep in one particular bank. The standard deposit insurance is $250,000 per individual per bank for each account ownership category, according to the FDIC.\n\nIf a person has a certificate of deposit at Bank of Cash, for example, and has a certificate of deposit at Big Dollars Bank, the amounts are insured separately up to $250,000. But money deposited in separate branches of the same insured bank are not separately insured.\n\nOwnership categories matter if you're dealing with one bank. A customer who has multiple accounts at the same bank, the FDIC notes, may qualify for more than $250,000 in insurance coverage if specific rules are met. The FDIC lists detailed scenarios at its web site.\n\nIt took highly unusual emergency action in the Silicon Valley Bank situation to eventually offer protection for all depositors there.\n\nExpect more rumblings on Wall Street\n\nEveryday investors can expect more volatility in the stock market in the coming days, as we get more data on other economic concerns, such as inflation, too.\n\n\"Like an exhausted boxer in the late rounds, investors have been staggered by a flurry of destabilizing blows to confidence,\" wrote Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist for U.S. equities at CFRA Research in New York, in his report Monday morning.\n\nInvestors saw a stock selloff in February, fears in March that the Fed might raise rates even higher as inflation remains stubborn and now the shock of trouble for some regional banks. State regulators closed New York-based Signature Bank on Sunday, the third largest failure in U.S. banking history.\n\nStovall said the latest anxiety puts more pressure on small cap stocks, as investors question whether banks will be willing to lend to smaller, riskier companies.\n\nAny reverberations of a recession in tech or California will likely be felt across the U.S., including Michigan, he said, but possibly in a more muted manner.\n\n\"If there is a recession, it will likely be dated as starting in the second quarter of 2023,\" Stovall said. He noted that economists at his firm are not projecting a recession, but the second quarter is projected to be the weakest quarter of the year.The Fed policy committee will meet March 21 and March 22 to determine the next rate hike to fight inflation. Earlier, some speculated that the Fed could raise rates by a quarter point next week. But last week, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's remarks on Capitol Hill indicated that the Fed could move higher than anticipated and many experts started to say that a half-point rate hike could be ahead in March.\n\nNow there's more doubt about what move the Fed will make next.\n\nCox Automotive Chief Economist Jonathan Smoke said new banking concerns may contain the ability of the Fed to get more aggressive with rate hikes this spring.\n\nThe Fed looks far less likely now to raise rates by 50 basis-points next week, Smoke said, and it's possible the Fed does not raise rates at all in March.\n\nHe noted that Treasury yields and interest rates have fallen in trading since last Thursday in response to the Silicon Valley Bank failure.\n\nZandi said the latest banking upheaval could cause the Fed to pause its interest rate hikes, which will \"take some pressure off financial markets and the economy, at least in the near term.\"\n\nContact Susan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com.

In recent weeks, Tennessee has broken daily records for coronavirus cases and Williamson County began requiring people to wear masks in public.\n\nThis month, she estimates, sales are down about 30% from a year ago and she’s roughly breaking even but believes better times lay ahead.\n\n“It’s been a rough several months,” says Davis, who used a forgivable federal loan to hold on to her 12 employees. “I’m just glad to be open.”\n\nBusiness owners like Davis are struggling to dig out of a massive hole in the economy, laid bare Thursday in a government report showing the nation’s gross domestic product contracted at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 32.9% in the second quarter, its worst performance on record.\n\nBut even as the economy takes two steps forward, infection surges across much of the country have set it a step back.\n\nThe backslide was exemplified in a separate report that the number of Americans filing initial jobless claims – a rough measure of layoffs – last week rose to 1.42 million, the second straight weekly increase after 15 weeks of declines. A stunning 54.1 million workers have sought unemployment benefits since March.\n\nMost of that turmoil in the labor market came during the economy's brutal economic slide in the April-June period. The free-fall was driven by a historic 34.6% pullback in consumer spending as states closed down restaurants, malls, movie theaters and other outlets, and Americans avoided public gathering spots and travel out of contagion fears. Nearly every corner of the economy was battered, including business investment, housing, trade and government outlays.\n\n\"The GDP numbers are mind-boggling,\" said Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.\n\nThe contraction followed a 5% slide in economic output in the first quarter.\n\nBut the nation’s steepest-ever recession is also expected to be the shortest, with consumer spending, job growth and other key measures bouncing back sharply in May and June as states began allowing businesses to reopen in phases and many employees were rehired.\n\nAbout $2.5 trillion in federal government aid also propped up spending, including forgivable loans to small businesses that retained or brought back workers, as well as $1,200 checks to individuals and a $600 supplement to weekly state unemployment benefits.\n\nEvery state was walloped last quarter, though ones that rely heavily on travel and tourism, such as Hawaii and Nevada, were hit hardest by the downturn, according to employment figures analyzed by economist Adam Kamins of Moody’s Analytics. Michigan, the heart of the nation’s auto industry, was slammed as consumers put off car purchases. And densely populated Northeast states struck by the most severe virus outbreaks – like New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts – absorbed among the heaviest economic losses as governors shut down earlier and residents stayed home.\n\nMeanwhile, more rural states with less virulent outbreaks, such as Idaho, Utah, Oklahoma, Arizona and Nebraska, were more insulated from economic damage, Kamins sajd. Those patterns are now largely reversing, with initially lax states suffering COVID-19 surges.\n\nRecent jumps in coronavirus cases across much of the South and West have led at least 20 states to pause or roll back reopening plans, dampening the anticipated recovery in the second half of the year. The number of hours worked in states such as Texas, Florida and Arizona recently has declined, according to Homebase, a supplier of employee scheduling software.\n\nAfter the nation recouped about a third of the 22 million jobs lost early in the crisis in May and June, a chunk of those gains could be erased in July with millions of jobs shed, said economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\n\nMany analysts still expect the hot-spot states to resume reopening after the outbreaks are tamed in the next month or so, helping America’s economy bounce back and dodge another recession. Scott Anderson, chief economist of Bank of the West, estimates the economy will grow an annual rate of 17.3% in the third quarter and 4.9% in the fourth quarter, assuming Congress passes another $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion stimulus package.\n\nWith some businesses closing for good and millions of workers laid off permanently, Barclays reckons the nation’s economic output won’t return to its pre-pandemic level until early 2022. And Moody’s Analytics figures a return to pre-pandemic employment levels won’t come until 2023.\n\n“Our business is slim to none right now,” said Michael Vander Hook, president of Freight Motion, a broker for truck shipments, “We typically would be growing at this time” of year as retailers stock goods for the holidays.\n\nBut Vander Hook said his business saw revenue fall 90% in April compared to a year ago before rebounding modestly in May. Still, it remains 70% below year-ago levels.\n\nSuppliers, he says, are shipping food to grocery stores but not much of other products. And with many small businesses going bankrupt, he sees little prospect of a noticeable pickup in coming months. Vander Hook used a federal loan to hold on to three of the five employees he had pre-pandemic but won’t be able to keep them without an upswing in business or more federal aid.\n\n“I can’t run at 30%,” he says.\n\nConsumer spending nosedives\n\nConsumer spending plummeted 34.6%, the largest drop on record, after sliding 6.9% in the first quarter. The state shutdowns and Americans’ contagion fears combined with massive layoffs, prompted shoppers to halt much of their discretionary outlays.\n\nConsumption makes up about 70% of economic activity.\n\nBusiness investment tanks\n\nBusiness investment sank a record 27%, after a 6.7% drop in the first quarter. The culprits were business and factory closures, along with uncertainty about the outbreak's economic effects. Spending on equipment such as computers and factory equipment dropped 37.7%, while outlays on buildings, oil rigs and other structures declined 34.9%.\n\nCompanies draw down inventories\n\nInstead of adding to their stockpiles, firms drew from existing supplies to meet sharply reduced demand, contributing nearly 4 percentage points to the drop in GDP.\n\nResidential investment plunges\n\nHousing construction and renovation broke a string of three straight quarterly increases, tumbling 38.7%. Despite historically low mortgage rates, the outbreak suspended construction projects and prompted homebuyers to stay on the sidelines.\n\nOverall, though, housing is the economy's biggest bright spot, with housing starts rebounding strongly in May and June after slumping in March and April as rock-bottom mortgage rates attracted buyers.\n\nGovernment spending rises\n\nGovernment outlays represented the biggest positive for the economy as federal spending jumped 17.4%, bolstered partly by the stimulus measures. The increase more than offset a 5.6% drop in state and local government spending amid falling tax and other revenue and school closures.\n\nTrade aids growth\n\nU.S. exports fell 64.1%, hammered by stricter lockdowns overseas than in the U.S., while imports decreased 53.4% as Americans substantially cut their spending amid the shutdowns.\n\nSince the drop in imports more than offset the decline in exports in absolute terms, the nation’s trade gap narrowed, adding slightly to economic growth.\n\nBottom line\n\nThe economy is already on the mend but faces a tortuous comeback in the face of virus flare-ups in parts of the country and the risk of a second COVID-19 wave in the fall. A more sustained rebound in consumer spending isn’t expected until a vaccine is available sometime next year and Americans are emboldened to travel and spend freely.\n\nEven then, deep bruises will linger as a result of permanently laid-off workers who will struggle to find new positions, or retire, and businesses that will never reopen.\n\n“We expect it will take years for that damage to be fully reversed,” said Andrew Hunter, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/07/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/07/business/beyond-meat-sales/index.html", "title": "What's gone wrong at Beyond Meat | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nA slew of problems have stalled the growth of Beyond Meat, once a darling of Wall Street whose top product became synonymous with plant-based burgers.\n\nSales have been declining, sliding 22.5% in the third quarter compared to the previous year, and the company has laid off over 20% of its global staff since August. After an extremely successful market debut in 2019, Beyond Meat (BYND) has lost favor with investors. The stock dropped about 77% so far this year.\n\nSome of the problems can be attributed to broader industry challenges. In the grocery store, interest in plant-based meats has waned as consumers, faced with inflation, focus on shopping for affordable basics.\n\nAt the same time, restaurant traffic is dipping. Cash-strapped customers are pulling back on dining out, making Beyond’s foodservice business more vulnerable. And Beyond is far from the only company to lay off staff as a possible recession looms.\n\nBeyond Meat's sales fell in the third quarter. Yuriko Nakao/Getty Images\n\nBut Beyond is facing some unique challenges.\n\nThe company recently parted ways with three members of its C-suite, one of whom allegedly bit someone’s nose. A recent LA Times report called into question the hygiene of a Beyond Meat facility in Pennsylvania, though the company stands by the cleanliness of the plant, saying that its “food safety protocols go above industry and regulatory standards.”\n\nAlso, a promising partnership with McDonald’s (MCD) has stalled in the United States. And fierce competition is squeezing sales, including in frozen, plant-based chicken, a category that is growing while refrigerated plant-based meat sales falter.\n\nThe company’s plan is to focus on cash flow and profitability rather than growth, and become more strategic in its restaurant and marketing initiatives, among other things.\n\n“Despite the current headwinds facing our business and category, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on the long-term growth and impact expected from our global brand,” a Beyond Meat spokesperson told CNN Business in response to a request for comment.\n\n“They’ve got a big task ahead of them,” said Peter Saleh, restaurant analyst at financial services firm BTIG. Next year will be about “trying to get their financials in order to a place where they can sustain themselves,” he added. “It’s a tall order.”\n\nWhere’s the McPlant?\n\nLast year, Beyond Meat announced a strategic partnership with McDonald’s, including working with the burger chain on the McPlant, a plant-based burger.\n\nSince then, the McPlant has been added to the McDonald’s menu permanently in some European markets.\n\nIn the US, McDonald’s (MCD) tested out the burger in some locations. But it hasn’t added the item to the menu, and it’s not clear if or when that will happen.\n\n“I don’t think it’s totally off the table, but I’m not sure that it’s going to be [Beyond’s] saving grace at this point,” said Saleh.\n\nBeyond has also lost its spot on the Dunkin’ menu. The coffee chain enthusiastically rolled out a breakfast sandwich with Beyond sausage nationally in 2019, but stopped working with Beyond last year.\n\nMcDonald's tested the McPlant, but has not added it permanently to US menus. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nBeyond still has plenty of partnerships with restaurants, but many of them are limited-time tests.\n\n“In the last 12 months, we have had 25 trials for permanent menu launches with nine distinct products,” said Beyond CEO Ethan Brown during a November analyst call discussing the company’s third-quarter results.\n\nBrown positioned the launches as long-term investments, saying they won’t generate big sales in the short term but should pay off eventually. But getting a permanent menu spot might be challenging, noted Kathryn Fenner, principal at foodservice consulting firm Technomic.\n\n“Even if they sell, say 30 to 40 of these plant-based burgers a day … that still pales in comparison to their traditional proteins,” she said, speaking about plant-based burgers in general. And these days, making a limited-time offer permanent is a tough sell because operators have been slimming down their menus, she noted.\n\nMeanwhile, Burger King continues to sell the Impossible Whopper nationally. “We haven’t been experiencing what Beyond Meat and some of the other brands in the space have reported,” said Impossible foods spokesperson Keely Sulprizio. Impossible is private and is not required to share its sales data publicly.\n\nIn the grocery store, Beyond is facing a swell of competition.\n\nCompetition heats up\n\nBeyond has embraced competition in the past. But now, rivals are interfering with its bottom line.\n\n“We believe that healthy competition within plant-based meat is a good thing as it brings investment in marketing to the category,” said Brown during the November analyst call.\n\n“However, in the current environment, we are not seeing this benefit,” he said. “Instead, more companies are pursuing the same or fewer consumers.” Brown said Beyond is the leader in refrigerated plant-based meat, and that he expects some brands to pull back or consolidate in the future.\n\nIt’s true that the plant-based meat pie is smaller these days. Retail sales of meat alternatives fell about 12% in the year through November 6, according to data from IRI. Ground plant-based meat fell about 19%, and patties were down 30% in that period.\n\nBut frozen chicken alternatives are growing. Strips and cutlets sales increased about 16% and nuggets jumped nearly 28%.\n\n“Frozen plant-based chicken is the largest single subcategory in all of plant-based meats and continues to grow at a double-digit pace,” said Brown during the analyst call. “So we are pleased to be expanding our presence of additional chicken items.”\n\nBeyond Meat introduced plant-based chicken strips in retail in 2014, but pulled the product in 2019. It launched a retooled version, Beyond Chicken Tenders, in stores in 2021, and has built its plant-based chicken portfolio since then.\n\nBut in the few years Beyond’s product was off the market, new entrants rushed into the space.\n\nNuggs, a plant-based chicken nugget made by startup Simulate, has made a splash online thanks to its bold packaging over the last few years and has been expanding in retail.\n\nDaring, another plant-based chicken company, launched its product in the US in 2020. Daring’s chicken alternative became available at Whole Foods last year. Impossible and other legacy brands have offerings, as well.\n\n“Plant-based chicken is a good growth category,” said Saleh. “I would have liked to have seen [Beyond] double down.”", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/12/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/07/economy/boris-johnson-resignation-economy/index.html", "title": "Boris Johnson leaves world's fifth biggest economy in crisis", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nBoris Johnson was ultimately forced to resign as UK prime minister Thursday as dozens of members of his party quit the government after one ethics scandal too many.\n\nBut his popularity outside parliament has also been badly dented by surging inflation and stagnation in the British economy, a cost-of-living crisis that threatens to impoverish millions more people this winter, and the risk of a damaging trade war with the European Union.\n\nUK stocks rose in response to reports that Johnson was preparing to stand down, and the pound gained 0.75% to trade at $1.20 — recovering slightly from two-year lows hit earlier this week.\n\n“Make no mistake however, the [pound] remains severely weak due to the dire state of the UK economy which is underperforming its peers, [and] likely to enter into a recession,” wrote Walid Koudmani, chief market analyst at broker XTB, in a note to clients.\n\nWhoever emerges from the rubble of his administration as new leader of the Conservative Party and the country, they face a series of extraordinary economic and financial challenges.\n\nThe UK has the highest inflation in the G7…\n\nEvery major economy has suffered from the pandemic’s lingering effects on supply chains, and the shock to energy and food costs delivered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February.\n\nBut the United Kingdom has it worse than most of its peers. Inflation hit a 40-year high of 9.1% in May, the highest among the G7 leading economies — and is forecast to climb above 11% later this year despite a series of interest rate hikes.\n\nThe knock-on effects of Brexit — Johnson’s signature achievement in government — have exacerbated crippling labor shortages and increased operating costs for businesses. The cost of imports has also been driven higher by a sharp fall in the value of the pound this year.\n\nThe rise in food and fuel prices has created the worst cost-of-living crisis in decades, forcing lower-income households to choose between “heating and eating,” a rallying cry for anti-poverty campaigners as they demand more government support.\n\nJohnson’s government promised £400 ($502) in grants per family to help out the millions of people struggling to pay their energy bills. It also bowed to pressure last month and unveiled a £5 billion ($6.3 billion) tax on the windfall profits of oil and gas companies.\n\nBut those efforts are being swallowed up. Disposable incomes are on track for the second biggest fall since records began in 1964, according to the Bank of England, driven by the soaring cost of energy and food. And those bills are about to get a lot worse.\n\nAnnual average household energy bills could rise by about 50% to £3,000 ($3,600) this winter when a cap on the maximum price suppliers can charge customers is revised in the fall. The regulator already raised the cap by a whopping 54% in April.\n\nBritish households have been left particularly exposed by a persistent decline in living standards. Typical wages are no higher today than they were before the 2008 financial crisis, the Resolution Foundation said on Monday.\n\n“Britain’s poor recent record on living standards — notably the complete collapse of income growth for poor households over the past 20 years — must be turned around in the decade ahead,” said Adam Corlett, principal economist at the foundation.\n\nAnd is heading for the lowest growth…\n\nWithout stronger growth, that pay slump won’t be reversed. And there’s little prospect of that any time soon. Around the world, once-robust recoveries are being dragged down. But the United Kingdom is in a particularly bad spot, with a recession looming.\n\nThe world’s fifth-biggest economy ground to a halt in February and started shrinking in March. The decline accelerated in April, when GDP is estimated to have fallen by 0.3%, with all three major sectors of the economy — services, manufacturing and construction — going backwards, according to the Office for National Statistics. Retail sales fell in May for the second consecutive month.\n\nThere’s more bad news ahead. In a report on financial stability published earlier this week, the Bank of England said that the outlook for the UK economy had “deteriorated materially.”\n\nThe Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development forecast last month that the UK economy was heading to stagnation, with zero growth in GDP forecast for 2023. That would be the worst performance in the G7 next year.\n\nWeak growth is bad news for government debt, which has shot up to more than 90% of GDP as a result of measures taken to help businesses and households cope with the pandemic and the energy crisis.\n\nThrow in the pressures of an aging population and UK public debt is on “an unsustainable path and projected to surpass 250% of GDP over the long term,” the government’s fiscal watchdog — the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) — said on Friday.\n\nThat means there’s little room for the next prime minister to make big tax cuts or spending pledges.\n\n“This all adds up to a challenging outlook for this and future governments as they steer the UK economy and public finances in the years ahead,” the OBR added.\n\n… while Brexit hasn’t delivered\n\nJohnson succeeded where his predecessor, Theresa May, failed by “getting Brexit done.” But the break with the European Union hasn’t delivered the boost to trade that he and other Brexit advocates promised.\n\nThe United Kingdom missed out on much of the recovery in global trade since the pandemic, the OBR concluded in March.\n\nFor many businesses, the tariff-free trade deal Johnson signed with EU leaders less than two years ago has caused a huge increase in customs paperwork, making it harder for them to sell to their biggest export market and increasing the cost of imports. And deals signed with other countries barely move the needle.\n\n“While additional trade with other counties could offset some of the decline in trade with the EU, none of the agreements concluded to date are of a sufficient scale to have a material impact on our forecast,” the OBR stated.\n\nOfficial data published last week showed the UK balance of payments deficit soared to 8.3% of GDP in the first quarter of 2022, meaning the country is having to rely ever more heavily on foreign investment to make up for the fact that the country is importing far more than it exports.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the pound has been hammered this year, not helped by Johnson’s threat to tear up part of the Brexit treaty he signed. That has poisoned relations with EU leaders, and brought talk of retaliation that could escalate to a trade war that would likely hurt the United Kingdom the most.\n\n“Judging by the early line-up of potential successors to Johnson, the balance of potential outcomes would tilt towards less strained relations with the EU,” noted Kallum Pickering at Berenberg.\n\n“Even the ardent Brexiteer candidates … are less of the populist variety than Johnson. This suggests that, while it is unclear whether UK-EU relations would improve a bit or a lot, the overall situation stands to be much calmer.”", "authors": ["Mark Thompson"], "publish_date": "2022/07/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/02/07/biden-state-of-the-union-sotu-address-updates/11204405002/", "title": "State of the Union recap: Biden tells Americans economy roaring ...", "text": "WASHINGTON, D.C — President Joe Biden took credit Tuesday for what he said was the country's economic revival while pushing an agenda of reducing prescription drug costs, protecting abortion rights and banning assault weapons.\n\nThe economy was reeling two years ago, Biden said in his second State of the Union address delivered in a packed House chamber.

Children orphaned. Empty chairs at the dining room table. We remember them, and we remain vigilant,” he said.\n\nBiden said it was important to remain vigilant and monitor dozens of variants and support new vaccines and treatments. He urged Congress to fund these efforts and keep America safe.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nThe COVID emergency declaration is ending:What it means for tests, vaccines, treatment\n\nBiden: Police departments 'must be held accountable'\n\nSaying Tyre Nichols’ mother wants something good to come from his death at the hands of police officers in Memphis, Biden called for police reform.\n\n“When police officers or departments violate the public trust, they must be held accountable,” he said.\n\nBiden also pointed to an executive order he signed affecting federal officers that banned chokeholds, restricted no-knock warrants, and implemented “other key elements of the George Floyd Act.”\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nTyre Nichols:Ex-Memphis police officer took a photo of Tyre Nichols after beating, document says\n\nBiden urges Congress to act on labor reform\n\nBiden called for Congress to take up labor reform and worker protections as he touted his support for unions and his pledge to be “the most pro-union president.”\n\n“I’m so sick and tired of companies breaking the law by preventing workers from organizing,” said Biden. “Workers have a right to form a union.”\n\nBiden also urged action on additional worker protections and benefits, including paid family and medical leave and affordable child care, specifically calling for the return of the expanded Child Tax Credit.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nLabor secretary makes move:Former Boston mayor Marty Walsh stepping down as Biden Labor Secretary for job with NHL union\n\nBiden calls for rebooting the expanded Child Tax Credit\n\nParents who qualify for the Child Tax Credit (CTC) won’t be getting as hefty checks as last year. That’s because the enhanced CTC, which parents could also opt to receive in installments rather than waiting to receive it in a lump sum payment when they file their taxes, expired.\n\nThe enhanced CTC increased payments from $2,000 per qualifying child to $3,600 for children ages 5 and under and $3,000 for children ages 6 through 17. This year it will go back to $2,000 for qualifying children of all ages.\n\nIn his remarks, Biden vowed to “restore the full Child Tax Credit which gave tens of millions of parents some breathing room and cut child poverty in half, to the lowest level in history.”\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nChild tax credit this year:How much is the Child Tax Credit for 2023? Here's what you need to know about qualifying.\n\nBiden: Ban ‘junk fees’ on hotel bills, other services\n\nBiden urged Congress to pass legislation to ban excess fees that companies often tack onto hotel bills, airline tickets and other services.\n\n“Americans are tired of being played for suckers,” he said.\n\nThe Junk Fee Prevention Act, if approved, would bar so-called “resort fees” that can add up to $90 a night on hotel bills, stop cable internet and cell phone companies from charging up to $200 more when a customer switches providers, and prohibit airlines from charging up to $50 roundtrip for families to sit together, Biden said.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nJunk fees:Biden moves to limit credit fees to $8 for missed payments in latest \"junk fee\" crack down\n\nSocial Security and Medicare benefits draw tension during speech\n\nBiden’s State of the Union address comes as he and Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy have started talks on the debt ceiling and government spending.\n\nTension has been building between the two parties over Social Security and Medicare benefits. McCarthy said Republicans aren’t going to cut those programs, but Democrats say the math will force those cuts if the GOP demands lowered government spending.\n\nBiden in his speech said Republicans want to cut the programs, to which Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., stood up and yelled “Liar!” as other members booed the president.\n\n“OK, so we agree,” Biden said. “Social Security and Medicare is off the books.”\n\nBipartisan cheers returned to the chamber.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nMedicare:Medicare launches plan to negotiate prices for the costliest drugs. Here's what to know.\n\nBiden takes credit for deficit cuts\n\nBiden celebrated the government’s deficit cuts seen under his administration in his State of the Union address.\n\n“For the last two years, my administration has cut the deficit by more than $1.7 trillion, the largest deficit reduction in American history,” Biden said. The deficit’s cut was partly a result of higher tax revenues that Biden touted but also the end of spending related to the pandemic.\n\nBiden also took a jab at former President Donald Trump for increases in the federal deficit under Trump’s administration. “Under the previous administration, the American deficit went up four years in a row,” Biden said, to boos and jeers from Republican lawmakers.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWhat happens if the US hits the debt ceiling?:Here's what to expect if we reach debt limit.\n\nBiden says Republicans want to ‘take the economy hostage’ in debt ceiling talks\n\nBiden accused Republicans of wanting to “take the economy hostage” unless he agrees to their demands for spending cuts during debt ceiling talks.\n\nBiden demanded Republicans show “what their plans are.” House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has not specified what Republicans want axed.\n\n“Some Republicans want Medicare and Social Security to sunset every five years,” Biden said, prompting loud boos from Republicans in Congress.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nMedicare and debt ceiling fight:How Medicare and Social Security benefits factor into the Kevin McCarthy debt ceiling fight\n\nBiden defends Inflation Reduction Act\n\nPresident Biden touted the Inflation Reduction Act which he signed into law, saying he was taking on powerful interest to bring health care costs down.\n\n“You know, we pay more for prescription drugs than any major country on earth,” he said. “Big Pharma has been unfairly charging people hundreds of dollars – and making record profits.”\n\nHaving capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors on Medicare, Biden said it was time to help Americans not on Medicare, including 200,000 young people with Type I diabetes who need insulin to save their lives. “Let’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for every American who needs it,” he said. The law also caps out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors on Medicare at a maximum $2,000 per year.\n\nHe also promised to veto any attempts to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nCredit fees:Biden moves to limit credit fees to $8 for missed payments in latest \"junk fee\" crack down\n\nBiden tangles with GOP lawmakers over Social Security and Medicare\n\nBiden got into an unusual back and forth with Republicans over whether GOP lawmakers want to end the automatic continuation of Social Security and Medicare.\n\nWhen some vocally protested, Biden responded: “Anyone who doubts it, contact my office. I’ll give you a copy of the proposal.”\n\nWhen the protests continued, Biden said he wasn’t arguing that all Republicans back reviewing entitlement programs every five years.\n\n“But it’s being proposed,” he said.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nMedicare debate:How Medicare and Social Security benefits factor into the Kevin McCarthy debt ceiling fight\n\nCheers and boos for Biden\n\nProgressive members of the House, known as “the Squad,” cheered as President Joe Biden pushed for fair taxes and called out low tax rates for billionaires.\n\n“You tell ‘em, Joe,” said Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.\n\nHe also had plenty of jeers from the Republican side of the chamber when he slammed former President Donald Trump’s fiscal record and accused the House GOP of trying to cut Social Security and Medicare.

Biden then announced, “new standards to require all construction materials used in federal infrastructure projects to be made in America.”\n\n“American-made lumber, glass, drywall, fiber optic cables,” he said. “And on my watch, American roads, American bridges, and American highways will be made with American products.”\n\nBiden’s message echoes former President Donald Trump’s prior State of the Union addresses where he boasted about initiatives to bring back manufacturing jobs that have been lost over the years.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nInsulin costs:Medicare caps insulin costs at $35 a month. Can Biden get that price for all Americans?\n\nBiden touts legislative victories in infrastructure and manufacturing\n\nBiden championed his series of legislative victories that ranged from tackling the country’s supply chain shortage and sweeping investments in domestic manufacturing and infrastructure.\n\n“We’re gonna make sure the supply chain for America begins in America,” Biden said, touting a bipartisan bill he signed that made investments to boost domestic manufacturing of semiconductors.\n\n“To maintain the strongest economy in the world, we need the best infrastructure in the world,” said Biden, pointing to the bipartisan infrastructure bill. “Folks, we’re just getting started.”\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWhy Bono is at SOTU:Here's why musician, advocate Bono is at Biden's State of the Union address\n\nBiden appeals to middle and working class people on manufacturing\n\nIn an appeal to middle class and working class people, Biden said he ran for president “to make sure the economy works for everyone” so that everyone can have pride in what they do for a living.\n\n“For decades, the middle class was hollowed out,” he said. “Too many good-paying manufacturing jobs moved overseas. Factories at home closed down. Once-thriving cities and towns that many of you represent became shadows of what they used to be.”\n\nBiden then spoke about his administration’s accomplishments in the manufacturing sector.\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nWhat is fentanyl poisoning?:These State of the Union guests lost their son to it\n\nMore:As Biden prepares 2024 reelection run, Dems worry blue-collar voters are slipping away\n\nBiden: ‘COVID no longer controls our lives’\n\nBiden said the nation’s economy is roaring back from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“Two years ago, COVID had shut down our businesses, closed our schools, and robbed us of so much,” he said. “Today, COVID no longer controls our lives.”\n\nBiden said his administration has created 12 million jobs, “more jobs created in two years than any president has ever created in four.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nA full House – literally – for State of the Union\n\nPresident Joe Biden entered a full House chamber Tuesday.\n\nThe capacity crowd included House and Senate members, current and former Supreme Court justices, family and honored guests.\n\nBiden’s first words were met with a standing ovation, as he honored Republican and Democratic leaders – but also as he described the state of the union.\n\nThe applause came from Democrats and Republicans, and the standing ovations were sometimes led by a row of powerful Senate moderates, including Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Kyrsten Sinema, who recently changed her party affiliation to independent.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nBiden: Pelosi is 'greatest speaker’ ever\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi isn’t sitting behind Biden for his address but she got a special call-out from the president anyway.\n\n“I want to give special recognition to someone who I think will be considered the greatest speaker in the history of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi,” Biden said.\n\nPelosi stepped down from Democratic leadership after the midterm elections.

That closely matches the FiveThirtyEight average of polls.\n\nBiden’s job performance has stayed below since August 2021 in most polls. Even more troubling for Biden, most Americans can’t identify his achievements. Sixty-two percent of Americans said Biden has accomplished \"not very much\" or “little or nothing,\" in the same Washington Post-ABC News poll, while only 36% said he has accomplished \"a great deal\" or \"a good amount.\"\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nWhat to watch for:The State of the Union is Tuesday: Here's what you can expect from Joe Biden's speech\n\nVice President Kamala Harris chats with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy ahead of speech\n\nVice President Kamala Harris shook hands with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, and the two chatted, as they stood behind the rostrum waiting for Biden to enter the House chamber.\n\nThis will be the first State of the Union with McCarthy as speaker since Republicans took control of the House during the midterm elections.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nBiden heads to the Capitol\n\nBiden left the White House at 8:30 p.m. en route to the Capitol.

Multiple other cabinet members are also fanning out across the country.\n\n- Maureen Groppe\n\nHow would Biden’s billionaire tax work?\n\nTonight Biden will resurface his plan to levy more taxes on the ultra-wealthy. But how would that work?\n\nUnder the current tax system, you don’t have to pay taxes on assets like stocks, homes and artwork that can appreciate over time until you sell it. But if you hold onto them until you die, you won’t have to pay any taxes. And on top of that, heirs that inherit your assets won’t have to pay taxes if they sell them.\n\nThe Biden Administration refers to this as a tax loophole, as billionaires benefit the most since they’re more likely than working-class Americans to get compensated via stocks or other assets that appreciate over time or inherit them.\n\nTo end the practice, Biden is proposing “minimum income tax” on American households worth more than $100 million. His plan calls for the wealthiest Americans to pay a tax rate of at least 20% on their full income, including unrealized gains from assets that have increased in value since their purchase.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nTaxing billionaires:Should the wealthy pay taxes on expensive art and wine? Joe Biden thinks so. Here's how it would work\n\nOcasio-Cortez lays out expectations for Biden’s speech, working with Republicans\n\nAhead of Biden’s address, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D.-N.Y., said she’s hoping to “hear a really strong vision” from Biden and explained how Democrats and Republicans could find common ground after the GOP gained control of the House during the midterm elections.\n\nThe New York lawmaker told CNN she hopes to hear “about not just what we've done so far, but also our plans on executing on the enormous bills and successes that we've had in the last one to two years,\" saying “There still is implementation and execution on these plans to address our priorities around climate, taxing the rich and so much more.”\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nBiden's 'finish the job' call in State of the Union echoes FDR\n\nHistorian Michael Beschloss hears echoes of Franklin D. Roosevelt in Biden’s State of the Union address.\n\nBiden will call on Republicans to work with him to “finish the job” of rebuilding the economy and uniting the country, according to excerpts of the speech released by the White House.\n\n“Finish the job” was used as a rationale for FDR's reelection, Beschloss tweeted about the phrase’s historical lineage. It was also a slogan for the World War I effort. And in a famous radio address during World War II, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill vowed to “finish the job.”\n\nAt the start of Biden’s administration, many comparisons – not all of them favorable – were made between the size and scope of Biden’s ambitions, Roosevelt’s programs and the World War II spending that lifted the nation out of the Great Depression.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders: Biden is more interested in 'woke fantasies' than concerns of everyday Americans\n\nIn delivering the Republican response to the State of the Union, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sander plans to attack Biden and the Democrats over a panoply of issues that include inflation, taxes, education and so-called \"culture wars.\"\n\n\"And while you reap the consequences of their failures, the Biden administration seems more interested in woke fantasies than the hard reality Americans face every day,\" Sanders plans to say, according to speech excerpts released by her office.\n\nAnother excerpt: \"Most Americans simply want to live their lives in freedom and peace, but we are under attack in a left-wing culture war we didn’t start and never wanted to fight.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nState of the Union guests:Lawmakers highlight policing, abortion, wrongful imprisonment\n\nHow long does the State of the Union last? What it will take for Biden to set a SOTU record\n\nBiden’s first State of the Union address in 2022 was somewhere between the longest and shortest speeches ever given, according to The American Presidency Project. Will he keep his second address tonight short and sweet, or will he be long-winded?\n\nIf he intendeds to break the record for the shortest speech ever, he’d have it keep it under 28 minutes and 55 seconds. That was the time Richard Nixon took to deliver his address in 1972. To beat the longest address ever, he’d have to outdo his fellow Democrat former President Bill Clinton, who went on for 1 hour, 28 minutes and 40 seconds for his final State of the Union speech in 2000. Clinton also claims the spot for the second longest address, clocking in at 1 hour, 24 minutes and 58 seconds in 1995.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nBiden to promise investment in ‘places and people that have been forgotten’\n\nBiden will spend part of his address promoting his economic plan and assuring Americans that he wants to invest in “places and people that have been forgotten.”\n\nAmid the economic upheaval of the past four decades, too many people have been left behind or treated like they’re invisible, he will say, according to excerpts of the speech released by the White House.\n\n“Maybe that’s you watching at home,” Biden will say. “You remember the jobs that went away. And you wonder whether a path even exists anymore for you and your children to get ahead without moving away. I get it. That’s why we’re building an economy where no one is left behind. Jobs are coming back, pride is coming back because of the choices we made in the last two years. This is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America and make a real difference in your lives.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nBiden to praise recovery from Jan. 6 riot, COVID\n\nPresident Joe Biden will say “the story of America is a story of progress and resilience” in his State of the Union address as he touts a rebounding economy, COVID-19 recovery and democracy that survived the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol attack, according to excerpts of the speech provided by the White House.\n\nBiden will tout 12 million new jobs created under his presidency – many that came back following the pandemic – to claim economic progress. And he will reflect on a period two years ago when businesses and schools closed at the height of the pandemic.\n\n“Today, COVID no longer controls our lives,” Biden plans to say. “And two years ago, our democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil War. Today, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nBiden to ask Republicans to work with him in SOTU speech\n\nPresident Joe Biden will make a plea to Republicans in Congress to work with him. He said after the November elections that Americans sent a divided Congress to Washington because they want them to work together.\n\n“The people sent us a clear message,” Biden will say, according to excerpts released from the White House. “Fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict, gets us nowhere.”\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nWhy Sen. Patty Murray and other lawmakers will be wearing crayons at State of the Union\n\nWashington Sen. Patty Murray and some of her Democratic colleagues will be wearing crayon pins to President Joe Biden's State of the Union address Tuesday to signal their support for greater investments in child care. Such care now costs more than $10,000 a year on average, and roughly half of Americans live in a child care desert. Insufficient child care takes a toll on America's economy, recent research shows, costing taxpayers $122 billion annually.\n\nPartisan gridlock has prevented progress on major child care reforms, such as Murray's Child Care for Working Families Act, which would generally cap child care expenses at 7% of a family's household income. Biden, who alluded to that cap in his last State of the Union, has also struggled to gain traction on his child care proposals.\n\n– Alia Wong\n\nLawmakers to highlight key social issues through guests\n\nTuesday night’s State of the Union address will be the first year since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic where lawmakers are allowed to bring their own guests. As part of tradition, lawmakers tend to invite guests that draw attention to issues important to them.\n\nSeveral Democratic lawmakers have invited guests to champion abortion access such as Roslyn Roger Collins, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Metropolitan New Jersey, who will attend the address alongside Rep. Bob Mendendez, D-N.J., according to Planned Parenthood.\n\nIn the wake of the brutal beating and subsequent death of Tyre Nichols in Memphis, Tennessee, members of the Congressional Black Caucus are bringing guests who have been impacted by police violence. House Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has invited Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, who died at the hands of a New York police officer in 2014.\n\n– Christine Fernando and Ken Tran\n\nRepublican response: Sarah Huckabee Sanders follows in historic footsteps with her State of the Union response\n\nArkansas Gov.

Republicans have accused Biden of showing weakness by not shooting down the balloon sooner.\n\nTensions have been rising with China, which the U.S. considers its biggest strategic and economic competitor. The nations have clashed over Taiwan, technology, human rights, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and other disputes.\n\nThe Biden administration has been trying to stabilize the relationship, building what it’s called “guardrails” as it normalizes interaction. But one effort to do that – sending Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China – was postponed because of the balloon incident.\n\n– Maureen Groppe and Michael Collins\n\nIntel chair: China balloon flew over nuke sites\n\nBiden to lay out 'forceful approach’ to combatting fentanyl\n\nThe Biden administration will launch a national campaign to educate young people on the dangers of fentanyl, part of the “forceful approach” for going after fentanyl trafficking and reducing overdose deaths.\n\nOther steps include:\n\nUsing new large-scale scanners to improve efforts to stop fentanyl from being brought into the U.S. through the southern border.\n\nWorking with package delivery companies to catch more packages containing fentanyl from being shipped around the country.\n\nWorking with Congress to make permanent a temporary tool that that’s helped federal agents crack down on drugs chemically similar to fentanyl.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\n5 big questions on Biden's speech:Is he running? 5 big questions Joe Biden will answer in the State of the Union\n\nBiden to plug job market as recession looms\n\nPresident Joe Biden is expected to take credit for a booming job market and easing inflation when he speaks to the nation Tuesday night.\n\nBut he’ll likely leave out a litany of trouble spots, including a slumping housing market, a monthslong manufacturing downturn and elevated recession risk this year. Meanwhile, inflation is still high and economists pin at least some of the blame on Biden for showering Americans with cash in early 2021 while the economy was already healing.\n\n– Paul Davidson\n\nState of the economy:A look at economy's strengths, weaknesses as Biden sets to boast of record job growth in State of Union\n\nWho is Sarah Huckabee Sanders? Arkansas governor to giver Republican response to Biden's State of the Union address\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders, one-time White House press secretary for former President Trump and current governor of Arkansas, will deliver the Republican rebuttal to Biden’s State of the Union address tonight.\n\nSanders, the youngest governor in the U.S., hails from a prominent political family. Her father Mike Huckabee was the 44th governor of Arkansas, serving from 1996 to 2007 before launching an unsuccessful presidential bid during the 2008 election. The younger Sanders has since cut out her own place in GOP politics, emerging as one of the more high-profile members of the Trump administration.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nBono, Tyre Nichols’ family members among guests sitting with first lady Jill Biden Tuesday night\n\nThe lead singer for the rock group U2, Bono, and Ukraine’s ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, are among the White House guests attending President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address Tuesday.\n\nGuests are chosen to highlight themes of the president’s speech or because they represent his policy initiatives.\n\nBono is the cofounder of the ONE campaign to fight poverty and preventable diseases, and (RED), which fights HIV/AIDS in Africa. Other guests who will be sitting with first lady Jill Biden during the speech include:\n\nThe mother and stepfather of Tyre Nichols, the 29-year-old Black man who died after being beaten by Memphis police officers.\n\nBrandon Tsay, the man who disarmed the Monterey Park gunman who killed 11 people and injured 10 others during a Lunar New Year celebration.\n\nA Texas woman who almost died because doctors were concerned that intervening when her pregnancy ran into difficulties would violate the state’s abortion ban.\n\nOne of the Massachusetts same-sex couples who sued the state for the right to marry in 2001.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nWhat to expect from tonight's speech:Here's what you can expect from Joe Biden's speech\n\nBiden's speech comes amid job gains\n\nOne accomplishment Biden is sure to bring up tonight is the level of job gains under his presidency. Since he took office the unemployment rate went from 6.3% to 3.4%, per the latest jobs data.\n\nDespite recession fears and massive tech layoffs, U.S. employers added 517,000 new jobs last month, well exceeding economists' expectations of around 180,000 new jobs.\n\nThe blowout jobs report paved the way for the Federal Reserve to pass more rate hikes aimed at lowering inflation, Fed Chairman Powell said in remarks he delivered earlier today. But the rate hikes could push the economy closer to a recession, which the central bank has avoided so far.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nBiden’s student loan forgiveness plan remains stalled\n\nBiden has yet to fulfill his campaign promise of canceling at least $10,000 in student loan debt. Last year he unveiled a plan to make good on his promise.\n\nHowever the plan is being stalled by legal challenges. Six states – Nebraska, Missouri, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas and South Carolina – formed a coalition to fight the proposal. They argue that canceling student loan debt extends beyond the administration’s legal authority.\n\nThe Supreme Court is set to hear arguments for the case later this month. The Biden administration claims it is well within their legal realm to proceed with its plan. It cannot do so unless the Court rules in its favor, however.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nStock market under Biden\n\nSince President Joe Biden took office in January 2021, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 10%. Last year the index fell into a bear market, meaning it dropped 20% below a market peak set last January.\n\nDuring former President Donald Trump's time in office, the Dow gained 56%. That represents an annualized gain of close to 12%, one of the best stock market performances under a Republican president according to data from LPL Financial.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nWhat time is the State of the Union speech tonight?\n\nBiden’s State of the Union speech is Tuesday at 9 p.m. EST.\n\nHow to stream the SOTU\n\nThe speech will be livestreamed by USA TODAY.\n\nWho is the designated survivor tonight?\n\nThe State of the Union address, delivered to a joint session of Congress and a crowd that includes all nine Supreme Court justices, poses a unique scenario in which every key member of the nation’s leadership is in one room.\n\nThat makes it both a momentous affair, and a significant national security risk. For this reason, each year one member of the president’s Cabinet dubbed the \"designated survivor\" hangs back.\n\nThe practice dates back to the Cold War, during which fears of a Soviet Nuclear attack abounded and a fresh urgency surrounded protocols for the order of presidential succession. The designated survivor for 2023 has not yet been announced, but heads of the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, and Energy have most frequently been chosen.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nWhat channel is the State of the Union on?\n\nThe major TV networks and other news outlets, such as Fox News, MSNBC, CNN and PBS, are providing live coverage of the address.\n\nWhat is the State of the Union address?\n\nThe State of the Union address isn’t just a tradition in the nation’s capital. It's rooted in the Constitution.\n\nArticle II of the Constitution says the president shall “from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union.\"\n\nThat doesn’t mean the president has to give a speech – as they often do today.\n\n\"From that very general mandate in the Constitution has evolved into what we recognize today as a yearly event, with lots of pomp and circumstance,\" Claire Jerry, a curator of political history at the National Museum of American History, told USA TODAY.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhen did the annual message become known as State of the Union address?\n\nFrom 1790 to 1946, the speech delivered by the president to Congress was known simply as the \"Annual Message.\"\n\nIn 1947 is became the ‘State of the Union’ and has since been referred to by that name.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nWhat is the origin of the state of the union address?\n\nArticle II, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution states that the president will “give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.”\n\nThis language birthed the practice, allowing the executive to deliver to a joint session of Congress and the American people.\n\nIn the modern era, the speech has become a vehicle for administrations to roll out their policy priorities for the coming year and spotlight key agenda issues.\n\n– Anna Kaufman", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2023/03/15/bank-safe-collapse-protect-money-svb/11474023002/", "title": "Is my bank safe from collapse? How to protect your money in the bank", "text": "More people are wondering just how safe their money is in a bank after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.\n\nOnline searches asking that question have jumped as Americans worry their bank could be the next to fail.\n\nThat fear hasn't subsided even after major U.S. banks injected more than $30 billion of deposits in First Republic Bank last week and UBS bought Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse over the weekend.\n\nExperts say there’s no reason customers should worry about money kept in banks that are covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, especially since very few depositors surpass the $250,000 limit on the insurance.\n\nAnd with Signature and SVB, the government took extraordinary steps to insure deposits above that limit.\n\nLearn more: Best current CD rates\n\nClark Kendall, president and CEO of Kendall Capital, a wealth management firm, said the government's actions set a precedent for any other bank failures. \"The FDIC will now step up and ensure all depositors,\" he thinks.\n\nWhat caused the SVB collapse?\n\nSilicon Valley Bank's collapse was tied to faltering tech stocks and interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe bank’s customers – mostly startups and other tech companies – were in need of cash after venture capital funding started to decline. Those customers began withdrawing their SVB deposits to pay their expenses.\n\nSVB didn't anticipate so many withdrawals at the same time. And when that occurred, the bank was ill-prepared with minimal deposits on hand and most of its money tied up in U.S. Treasuries.\n\nNormally, this is considered a safe long-term investment, but the Fed’s interest rate hikes made the value of the Treasuries tumble.\n\nSVB had to start selling those bonds at a loss to meet withdrawal requests, but it wasn’t enough.\n\nLast week, the bank said that it suffered a $1.8 billion after-tax loss and would sell $2.25 billion in new shares, which spooked investors. The bank's stock plummeted and depositors moved to take out more money than the bank could provide. Two days later, regulators seized the bank’s assets.\n\nOpinion:SVB's failure poses serious challenge for America's innovation economy\n\nOpinion:Blaming Silicon Valley Bank collapse on diversity or 'wokeness' gives away Republican game\n\nA week after the FDIC took over SVB, its parent company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nHow is this different from 2008 bank collapses?\n\nWhile SVB's meltdown and the stress rippling through the banking system may stir memories of the 2008 financial crisis, it has little in common with the earlier episode.\n\nThe 2008 crisis enveloped the entire housing market, threatened the survival of the nation’s biggest banks, and threw the economy into its worst downturn since the Great Depression.\n\nIn the early 2000s, banks approved subprime mortgages for unqualified borrowers who couldn’t refinance or repay the loans when the housing bubble burst. As house prices fell further, the pain quickly spread to more traditional borrowers who defaulted on their mortgages and to banks that had bundled the mortgages into securities and sold them to other investment firms.\n\nWith the value of those securities plunging, banks virtually halted lending, millions of Americans lost their homes to foreclosure, nearly 9 million workers lost their jobs and nearly $20 trillion in household wealth was wiped out.\n\nThe current crisis began with a single regional bank that disproportionately served tech companies.\n\nA second bank, Signature Bank, also had to shut down and the stress spread to other regional banks with concentrated portfolios. But it generally has not imperiled larger, more diversified banks, said Gregory Daco, chief economist of EY-Parthenon.\n\nAnd while SVB had to cope with “interest rate risk,” which ultimately led to its demise, banks in 2008 faced “credit risk” – the more serious hazard of loan defaults, Daco said.\n\nAnother key difference is commercial banks have a far bigger capital cushion to withstand losses today, with cash comprising 14% of their assets, compared with 3% at the start of the financial crisis, said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist of LPL Financial.\n\nThe values of those assets, largely Treasury bonds, are known. That is unlike the underlying value of mortgage securities in 2008, Daco said.\n\nAnd this time, regulators moved within two days to guarantee that deposit holders at SVB, Signature, and other banks could access all their money, Daco said. In 2008, it took federal agencies months after the failure of Bear Stearns and IndyMac Bank to set up their most sweeping rescue programs.\n\nHundreds of banks failed in the 2008 crisis, versus two so far in the SVB episode. And the current crisis will cause banks to pull back on lending but not nearly as much as in 2008, economists say.\n\n“Unlike in 2008, the government is getting ahead of the problem rather than trying to clean up afterward,” says Brad McMillan, chief investment officer of Commonwealth Financial Network. “We are not set for a rerun of the Great Financial Crisis.”\n\nHow does FDIC insurance work?\n\nThe FDIC covers up to $250,000 worth of deposits at FDIC-insured banks.\n\nThe $250,000 limit is per depositor, per insured bank for each account ownership category, with the exception of some accounts including, investment accounts, life insurance policies, and safe deposit boxes or their contents.\n\nHere are some of the types of accounts the FDIC does insure:\n\nChecking accounts\n\nSavings accounts\n\nNegotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts\n\nMoney market deposit accounts (MMDA)\n\nCertificates of deposits (CDs) and other time deposits\n\nCashier’s checks, money orders, and other official items issued by banks\n\nDeposits above $250,000 may be protected as well.\n\nShould you pull money out of the bank?\n\n“Every American should know that their accounts are safe and their deposits are protected,\" said Jeff Sigmund, a spokesperson for the American Bankers Association. \"Our industry will work with the administration, regulators, and Congress to further bolster that trust,” Sigmund said.\n\nThe National Bankers Association, which promotes minority-owned financial institutions, issued a statement Monday to assure customers that their deposits are safe at banks.\n\n“Minority depository institutions are very different from both SVB and Signature Bank which had high concentrations in crypto deposits and volatile venture capital,” President and CEO Nicole Elam said in a release. “Minority banks are not exposed to riskier asset classes and have the capital and strong liquidity to best serve consumers and small businesses.”\n\nDavid Sacco, an instructor in finance and economics at the University of New Haven's Pompea College of Business and a former fixed-income trader, said most banks are \"in better shape than they've been in in a long time.\"\n\n“Anything could happen. But I am significantly less worried that this is going to spread in terms of bigger banks having the same problem,\" he said.\n\nThe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, an independent bureau of the U.S. Treasury Department that supervises national banks, said it has heightened monitoring and is coordinating with other U.S. regulatory agencies to make sure the federal banking system retains the trust of consumers, businesses and communities.\n\n“The OCC remains committed to ensuring that national banks remain safe and sound, provide fair access to financial services, and treat customers fairly,” a statement from the bureau said.\n\nWhich banks are safe from collapse?\n\nThe Financial Stability Board, an international organization that was created after the 2008 crisis, maintains a list of banks that are colloquially considered \"too big to fail.\"\n\nIn addition, the U.S. created a Financial Stability Oversight Council after the crisis to determine which banks are systemically important to the banking stability in the country. The Council and FSB place unique restrictions on these banks, for instance, how much of depositors' money they can lend out and how much cash they need to have on hand.\n\nThe restrictions are designed to add an extra layer of protection beyond what the banks would do if left to their own devices, according to the architects of the post-2008 regulations. That's not to say that these banks can't run into trouble but it's safe to say the government wouldn't allow them to collapse because it would pose so much danger to the overall financial stability of the country.\n\nOn the top of the list is JPMorgan, the nation's biggest bank. It didn't respond to USA TODAY's requests for comment regarding if its customers' deposits are safe with them. Citibank, the nation's third-largest bank, declined to comment.\n\nCharles Schwab also declined to comment but pointed to a Monday report that noted more than 80% of its total bank deposits fall within FDIC insurance limits. In comparison, 6% of total domestic deposits were insured at Silicon Valley Bank, according to S&P Global.\n\nAlly Bank told USA TODAY that \"nearly 90% of our customer deposits are fully insured (by the FDIC).\"\n\nPNC Bank said its \"strong capital and liquidity levels position us well to continue supporting our customers regardless of the economic environment.\"\n\nWells Fargo declined to comment. First Republic Bank, Capital One, and Bank of America didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nWhat happened to Credit Suisse?\n\nCredit Suisse, a global bank based in Switzerland, had been under stress before the Silicon Valley Bank collapse. SVB's collapse amplified the troubles Credit Suisse was facing as its stock plunged.\n\nCredit Suisse desperately needed more cash to alleviate customers' anxieties. So the Swiss central bank provided a lifeline of around $54 billion Thursday morning.\n\nThen over the weekend Credit Suisse's rival, UBS, agreed to buy it for $3.2 billion in an effort to restore banking stability.\n\nHow to protect your money\n\nYou can do a number of things to ensure all of your money is safe in the unlikely event that your bank collapses.\n\nYou can open multiple accounts at different banks, the FDIC says.. You can also open a joint checking account which would insure up to a total of $500,000 in the account ($250,000 per person).\n\n“No one needs to worry about losing their deposits as long as they're in a bank that's got that FDIC symbol somewhere on their logo,” Sacco said. “You definitely don't have to panic.\"\n\nDig deeper:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/27/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html", "title": "Premarket stocks: Why tech stocks are bleeding right now | CNN ...", "text": "A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter.

Now, it’s facing ever deeper losses as investors fear that fast-growing companies are running out of steam.\n\nWhat’s happening: The Nasdaq dropped almost 4% on Tuesday, sending the index to its lowest level since December 2020. The S&P 500 lost 2.8%. It’s now 13% below its January high.\n\n“The market has fallen significantly from its peak at the start of the year and, more recently, has taken a sharper drop,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network.\n\nSo what’s driving the painful sell-off?\n\nEarnings: Stocks of Big Tech companies soared after the 2020 market crash. Their businesses proved resilient, and investors — flush with cash thanks to efforts by central banks to prop up the economy — rushed to capitalize on their rapid growth.\n\nNow, Wall Street is giving these companies another look amid doubts they can maintain the momentum needed to justify their high valuations. Last week, Netflix’s earnings catastrophe sent its shares plummeting.\n\nGoogle’s parent Alphabet (GOOGL) said Tuesday that its sales growth in the first quarter slowed to 23%, slightly below Wall Street’s forecasts. Alphabet (GOOGL)’s full-year sales growth for 2021 came in at 41%. Shares fell more than 3% before the report on Tuesday and are down another 4% in premarket trading on Wednesday.\n\n“They don’t tend to miss their earnings, so I think that was the big shock for markets,” Justin Onuekwusi, Legal & General Investment Management’s head of retail investments, told me.\n\nEconomy fears: The Federal Reserve is yanking support for the economy to fight the highest inflation in four decades. But if it’s too aggressive in raising rates, it risks sending the US economy into a recession, which would further weigh on corporate earnings.\n\nDeutsche Bank, which earlier this month became the first major bank to forecast a US recession next year, said Tuesday that it now expects a “major” downturn.\n\nIn a report titled “Why the coming recession will be worse than expected,” its economists said it’s “highly likely that the Fed will have to step on the brakes even more firmly, and a deep recession will be needed to bring inflation to heel.”\n\nGrowth is also slowing sharply in China, the world’s second largest economy, as the country tries to limit the spread of coronavirus. That’s bad news for the rest of the world.\n\n“Clearly, as we’re recovering, we need Chinese demand,” Onuekwusi said.\n\nRising rates: Yields on US bonds, which move opposite prices, have jumped this year in anticipation of the Fed’s plan to raise interest rates. The yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury note is now at 2.76%. At the beginning of 2022, it was near 1.5%.\n\nAs yields on safe debt rise, investors start to rethink riskier gambles on the future earnings of companies. Tech stocks, in particular, start to look less appealing.\n\nLooking ahead: Not all earnings have been cause for concern. Microsoft (MSFT), which also reported results on Tuesday, said its revenue rose 18%. Its shares are up 4% in premarket trading. But with Facebook’s Meta (FB), Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) still to come this week, markets are likely to remain on edge.\n\n“Because these stocks are bigger and bigger and bigger, any disappointment is going to have a massive impact,” Onuekwusi said.\n\nRussia shuts off natural gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria\n\nFollowing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, fears spiked that Moscow could weaponize the country’s energy supplies as a means of retaliating against the West for punishing sanctions.\n\nThat’s no longer a hypothetical. On Wednesday, Russia cut off natural gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria after they refused to pay in rubles, dramatically escalating tensions.\n\n“Energy is being increasingly weaponized as the war in Ukraine looks set to enter the long haul and expectations grow that a crude oil embargo will end up being slapped on Russia by the EU,” said Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Susannah Streeter.\n\nThe European Commission described the decision to halt supplies as attempted “blackmail” and said it was coordinating a response among EU member states.\n\nPoland had been preparing for a move like this by importing more liquified natural gas from countries like Qatar. But the development feeds worries that Russia could hit Germany by stopping flows of gas through the crucial Nord Stream pipeline.\n\nGermany has warned that it would plunge into a deep recession if its supply of Russian natural gas was suddenly shut off, losing $234 billion in economic output over the next two years and hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n\nInvestor insight: European natural gas prices spiked on the news, rising more than 20% early Wednesday before falling back.\n\nStocks in Europe largely shrugged off the development, but the euro sank. Faced with a strong US dollar, it fell below $1.06 for the first time in five years.\n\nTesla shares just plunged. That’s bad news for Musk\n\nIn yesterday’s edition of Before the Bell, we highlighted how Elon Musk’s deal to buy Twitter posed a risk to Tesla (TSLA) shares.\n\nIt didn’t take long for investors to indicate they were rattled. Tesla’s stock plunged 12% on Tuesday, notching its worst day since September 2020. The decline wiped $126 billion off the company’s market value.\n\nRemember: Musk has secured more than $25 billion in debt financing from banks including Morgan Stanley. But he still needs to put up roughly $21 billion on his own.\n\nMost of Musk’s riches are tied up in Tesla shares. That’s raised questions about whether he could offload a portion of his 17% stake to come up with the cash.\n\nIt’s also not clear how involved Musk will be at Twitter. Could he be stretched too thin, giving him less time to focus on running the world’s most valuable automaker?\n\nIt may take some time for investors to sort through these unknowns. But their unease puts pressure on Musk, who used his Tesla holdings as collateral for some of the loans he received. As the value of his stake drops, he has less room to maneuver, which could be a problem as bankers and lawyers work to close the deal.\n\nUp next\n\nBoeing (BA), Harley-Davidson (HOG), Kraft Heinz (KHC), Steve Madden and Spotify (SPOT) report results before US markets open.

Now they're losing steam ...", "text": "Minneapolis CNN —\n\nFor a year that held promise of a return to normalcy, 2022 threw plenty of curve balls at the American consumer.\n\nSupply chains remained in disarray as ongoing snarls were drastically worsened by lockdowns in China and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, average US gas prices shot north of $5 per gallon for the first time ever, inflation spiked to levels not seen since the early 1980s, and interest rates quickly soared as the Federal Reserve dug in its heels and took a whatever-it-takes approach to rein in soaring prices.\n\nConsumers armed with plenty of pandemic-induced pent-up demand and bountiful financial buffers kept the economy churning throughout much of 2022. Spending, adjusted for inflation, remained above 2021 levels, landing at 2% as of November, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n\n“In general, most people’s finances are probably better than we give them credit for,” said Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at Bankrate. “But I think there are reasonable worries that may not last.”\n\nConsumer spending remained resilient throughout much of 2022. However, stubbornly high inflation has taken its toll and knocked the stuffing out of the financial cushion. With interest rates poised to go higher in 2023 and economic uncertainty sure to grow, consumers could be starting to run dry at the worst time.\n\n“A lot of people have been able to keep up with the bills, they’ve been able to save more; it’s just a question of, ‘where do we go from here?’” Rossman said.\n\nThat could quickly change if the historically low unemployment rate ticks up as the Federal Reserve and economists expect, he said.\n\nA return to pre-pandemic levels\n\nAmericans’ personal savings rate reached an all-time high during the pandemic as many locked-down workers saved on the cost of their daily commute and other expenses, and benefited from government checks meant to stimulate spending. But the household savings rate now sits at 2.4%, the lowest level since 2005 and the second-lowest rate going back more than 60 years.\n\nHousehold financial obligations (i.e. debt) as a percentage of disposable personal income hit an all-time low of 12.57% in the first quarter of 2021, according to Federal Reserve data. That share has now ticked up to 14.49%, well below average rates of the past 40 years, as consumers lean more on credit cards and other borrowing.\n\nAs of September 30, credit card delinquencies remained near historic lows with a 2.07% rate, according to Federal Reserve data. However, that rate is higher than the previous quarter and was reached at the fastest pace on record, according to Fed data going back to 1991.\n\nAuto loan delinquencies, which fell to the lowest level since 2003, are revving up to pre-pandemic levels; however, those delinquencies are climbing faster than they have during those nearly 20 years.\n\n“Auto delinquencies do seem to be the biggest trouble spot at the moment, more so than things like credit cards and mortgages,” Rossman said.\n\nThe biggest problem with car loans is that the spike in prices [during the pandemic] caused people to get in over budget. The rate hikes haven’t helped, he added.\n\n“We’re seeing more people taking out $700 or $800 monthly payments and loans that are lasting five, six, seven years,” he said. “It seems like a lot of people have already gotten over-extended on this, and that does seem to be leading to more worries about delinquencies and defaults, especially in the auto space.”\n\nThe average monthly payment for a new car was $703 in the third quarter, up nearly 26% from 2019, according to Edmunds.com.\n\nAlthough delinquencies, defaults and repossessions are on the rise from record lows, they aren’t expected to soar to “red-alert levels,” said Jonathan Smoke, chief economst at Cox Automotive.\n\n“The real worry in the market right now is a recession, not a tsunami of repossessions,” he wrote in a post last week. “We have been expecting loan defaults and repossessions to increase, but long-term expectations through mid-decade (2025) suggest overall defaults and repossessions will remain within expected norms.”\n\nBalance sheets starting to shrink\n\nThe pendulum is swinging from a place where many of these metrics were artificially low, Rossman said.\n\n“Things don’t feel great with high inflation and higher interest rates, and it’s not great that, at the moment, the saving rate has slipped to just 2.3%; but in terms of money that some people have in the bank, it’s a lot more,” he said.\n\nPersistently high inflation has consumers leaning more on credit cards and other forms of financing. Adobe Stock\n\nPandemic aid combined with a drastic curtailing of consumer spending during the height of the pandemic allowed people’s savings accounts to balloon. Fed economists estimated that between 2020 and through the summer of 2021, US households accumulated $2.3 trillion in savings in excess of pre-pandemic trends. Consumers have been draining those coffers to an estimated current range of $1.2 trillion to $1.8 trillion, according to JPMorgan Chase.\n\n“That trillion and a half dollars will run out some time mid-year next year,” JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told CNBC earlier this month, noting that inflation is “eroding” the pile of savings.\n\nAnd American’s dependence upon credit cards and other forms of financing — including “Buy Now, Pay Later” installment loans — is growing, Rossman said.\n\n“[BNPL] may feel better than a credit card, because it may have a lower interest rate, and it may have a shorter term, but it may also encourage you to overspend,” he said.\n\n2023 outlook getting cloudier\n\nHeadwinds are gathering, and that could put pressure on household spending — which makes up the lion’s share of the US economy.\n\n“The main engine of US growth — the consumer — is still running, but as we head into 2023, three key factors suggest it will lose considerable steam,” wrote Gregory Daco, EY Parthenon’s chief economist, in a note earlier this month. “First, the soft income trend will weaken further in 2023 on softer compensation and employment growth. Second, the ‘savings dip’ is unprecedented and unsustainable. Third, the credit splurge is a true risk, especially for families at the lower end of the income spectrum.”\n\nEY Parthenon projects that consumer spending will flatline in 2023 after growing 2.7% this year. Persistent inflation, tighter financial conditions and weaker global growth could help tip the United States into a mild recession during the first half of the year, Daco noted.\n\n“With household sentiment historically depressed and savings cushions rapidly dwindling, consumers will likely grow increasingly reluctant to spend in coming months,” he wrote. “This will become more apparent as labor market conditions deteriorate and household wealth takes a hit from falling stock prices and declining home values.”\n\nBut consumers, while showing resiliency, also are showing some restraint, said Matt Kramer, national sector leader of consumer and retail for KPMG.\n\nConsumers are “definitely making tough choices [and taking] a pause on the larger ticket items’ focusing on non-discretionary items,” he said.\n\nThose adjustments have included buying fewer gifts and seeking out savings, he said. That frugality has extended to purchase of essentials. Discount retailers such as Walmart and Dollar General have reported an increase in wealthier customers.\n\n“We may have a tale of two years within 2023, with the first half being a bit challenged with the economic headwinds but coming out of it in the back half with things looking more favorable and consumers being a little bit more willing to spend with the positive outlook that’s ahead,” Kramer said.", "authors": ["Alicia Wallace"], "publish_date": "2022/12/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2012/11/15/stocks-thursday-11-14/1706379/", "title": "Stocks end down, biggest fear is 'fiscal cliff'", "text": "AP\n\n'Fiscal cliff' remains primary worry of most investors\n\nSlew of retailer earnings offer mixed view of economy's health\n\nClaims for jobless aid surged last week due to Superstorm Sandy\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — Key stock indexes fell Thursday as a pair of U.S. retail giants posted better-than-expected profits, but revenue that fell just short.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average ended down 0.2%, falling 29 points to finish at 12,542.

Not disclosed, however, is the significant portion of the fund that is being withheld from those it was promised.\n\nAs the award notifications begin to trickle out, some of the recipients have been stunned to find they may receive just pennies on the dollar of what they’re owed, likely setting off another spate of frustrating court battles.\n\nSome have even received notices that show pending payments in the negative.\n\nSarah Goldston, the 90-year-old widow of Ralph Goldston – who was one of the first black players on the Philadelphia Eagles in 1952 before Alzheimer’s set in during his retirement – learned this month that their family had been awarded $160,000 from the settlement. But that preliminary award dwindled to negative $740 after deductions and “holdbacks,” including thousands the court has kept in case the family owes money for Ralph’s medical bills.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\n“I thought they made a mistake,” Ralph’s daughter, Ursula Goldston, said after seeing the family might receive nothing because of the pending liens, which email correspondences show might have been withheld in error. \"I just cannot believe these people did that.”\n\nUSA TODAY reviewed documents or interviewed families in a dozen cases of former players whose settlement projections have been similarly reduced. Money that the former players or their family members had counted on will instead, for now, remain in the NFL’s settlement fund or will be redirected to insurance companies, lawyers, credit card companies or others who have placed a lien on the awards in an effort to secure a piece of the payout.\n\nMore:NFL had 'intervention' with seven teams on concussion rates\n\nMore:Pop Warner football is offering 'crash course' on concussion conundrum\n\nMore:Family of Junior Seau settles concussion lawsuit against NFL\n\nThe payout determinations are not final. Court officials and lawyers are sorting through the lienholders’ claims, while players can also appeal their deductions for an additional cost of $1,000. Out of 20,000 players involved in the suit, less than 700 have been approved for payment so far.\n\nSome of the former players, as well as outside observers, blame in part lawyers who have filed liens seeking a large percentage of the awards even though they did minimal work on the case or recruited players with false promises after the settlement was reached.\n\nUSA TODAY reviewed letters in which former attorneys, who were fired before the case settled, demanded as much as 25 percent of a player’s award for as little as 15 months of work. The firms indicated in the letters that their work product amounted to “considerable time and effort.” They say they deserve fair compensation for helping qualify players to receive a settlement and that the lien is largely a fight with the new lawyer over fees.\n\nJohn C. Coffee Jr., a professor at Columbia Law School, reviewed a sample of the settlement payout notices obtained by USA TODAY. He said if attorneys who did little work are demanding large chunks of a player’s award, that amounts to “unjust enrichment.”\n\n“That’s where you should be outraged,” he said.\n\n'Patently unfair'\n\nIt’s now on those players to dispute the work their old lawyers put in, and a magistrate judge will ultimately decide if and how much of a cut they will get.\n\nThe settlement terms created a formula for each player’s specific case and then a court administrator decides how much of the settlement fund to disperse, while holding back any money contested in a lien.\n\nAs of this month, payouts in the settlement total almost $570 million, according to a claims administrator. Though it includes claims the NFL has appealed, the high dollar figure has been touted by both sides as evidence that the settlement is already compensating players.\n\nBut until now, the specific dollar amounts withheld from players had not been reported. Those involved will not release what share of the total payouts are actually deductions and disputed liens.\n\nJim Acho, a Michigan attorney who has represented roughly three dozen retired players, said that his clients have said they are stunned by the holdbacks. He called some of the deductions “patently unfair” and said they “eviscerate a big chunk of the payment,” leaving his clients with a fraction of what they expected.\n\n“When it really hits home for them is when your are sent the breakdown of the payout by the claims administrator,”Acho said. He added that his clients have likened the reduced payouts to being “punched in the gut.\"\n\nCraig Mitnick, a lawyer whose firm co-represents more than 1,000 players in the class-action, said he now regrets publicly championing the agreement when it was first announced. Clients who fought for years to get a piece of the settlement have seen their potential payouts reduced to the low thousands, or even to nothing, by the holdbacks, he said.\n\n\"These players didn’t know what they were getting into,” Mitnick said. “The settlement is not what we thought it was.\"\n\nPlayers and their families who spoke with USA TODAY said the withheld payouts are the latest insult in a years-long battle to hold the NFL, the world’s highest-earning sports league, accountable for brain injuries incurred during playing careers. The league long denied connections between the sport and lasting brain injury and, the suit claimed, failed to warn players or do what it could to protect them from head trauma caused by hard hits, leading to a condition now known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE.\n\nPlaintiffs have complained in the past that the legal battle against the NFL has been full of trapdoors and fine print that has tested resolve and stretched bank accounts, all while dealing with the devastating long-term impact of careers spent in football. Some had to unearth decades-old proof of their playing days and medical history before fighting through audits, appeals and narrow diagnosis criteria to show the court they deserved part of the settlement.\n\n“A lot of people would have given up by now,” Ursula Goldston said. She and her family corralled decades-old paperwork documenting her father’s illness from past doctors. They got letters from neighbors who witnessed Ralph declining. One saw him standing by himself outside in the Ohio winter, freezing and confused, years ago. He stopped bathing and caring for himself. He lashed out at his wife in fits of rage.\n\n“I’m not giving up,” Goldston said, “because my mother deserves this money.”\n\nDifferent from other settlements\n\nThe terms of the class-action settlement are a result of negotiations between lawyers representing the players as a whole and those for the NFL. In interviews, many of those on the players’ side faulted Chris Seeger, co-lead counsel for the plaintiffs, for negotiating settlement terms that they said opened the door for holdbacks without safeguards to ensure players don’t leave empty-handed.\n\nIn a letter sent to USA TODAY, Seeger wrote that the court accepted the terms and payout structure. He pointed to the hundreds of millions in approved payouts as evidence that the settlement was “working effectively.”\n\n\"It is required by law” to hold back funds until medical liens are resolved, Seeger wrote. He added that no players whose medical liens had been finalized had received a negative payout.\n\nIn a statement from Seeger after the story was published online, he wrote, in part, that “the majority had $0 deducted from their awards for medical liens or lien-related fees. For the minority that did pay medical liens and related fees, their average deduction has been 2.2%.”\n\nIn other high-profile class-action cases with large settlements, the parties negotiated the ability to increase award amounts to make sure deserving victims did not see their payouts diminished, said Kenneth Feinberg, an attorney who has administered class-action settlements, including one stemming from the September 11 attacks.\n\n“We had broad discretion to prevent the injustice of an eligible member getting nothing due to the cold calculation of a formula,” Feinberg said.\n\nSimilar steps were not taken to ensure NFL players won’t walk away with very low or no awards.\n\n“I’m afraid that wasn’t part of the negotiating,” said Larry Coben, a lawyer for the plaintiffs involved in reaching the terms of the settlement.\n\nThe NFL declined to make a league official available for an interview. In a statement, the league did not address the issue of depleted awards but said, “The settlement program is working as intended, and we will continue to work in good faith to pay all approved claims under this settlement, which has been thoughtfully and thoroughly negotiated by the parties and approved by multiple courts.”\n\nCoben defended the broader terms of this deal – which has been criticized by debilitated former players as too full of exclusions and provisions – as “not a one-time shot.”\n\n“Ten to 15 years from now, if their condition worsens, they could apply again and potentially get a benefit,” Coben said.\n\nEchoing an opinion of the federal judge overseeing the settlement, Coben justified the holdbacks as a measure to negotiate down liens and prevent players from later getting sued by medical providers or other entities. It’s not uncommon for large, public settlements like this to open the door for third parties who think they are due a cut. Health care plans with hospitals, insurance providers and Medicare often specify some sort of repayment should a patient ever win a windfall settlement meant to help cover the cost of care.\n\nSome of the payout notices reviewed by USA TODAY show initial awards calculated by the administrator reduced to nothing after all the pending lien holdbacks.\n\nAfter Gordon Smith – a Minnesota Vikings tight end who played in the 1960s – went through a formula that calculated his age at the time of his Alzheimer's diagnosis, degree of illness, years in the league and medical history, the courts administrator awarded him $183,000 for his brain trauma.\n\nBut because private insurance had covered some of the costs related to his care, the courts administrator held back all but $4,600.\n\nSmith’s wife, Maetha, who spoke on Gordon’s behalf, said she was shocked at the amount after seeing the public statements about large payouts from the NFL and lawyers who negotiated the settlement.\n\n“We were hearing hundreds of thousands,” she said. \"This settlement is minuscule.”\n\nThe administrator awarded Barbara Stark $100,000 in a settlement for her husband, Ed Cooke, a defensive end on five teams in the 1960s who later developed Alzheimer’s. After holdbacks for pending liens, the final figure showed Cooke is slated to receive negative $200.\n\nAndrew Stewart, a 52-year-old former linebacker who has Parkinson’s disease, said that angry phone calls and messages are circulating among retired players and their wives after receiving notices detailing their settlement payouts.\n\n“It’s shocking what the offsets are,” said Stewart, who was on the Cleveland Browns, Cincinnati Bengals and San Francisco 49ers from 1989 through 1993. He saw his own potential award drop from $3 million to $750,000 after the administrator reduced the amount of seasons he was credited for because he missed time with injuries. He has not yet received his claim determination because his case is tied up in appeals, he said.\n\n“I’ve heard of guys receiving a tenth of what they were going to get,” Stewart said. “Nobody’s getting what they thought they were getting.”\n\nOfficials working on the claim distribution said many of the liens placed on players’ payouts are from former lawyers, some of whom were fired before the class-action litigation even began.\n\nSandra Irvin, speaking on behalf of her husband, Darrell, a defensive lineman for the Buffalo Bills and Seattle Seahawks in the early 1980s who was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, called her fired attorney’s $200,000 lien an affront.\n\n“I think we got a total of three phone calls from them,” Irvin said. “What a joke.”\n\nContributing: A.J.

The much-anticipated film airs after ESPN, which had agreed to partner with Frontline on the project, pulled out shortly before the concussion settlement was announced. ESPN, a major broadcaster of NFL games, denied the decision came after pressure from the league. The film rolls on with substantial reporting by ESPN journalists.\n\nThe 2002 death of center Mike Webster of the Pittsburgh Steelers at age 50 is the cornerstone of the documentary, a tipoff delivered in opening scenes of molten steel and blast furnaces. The Hall of Famer was the first former NFL player diagnosed through autopsy with the brain disease known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE.\n\nMORE:Two former college football players file class-action lawsuit alleging NCAA ignored concussions\n\nWebster and other CTE cases were cited in the lawsuits, but because the ex-NFL players opted not to go to trial, the case never got to the stage of what the NFL knew and when it knew it. Frontline makes the case that, beginning in the late 1990s, the NFL ignored mounting evidence about long-term dangers of concussions and tried to refute emerging science with questionable research of its own.\n\nThe Pittsburgh doctor who diagnosed Webster says the NFL tried to \"squash\" him and later helped block him from examining the brain of former NFL star Junior Seau, who committed suicide in 2012. Another researcher says she encountered a dismissive attitude – and sexism – when she made a presentation to a male-dominated NFL committee in 2009.\n\nMORE:Bob Kravitz says the full truth still eludes, but former NFL players needed money from concussion settlement\n\nThe NFL has implemented an array of player safety policies over the past four years, including no return to play on the same day a concussion is diagnosed, stricter rules covering hits to the head (including fines and suspensions of players) and putting athletic trainers in the press box to alert the sideline of potential concussions. This season, a league directive added \"independent\" neurological consultants on the sideline during games.\n\nIn the settlement, which is subject to court approval, the NFL agreed to compensation and medical benefits for former players, as well as funding for research. Independent of the suits, the league this year launched a $60 million \"Head Health Initiative\" to encourage research into diagnosis, treatment and prevention of concussions.\n\nIn response to League of Denial, the NFL issued a statement from Jeff Miller, senior vice president of health and safety policy, who said that for more than two decades the league has been a \"leader in addressing the issue of head injuries in a serious way.\" Miller cites investments in research, changes in rules and this year's national launch of \"Heads Up Football,\" a youth safety program administered by NFL-supported USA Football.\n\n\"By any standard, the NFL has made a profound commitment to the health and safety of its players that can be seen in every aspect of the game, and the results have been both meaningful and measurable,\" Miller wrote.\n\nSteve Fainaru and his brother, fellow ESPN investigative reporter Mark Fainaru-Wada, who co-wrote the documentary and a book (also being released Tuesday), paint a different picture of how the NFL handled the issue in previous years.\n\n\"The league just knocked it down time after time,\" Steve Fainaru, a 2008 Pulitzer Prize winner for reporting on the Iraq war, told USA Today Sports. \"At the very least, the league should have known that it was a far more nuanced picture than they were presenting to the players and the public and that there were very serious warnings from credible scientists.''\n\nMark Fainaru-Wada pointed out contradictions in the league's actions: At the same time the league's former Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (MTBI) Committee was denying a link between concussions and long-term effects, the league's retirement board was awarding disability compensation to players such as Webster following doctors' assessment of their mental conditions.\n\n\"You had this weird dynamic of two separate (NFL) committees … one sending a message that concussions were essentially not a problem and the other acknowledging that football had caused brain damage in several players,\" said Fainaru-Wada, who also broke the BALCO steroid scandal.\n\nNFL disputes findings\n\nMike Webster played with the Steelers (1974-1988) and Kansas City Chiefs (1989-1990), winning four Super Bowls with Pittsburgh in his Hall of Fame career. But the physical toll was high for the offensive lineman. \"For Mike Webster, the head hits just kept on coming for 17 years,\" says Frontline narrator Will Lyman.\n\nThe documentary details Webster's descent into confusion, depression and dementia, the end of his marriage, his living out of a pickup truck and his inability to sleep. His former wife, Pam, tells how he took a knife and slashed all his football pictures.\n\nWebster died on Sept. 24, 2002.\n\n\"The news that day would start a chain of events that would threaten to forever change the way America sees the game of football,'' the narrator says.\n\nFrontline shows a photo of Webster's body on a table at the coroner's office in Pittsburgh . Bennet Omalu, the forensic neuropathologist who did the autopsy, said death was due to heart disease, but he also wanted to examine Webster's brain.\n\nOmalu said his examination found evidence of CTE, a degenerative condition that previously been associated with boxers. Omalu was the first to report a case in an NFL player and in 2005 he published his findings in the journal Neurosurgery.\n\nIn response, the then-chairman and other members of the NFL's former Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (MTBI) Committee wrote a letter to the journal saying Omalu's findings were based on a \"complete misunderstanding of the relevant medical literature\" and that there was \"inadequate clinical evidence that the subject had a chronic neurological condition.\"\n\n\"They insinuated I was not practicing medicine. I was practicing voodoo … voodoo,\" the Nigerian-born Omalu tells Frontline.\n\nOmalu added: \"CTE has dragged me into the politics of science, the politics of the NFL. You can't go against the NFL. They'll squash you.\"\n\nAfter former San Diego Charger Seau's death, Omalu was invited to participate in the autopsy. He said he had an understanding with Seau's son, Tyler, that he would be allowed to examine the brain. The documentary reports that access was denied after the NFL informed the son that \"Omalu's research is bad and that his ethics are bad.\"\n\n\"I got a long email about it,\" Tyler Seau says in the film.\n\nThe Frontline report also says that in 2000 the NFL retirement board said in a letter to Webster's attorney, Bob Fitzsimmons, acknowledging that Webster had been declared totally disabled as a \"result of head injuries he suffered as a football player with the Pittsburgh Steelers and Kansas City Chiefs.\" The finding were based on reports from five doctors, including a neurologist hired by the NFL board.\n\nMark Fainaru-Wada says the letter is \"sort of the proverbial smoking gun,\" an admission that the NFL was not making publicly at the time.\n\nFrontline also challenges a series of research papers published by the NFL's MTBI committee from 2003 to 2009.\n\nIn 2004, a league study had found \"no evidence of worsening injury or chronic cumulative effects\" from multiple concussions.\n\nIn a study published in 2005, the committee said players whose concussion symptoms go away while a game is in progress can return \"safely\" to that game. It noted the \"possibility\" that the same might apply to high school and college players.\n\nIn May 2009, Ann McKee made a presentation before the MTBI committee at NFL headquarters in New York. A professor of neurology and pathology at Boston University and co-director of BU's Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopath, McKee told Frontline the committee was not receptive.\n\n\"They were convinced it was wrong, and I felt that they were in a very serious state of denial,\" she said.\n\nMcKee also sensed a gender issue. \"Sexism is a big part of my life, and getting in that room with a bunch f males who thought that they knew all the answers, more sexism. It was like, 'Oh, the girl talked. Now we can get back to some serious business.'\"\n\nNeurosurgeon Henry Feuer, a member of the committee at the time, tells Frontline: \"I don't know why she feels that way. … I don't know where she's coming from.\"\n\nUnknowns remain\n\nFrontline and McKee acknowledge there are unknowns about CTE.\n\nIn 2012, the Boston University Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy reported it had examined the brain of 50 deceased football players that had evidence of CTE: 33 from the NFL, one from the Canadian league, one semi pro, nine college and six high schools players.\n\nYet after an international conference in 2012 in Switzerland, a consensus statement said that CTE represents a condition \"with an unknown incidence in athletic populations.\" It also said \"that a cause and effect relationship has not as yet been determined between CTE and concussions or exposure to contact sports.\" It recommended that interpretation of cause should \"proceed cautiously.\"\n\nMichael Collins, director of the Sports Medicine Concussion Program at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, addressed the uncertainty about CTE in an interview last summer with USA Today Sports. UPMC is the sports medicine provider of the Steelers.\n\n\"There's no proof at this point in time determining that concussion is an isolative favor in causing CTE. There are so many other factors that have yet to be controlled for,\" said Collins. \" … We haven't looked at a bunch of control brains to see if that occurs in the normal population. We don't know if factors such as steroid use or alcohol use (play a role). … I think people generally think that concussion has been confirmed to cause this problem, when in fact the science hasn't proven that.\"\n\nBut McKee says she believes additional data will show a strong relationship between concussions and CTE. \"I think it's going to be a shockingly high percentage,\" she says. \"I'm really wondering where this stops. I'm really wondering on some level if every single football player doesn't have this.\"\n\nFrontline says the shift in NFL policies about concussions was stepped up after Goodell, who replaced Paul Tagliabue in 2006, was called in October 2009 to testify before Congress about concussions and long-term effects. Goodell said in his testimony that the league was committed to player safety but that \"the medical experts should be the ones to continue that debate.\"\n\nU.S. Rep Linda T. Sanchez (D-Calif.) responded, \"The NFL sort of reminds me of the tobacco companies pre-'90s.\"\n\nA month later, the NFL announced it was \"strengthening and expanding\" its concussion committee. In early 2010, the MTBI committee was replaced – with new leadership – by the Head, Neck and Spine Committee with new leadership.\n\n\"In the short term, we can already see that football is changing,\" says Steve Fainaru. \" … The NFL is certainly trying to get its arms around the problem.''\n\nStudies and lawsuits aside, what's the prognosis for the long-term future of football?\n\n\"The core issue around this is what is the incidence of brain damage associated with football?\" Steve Fainaru told USA Today Sports. \"Some people, like Ann McKee, will tell you that she thinks it's going to be a shockingly high percentage of players. Other people feel we don't know.\n\n\"It's going to be a while before we know what the prevalence is, and I think that's going to have a real impact in determining how many people end up playing and how far the league has to go to try to protect the players.\"\n\nHarry Carson, a former linebacker with the New York Giants who is in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, sums up the problem during the documentary.\n\n\"The human body was not created or built to play football,\" he says. \"You're going to have some brain trauma.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/10/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2013/08/29/nfl-concussion-settlement-keeps-files-closed-dave-duerson-junior-seau-ray-easterling/2735941/", "title": "Lawyers: NFL wins by keeping files closed", "text": "Gary Mihoces\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nSome legal experts are criticizing the settlement because it allows the NFL to keep secret what it knew about concussion dangers\n\nOthers say the league settled because a new documentary %22would have made it impossible for there ever to be a settlement%22\n\nBoth sides say the $765 million settlement of concussion lawsuits filed against the NFL by about 4,500 former players is preferable to a court battle that might have dragged out a decade or more.\n\nNot all legal observers agree, because this means no court inquiry into allegations in the lawsuits that the NFL knew about dangers of concussions and covered them up.\n\nThe settlement, subject to approval by U.S. District Judge Anita B.

And it will do so faster and at a far, far less cost – both financially and emotionally – than would have been accomplished by continuing to litigate,\" said Christopher Seeger, co-lead counsel for the players.\n\nSeeger said full litigation might taken 10 to 20 years.\n\nJeffrey Pash, NFL executive vice president, said it is critical to help players now \"rather than spend many years and millions of dollars'' in court.\n\nLayn Phillips, the former federal judge who led the mediation, said the settlement was a preferable to arguing \"thousands of complex individual claims over many years.\"\n\nThe settlement (with the NFL and its marketing arm NFL Properties) comes with no admission of liability by them or acknowledgement by the ex-players of any weakness in their claims.\n\nSettlement also nullifies the pretrial court discovery, including information in NFL documents and sworn statements, that would have occurred had the cases stayed in court.\n\n\"People settle on terms they find satisfactory, but there is a strong public interest and players' interest in having information about what the NFL did or didn't do. So I think we lose that with a settlement, which is probably unfortunate,\" said Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor.\n\nMichael Kaplen, a practicing brain injury lawyer who teaches at George Washington University, has labeled football a \"concussion delivery system\" for players.\n\n\"The settlement will have the unfortunate result of hiding from the American public all the dangers that the league has known about concussions and will allow them to perpetuate the myth that football is safe,\" Kaplen said.\n\nRecently, ESPN pulled out of a project for an upcoming documentary with the PBS series Frontline titled League of Denial: The NFL's Concussion Crisis. The NFL said it did not pressure ESPN, and the network said its decision was based on \"editorial control\" of its concussion coverage.\n\n\"I'm guessing that they (the NFL) made this settlement before the scheduled release of some documentaries on this issue that would have blown up this whole thing and made it impossible for there ever to be a settlement in this case,\" said Kaplen, past president of the Brain Injury Association of New York State,\n\n\"So they're buying peace now in order to keep all this quiet. There has to be Congressional investigation of the NFL under subpoena, where all the true facts come out.\"\n\nFormer NFL fullback Kevin Turner, who has ALS (Lou Gerhrig's Disease) welcomed the settlement. He spoke haltingly during a teleconference Thursday.\n\n\"It's been a struggle to get to this point, but today … I am very proud that the NFL has decided to stand up for all the former players who are suffering from brain injuries,\" said Turner, 44, who played with the Philadelphia Eagles and New England Patriots from 1992-1999.\n\n\"The compensation provided in this settlement will lift the huge burden off the men who are suffering right now, both them and their and families. It will give them peace of mind to have the best quality of life they are able to have. They'll no longer have to make decisions regarding their health based on what they can afford.\"\n\nSeeger said providing such help as quickly as possible trumped final resolution of the allegations in the suits. More than 200 were filed around the country and consolidated in a master complaint in Philadephia.\n\n\"We made some pretty serious allegations,'' Seeger. said. \"I put that aside and only had one goal in negotiating and that was achieving the right result for players.''\n\nThough about 4,500 former players sued, all 18,000 currently retired NFL players will be eligible for potential benefits from the settlement.\n\nSeeger said the deal will provide testing and medical benefits to ex-players who may be symptom-free. He said all retired players will be eligible for a benefit card that can be used for further testing and treatment.\n\nHe said payouts will include up to $5 million for former players with Alzheimer's Disease, $4 million to the families of those diagnosed after death with the degenerative brain disorder known as CTE, and $3 million for dementia.\n\nAfter the suicide deaths of former NFL players Dave Duerson (2011), Junior Seau (2012) and Ray Easterling (2012), all were diagnosed with CTE.\n\nPhillips' announcement of the settlement was made in a press release issued by his firm, the Alternative Dispute Resolution Center of Newport Beach, Calif. In the release, Phillips said players with \"demonstrated cognitive injury\" – to be decided by independent doctors and fund administrators agreed on by both side – will be eligible for monetary awards.\n\nPHOTOS: Concussions and the NFL\n\nSeeger said settlement means the former players won't have to prove their conditions are related to NFL concussions. \"You just need to be a former retired player (with the condition) and you're in the program,\" said Seeger.\n\nUnder the terms, the NFL will pay about half of the settlement over three years and the balance over 17 years. The NFL is a $10-billion-a-year industry.\n\n\"While this (the settlement) might look like a lot of money at first blush, in reality it's not a lot of money, because they're not making the payment now,\" Kaplen said.\n\n\"When you purchase an annuity policy to make payments over 17 years, the cost to the NFL will be significantly less than what they are saying the settlement value is.\"\n\nKaplen said that, depending on the schedule of payments, he figured the actual cost could be in $574 million to $661 million range.\n\nKaplen also said he wouldn't settle a case of a person with CTE for $4 million. \"No lawyer in their right mind would settle that kind of case for $4 million,\" he said.\n\nRiddell, makers of the official helmet of the NFL, is also being sued by the former players. It was not a party to a settlement. A Riddell spokesman said Wednesday that the firm had no comment on the settlement. Brody said Riddell remains under a gag order and that it must refrain from \"publicly discussing the mediation process.\"\n\nFollow Gary Mihoces on Twitter @ByGaryMihoces.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/08/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/players/2014/10/16/nfl-europe-doesnt-count-in-proposed-concussion-deal/17385147/", "title": "NFL Europe doesn't count in proposed concussion deal", "text": "Gary Mihoces\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nPlayers from the United States once crossed the ocean to play for teams in NFL Europe.\n\nAwards in the tentative settlement of concussion suits against the NFL won't have the same reach -- if the agreement is approved.\n\nSeasons played in NFL Europe won't count in the formula for monetary compensation in the proposed settlement. Former London Monarchs quarterback Preston Jones is among those objecting in court.\n\n\"I have been dealing with depression for probably 15 years now. Anxiety, aggression, memory loss, those types things I've been dealing with and seeing a therapist and psychiatrist for,\" the 44-year-old Jones told USA Today Sports Thursday by phone from Anderson, S.C.\n\nCompensation for players is based on \"eligible seasons\" in the NFL – not NFL Europe, also known at various times from 1991-2007 as the World League of American Football and NFL Europa.\n\nThe settlement does not require former players to prove their conditions are football related, nor does the NFL acknowledge they are.\n\n\"This is extraordinary and makes no rational sense,\" said an objection filed by Jones' attorneys this week in federal court in Philadelphia, where the tentative settlement of suits filed by more than 5,000 former NFL players is under review.\n\n\"The NFL originated and maintained ownership and control of its European league equivalent. … There is no evidence … that effects of repetitive mild traumatic brain injury are less in magnitude or prevalence among NFL players who played in Europe versus the United States.\"\n\nChris Seeger, co-lead counsel for the former players in their consolidated suits against the NFL, was not available Thursday for comment on why those who played in Europe were excluded. But he has said that it was part of the \"give and take\" of negotiations to reach a settlement with the league and that the primary objective was to get help to NFL players.\n\nFrom the early stages, Jones suspected his issues were football related. He now worries about having the brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).\n\n\"I played 21 years going back to when I was 8 years old,'' said the former University of Georgia quarterback. \"So it was a lot of years – and (included) five years of pro football. I figured that might have had something to do with it.\"\n\nJones played one NFL season (1993) as third quarterback for the Philadelphia Eagles. Under the tentative settlement, a player with one eligible NFL season would receive an 80 percent downgrade of any compensation.\n\nAfter being released by the Eagles in training camp in 1994 and the Atlanta Falcons in camp in 1995, Jones played the 1996 and 1997 seasons for NFL Europe in London. He said a knee injury his second season in London ended his career.\n\n\"Back when I played, getting your 'bell rung' was just kind of an everyday thing. It was just something you kind of shook off and went back and played. Nowadays, they keep you out and monitor you,\" Jones said.\n\n\"I did not have a documented concussion. I had several mini-concussions. … I was dazed. … Getting hit, your head hitting the ground, people didn't pay attention to that a lot.\"\n\nUnder the settlement, the estate of an ex-player diagnosed with CTE by an examination of his brain after death could qualify for an award of up to $4 million.\n\nJones' family would not be eligible for that because a former player had to have been diagnosed with CTE prior to July 7, 2014, the date the settlement was approved preliminarily by a federal judge in Philadelphia.\n\nThere are other awards for neurocognitive impairment, should Jones qualify, he would be subject to the 80 percent reduction. If his two seasons in NFL Europe were counted and he had three eligible seasons, the deduction would be 40 percent.\n\nJones could have opted out of the settlement (the deadline was Tuesday). He chose to remain in the settlement, according to his attorney, James Capretz of Newport Beach, Calif.\n\n\"If you opt out of the settlement, the only way to pursue any claim you may have now or in the future is through litigation. … One small ex-NFL player versus the NFL, I don't think I probably need to elaborate on that,\" Capretz said.\n\n\"If the settlement, before it's approved, can be modified or adjusted or amended to take care of this group … that would do what Preston is looking for, for himself and for others similarly situation.\"\n\nJones, who works for a bank in his hometown of Anderson, was not part of any concussion suit against the NFL, but the settlement covers all former NFL players (unless they opt out).\n\nJones said his wife, Katherine motivated him to contact attorneys. \"We've been married almost 19 years now, so she's seen the struggles I've gone through,\" he said.\n\nHe is concerned about CTE.\n\n\"Yeah, I worry about it because of the depression and memory loss,\" he said.\n\nHe still follows football. \"I watch college football and pro football all the time,\" he said.\n\nHe has three children.

He wants to play, so I'm very involved with his coaches and making sure they're getting taught the right way and being on top of any head injuries he may have as he plays football,\" Jones said.\n\nHe said he has another 8-year-old son who'll will also have to wait until he is 10 to play football.\n\nJones said he got involved in the settlement because of his family. \"You start thinking about your family and your wife and kids, so definitely that becomes a big issue,\" he said.\n\n***\n\nFollow Gary Mihoces on Twitter @ByGaryMihoces", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/10/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2022/11/03/nfl-kellen-winslow-sr-settled-brain-injury-claims/8244596001/", "title": "Ex-NFL player Kellen Winslow Sr. recently settled brain injury claims", "text": "Pro Football Hall of Fame tight end Kellen Winslow Sr. reached a $24,750 settlement earlier this year to resolve a workers compensation case in which he claimed to have suffered brain and nervous system injuries from his NFL career with the San Diego Chargers from 1979-1988, according to records obtained by USA TODAY Sports.\n\nWinslow, who turns 65 on Saturday, filed the case with the California Workers’ Compensation Appeals Board in early 2018, claiming to have sustained “repetitive traumas to his head resulting in cognitive and behavioral disorders.” He underwent extensive examinations as part of this claim, with one doctor attributing his complaints of headaches and cognitive disorder to his football career since high school.\n\nWinslow also complained of significant depression and anxiety, as well as problems with his memory, according to the records. A scan of his brain “suggested evidence of organic brain damage,” said one report.\n\n“However, the neuropsychological evaluation did not demonstrate any significant neurocognitive impairments,” said the report from psychologist Serina Hoover in February 2020.\n\nAnother doctor, psychiatrist Lawrence Warick, attributed most of Winslow's psychiatric issues to other non-football factors, such as the legal problems of his namesake son, who also suffered mental problems from head trauma in football, according to his attorneys. Kellen Winslow II, 39, pleaded guilty last year to rape and other sex crimes against five women and is currently in state prison in Tehachapi, California, after being sentenced to 14 years behind bars. Another son, Justin, died at age 23 after a drug overdose in 2006.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nWinslow Sr. filed this case several months before his son was arrested in 2018. But Warick still highlighted these factors in his report of his psychiatric evaluation of Winslow Sr. in January 2020.\n\nThis report and others, obtained from public records, provide a glimpse into the physical and mental health of another aging former football star while also showing how difficult it can be to prove such mental health claims are linked to football alone.\n\nTRADE DEADLINE WINNERS, LOSERS:Bills, Packers miss out on upgrades as Dolphins load up\n\nOPINION:Dolphins' trade for Bradley Chubb puts Miami in win-now mode for first time in decades\n\nMORE:Daniel Snyder hires bank to explore 'potential transactions' with Commanders\n\nThe case was settled between Winslow and the two defendants – the Chargers and the California Insurance Guarantee Association (CIGA), an organization that pays covered claims for insolvent insurance carriers. The defendants disputed his claims but decided to settle with Winslow in June to avoid the costs and risks of further litigation, according to the agreement.\n\nThe conclusions of some doctors also apparently didn’t give Winslow much additional leverage for a larger settlement.\n\nWarick said Winslow did not meet the requirement under the law to show his psychiatric injuries came from work injuries.\n\n“Mr. Winslow did not sustain a psychiatric injury arising out of and caused by his work-related injuries,” Warick’s report stated from January 2020. “A preponderance of the evidence shows that greater than 51% of the cause of his psychiatric injury is not a result of the orthopedic injuries or claimed neurologic injuries.”\n\nWarick also stated Winslow is not disabled on a psychiatric basis, noting then he was giving speeches and working then as an assistant to the president at Madonna University in Michigan.\n\nSignificant non-football factors\n\nBut Warick did state Winslow may have a mood disorder due to his orthopedic problems and chronic pain. Additionally, he wrote that Winslow has dysthymia with bereavement, generally described as persistent low mood.\n\n“It is my impression that this chronic, non-industrial condition was in no way caused or exacerbated by the applicant’s work as a professional football player,” Warick’s report stated. “It should, in fact, be viewed as a significant non-industrial stressor for this applicant.”\n\nWinslow and his attorney didn’t return messages seeking comment.\n\nWinslow’s psychiatric condition still may be considered permanent, according to Warick’s report, but with only 20% of the causation apportioned to “industrial” or football-related factors. The rest of the causation was apportioned to nonindustrial or non-football factors, including the death of one son in 2006 and the criminal proceedings of his other son in 2018 and 2019.\n\n“His prognosis is good,” Warick’s report stated.\n\nWinslow Sr. gave deposition testimony in the case in 2019 when he tried to recall various injuries during his football career. He reported having “head-to-head” collisions in college at Missouri and in high school before that, when “coaches in those days believed in contact practice.” He didn’t recall how many times he was diagnosed with concussions in the NFL. In one game against the Cincinnati Bengals, he said he was hit in the back of the head by an opponent’s knee, which “laid him out on the field.”\n\n“They came and got me,” he said, according to the records. Another time he had a “bright flash of light.”\n\nHe was unconscious “several times when playing for the Chargers,” the report stated. “Half a dozen or so.”\n\nOther injuries from football\n\nHe also has ongoing pain in his head, neck, lower back, hips, shoulder and right knee, which might require replacement, Warick’s report states. In a previous workers’ compensation case, he received $72,000 for his right knee injury, according to the records.\n\nBut the body part issues settled in this case primarily involve the brain and nervous system, along with chronic pain, hypertension, heart disease and headaches.\n\n“Although Mr. Winslow does not have a headache disorder or a cognitive disorder which reaches a ratable level, I would apportion his subjective complaints of headaches and cognitive disorder 50% to playing football in high school and college as well as the specific motor vehicle accident at age 17, and 50% to playing professional football,” said the evaluation signed by doctor Charles Glatstein.\n\nOther doctors did not share Glatstein’s viewpoint.\n\n“I would respectfully disagree with Dr. Glatstein,” said another report by neurologist Kenneth Nudleman. “He did not take into consideration or document (Winslow’s) activities of daily living … Given that he played as a tight end and in a time where he had multiple subconcussive blows, it would be expected with aging that his cognitive problems would gradually evolve. As to any headaches, I did not consider these to be on an industrial basis (related to football) given the more recent onset of the headaches. The dizziness did not rise to the level of impairment.”\n\nNudleman noted he should be monitored for late onset neurocognitive disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.\n\n“Clinically, of course, he does not have this at the present time and he is at risk to develop CTE,” Nudleman wrote, referring to chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a brain disease linked to football head trauma.\n\nWinslow no longer works at Madonna University.\n\nWarick’s report in 2020 also noted several positives about his mental state.\n\n“He likes music,” the report stated. “He plays chess on the internet. He considers himself in the upper echelons of chess players, with a rating of 1800/2300. He plays golf. He listens to audiobooks, documentaries and fiction, and he likes to read.”\n\nFollow reporter Brent Schrotenboer @Schrotenboer.

After all, many of the sport’s most pressing problems appear to have been patched over. But in pursuing short-term fixes that ignore long-term warning signs, the league might be setting itself up for a dramatic fall from grace.\n\nTo be sure, the state of today’s NFL appears strong. The league found a solution of sorts for player protests over the national anthem, and the class action settlement over concussions remains intact, limiting teams’ financial exposure for decades of brain injuries and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) — the “industrial disease” that ultimately will afflict most longtime players. And for all the talk of declining television viewership, pro football remains America’s most-watched sport.\n\nMore broadly, the sport continues its outsized grip on the American imagination. At $14 billion in 2017 income, the NFL is about as big as the markets for soybean exports and craft beer. Yet pro football retains a cultural significance far out of proportion to its revenue. Suburban grandmothers do not don jerseys advertising the names of local microbrews, and there is no fantasy draft for soybean varieties.\n\nFootball is still king, but the throne is unsteady\n\nIn short, pro football remains king in America. But there are good reasons to wonder whether the king is seated on an unsteady throne.\n\nIn 2006, after I successfully sued the NFL’s pension plan on behalf of ex-Steelers great Mike Webster, it opened up a series of questions about “America’s game” that continue to reverberate today. American tastes in popular entertainment are not set in stone, after all. Just ask the owners of newspapers, magazines and broadcast TV franchises. Worrisome signs on the horizon suggest that the NFL’s hold on the U.S. market — and its national psyche — is diminishing as a direct result of the demonstrated links between pro football and brain injuries. Like any early warning, these indicators are weak and their significance is ambiguous. But what do they say about the future?\n\nOne example is the handful of pro players who have chosen to walk away from the game while still in their primes. For decades, the list of players who retired early — and willingly — was short. True, Jim Brown left football after nine seasons, having set every major rushing record. Barry Sanders retired after 10 years in frustration at the Lions’ losing ways. And a handful of other players quit for idiosyncratic reasons.\n\nMore:Football safety not scoring high enough in schools\n\nWe’re working to make football even safer\n\nI'm donating my brain to science for the sake of football and facts. Really.\n\nThe short list is no surprise. From my own work representing NFL retirees, I know that even ex-players who can trace their crippling injuries to the game would still play again if given the chance. Even so, in just the past two years players have chosen to retire for a brand new reason: the future risks from repeated concussions, including CTE.\n\nThe most recent is Joshua Perry, who announced his retirement from the Seahawks weeks ago after his sixth (documented) concussion. He followed Chris Borland and A.J. Tarpley, who both left after one season apiece, each because of concussions.\n\nIt would be easy to shrug off these retirements — what are three players against the 1,500-plus players on the rosters of 32 NFL teams? The Seahawks replaced Perry within a day. But another development puts pro football’s challenges in sharper relief.\n\nFrom 2016-17, the number of high school students playing 11-man football fell by more than 25,000, or over 2 percent, and the decline in high school football participation over five years was even greater, at 3.5 percent.\n\nFourteen states saw drops of 10 percent or more in high school football. By many accounts, this drop in participation is related to the known dangers from concussions and CTE. Simply put, many parents are unwilling to let their children play a sport that risks their long-term well-being.\n\nBoxing was king, until deposed with a punch\n\nAgain, it is possible to dismiss this decline as short-term and not terribly large. Although anecdotes abound of high schools dropping football, the total number of schools playing football has held steady due to modest growth in the South and West. But what if these trends are the first signs of a shift in the culture?\n\nIn 1926, when boxing — not football — was king (the NFL was not formed under that name until 1922), Gene Tunney’s heavyweight victory over Jack Dempsey was banner headline news in The New York Times, which covered it with a half-dozen stories on the front page. Even the Super Bowl does not receive that coverage today: Boxing was one of the top two spectator sports in the 1920s. Today, boxing has dropped far out of the Big Four sports and is at risk of being eclipsed by mixed martial arts and pro wrestling.\n\nWhat happened? The fall of boxing has many causes, but the dawning public appreciation of it as a blood sport is clearly one of them. The death of South Korean boxer Kim Duk Koo at the hands of Ray Mancini in 1982 served to crystallize the problem and led to calls for the sport’s abolition. That didn’t happen, but boxing’s popularity has fallen and will never find its way back to the top.\n\nEver since the Webster case cemented the link between pro football and brain injuries more than a decade ago, the NFL has had a concussion problem. Changes to the rules (and helmets), grudging recognition of the links between football and CTE, and the class action settlement have limited the hit to football’s popular appeal and the NFL’s brand.\n\nPro football’s reign may continue — it takes a lot to dislodge the king, after all. But two decades from now, when we look back on the heyday of NFL football, we are likely to see these events as the beginning of the end.\n\nCyril Smith delivered the first-ever win against the NFL pension plans on behalf of a former player (Mike Webster) and continues to represent many NFL players with Zuckerman Spaeder.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/09/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2015/09/26/lawrence-phillips-seeks-pay-murder-defense-nfl-concussion-settlement/72881424/", "title": "Lawrence Phillips seeks to pay murder defense with NFL ...", "text": "Josh Peter\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nLawrence Phillips, facing first-degree murder charges in the death of his cellmate at Kern Valley (Calif.)

Chamberlain said he is helping Phillips retain Jesse Whitten, a criminal defense attorney in Bakersfield, Calif. who said he expects to represent Phillips in the criminal matter.\n\nChamberlain said he believes that brain trauma Phillips suffered during his football career may have contributed to the former running back’s legal troubles.\n\nEx-NFL RB Lawrence Phillips pleads not guilty to murder of prison cellmate\n\n“It’s a real shame,’’ Chamberlain told USA TODAY Sports. “I’m going to do everything I can to help him.’’\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nPhillips was assigned a deputy public defender Sept. 15 when the former star running back entered a plea of not guilty. But Whitten said he was contacted by Phillips’ mother, Juanita, and then spoke with Chamberlain about how the legal fees that Whitten said could be as much as $200,000 would be paid.\n\nJudge Anita B. Brody approved the settlement for the concussion lawsuit in April, a deal that could provide about 21,000 players with more than $900 million. However, payouts are being delayed by several appeals.\n\nChamberlain, chairman of the Brain Injury Association of American, has been active in the case. He said the settlement money will be not be assured any earlier than Nov. 20, when oral arguments are scheduled to be heard over whether players should be eligible for compensation if in the future they are diagnosed with the degenerative brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).\n\nPhillips, a first-round NFL draft pick in 1996, played three seasons in the league. In estimating Phillips will get $1.4 million, Chamberlain said he used an equation based on the number of games and seasons Phillips played and issues resulting from brain trauma suffered during his NFL career.\n\nChamberlain said Phillips suffered multiple brain injuries in the NFL and at the University of Nebraska, where Phillips starred on national championship teams in 1994 and 1995, and he is waiting for Phillips’ medical records.\n\nWhitten, the defense attorney who works for a law firm near the prison where Phillips is serving a 31-year sentence for assaulting a former girlfriend and driving his car into three teenagers, said he is scheduled to meet with Phillips Thursday.\n\nLawrence Phillips hinted at murder a month before cellmate found dead\n\nT. Allan Rogers, the deputy public defender in Kern County, told USA TODAY Sports Phillips acted in self-defense in the death of his former cellmate, Damion Soward. But Whitten said it could take months to track down witnesses needed to determine what happened.\n\n“It’s anyone’s guess as to what happened in this situation,’’ Whitten said.\n\nOn Friday, the Kern County District Attorney’s office filed a motion for a gag order — “a protective order against publicity,’’ according to a copy of the motion. The exhibits in support of the motion included copies of letters that Phillips wrote to his mother and former coaches and were published by USA TODAY Sports.\n\n“Given the extreme interest in this case,’’ the motion states, “…a protective order is in the best interests of the People and the defendant.’’\n\nA hearing for the motion is set for Oct. 13.

To qualify for compensation, former players do not have to show their conditions are related to NFL football.\n\nIn a statement, Jeff Pash, the NFL's executive vice president and general counsel, said, \"As a result of the settlement, retirees and their families will be eligible for prompt and substantial benefits and will avoid years of costly litigation that — as Judge Brody's comprehensive opinion makes clear — would have an uncertain prospect of success. … We look forward to implementing the terms of the settlement and continuing to work with our players, coaches and medical staffs to enhance the safety and benefits of football.\"\n\nLawyers for the players and their families similarly praised the deal.\n\n\"This is clearly a tremendous moment for the NFL retired player community,\" Seeger said.\n\n\"With over 99 percent participation, it's clear that the retired player community overwhelmingly supports this agreement and is eager to begin taking advantage of its benefits. In fact, throughout this process, the most common question we've heard from retired players has been how quickly can we get help?\"\n\nSome ex-players and their attorneys objected to the settlement in court filings and at a hearing in November. A legal appeal of the final approval seems likely, although Seeger expressed concern that any appeal would significantly delay the process of players and their families receiving benefits.\n\nSteven Molo, a New York attorney for several players who objected to the settlement in court, said he is reviewing Brody's decision to determine next steps.\n\n\"We are pleased that the settlement was substantially improved as a result of objections that we made,\" said Molo, who represents former Pro Bowl guard Alan Faneca and former Super Bowl champion receiver Sean Morey.\n\nMichael Kaplen, a New York attorney who practices brain injury law and teaches a course about it at George Washington University, criticized the settlement for excluding an entire class of players who suffered mild traumatic brain injuries, calling it a \"grave injustice.\"\n\nThough he does not represent any players, he expects an appeal to be filed.\n\n\"I just knew we were in trouble when I attended the hearing and the judge said, 'What is TBI?' I don't know if she really got it at the end of the day,\" Kaplen said. \"It's easy to look at this case in terms of some of these injuries, but unless you look at the big picture, I think unfortunately she missed it. So I'm hopeful that a neutral appellate court will look at the big picture and understand the injustice that was done in this settlement and send it all back because these issues are not settled until they're settled properly. And this issue, unfortunately, has not been settled properly.\"\n\nDuring the settlement process, the deal was adjusted twice at the urging of the judge.\n\nThat included removal of a $675 million cap on what the NFL will pay to players with diagnosed conditions. Both sides said the $675 million was sufficient, but they agreed to make the amount open ended.\n\nDepending on age of diagnosis and years played in the NFL, there are awards of up to $5 million for a diagnosis of ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or Lou Gehrig's Disease), up to $4 million for diagnosis after death with the brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and up to $3.5 million for Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.\n\nThe settlement also included payments of up to $3 million for neurocognitive impairment such as \"moderate dementia\" and up to $1.5 million for conditions such as \"early dementia.\"\n\n\"While nothing can change the reality faced by those who suffer from ALS or other devastating neurocognitive illnesses, this settlement will provide the benefits we need to take care of our families and have the best quality of live we are able to have,\" Kevin Turner, a former running back for Philadelphia and New England and a class representative, said in a statement.\n\n\"I also take comfort in the knowledge that these benefits are guaranteed to be there for all retired players, especially for those who do not know they are going to need them.\"\n\nThe settlement also includes $75 million — or more if needed — for a program of baseline examinations of players for potential brain impairment, counseling and treatment. The $75 million limit was removed at Brody's request.\n\nBeyond the amount of the settlement, the NFL will pay fees to the ex-players' attorneys.\n\nThe judge will have final say in the amounts of the payments, but the parties have agreed not to contest fees up to $112.5 million. The steering committee alone set up to handle the retirees' suits includes lawyers from 15 firms.\n\nAccording to court documents, the settlement will apply to about 25,000 former NFL players, provided they were retired by July 7, 2014 — the date the judge gave preliminary approval to the tentative agreement.\n\nThe settlement class also includes about 9,000 relatives of deceased players.\n\nRetirees had the choice to \"opt out\" of the settlement and retain their rights to continue suits against the league. According to court documents, only about 200 opted out.\n\nAmong those who opted out were former Dallas Cowboys running back Tony Dorsett and the family of late San Diego Chargers/Miami Dolphins/New England Patriots linebacker Junior Seau. In 2012, Seau died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Examination of his brain after his death showed signs of CTE.\n\nThe settlement applies only to retired players. With the settlement, those who filed suits agree to halt their legal actions, provided they did not opt out.\n\nIn coming decades, future retirees could file similar suits.\n\nThey would face the same legal challenges that the NFL presented in the just settled cases. The NFL had argued the players were pre-empted from suing because they were covered by collective bargaining agreements and required to solve disputes through arbitration.\n\nThe NFL also made arguments involving whether players knowingly assumed risks with participation, whether statues of limitations had run out had run out on filing suits and whether there was any proof the players' conditions were linked to NFL football.\n\nIn addition, the NFL's handling of concussions has changed since the decades addressed in the suits. The league now requires concussed players be removed from practice or play and not return until receiving multiple layers of medical clearance. The league has added rules against hits to the head and neck and stiffened penalties, including fines and suspensions. It has added a neurological consultant on the sidelines for games, as well as athletic trainers observing from the press box.\n\nSince 2007, under the 88 Plan administered by the NFL Player Care Foundation has distributed $32 million to ex-players with dementia, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, according to the league.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/04/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/bigten/2023/03/06/4-m-settlement-reached-in-iowa-football-racial-discrimination-lawsuit/11412952002/", "title": "$4M settlement reached in Iowa football racial discrimination lawsuit", "text": "A $4.175 million settlement agreement has been reached in the lawsuit filed by a group of Black former University of Iowa football players who claimed head coach Kirk Ferentz oversaw a racially discriminatory culture.\n\nThe Iowa Department of Management’s State Appeal Board was expected to vote on the settlement Monday afternoon, which would have the Iowa athletics department paying out $2.175 million and the state picking up the remainder.\n\nIowa State Auditor Rob Sand, one of the three appeal board members, said Monday morning he would oppose using taxpayer funds for the settlement unless Iowa athletics director Gary Barta was ousted.\n\nSTAY UP-TO-DATE: Subscribe to our Sports newsletter now!\n\nWhy does Iowa State Auditor oppose the lawsuit settlement?\n\nThe State Appeal Board is a three-member board comprised of the auditor of state, treasurer of state, and director of the department. The board approves or rejects, and pays claims against the state or a state employee, and resolves local budget protests.\n\n\"Under Gary Barta’s leadership at the University of Iowa Athletics Department, we’ve had the Peter Gray scandal plus three instances of discrimination totaling nearly $7 million in damages (setting aside other suits),\" Sand said in a statement to other settlement board members.\n\n\"After the largest settlement (referring to a $6.5 million payout from the discrimination lawsuit surrounding the 2014 firing of former field hockey coach Tracey Greisbaum and retaliation against her partner, Jane Meyer), Barta asserted no wrong was done. Now we have a new matter for $4 million more, and for the first time they want part paid from the taxpayers’ general fund, even though they now collect tens of millions annually thru the Big Ten TV deal.\n\n\"Enough is enough. Clear personal accountability is necessary. I will not support taxpayers funding this settlement unless Gary Barta is no longer employed at the university and forfeits any severance or similar pay. I encourage you to join me. Real accountability will help prevent discrimination, protecting both taxpayers and future victims.\"\n\nWhat's in the Iowa football discrimination lawsuit settlement?\n\nThe key settlement details are as follows:\n\nThe state of Iowa was on the hook to pay $2 million to the plaintiffs, with the Iowa athletics department being responsible for the remaining $2.175 million.\n\nAbout 45.5% of the settlement will go toward attorney's fees of $1,878,750. Another $35,837.41 will go toward unspecified costs. The firm of Tulsa-based civil rights attorney Damario Solomon-Simmons, who was lead counsel for the former players, will be paid the full settlement amount.\n\nTwelve former players signed the settlement agreement Feb. 23:\n\nAkrum Wadley (a former star running back who played at Iowa from 2013 to '17)\n\nJonathan Parker (2013-16)\n\nMarcel Joly (2014-17)\n\nAaron Mends (2014-18)\n\nMaurice Fleming (2012-15)\n\nReggie Spearman (2013)\n\nKevonte Martin-Manley (2010-14)\n\nDarian Cooper (2011-16)\n\nLaron Taylor (2012-14)\n\nBrandon Simon (2016-19)\n\nJavon Foy (2019-20), and\n\nTerrence Harris (2014-16).\n\nThere were 13 players on the initial lawsuit filed in November of 2020, but Andre Harris' name was not included in the settlement for reasons not immediately known. Those 12 players would presumably share the remaining $2,210,412.59 – which amounts to roughly $184,201.05 per player.\n\nThe University of Iowa also will commit $90,000 toward the suing players to obtain graduate school degrees. They would not be required to attend the UI.\n\nThe university also agreed to support mental-health costs for the 12 former players for one year, through March 15, 2024.\n\nThe agreement also stipulates that the university will hire the services of Leonard Moore, a former vice president for diversity at the University of Texas, through at least May 2024 to assist Iowa's five-year Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) plan.\n\n\"The athletic department remains committed to providing an inclusive and welcoming environment for every student-athlete and staff member involved in our program,\" Barta said in a statement provided to the Des Moines Register. \"The Hawkeyes' over-arching goal to win every time we compete, graduate every student-athlete that comes to Iowa, and to do it right, remains our focus.\"\n\nLawsuit stemmed from allegations of mistreatment in Iowa football program\n\nIf approved, Monday's potential settlement would end the legal chapter of what became a national news story on June 5, 2020, when dozens of former players used social media to share their stories of alleged mistreatment under the watch of Ferentz, the longest-tenured active coach at college football's top level.\n\nThe outcry led to the ousting of longtime strength and conditioning coach Chris Doyle through a $1.1 million separation agreement and an outside investigation led by law firm Husch Blackwell, which found that \"the program’s rules perpetuated racial or cultural biases and diminished the value of cultural diversity.\"\n\nThat report became the basis for Solomon-Simmons (a former Oklahoma football player) to lead 13 former players in a suit filed Nov. 13, 2020, that named as defendants the UI; the Board of Regents; Barta; Ferentz and his son, Brian (the Hawkeyes’ offensive coordinator); Doyle; and current strength coach Raimond Braithwaite.\n\nThe players requested $20 million in damages, demanded the firings of Barta and both Ferentzes and sought other measures aimed at improving the treatment of Black players at Iowa.\n\nWhat led to the University of Iowa football lawsuit settlement agreement?\n\nOver the course of two-plus years, many key moments pointed to Monday’s settlement agreement.\n\nThe first big development was a 21-page ruling in May 2021 by Judge Stephanie Rose that removed Barta, Braithwaite and Kirk Ferentz as defendants; dismissed six of the eight counts; and trimmed the number of plaintiffs from 13 to seven, saying ex-players Fleming, Andre Harris, Terrence Harris, Martin-Manley, Spearman and Taylor were outside the four-year statute of limitations to sue.\n\nWhile many aspects of that development favored Kirk Ferentz, the players’ side also claimed victory because two counts of the federal lawsuit (Count I, overseeing a racially hostile environment, and Count IV, deprivation of civil rights) were allowed to continue and put more scrutiny on the behaviors of Doyle and Brian Ferentz.\n\nAt the time, Oregon-based sports-conflict resolution expert Joshua Gordon looked over the case and told the Register. \"I still think this will end with (a) settlement, ultimately. (When) you get into an evidentiary battle, you’re talking big money to defend and deal with depositions and discovery.\"\n\nFrom May 2021:Judge Stephanie Rose's 21-page response sets stage for case\n\nWhile Gordon was proven correct, settlement talks didn’t ramp up for another 18 to 20 months as both sides dug in.\n\nOver the ensuing year, the two sides fought over access to university records, including confidential personnel reports from the Husch Blackwell investigation related to Doyle, Kirk Ferentz, Brian Ferentz and linebackers coach Seth Wallace.\n\nThe state argued it had already provided 200,000 pages of documents and that personnel reports were protected by attorney-client privilege, but on June 24, 2022, Chief U.S. Magistrate Judge Helen Adams ordered UI to turn over all the materials to Solomon-Simmons and his team.\n\nWhile that wrangling took place, a filing by the plaintiffs in April 2022 cranked up the heat.\n\nSolomon-Simmons' team filed a second amended complaint with four new counts, including a retaliation claim against Kirk Ferentz over his treatment of Parker, and sought to restore Barta and Ferentz as defendants while adding Wallace.\n\nA secretly recorded meeting by Parker between him and Ferentz was included in the defense team's public filings. The recording shed light on Ferentz inquiring whether Parker had \"both feet in the circle\" of the program and the coach assigning Parker four hours of community service for throwing a ball toward Brian Ferentz during a special-teams drill.\n\nFrom April 2022:Damario Solomon-Simmons speaks with Register after new developments\n\nA final push, then football season\n\nAfter the order for the UI to turn over all materials, the defense team continued to push Rose to dismiss the case, while the plaintiffs argued that key UI personnel were hiding behind their legal team to avoid depositions.\n\nIn August 2022, Brian Ferentz’s voice was heard through a 537-page filing as he outlined the complaints against him from all seven players, with Wadley being the most prominent. Wadley is Iowa’s No. 5 all-time leading rusher and left the program after the 2017 season with 35 career touchdowns, one shy of Tavian Banks’ school record.\n\nWadley sued Brian Ferentz for $20 million, saying the coach tarnished his reputation. Brian Ferentz replied in his filing that Wadley stopped going to class, thinking he would be taken in the 2018 NFL Draft.\n\nAs stated in the filing, \"Based on 20 years of playing and coaching, B. Ferentz believes that if Wadley were good enough to play professional football, he would have played or be playing, regardless of anything B. Ferentz said or his silence.\"\n\nThen in September 2022, Doyle submitted his own request for a summary judgment and included testimonials of support from more than a dozen people, including nine who are Black and played in the NFL. That list included prominent NFL players such as Mike Daniels, Noah Fant, Micah Hyde, Desmond King and Tristan Wirfs.\n\nDoyle also went through the contentions of each player suing him, including Wadley. The filing stated, \"Mr. Wadley acknowledged under oath that Doyle never used the ‘n’ word, and never said anything about his hair, jewelry, tattoos other than Wadley’s belief that neither Doyle nor Coach Kirk Ferentz liked players wearing hoodies.\"\n\nThen came the rigors of a football season and an even greater spotlight on the Ferentzes, as Brian Ferentz's offense produced the program's worst yardage totals since 1978. Meantime, the legal waiting continued, with depositions for Kirk and Brian Ferentz still on hold.\n\nIn a Dec. 14 filing, both parties requested additional time to file motions to compel and resolve outstanding issues with the discovery process. The original trial date of March 6 was pushed back, and on Feb. 25 the plaintiffs removed Wallace from the case (no specific racial-bias claims ever surfaced about him) \"with prejudice,\" meaning he could not be re-added to the lawsuit.\n\nThree days later, on Feb. 28, the Ferentzes, Doyle and Barta were removed \"without prejudice,\" meaning they could be re-added to the suit, but their removal proved to be a strong indication that a settlement was near.\n\nBy taking them off the case, the power of reaching a settlement lay with the University of Iowa and Board of Regents.\n\nThat settlement agreement arrived on Monday.\n\nHawkeyes columnist Chad Leistikow has covered sports for 28 years with The Des Moines Register, USA TODAY and Iowa City Press-Citizen.

Thomas Lake’s views on football have not changed.\n\nCNN —\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, as third-ranked Georgia played top-ranked Tennessee in the game of the year so far in college football, I was not watching.\n\nIn past years I would’ve been on the couch with my brother, eating pizza and wings, bellowing at the television. Instead I got in the minivan with my wife and kids, and we drove to Zoo Atlanta.\n\nWe got there a few minutes before kickoff, when a lot of people were leaving. Who goes to the zoo during the Georgia game? We do, as it turns out, along with an Amish family, the women in bonnets, the men in straw hats.\n\nIt was a warm and cloudy afternoon, with yellow leaves falling from the pecan trees. A zookeeper told us there are 100,000 muscles and tendons in an elephant’s trunk. I texted my brother to say I was sorry.\n\n“I miss you,” I wrote. “This is just a thing I’m trying.”\n\nThere were lions on a rock, all brothers, we were told, and two were asleep, and the third stood at the edge of the rock, and he kept roaring. It was a lonely sound. We walked away but kept hearing that distant, lonely roar.\n\nI could imagine the sound of the crowd, the brass of the band, the beat of the drums, the feeling that I was a part of something, a joyous participant in one of our nation’s last unifying rituals. A sport both uniquely American and intrinsically violent.\n\nAn overview of Sanford Stadium in Athens, Georgia, during Saturday's game between the University of Georgia Bulldogs and the University of Tennessee Volunteers. David J. Griffin/Icon Sportswire/Getty Images\n\nI still remember when Tim Krumrie’s leg shattered. I was eight years old, watching Super Bowl XXIII at my grandparents’ house, and Krumrie, a defensive lineman for the Cincinnati Bengals, stepped the wrong way while trying to make a tackle and suffered a compound fracture. They showed the replay on TV, and we saw the leg shatter again.\n\nThe game went on. The game always goes on. That was the lesson I learned as an 8-year-old. Nothing will ever stop the game.\n\nMy brother and I were watching two years later when Bo Jackson, one of the greatest athletes of all time, had his left hip dislocated and fractured during a playoff game against the Bengals. Jackson’s football career was over, but the game was not. The Raiders won.\n\nLater that year, Detroit Lions offensive lineman Mike Utley broke his neck when a Rams player fell on him. Although Utley gave a thumbs-up as he left the field, he would be paralyzed for the rest of his life. The game went on. The Lions won, 21-10.\n\nWe kept watching. Our teams were the Georgia Bulldogs and the Atlanta Falcons. I clenched my jaw. I ground my teeth. I screamed. There was this deep, guttural sound, too, this command that would emerge most often in those moments when the other team’s quarterback had the ball, and he was eluding our defenders, and he seemed on the verge of throwing or running for a touchdown.\n\n“COME ON!” I would growl. “GET ‘IM!”\n\nIt was third and goal, the game was tied, and Washington’s Robert Griffin III was running toward the end zone. But the Falcons got him. Linebacker Sean Weatherspoon lowered his shoulder and smashed Griffin’s head. “Legal hit, good hit, great play by Sean Weatherspoon,” a TV analyst said. Griffin left the game. Suffering from a concussion, he was too disoriented to know the score. The game went on. The Falcons won.\n\nBy then it was 2012, and I knew what football could do to a player’s brain. Former Bears quarterback Jim McMahon was only 53 and already showing signs of dementia. His old teammate Dave Duerson, suffering from blurred vision and memory loss, fatally shot himself in the chest at age 50. Postmortem tests showed he had chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a rare brain disorder that appears to be caused by blows to the head.\n\nThe NFL reached a $765 million concussion settlement with more than 4,500 former players and developed a new protocol to detect and treat concussions. The game went on.\n\nMedical staff tend to Miam Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa after he took a hit during a September 29 game against the Cincinnati Bengals. Andy Lyons/Getty Images\n\nYear after year, I told myself I was going to quit. And then September rolled around, and I couldn’t stay away. “COME ON!” I growled at the Georgia defenders chasing Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa during the national championship game in 2018. “GET ‘IM!”\n\nThey got him on first down, forcing a 16-yard loss, but he got up. On 2nd-and-26 he threw deep for the winning touchdown. My son cried.\n\nIn September, playing for the Miami Dolphins, Tagovailoa was slammed to the ground by Bengals lineman Josh Tupou. I heard about it afterwards. It was a horrible sight. Tagovailoa lay on his back, his fingers stiff and crossed at odd angles, an apparent sign of a brain injury. The game went on. The Bengals won.\n\nThis time I was not watching, because I’d finally begun my trial separation from football. I’d been inching toward this decision for a long time. When the Bulldogs’ Lewis Cine hit Florida’s Kyle Pitts so hard in a November 2020 game that I thought one or both of them might be dead, I turned off the TV to protect our children.\n\nEven after that, I kept watching until early 2022, when I finally saw the Bulldogs win a championship. It seemed like a good time to walk away.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon at the zoo, as the Georgia-Tennessee game went on, I saw a green anaconda lying motionless in shallow water. I learned that red spitting cobras can deliver a stream of venom into the eyes of an enemy several feet away. My son did not seem to miss football. He was enthralled with the reptiles. I was there but not really there. Back outside, we heard the lion roar again.\n\nText messages accumulated on the phone in my pocket, a running commentary on the game, keen and amusing observations from people I knew and loved regarding events of which I was unaware. Yes, I felt regret. No, I did not check the score on my phone.\n\nWe left the zoo and drove to Shake Shack. I walked in and looked straight ahead, avoiding the game on the suspended televisions, though I caught a flash of Tennessee orange in my peripheral vision.\n\nBy now it was clear. No matter how much I missed football, football did not miss me. One week in October, all five of the top-rated broadcasts on TV were either NFL games or pregame or postgame shows. The game would go on. Old players and fans would leave, and new ones would replace them.\n\nSomewhere out there were Tim Krumrie and Bo Jackson, Mike Utley and Robert Griffin, men who walked off the field and men who were rolled off on stretchers. They were sacrificed for me, and perhaps for you, in this country’s most popular form of live entertainment.\n\nWe drove home, and I went to my office to start writing. Through the window I could see it was getting dark. More yellow leaves fell from the pecan trees. The room was so quiet. It was almost 6:30, and I did not know the score, or who was winning, or who, if anyone, was broken.", "authors": ["Thomas Lake"], "publish_date": "2022/11/07"}]}

The upcoming launch, which has faced setbacks and delays, has been long-awaited.\n\nBut some are hoping it can wait a little longer.\n\nLeaders of United States' largest tribe of Native Americans sent a letter Dec. 21 to NASA and the U.S. Department of Transportation objecting to plans for human remains to be carried aboard the rocket in order to be laid to rest on the lunar surface. Buu Nygren, president of the Navajo Nation, requested the launch window to be delayed until tribe leaders can meet with NASA and other government leaders to discuss their concerns.\n\nIn response, the White House convened a last-minute meeting Friday with Navajo Nation to discuss their concerns, even if it may be too late to stop or alter the mission.\n\n\"The sacredness of the moon is deeply embedded in the spirituality and heritage of many Indigenous cultures, including our own,\" Nygren said in a statement. “The placement of human remains on the moon is a profound desecration of this celestial body revered by our people.”\n\nThe year ahead in space:A return to the moon and a rare eclipse among 5 great space events on the horizon in 2024\n\nWhat is the Peregrine Mission One?\n\nPittsburgh-based Astrobotic and its Peregrine Mission One is one of two NASA-supported private companies racing to get the U.S. back on the moon this year. The uncrewed commercial missions are a vital part of NASA's hopes of sending astronauts back to the lunar surface itself within the next few years as part of its Artemis program.\n\nHouston’s Intuitive Machines is the second company with lunar ambitions, with aims to launch a lander in mid-February aboard a flight with SpaceX. The two companies each received nearly $80 million in 2019 under a NASA program to develop lunar delivery services, the Associated Press reported.\n\nIt will take Astrobotic two weeks to get to the moon and another month in lunar orbit before a landing is attempted on Feb. 23.\n\nWhen it potentially launches Monday from Cape Canaveral, Florida, Astrobotic's Peregrine lunar lander will be carried on the United Launch Alliance's new Vulcan Centaur rocket along with a variety of scientific instruments developed by NASA.\n\nBut that's not the only cargo slated to be carried aboard the rocket.\n\nTwo private companies, Celestis and Elysium, have also hitched a ride aboard the lunar lander for the cremated human remains and DNA of its customers destined for a cosmic burial. Among them are notable names that include “Star Trek” creator Gene Roddenberry and science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke.\n\nAnother 265 people will be represented on the rocket’s upper stage, which will circle the sun once separated from the lander. They include three original “Star Trek” cast members, as well as strands of hair from three U.S. presidents: George Washington, Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy, the Associated Press has reported.\n\nNavajo Nation says NASA violated commitment to consult tribal leaders\n\nNavajo members and other Indigenous tribes revere the moon as a sacred place, which is why Nygren authored the Dec. 21 letter imploring for the mission to be postponed until his people are consulted.\n\nAccording to Nygren's letter, NASA's decision to authorize human remains to be taken to the moon violates the space agency's previous commitment to notify the Navajo Nation regarding memorial flights involving human remains. That promise dates back to 1998 when NASA sent a polycarbonate capsule containing the ashes of geologist Eugene Shoemaker to rest on the moon.\n\n\"At the time, Navajo Nation President Albert Hale voiced our objections regarding this action,\" Nygren wrote in the letter. \"In response, NASA issued a formal apology and promised consultation with tribes before authorizing further missions carrying human remains to the moon.\"\n\nNygren also contends that President Joe Biden's administration promised to consult with tribal leaders over similar concerns, as outlined in a Jan. 26, 2021 memorandum.\n\nIn a press conference held Friday after meeting with White House and other government officials, Nygren said he reaffirmed that the stance of the Navajo Nation has not changed since 1990s.\n\n“The Navajo Nation holds the moon in such high regard. When it comes to our way of life and our culture, we shouldn’t be transporting human remains or ashes to the moon,” clarifying that humans should be laid to rest where they are born.\n\nNASA claims to have no oversight over commercial payloads\n\nThe upcoming mission, the first launch of the Vulcan Centaur, represents the debut of NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services program.\n\nWith a budget of $2.6 billion in contracts available through 2028, the program will see NASA more often partnering with private companies to help place scientific payloads on the lunar surface, freeing the space agency up to focus on building spacecraft and rockets for deep space missions.\n\nThat also means that NASA is just one customer on the mission with no oversight over exactly what additional payloads are included in commercial flights.\n\nJoel Kearns, a NASA deputy associate administrators, briefly addressed Navajo Nation’s concerns during a pre-launch media briefing Thursday. While he emphasized that NASA is merely contracting with those private companies, he did acknowledge that commercial missions could cause additional controversies as they become more common.\n\n\"With those new opportunities and new ways of doing business, we recognize that some non-NASA commercial payloads can be a cause for concern for some communities,\" Kearns said. \"For our own missions and our own cargo and our own payloads, NASA works to be very mindful of potential concerns for any work that we'll do on the moon.\"\n\nFollowing Kearn's remarks, Nygren issued a new letter Thursday critical of NASA for seeming to suggest it is not responsible for the decisions of commercial entities with which it contracts.\n\n\"While I acknowledge the excitement and progress associated with the first commercial lunar payload service flight, the Navajo Nation holds profound concerns regarding the lack of oversight and regulation of non-NASA commercial payloads,\" Nygren said. \"As stewards of our culture and traditions, it is our responsibility to voice our grievances when actions are taken that could desecrate sacred spaces and disregard deeply held cultural beliefs.\"\n\nCelestis CEO: Navajo concerns not 'compelling'\n\nCelestis has been offering a variety of memorial spaceflights for more than 20 years, which include taking human remains for brief flights to the edge of space before returning them back to Earth.\n\nThe U.S.' renewed interest in lunar missions means that the company can begin offering grieving families with at least $12,995 to spare the opportunity to send their loved ones to the moon, where their cremated remains are interred in flight capsules permanently encased in lunar landers.\n\nCelestis' payload, called Tranquility Flight, includes 66 memorial capsules bound for the lunar surface as \"a permanent tribute to the intrepid souls who never stopped reaching for the stars,\" according to the company's website.\n\nCelestis CEO and co-founder Charles M.

The launch, which had been delayed from Wednesday due to an error with the rocket's methane fuel, comes a little over a month after another American company's lander tried – and failed – to reach the moon.\n\nIf it makes it to the lunar surface, Houston-based Intuitive Machines' spacecraft would also hail the first American moon landing in more than 50 years.\n\nMartian eclipse:Rover captures Red Planet's moon whizzing by sun's outline\n\nWhat to know about the 'Odysseus' mission\n\nIntuitive Machines built the Odysseus spacecraft to carry cargo for NASA and other customers to the lunar surface for its IM-1 mission.\n\nLess than an hour after the Falcon 9 launch, Intuitive Machines reported that its lander had separated from the rocket’s second stage and its systems were operating as planned.\n\nNamed for the Greek hero of Homer's epic poem \"The Odyssey,\" the spacecraft is expected in the days ahead to touch down near the moon's south polar region. While previous American moon missions have landed in the equatorial regions, the south pole holds scientific interest due to the presence of water ice thought to be abundant within its craters.\n\nThe spacecraft, the design of which the company calls a Nova-C, is a 14-foot-tall hexagonal cylinder with six legs. Intuitive Machines will operate the mission from its Nova Control Center in Houston, where flight controllers will monitor the spacecraft's health, send commands and receive data.\n\nThe journey to the moon is expected to take about a week before Odysseus attempts on Feb. 22 to settle onto the lunar surface. If all goes to plan, it will become the first American spacecraft to touch down on the moon’s surface since the final Apollo mission in 1972.\n\n\"We carry with us the collective spirit of perseverance, fueled by the dedication and hard work of everyone on our team,” Intuitive Machines President and CEO Steve Altemus said in a statement ahead of the launch. “Their tireless efforts have brought us to this moment, where we stand on the precipice of history, humbled by the gravity of our mission, yet emboldened by the boundless possibilities that lie ahead.\"\n\nMoon mission comes weeks after failed Peregrine landing\n\nA successful mission would also make Intuitive Machines the first private company to ever land an unmanned spacecraft on the moon after previous efforts have failed.\n\nIn the United States, the Peregrine lander's doomed mission to the moon ended with the spacecraft burning up in Earth's atmosphere days after its Jan. 8 launch.\n\nShortly after the spacecraft designed and operated by Pittsburgh aerospace company Astrobotic separated from the United Launch Alliance's Vulcan rocket, its propulsion began leaking a critical amount of propellant. Astrobotic attempted to salvage the mission by having its probe explore what it could of space, but the malfunction eventually forced the company to abandon its plan.\n\nThe lander may not have been able to touch down on the moon, but NASA still said scientists were able to gather important data on the \"interplanetary environment\" before it was sent on Jan. 18 plummeting to Earth, burning up in the atmosphere.\n\nThe Peregrine lander's mission also drew highly-publicized scrutiny from the Navajo Nation, whose members objected to the human remains it carried on board bound for a lunar burial.\n\nNASA's interest in lunar missions\n\nIf a private company like Intuitive Machines can pull off the mission, it would open the door for NASA to work with more commercial entities on future space endeavors.\n\nBoth Odysseus and Peregrine are part of NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services program, or CLPS. With a budget of $2.6 billion in contracts available through 2028, the program will see NASA more often partnering with private companies to help place scientific payloads on the lunar surface.\n\nAs the primary customer for the Odysseus mission, NASA paid Intuitive Machines $118 million to take its scientific payloads to the moon as it prepares to send astronauts back to the lunar surface for its since-delayed Artemis program. Among the cargo are tools to test plume-surface interactions and measure both radio astronomy and space weather interactions with the lunar surface.\n\nIntuitive Machines also is serving customers like Columbia Sportswear, which is testing a metallic jacket fabric as a thermal insulator on the lander, as well as sculptor Jeff Koons, who is sending up 125 inch-sized moon figurines in a see-through cube, according to reporting from the Associated Press.\n\nThe mission, and others like it ahead, is intended to pave the way for human exploration of the moon.\n\nNASA delayed plans for Artemis II until 2025, which is when a group of spacefarers could finally embark on a 10-day trip circumnavigating the moon. The mission would be the precursor to Artemis III years later, when another crew of astronauts will set out to land on the lunar surface itself.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe Artemis I mission — a 25½-day uncrewed test flight around the moon meant to pave the way for future astronaut missions — came to a momentous end as NASA’s Orion spacecraft made a successful ocean splashdown Sunday.\n\nThe spacecraft finished the final stretch of its journey, closing in on the thick inner layer of Earth’s atmosphere after traversing 239,000 miles (385,000 kilometers) between the moon and Earth. It splashed down at 12:40 p.m. ET Sunday in the Pacific Ocean off Mexico’s Baja California.\n\nThis final step was among the most important and dangerous legs of the mission.\n\nBut after splashing down, Rob Navias, the NASA commentator who led Sunday’s broadcast, called the reentry process “textbook.”\n\n“I’m overwhelmed,” NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said Sunday. “This is an extraordinary day.”\n\nThe capsule then spent six hours in the Pacific Ocean, with NASA collecting additional data and running through some tests before the rescue team moved it. That process, much like the rest of the mission, aims to ensure the Orion spacecraft is ready to fly astronauts.\n\nThe capsule is expected to spend less time in the water during crewed mission, perhaps less than two hours, according to Melissa Jones, the recovery director for this mission.\n\nA fleet of reovery vehicles — including boats, a helicopter and a US Naval ship called the USS Portland — were waiting nearby.\n\nA NASA Twitter account confirm the capsule was on the USS Portland at 6:40 pm ET.\n\nArtemis I recovery update: @NASA_Orion is now in the well deck of the USS Portland. Teams with EGS and the DoD continue to make progress to safely secure the spacecraft. pic.twitter.com/EpslFMPLe6 — NASA's Exploration Ground Systems (@NASAGroundSys) December 11, 2022\n\n“This was a challenging mission,” NASA’s Artemis I mission manager, Mike Sarafin, told reporters Sunday afternoon. “And this is what mission success looks like.”\n\nWhat happened\n\nThe spacecraft was traveling about 32 times the speed of sound (24,850 miles per hour or nearly 40,000 kilometers per hour) as it hit the air — so fast that compression waves caused the outside of the vehicle to heat to about 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit (2,760 degrees Celsius).\n\n“The next big test is the heat shield,” Nelson had told CNN in a phone interview Thursday, referring to the barrier designed to protect the Orion capsule from the excruciating physics of reentering the Earth’s atmosphere.\n\nThe extreme heat also caused air molecules to ionize, creating a buildup of plasma that caused a 5½-minute communications blackout, according to Artemis I flight director Judd Frieling.\n\nINTERACTIVE: Trace the path Artemis I will take around the moon and back\n\nAs the capsule reached around 200,000 feet (61,000 meters) above the Earth’s surface, it performed a roll maneuver that briefly sent the capsule back upward — sort of like skipping a rock across the surface of a lake.\n\nThere are a couple of reasons for using the skip maneuver.\n\n“Skip entry gives us a consistent landing site that supports astronaut safety because it allows teams on the ground to better and faster coordinate recovery efforts,” said Joe Bomba, Lockheed Martin’s Orion aerosciences aerothermal lead, in a statement. Lockheed is NASA’s primary contractor for the Orion spacecraft.\n\n“By dividing the heat and force of reentry into two events, skip entry also offers benefits like lessening the g-forces astronauts are subject to,” according to Lockheed, referring to the crushing forces humans experience during spaceflight.\n\nAnother communications blackout lasting about three minutes followed the skip maneuver.\n\nAs it embarked on its final descent, the capsule slowed down drastically, shedding thousands of miles per hour in speed until its parachutes deploy. By the time it splashed down, Orion was meant to be traveling about 20 miles per hour (32 kilometers per hour). NASA officials, however, did not yet have an exact splashdown speed at a 3:30 pm ET press conference.\n\nThe temperature in the Orion crew cabin maintained balmy temperatures between 60 degrees to 71 degrees Fahrenheit based on data, Howard Hu, NASA’s Orion Program manager, observed.\n\nWhile there were no astronauts on this test mission — just a few mannequins equipped to gather data and a Snoopy doll — Nelson, the NASA chief, has stressed the importance of demonstrating that the capsule can make a safe return.\n\nThe space agency’s plans are to parlay the Artemis moon missions into a program that will send astronauts to Mars, a journey that will have a much faster and more daring reentry process.\n\nThe Orion capsule captures a view of the lunar surface, with Earth in the background lit in the shape of a crescent by the sun. NASA\n\nOrion traveled roughly 1.3 million miles (2 million kilometers) during this mission on a path that swung out to a distant lunar orbit, carrying the capsule farther than any spacecraft designed to carry humans has ever traveled.\n\nA secondary goal of this mission was for Orion’s service module, a cylindrical attachment at the bottom of the spacecraft, to deploy 10 small satellites. But at least four of those satellites failed after being jettisoned into orbit, including a miniature lunar lander developed in Japan and one of NASA’s own payload that was intended to be one of the first tiny satellites to explore interplanetary space.\n\nOn its trip, the spacecraft captured stunning pictures of Earth and, during two close flybys, images of the lunar surface and a mesmerizing “Earth rise.”\n\nNelson said if he had to give the Artemis I mission a letter grade so far, it would be an A.\n\n“Not an A-plus, simply because we expect things to go wrong. And the good news is that when they do go wrong, NASA knows how to fix them,” Nelson said. But “if I’m a schoolteacher, I would give it an A-plus.”\n\nWith the success of the Artemis I mission, NASA will now dive into the data collected on this flight and look to choose a crew for the Artemis II mission, which could take off in 2024. The crew announcement is expected in early 2023, NASA officials said Sunday afternoon.\n\nArtemis II will aim to send astronauts on a similar trajectory as Artemis I, flying around the moon but not landing on its surface.\n\nThe Artemis III mission, currently slated for a 2025 launch, is expected to put boots back on the moon, and NASA officials have said it will include the first woman and first person of color to achieve such a milestone.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/12/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/26/world/dart-mission-nasa-scn/index.html", "title": "NASA's DART mission successfully slams into an asteroid | CNN", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nA NASA spacecraft has intentionally slammed into an asteroid in humanity’s first test of planetary defense.\n\nThe impact occurred at 7:14 p.m. ET greeted by cheers from the mission team in Laurel, Maryland. The DART mission, or the Double Asteroid Redirection Test, launched 10 months ago.\n\nWhile the asteroid, Dimorphos, was not at risk of impacting Earth, this demonstration could determine how to deflect space rocks that could pose a threat to Earth in the future.\n\n“We’re embarking on a new era of humankind, an era in which we potentially have the capability to protect ourselves from something like a dangerous, hazardous asteroid impact,” said Lori Glaze, director of NASA’s Planetary Science Division. “What an amazing thing. We’ve never had that capability before.”\n\nA detailed view of Dimorphos can be seen seconds before the DART spacecraft hit the asteroid. NASA\n\nAt the time of impact, Didymos and Dimorphos were relatively close to Earth – within 6.8 million miles (11 million kilometers). The team estimates that the spacecraft hit the asteroid at a point about 55 feet (17 meters) away from the space rock’s center.\n\nThe goal of the spacecraft, in addition to impact, is to affect the motion of an asteroid in space, but DART team members say it will take about two months for scientists to determine if the asteroid’s orbit changed.\n\nThe mission is heading for Dimorphos, a small moon orbiting the near-Earth asteroid Didymos. The asteroid system poses no threat to Earth, NASA officials have said, making it a perfect target to test out a kinetic impact – which may be needed if an asteroid is ever on track to hit Earth.\n\nThe event will be the agency’s first full-scale demonstration of deflection technology that can protect the planet.\n\n“For the first time ever, we will measurably change the orbit of a celestial body in the universe,” said Robert Braun, head of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory’s Space Exploration Sector.\n\nINTERACTIVE: One spacecraft’s journey to test Earth’s planetary defenses\n\nNear-Earth objects are asteroids and comets with orbits that place them within 30 million miles (48.3 million kilometers) of Earth. Detecting the threat of near-Earth objects, or NEOs, that could cause grave harm is a primary focus of NASA and other space organizations around the world.\n\nCollision course\n\nAstronomers discovered Didymos more than two decades ago. It means “twin” in Greek, a nod to how the asteroid forms a binary system with the smaller asteroid, or moon. Didymos is nearly half a mile (0.8 kilometer) across.\n\nMeanwhile, Dimorphos is 525 feet (160 meters) in diameter, and its name means “two forms.”\n\nOn the day of impact, images taken by DRACO will not only reveal our first look at Dimorphos, but the spacecraft will use them to autonomously guide itself for an encounter with the tiny moon.\n\nDuring the event, these images will stream back to Earth at a rate of one per second, providing a “pretty stunning” look at the moon, said Nancy Chabot, planetary scientist and DART coordination lead at the Applied Physics Laboratory.\n\nAt the time of impact, Didymos and Dimorphos will be relatively close to Earth – within 6.8 million miles (11 million kilometers).\n\nThe spacecraft will accelerate at about 15,000 miles per hour (24,140 kilometers per hour) when it collides with Dimorphos.\n\nThe DART spacecraft also revealed what Dimorphos looks like for the very first time.\n\n“It looks adorable, it’s so cute,” said Carolyn Ernst, DRACO Instrument Scientist at the Johns Hopkins University’s Applied Physics Lab. “It looks in a lot of ways like some of the other small asteroids we’ve seen.”\n\nThe egg-shaped asteroid’s surface, covered in boulders, looked similar to Bennu and Ryugu, two other asteroids that were visited by spacecraft in recent years. The scientists suspect that Dimorphos is a rubble pile asteroid made of loosely bound rocks.\n\nThe team is eager to learn more about the impact crater left behind, which they estimate to be about 33 to 65 feet (10 to 20 meters) in size. There may even be shattered pieces of the spacecraft in the crater.\n\nIt aims to crash into Dimorphos to change the asteroid’s motion in space, according to NASA. This collision will be recorded by LICIACube, or Light Italian CubeSat for Imaging of Asteroids, a companion cube satellite provided by the Italian Space Agency.\n\nThe briefcase-size CubeSat hitched a ride with DART into space. It recently deployed from the spacecraft and is traveling behind it to record what happens.\n\nThree minutes after impact, the CubeSat will fly by Dimorphos to capture images and video. The video, while not immediately available, will be streamed back to Earth in the weeks and months following the collision.\n\nProtecting the planet\n\nDimorphos was chosen for this mission because its size is relative to asteroids that could pose a threat to Earth. The spacecraft is about 100 times smaller than Dimorphos, so it won’t obliterate the asteroid.\n\nThe fast impact will only change Dimorphos’ speed as it orbits Didymos by 1%, which doesn’t sound like a lot – but it will change the moon’s orbital period.\n\nAn illustration shows NASA's DART spacecraft and the Italian Space Agency's LICIACube before the collision with Dimorphos. Steve Gribben/Johns Hopkins APL/NASA\n\n“Sometimes we describe it as running a golf cart into a great pyramid or something like that,” Chabot said. “But for Dimorphos, this really is about asteroid deflection, not disruption. This isn’t going to blow up the asteroid; it isn’t going to put it into lots of pieces.”\n\nThe nudge will shift Dimorphos slightly and make it more gravitationally bound to Didymos – so the collision won’t change the binary system’s path around the Earth or increase its chances of becoming a threat to our planet, Chabot said.\n\nDimorphos completes an orbit around Didymos every 11 hours and 55 minutes. After the impact, that may change to 11 hours and 45 minutes, but follow-up observations will determine how much of a shift occurred.\n\nAstronomers will use ground-based telescopes to observe the binary asteroid system and see how much the orbital period of Dimorphos changed, which will determine if DART was successful.\n\nSpace-based telescopes such as Hubble, Webb and NASA’s Lucy mission will also observe the event.\n\nIn four years, the European Space Agency’s Hera mission will arrive to study Dimorphos, measuring physical properties of the moon, and look at the DART impact and the moon’s orbit.\n\nNo asteroids are currently on a direct impact course with Earth, but more than 27,000 near-Earth asteroids exist in all shapes and sizes.\n\nThe valuable data collected by DART and Hera will contribute to planetary defense strategies, especially the understanding of what kind of force can shift the orbit of a near-Earth asteroid that could collide with our planet.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/09/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/world/artemis-nasa-moon-mission-walkup-scn/index.html", "title": "Historic NASA moon mission troubleshoots fuel leak ahead of ...", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe historic Artemis I mission — an uncrewed test flight around the moon that will make use of the most powerful operational rocket in the world — could finally take flight this week, though the team is once again troubleshooting some issues in the lead-up to launch.\n\nThe NASA mission team began fueling the rocket Tuesday afternoon at Kennedy Space Center in Florida ahead of another launch attempt, which comes after weeks of battling various technical problems and setbacks that included the rocket withstanding a Category 1 hurricane. For hours, the fueling appeared to go smoothly, progressing further into the countdown than the two previous launch attempts.\n\nThen, around 9:30 p.m. ET, intermittent leaks began to spring up that were occasionally above the threshold NASA officials hoped to see.\n\n“Teams have advised launch director Charlie Blackwell-Thompson that there’s not a lot they can do from here if (the leak readings) were to go back up” above the safety threshold, NASA spokesperson Derrol Nail said on the agency’s official livestream for the launch.\n\nThose leaks then forced a halt to fueling the tanks involved, and NASA deployed a “red crew” — a group of personnel specially trained to make repairs while the rocket is loaded with propellant. They tightened some nuts and bolts in the hopes of stopping the leak.\n\nThat work finished just before 11 p.m. ET, according to Nail, and the fueling operations resumed.\n\nThen, the Eastern Range, a branch of the military that supports NASA by providing weather forecasting and tracking data after launch, said that one of its radars had gone down, according to Nail. The problem was a faulty ethernet switch that took more than an hour to replace, and testing on that fix is still underway.\n\nThe mission is still scheduled to kick off overnight, with liftoff from Kennedy Space Center set to occur anytime within a two-hour launch window that opened at 1:04 a.m. ET Wednesday. Given all the issues that surfaced Tuesday evening, NASA could not move ahead with launch right at 1:04 a.m. ET — but it’s not yet clear how deep into the launch window liftoff may occur.\n\nThe public can follow along with the mission by catching NASA’s live stream or, for those in the vicinity of the launch site, by looking skyward from various public beaches and viewing spots if the rocket takes flight.\n\nThe launch attempt kicked off just days after Hurricane Nicole barreled through Florida, bringing winds of up to 100 miles per hour (87 knots) to the launchpad area. By the time it became clear the storm was bound to grow into a threat, there wasn’t enough time to get the rocket back indoors, the space agency said.\n\nThe rocket sustained only minor damage, according to NASA, including a 10-foot (3-meter) strip of caulking that came loose on the Orion spacecraft. Technicians have also been checking an electrical connection on what’s called a tail service mast umbilical, a 33-foot-tall (10-meter-tall) structure that links to the rocket’s engine area while it sits on the launchpad.\n\nThe NASA Space Launch System rocket is seen at Kennedy Space Center on November 15, ahead of the Artemis I launch. Emre Kelly/Florida Today/USA Today\n\n“We’re still seeing some funnies on that particular umbilical,” but engineers have other sources that can provide the same information as the connector, said Mike Sarafin, Artemis I mission manager.\n\nAnd while there is “a small likelihood” that caulking could dislodge during launch, the Artemis team determined it was within an acceptable range of risks, Sarafin said.\n\nThat caulking proved to be yet another issue that was brought up in the final hours before launch. Just after 1 a.m. ET — as the countdown clock was on hold at T-10 minutes — a final analysis confirmed the risk was acceptable, even if some of the caulking does fly off, Nail said.\n\nIf the mission takes off, viewers can expect a dazzling display as the Space Launch System, or SLS, rocket fires up its four main engines and two side boosters to become airborne and blaze across the night sky en route to the cosmos. The Orion spacecraft will ride atop the rocket and break away after reaching space. Orion is designed to carry humans, but its passengers for this test mission will be of the inanimate variety, including some mannequins collecting vital data to help future crews.\n\nAfter reaching orbit, the spacecraft is expected to embark on a journey around the moon, traveling roughly 1.3 million miles (2 million kilometers) over the course of about 25 and a half days. Orion will then splash down in the Pacific Ocean on December 11 off the coast of San Diego, where recovery teams will be waiting nearby to haul it to safety.\n\nThe aim of the mission is to gather troves of data for NASA engineers and to prove that the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft perform as expected before astronauts are allowed on board.\n\nArtemis I is just the first in what’s expected to be a long series of increasingly difficult missions as NASA works toward its goal of establishing a permanent outpost on the moon. Artemis II will follow a similar path as Artemis I but will have astronauts on board. Artemis III, slated for later this decade, is expected to land a woman and a person of color on the lunar surface for the first time. That mission will target the moon’s south pole, where permanently shadowed regions may harbor ice and other resources that could sustain astronauts during long moonwalks.\n\nWhat to watch for\n\nWeather is always a wild card when it comes to launching from Florida, but forecasters said Tuesday evening that conditions are expected to be 90% favorable in the early hours of Wednesday morning.\n\nIssues with leaky fuel may also sound familiar. The Artemis I mission team has run into trouble previously with leaks springing up while loading the rocket with superchilled liquid hydrogen, a central issue in the first two Artemis launch attempts (and the decision to scrap those attempts). After the most recent try in September, NASA did some troubleshooting and put the rocket through a fueling test. That test didn’t go exactly as planned, but the space agency deemed it a success and quickly moved to planning its next launch attempt.\n\nAs the hours-long fueling process began, NASA moved forward with what it has called a “kinder, gentler” approach to loading the fuel, a slower method employed in the hopes of avoiding the leaks. No major issues were reported as of 9 p.m. ET as the countdown clock ticked lower than it had during any previous Artemis I launch attempts. It was only after the SLS rocket’s core stage, the massive orange part of the rocket, was completely filled with fuel and merely needed to be continuously “topped off” that problems arose.\n\nOfficials were questioned during a news conference last week whether they intended to tighten nuts and bolts that may have been at the root of the fuel leak and that the “red crew” was sent in to address at the launchpad.\n\nBut Jim Free, NASA’s associate administrator for the exploration systems development mission directorate, said they did not.\n\n“That’s not in the current timeline,” Free said.\n\nIf NASA moves forward with liftoff, some of the most crucial moments of the journey will occur shortly after the towering orange rocket clears the pad.\n\nThe rocket will experience Max Q — an aerospace term that essentially means the rocket is enduring the maximum amount of stress that it must on its way to orbit — about a minute after takeoff. Then, the rocket will begin intentionally shedding parts, which will fall away from the Orion spacecraft and into the ocean, until a single engine remains attached to the gumdrop-shaped capsule.\n\nThat rocket engine will have to conduct some crucial burns to get Orion on the right path, including a very brief firing about 50 minutes after launch and another 20-minute-long burn a half-hour later. Two hours into the mission, the capsule will separate from the large rocket engine and rely solely on small, onboard thrusters to steer for the remainder of the trek.\n\nThis a test mission, but NASA — and the corporate contractors that helped build the $4.1 billion SLS — have a lot riding on it.\n\nThe rocket’s development has been billions of dollars over budget and years behind schedule, and it has faced staunch detractors and criticism over its ballooning costs that have made it far more expensive than initial projections.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nThree astronauts lifted off to China’s nearly completed space station on Tuesday, marking the beginning of the country’s long-term presence in space.\n\nIt’s a major achievement for China’s ambitious space program, which has explored the far side of the moon and Mars. The milestone also means the aging International Space Station’s role as the sole venue for continuous human occupancy in Earth’s orbit is coming to an end.\n\nThe three astronauts launched aboard the Shenzhou-15 spacecraft at 11:08 p.m. local time (10:08 a.m. ET) on Tuesday from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the Gobi Desert, Inner Mongolia. The Shenzhou-15 spacecraft is expected to dock with the Tiangong Space Station about 6.5 hours after launch.\n\nThe arrival of the three astronauts — Fei Junlong, Deng Qingming and Zhang Lu — will mark the first crew rotation on the space station, with two teams overlapping for five to 10 days before the Shenzhou-14 crew, who landed at the station in June, returns to Earth.\n\nThe Shenzhou-15 mission will finish the orbital outpost’s construction, expected by the end of December, and launch the first stage of “its application and development,” Ji Qiming, assistant to the China Manned Space Agency director, said at a press conference on Monday, according to state media Xinhua.\n\nDuring the mission, according to state media, the crew will also conduct more than 40 experiments and tests in the fields of space science research, space medicine and space technology, as well as three to four extravehicular activities — performed by astronauts in space suits.\n\n(From left) Chinese astronauts Zhang Lu, Deng Qingming and Fei Junlong attend a prelaunch ceremony at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center on November 29. VCG/Getty Images\n\nSmaller than the ISS\n\nOnce construction is completed, the space station is expected to last for 15 years. China plans to launch two crewed missions and two cargo missions to the station every year, according to the CMSA.\n\nTiangong, which means heavenly palace, is smaller than the International Space Station but similar in its modular design. The new space station will typically house three rather than six astronauts.\n\nOfficials at NASA have said it will retire the ISS, which is a collaboration between the US, Russia, Japan, Canada and the European Space Agency, in 2030.\n\nHowever, Russia has threatened to quit the ISS starting in 2024, which would make operating the ISS difficult, said Dr. Stefania Paladini, a reader in economics and global security at Birmingham City University in the United Kingdom.\n\n“There is no clarity about the future of the ISS after 2024. While the US seems committed to extend its life until 2030, Russia threatened to withdraw its participation after that date, (which would) make it extremely challenging to continue flying the ISS,” said Paladini, author of “The New Frontiers of Space: Economic Implications, Security Issues and Evolving Scenarios.”\n\n“The Chinese Space Station may … end up remaining the only human presence in Earth’s orbit for a while.”\n\nInternational collaboration\n\nThe new space station is expected to host around 1,000 scientific experiments during its life span.\n\nMost of the experiments taking place on board the Tiangong will involve research originating from China, but the country has invited experiments from international researchers, including how cancer tumors react to zero gravity.\n\nChina’s astronauts have long been excluded from the ISS, due to US political objections and legislative restrictions. However, CMSA astronauts have trained with their counterparts at the European Space Agency.\n\nIt’s not clear whether China would welcome astronauts from other countries to its space station, but Molly Silk, a doctoral researcher at the University of Manchester in the UK focused on China’s space program, said she thought it very likely that international astronauts would visit in the coming years.\n\n“Several European astronauts have been learning Chinese in order to better cooperate with their Chinese counterparts, which suggests that a visit to the CSS could be on the cards. Pakistan has also been trying to coordinate with China to send their first astronaut to space,” she said.\n\n“This project demonstrates to the world that China has both the vision and capabilities to pull off such an immensely challenging feat. The CSS will not only allow for China and other nations to conduct experiments in space, but acts as an important checkpoint for China’s planned international research base on the moon.”\n\nDebris risks\n\nEarlier this year, the space station’s two laboratory modules — Wentian and Mengtian — docked along the Tianhe core cabin, the main living space for the astronauts.\n\nThe Mengtian lab was launched by China’s massive Long March 5B rocket, remnants of which made an uncontrolled reentry into Earth’s atmosphere in early November.\n\nIt was the fourth uncontrolled reentry for a Long March 5B rocket since China’s space agency started flying it two years ago, as the vehicle was designed without the necessary equipment to steer itself to a safe landing.\n\nOfficials at NASA have slammed China for taking unnecessary risks. However, Tuesday’s launch involved China’s smaller Long March-2F rocket, used for human space flight, which experts have previously said is less likely to produce hazardous debris.", "authors": ["Katie Hunt Alex Stambaugh", "Katie Hunt", "Alex Stambaugh"], "publish_date": "2022/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/22/world/artemis-1-moon-rocket-apollo-explainer-scn/index.html", "title": "Why NASA is using Artemis I to return to the moon | CNN", "text": "Turn to CNN for live coverage from Kennedy Space Center in Florida this week. Space correspondent Kristin Fisher will bring us moment-by-moment reporting from the launch, along with a team of experts.\n\nCNN —\n\nIt’s time to go back to the moon.\n\nAlmost 50 years after the last Apollo mission ventured to the lunar surface, NASA has established a program that promises to land humans on unexplored lunar regions and eventually the surface of Mars – and it all begins with Artemis I.\n\nIt’s no coincidence that the Artemis program is named for the twin sister of Apollo from Greek mythology. Artemis will pick up where the famed Apollo program left off in 1972 by sending crewed missions to the moon, but in a new way.\n\nGoals of the Artemis program include landing diverse crews of astronauts on the moon and exploring the shadowy lunar south pole for the first time. The ambitious effort also aims to establish a sustained presence on the moon and create reusable systems that can enable human exploration of Mars and perhaps beyond.\n\nBut none of this is possible without first taking one big leap. When Artemis I launches on November 16, the uncrewed mission will test every new component that will make future deep space exploration possible before humans make the journey in 2024 and 2025 aboard Artemis II and Artemis III, respectively.\n\nThe mission team expects liftoff of the new Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft on Wednesday from Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\n\nAfter launching from Earth, Artemis I will go on a 25.5-day mission. During the journey, the Orion spacecraft will travel 40,000 miles (64,000 kilometers) beyond the moon – 30,000 miles (48,000 kilometers) farther than the record set during Apollo 13. This path mimics the journey that the Artemis II crew will take in 2024.\n\nIt will be the farthest that any spacecraft built for humans has flown, according to NASA officials.\n\nHistoric launchpad 39B is no stranger to monster rockets, as NASA Administrator Bill Nelson pointed out at a news conference earlier in August. It was once the home of the Saturn V rocket, which carried the Apollo missions to the moon and lifted off with 7.6 million pounds of thrust. The SLS rocket will punch off the pad with 8.8 million pounds of thrust.\n\n“As we embark on the first Artemis test flight, we recall this agency’s storied past, but our eyes are focused not on the immediate future but out there,” Nelson said.\n\n“It’s a future where NASA will land the first woman and the first person of color on the moon. And on these increasingly complex missions, astronauts will live and work in deep space and we’ll develop the science and technology to send the first humans to Mars.”\n\nA new generation of exploration\n\nReturning to the moon, with an eye on an eventual trip to Mars, requires a new ride.\n\nLessons learned from the Apollo and shuttle programs informed the design of the Space Launch System rocket, the world’s most powerful rocket. The mega moon rocket will propel the spacecraft almost 1,000 times farther than the International Space Station’s location in low-Earth orbit. The SLS rocket will boost Orion to a speed of 22,600 miles per hour (36,370 kilometers per hour) to escape Earth’s gravity and reach the moon.\n\n“It’s the only rocket that’s capable of sending Orion and a crew and supplies into deep space on a single launch,” said John Honeycutt, Space Launch System program manager at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.\n\nAtop the rocket is the Orion spacecraft, designed to carry a crew through deep space and safely return the astronauts to Earth.\n\nThe spacecraft has a crew module, a service module and a launch abort system that has the capability to take the spacecraft and its crew to safety during any emergency that could occur during launch or ascent. Orion’s trajectory through space will test the craft’s ability to maintain communication with Earth beyond the moon and protect its crew from radiation.\n\nBeneath Orion is the European Service Module.\n\n“It’s the power house side of the vehicle where it’s got the primary propulsion, power and life support resources we need for Artemis I,” said Howard Hu, Orion program manager at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston.\n\nThe Orion spacecraft has hardware and software that will allow future crews to have complete insight into what’s happening with their vehicle when they are thousands of miles from home, Hu said.\n\nOne of the biggest trials for Orion may be testing its heat shield, the largest one ever built.\n\nWhen the spacecraft returns to Earth in October, it will face temperatures half as hot as the sun’s surface and hit the top of Earth’s atmosphere at 25,000 miles per hour (40,200 kilometers per hour) – that’s 32 times the speed of sound, Nelson said.\n\n“Orion will come home faster and hotter than any spacecraft has before at 32 Mach,” Nelson said. “On the space shuttle, we were at 25 Mach, which is about 17,500 miles an hour (28,160 kilometers per hour).” (Mach 1 is the speed of sound.)\n\nThe heat shield has been tested on Earth, but returning from space is the one true test that simulations can’t completely replicate.\n\n“Re-entry will be great to demonstrate our heat shield capability, making sure that the spacecraft comes home safely, and of course for future missions, protecting the crew,” Hu said.\n\nThe ultimate test\n\nAll of the objectives for the inaugural Artemis flight will demonstrate capabilities necessary for when Orion carries humans to deep space. The list includes an overall safe flight, the performance of the SLS rocket, testing the heat shield and retrieving the spacecraft once it splashes down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of San Diego.\n\nOrion won’t carry a crew on this initial mission, but it will be full of data from the flight – including sensors attached to some very necessary passengers. Three mannequins will ride aboard Artemis I to simulate what humans might experience, and the data from their sensors will reveal how much vibration they experienced, as well as radiation exposure and the utility of their flight suits and radiation vests.\n\nBecause Artemis I is a test flight, the Artemis team is willing to take more risks, said Mike Sarafin, NASA’s Artemis I mission manager. Taking these risks now can eliminate issues when actual crew are aboard, he said.\n\nBut more than all of the data and science the mission team will garner is the idea of resuming human space exploration by taking a big step forward from Apollo to Artemis.\n\n“Artemis I shows that we can do big things things that unite people, things that benefit humanity – things like Apollo that inspire the world,” Nelson said. “And to all of us that gaze up at the moon, dreaming of the day humankind returns to the lunar surface: Folks, we’re here, we are going back and that journey, our journey, begins with Artemis I.”", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/08/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/01/08/ula-vulcan-rocket-launch/72147150007/", "title": "ULA Vulcan launch: Watch liftoff of Peregrine Mission One to moon", "text": "BREVARD COUNTY, Fla. − United Launch Alliance's new red-and-white Vulcan rocket lifted off in the early Monday morning darkness directly on time during its maiden flight from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, propelling the Peregrine robotic lunar lander to its planned Feb. 23 moon landing.\n\n\"It was so exciting.

They include three original “Star Trek” cast members, as well as strands of hair from three U.S. presidents: George Washington, Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy, the Associated Press has reported.\n\nHowever, the inclusion of remains on the moon mission elicited pushback from leaders of United States' largest tribe of Native Americans.

The inaugural mission will test out the new Space Launch System rocket, Orion spacecraft and other components ahead of the crewed Artemis II and Artemis III missions planned for 2024 and 2025.\n\nThe Artemis program is designed to return humans to the moon for the long term and eventually pave the way for crewed missions to Mars.\n\nWhile Artemis II will carry a human crew on a journey around the moon, Artemis III will be the first mission to return humans to the lunar surface since Apollo 17 in 1972.\n\nBut this time, mission astronauts will be venturing somewhere no human has gone before when they explore the lunar south pole.\n\n“It’s a long way away from the Apollo sites,” said Sarah Noble, Artemis lunar science lead for NASA’s Planetary Science Division. “All six Apollo landing sites were in the sort of central part of the near side (of the moon). And now we’re going someplace completely different in ancient geologic terrain.”\n\nReturning to the moon\n\nEach of the 13 regions identified by NASA is home to multiple potential landing sites.\n\n“Selecting these regions means we are one giant leap closer to returning humans to the Moon for the first time since Apollo,” said Mark Kirasich, deputy associate administrator for the Artemis Campaign Development Division at NASA Headquarters, in a statement.\n\n“When we do, it will be unlike any mission that’s come before as astronauts venture into dark areas previously unexplored by humans and lay the groundwork for future long-term stays.”\n\nA NASA rendering shows the 13 potential landing regions for Artemis III. Each region is approximately 9.3 by 9.3 miles (15 by 15 kilometers). NASA\n\nThe regions are all located within six degrees of latitude of the moon’s south pole and all of them have intriguing geologic features, according to NASA officials. And each site corresponds to all of the possible launch opportunities for Artemis III, since landing areas are closely connected to when a spacecraft takes off from Earth.\n\nScientists and engineers across NASA assessed the lunar south pole using data from NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, which has been circling the moon since 2009, as well as other scientific findings.\n\nThe team considered crew safety when evaluating potential landing areas, including accessibility, terrain, lighting and the ability for crews to communicate with Earth.\n\nThe 13 possible landing sites will be illuminated by sunlight over the course of the six-and-a-half days planned for the Artemis III surface excursion. Sunlight is key when considering the return of humans to the moon because it can provide a power source and protect astronauts from extreme temperature variations that take place there.\n\nExploring the unknown\n\nThe moon’s south pole is of interest because it has never been explored by humans before, and its permanently shadowed regions could harbor resources like ice.\n\n“Several of the proposed sites within the regions are located among some of the oldest parts of the Moon, and together with the permanently shadowed regions, provide the opportunity to learn about the history of the Moon through previously unstudied lunar materials,” Noble said.\n\nThe shadowy regions may not have been touched by sunlight for billions of years, Noble said.\n\nThe Artemis III mission has specific science objectives, like landing close enough to a permanently shadowed region for crews to go on a moonwalk, collect samples and carry out scientific analysis to learn more about the composition, depth and amount of water ice there.\n\n“Developing a blueprint for exploring the solar system means learning how to use resources that are available to us while also preserving their scientific integrity,” said Jacob Bleacher, chief exploration scientist for NASA, in a statement.\n\n“Lunar water ice is valuable from a scientific perspective and also as a resource, because from it we can extract oxygen and hydrogen for life support systems and fuel.”\n\nThe Artemis team will refine its site selections after conducting conferences and workshops to receive more input about the potential landing sites, as well as consulting with SpaceX to ensure that the company’s Starship lunar lander could touch down there. The sites will be confirmed once a target launch date has been set for Artemis III.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/08/19"}]}

A few months later, a TikTok influencer with some two million followers shared one of Goodwin’s cards on her account and Goodwin saw her business take off.\n\nGoodwin, now 28, told CNN that more than 90% of her orders currently come from people who discover her business through TikTok. “If it were to get banned, I would see business plummeting,” Goodwin told CNN. “I would lose most of my sales.”\n\nFor much of the past two years, talk of an outright TikTok ban seemed to recede. TikTok outlasted the Trump administration and only saw its popularity continue to grow. It was the top downloaded app in the United States last year, and remains the top downloaded app year-to-date in 2022, according to data from analytics firm Sensor Tower. In the process, TikTok, which said it had 100 million US users as of 2020, became even more central to American culture and to livelihoods of influencers and business owners like Goodwin.\n\nBut suddenly, the future of TikTok in the United States appears more uncertain than at any point since July 2020. A growing number of Republican governors have recently announced bans on TikTok for state employees on government devices, including from multiple states on Thursday alone. State attorneys general and a Republican commissioner at the Federal Communications Commission have each pressured Apple and Google to take tougher measures with the app. And a trio of US lawmakers led by Sen. Marco Rubio, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, introduced a bill earlier this week that once again seeks to block TikTok in the US due to the parent company’s base in China.\n\nCallie Goodwin launched a small business shortly before Trump first said he would ban the app. Two years later, she said a TikTok ban would cause her to \"lose most of my sales.\" Courtesy Callie Goodwin\n\nThe renewed political scrutiny comes amid a broader, ongoing reckoning over the impact that TikTok and other social media platforms have on their youngest users. There have been recent debates over whether TikTok’s content is age-appropriate for teens as well as fears that its algorithms may lead users to potentially harmful subject matter, including posts related to suicide and eating disorders.\n\nAt the same time, TikTok has come under fire in Washington for its ties to China through its parent company. The criticism ramped up earlier this year after a Buzzfeed News report said some US user data has been repeatedly accessed from China, and cited one employee who allegedly said, “Everything is seen in China.” TikTok, for its part, has confirmed US user data can be accessed by some employees in China.\n\nTikTok has been negotiating for years with the US government and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) on a potential deal that addresses the lingering national security concerns and allows the app to continue operating in the United States. Recently, there have been reports of delays in those negotiations.\n\nThe tremendous reach of TikTok may only make it harder to ban the service outright, some national security experts say. Even some TikTok critics have hedged on whether a ban is the right approach. Sen. Josh Hawley, who authored a bill to ban TikTok from US government devices, said this week he would be “fine” if the US government and TikTok reached a deal to safeguard US users’ data. “But if they don’t do that,” Hawley said, “then I think we’re going to have to look at more stringent measures.”\n\nAs lawmakers have renewed calls for tougher action to be taken with the app, some of its users who have built their livelihoods and found a sense of community on the app say they can’t imagine an America without it.\n\nTikTok now drives culinary habits (including a 200% jump in Feta sales at one grocery store after a baked pasta dish went viral); countless fashion and beauty crazes (from “skin cycling” to “glazed donut nails”), and propels new and old music (including the 1980s song “Break My Stride”) to the top of streaming charts. A significant percentage of US politicians campaigned on the app ahead of the midterm elections. And legacy news organizations like the 176-year-old Associated Press have recently joined TikTok to reach new audiences.\n\nKahlil Greene. Laurie Gomez\n\n“So many people, myself included, are always on TikTok,” Kahlil Greene, 22, of New Haven, Connecticut, told CNN. “That’s where we get our entertainment from, our news from, our musical taste from, our social inside jokes we make with friends come from memes that started on TikTok.”\n\nGreene, who is known as the “Gen Z historian” across social media, has amassed more than 580,000 followers on TikTok by documenting social and cultural issues. Greene’s following on TikTok even garnered the attention of the Biden administration. Greene was among the handful of TikTokers who were recently invited to a White House press briefing on the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n“So much of our culture and lives are driven by TikTok now that it’s not just something you can rip away easily,” he said.\n\n“Too big to fail”\n\nTikTok has simultaneously tried to ease concerns about its impact on Americans and their data while also working to expand its footprint in the country.\n\nThe company, which is owned by Beijing-based Bytedance, has committed to moving its US user data to Oracle’s cloud platform and to taking other steps to isolate US user data from other parts of its business. TikTok said last week that it would restructure its US-focused content moderation, policy and legal teams under a special group within the company led by US-based officials and walled off organizationally from other teams focused on the rest of the world.\n\nIn response to the bill calling for a ban, a TikTok spokesperson said: “It’s troubling that rather than encouraging the Administration to conclude its national security review of TikTok, some members of Congress have decided to push for a politically-motivated ban that will do nothing to advance the national security of the United States.”\n\nA growing number of state and federal lawmakers are attempting to crack down on TikTok, including some who are calling for an outright ban. Tom Brenner/Reuters\n\n“We will continue to brief members of Congress on the plans that have been developed under the oversight of our country’s top national security agencies—plans that we are well underway in implementing—to further secure our platform in the United States,” the statement added.\n\nThe company is also stressing its broad popularity. “TikTok is loved by millions of Americans who use the platform to learn, grow their businesses, and connect with creative content that brings them joy,” the spokesperson said.\n\nNow, the company is taking steps to keep growing its reach. At a time when major tech giants including Meta and Twitter are slashing staff, TikTok is still hiring American engineers. TikTok also appears be to taking aim at a chunk of Amazon’s e-commerce empire by seeking to build out its own warehousing network in the United States, a flurry of recent job postings indicates.\n\nThe challenge for the federal government “is it’s almost like TikTok is too big to fail,” said Rick Sofield, a partner at Vinson & Elkins L.L.P., who focuses on national security reviews, export controls and economic sanctions. “I think their minds are made up that ByteDance owning TikTok is a national security concern – the reason that we’ve been hung up is it’s too big to fail, and they’re trying to figure out a soft landing.”\n\n“There’s a whole lot of things I think that would have to happen first, before there’s a ban,” he added.\n\nA livelihood and a lifeline\n\nFor Adrianna Wise, 30, TikTok hasn’t just been “essential” for building her bakery in Columbus, Ohio, it’s also been a critical tool that lets her reach young Black and brown people in her community and share knowledge and tips on how to build a business.\n\n“I see the impact that I’m having when I go out into the community and people are like, ‘Oh my gosh, I follow you TikTok,’” Wise, who is co-founder of Coco’s Confectionary Kitchen, told CNN. “I had a little girl a few weeks ago tell me, ‘It was just so cool because you have hair like me, and you’re on TikTok and you have so many views!’”\n\nAdrianna Wise says TikTok allows her to reach young Black and brown people in her community. \"A lot of them are learning the skills and the tools they need to be able to create and cultivate their own businesses on platforms like TikTok, if not exclusively on TikTok,\" she said. Courtesy Adrianna Wise\n\n“A lot of them are learning the skills and the tools they need to be able to create and cultivate their own businesses on platforms like TikTok, if not exclusively on TikTok,” she said.\n\nGoodwin, the Sparks of Joy Co. founder, similarly says a TikTok ban would not only be devastating for her business, but also for her sense of community. She candidly documents her mental health journey via TikTok and has built a support system via the platform. “My best friend in the world right now, I met on TikTok,” she said. “We’re practically family at this point.”\n\n“TikTok is way more than just dancing videos or lip-syncing videos. It really has so many different niches, and you can find community in any of them,” Goodwin told CNN. “So if it were to go away, it would be it would be a great loss.”\n\nDespite the hullaballoo, Greene, the Gen Z historian, says he is not particularly worried about a potential TikTok ban – even though he acknowledges it could cause a hit to his income and sponsorship deals. If anything, he says the folks in government calling for a ban don’t seem to be aware of how central it is to the lives of people in his generation.\n\nHootie Hurley, 23, a Los Angeles-based full-time creator with more than 1.3 million followers on TikTok, told CNN that he now makes most of his income through his TikTok following. Courtesy Hootie Hurley\n\n“Generally speaking, the side of the argument that’s like super against TikTok, super alarmist about what it means, hasn’t done a great job communicating that message,” he said. Greene views “data privacy concerns” as “more of a buzzword than a tangible fear.”\n\n“We grew up in a generation where our data was always public,” he said, “and we always put our lives on social media.”\n\nHootie Hurley, 23, a Los Angeles-based full-time creator with more than 1.3 million followers on TikTok, told CNN that he now makes most of his income through his TikTok following. While a ban would be “very scary” for him and his livelihood,” Hurley said he and other TikTok creators are more focused on entertaining their audience than stressing about it – especially after weathering the first ban threats back in 2020.\n\n“If the government ever did ban it,” he said, “everybody would actually be very, very surprised.”", "authors": ["Catherine Thorbecke"], "publish_date": "2022/12/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/30/business/4-day-work-week-results/index.html", "title": "Global 4-day week pilot was a huge success, organizers say | CNN ...", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nThe verdict is in: A four-day work week is good for business.\n\nAfter six months, most of the 33 companies and 903 workers trialing the schedule, with no reduction in pay, are unlikely ever to go back to a standard working week, according to the organizers of the global pilot program.\n\nNone of the 27 participating companies who responded to a survey by 4 Day Week Global said they were leaning towards or planning on returning to their former five-day routine.

By Monday, air travel was more or less back to normal – unless you booked your holiday travel with Southwest Airlines.\n\nMore than 90% of Wednesday’s US flight cancellations were Southwest flights, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. Southwest canceled more than 2,500 flights. The next highest: SkyWest, with 77.\n\nSouthwest warned that it would continue canceling flights until it could get its operations back on track. The company’s CEO said this has been the biggest disruption he’s seen in his career. The Biden administration is investigating.\n\nWhat gives? Southwest had a combination of bad luck and bad planning.\n\nThe storm hit Chicago and Denver hard, where Southwest has two of its biggest hubs – Chicago Midway airport and Denver International airport.\n\nMore bad luck: The storm hit just as the so-called tripledemic surged across America, leaving people and their families sick with Covid, the flu and RSV. Although Southwest says it was fully staffed for the holiday weekend, illness makes adjusting to increased system stress difficult. Many airlines still lack sufficient staff to recover when events like bad weather cause delays or flight crews max out the hours they’re allowed to work under federal safety regulations.\n\nUnderinvestment\n\nBut Southwest (LUV) also hurt itself with an aggressive schedule and by underinvesting in its operations.\n\nSouthwest’s schedule includes shorter flights with tighter turnaround times, which are causing some of the problems, Kathleen Bangs, a FlightAware spokesperson, told CNN.\n\n“Those turnaround times bog things down,” Bangs said.\n\nStranded customers have been unable to get through to Southwest’s customer service lines to rebook flights or find lost baggage.\n\nEmployees also said they have not been able to communicate with the airline, the president of the union that represents Southwest’s flight attendants told CNN Monday.\n\n“The phone system the company uses is just not working,” Lyn Montgomery, President of TWU Local 556, told CNN’s Pamela Brown. “They’re just not manned with enough manpower in order to give the scheduling changes to flight attendants, and that’s created a ripple effect that is creating chaos throughout the nation.”\n\nOn a call with employees Monday, Southwest Chief Operating Officer Andrew Watterson explained that the company’s outdated scheduling software quickly became the main culprit of the cancellations once the storm cleared, according to a transcript of the call that was obtained by CNN from an aviation source.\n\nThe extreme cold, ice and snow grounded planes and left some crew members stranded, so Southwest’s crew schedulers worked furiously to put a new schedule together, matching available crew with aircraft that were ready to fly. But the Federal Aviation Administration strictly regulates when flight crews can work, complicating Southwest’s scheduling efforts.\n\n“The process of matching up those crew members with the aircraft could not be handled by our technology,” Watterson said.\n\nSouthwest ended up with planes that were ready to take off with available crew, but the company’s scheduling software wasn’t able to match them quickly and accurately, Watterson added.\n\n“As a result, we had to ask our crew schedulers to do this manually, and it’s extraordinarily difficult,” he said. “That is a tedious, long process.”\n\nWatterson noted that manual scheduling left Southwest building an incredibly delicate house of cards that could quickly tumble when the company encountered a problem.\n\n“They would make great progress, and then some other disruption would happen, and it would unravel their work,” Watterson said. “So, we spent multiple days where we kind of got close to finishing the problem, and then it had to be reset.”\n\nIn reducing the company’s flights by two thirds, Southwest should have “more than ample crew resources to handle that amount of activity,” Watterson said.\n\nThe problems Southwest faces have been brewing for a long time, said Captain Casey Murray, the president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association.\n\n“We’ve been having these issues for the past 20 months,” he told CNN. “We’ve seen these sorts of meltdowns occur on a much more regular basis and it really just has to do with outdated processes and outdated IT.”\n\nHe said the airline’s operations haven’t changed much since the 1990s.\n\n“It’s phones, it’s computers, it’s processing power, it’s the programs used to connect us to airplanes – that’s where the problem lies, and it’s systemic throughout the whole airline,” he said.\n\nSouthwest CEO Bob Jordan, in a message to employees obtained by CNN, acknowledged many of Murray’s concerns, and promised the company will invest in better systems.\n\n“Part of what we’re suffering is a lack of tools,” Jordan told employees. “We’ve talked an awful lot about modernizing the operation, and the need to do that.”\n\nHe said the airline is “committed to and invested in” improving its systems, but “we need to be able to produce solutions faster.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Tuesday urged consumers to check if they’re eligible for compensation as cascading airline delays have disrupted holiday travel across the country.\n\n“Our Administration is working to ensure airlines are held accountable,” Biden tweeted.\n\nThe US Department of Transportation said it is investigating.\n\n“USDOT is concerned by Southwest’s unacceptable rate of cancellations and delays & reports of lack of prompt customer service,” the agency tweeted. “The Department will examine whether cancellations were controllable and if Southwest is complying with its customer service plan.”\n\nTo recover, Jordan told the Wall Street Journal the company plans to operate just over a third of its schedule in upcoming days to give itself the ability for crews to get into the right positions.\n\nNot Southwest’s first rodeo\n\nIf this is all ringing a bell, that’s because this isn’t the first time Southwest’s service melted down in epic fashion. In October 2021, Southwest canceled more than 2,000 flights over a four-day period, costing the airline $75 million.\n\nSouthwest blamed that service meltdown on a combination of bad weather in Florida, a brief problem with air traffic control in the area and a lack of available staff to adjust to those problems. It has admitted it was having service problems caused by short staffing even before the thousands of canceled flights stranded hundreds of thousands of passengers.\n\nSimilar to this month’s service mayhem, Southwest fared far worse than its competitors last October. While Southwest canceled hundreds of flights in the days following the peak of October’s disruption, competitors quickly returned to normal service.\n\nLater that month, on a call with Wall Street analysts, then-CEO Gary Kelly said the company had made adjustments to prevent a similar meltdown in the future.\n\n“We have reined in our capacity plans to adjust to the current staffing environment, and our ontime performance has improved, accordingly,” said Kelly on October 21. “We are aggressively hiring to a goal of approximately 5,000 new employees by the end of this year, and we are currently more than halfway toward that goal.”\n\nAnd, just like the latest disruption, the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association claimed the cancellations were due to “management’s poor planning.”\n\n– CNN’s Ross Levitt contributed to this report", "authors": ["David Goldman"], "publish_date": "2022/12/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/24/health/hypermobile-ehlers-danlos-syndrome-health-hnk-spc-dst-intl/index.html", "title": "Ehlers-Danlos syndrome affects millions. Why isn't the medical ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nOne day in July 2021, my then 15-year-old daughter Poppy stumbled and fell while walking down some stairs, grazing her knee. It wasn’t a serious wound, but over the weeks it didn’t heal.\n\nAround the same time, her wrists and knees became sore; her ankles started rolling when she walked; her hands began shaking; her headaches and stomach aches became more frequent and intensely painful. She was always exhausted.\n\nBefore her health declined, Poppy had enjoyed horse riding and gymnastics, she’d competed in cross country races and been a fearless goalkeeper for the school hockey team.\n\nBut within a couple of months, as walking became increasingly difficult, she asked me for a walking stick. We found one that folds up and fits neatly in her school bag.\n\nI took Poppy to doctors who conducted tests, but they couldn’t find out what was wrong with her. Then, in October, a breakthrough.\n\nA podiatrist who was measuring Poppy for insoles to support her aching feet asked if Poppy could bend her thumb to reach her forearm. She could. Could she pull her little finger back to form a 90-degree angle with the back of her hand? She could do that, too.\n\n“Have you heard of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome?” the podiatrist asked me. I hadn’t – so as soon as I got home, I went looking on the internet.\n\nThere are 13 types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), according to research and advocacy organization The Ehlers-Danlos Society. Most types are very rare, and can be diagnosed using genetic tests. However, the genes that cause hypermobile EDS (hEDS) – the most common form, accounting for about 90% of cases – are unknown, so diagnosis is based on a checklist of symptoms. The list includes a hypermobility rating, known as the Beighton Score.\n\nPoppy had enough symptoms to qualify for hEDS, and the diagnosis was confirmed by a doctor one year ago, on Christmas Eve. He told us that although we can do our best to alleviate some symptoms, there is no cure.\n\nPoppy reacted to the news better than I did. She had known for some time that something was fundamentally wrong. The diagnosis was upsetting but identifying her illness also gave her a sense of relief. I felt shocked and overwhelmed, and I cried for weeks.\n\nReading about EDS was like a dreadful slow reveal.\n\nI learned that it’s a genetic disorder that causes the body to make faulty connective tissue, and connective tissue is everywhere – in the tendons, ligaments, skin, heart, digestive system, eyes and gums.\n\nWeak connective tissue leads to hypermobility, which may sound like a good thing, but some people with bendy bodies suffer a mind-boggling array of symptoms, including joint dislocations and subluxations (like a mini dislocation, when the joint partially slips out of place), soft stretchy skin, abnormal scarring, poor wound healing, gastrointestinal disorders, chronic pain and fatigue.\n\nThe severity of symptoms varies wildly. Patients with milder cases can lead relatively normal lives, while others become housebound, and some can’t digest food and must be fed through tubes.\n\nWhat’s more, people with hEDS are prone to other conditions, including POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, which makes you dizzy when you stand up) and MCAS (mast cell activation syndrome, which gives you allergy-type symptoms).\n\nI learned a lot of new acronyms and they all spelled bad news.\n\nZebras or horses?\n\nI initially thought hEDS was rare, because all forms of EDS are commonly referred to as rare. But within a few weeks, I felt like I was seeing references to hEDS everywhere. Actor, writer and director Lena Dunham; actor and presenter Jameela Jamil; and drag queen Yvie Oddly live with it. I deep dived into EDS Twitter and EDS Instagram, while Poppy found it comforting to watch TikTok videos made by teenagers with the condition.\n\nDrag queen Yvie Oddly, who has hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, crab walks down the pink carpet at RuPaul's DragCon LA in 2019. Rodin Eckenroth/Getty Images\n\nI discovered multiple patient groups on Facebook, each with tens of thousands of members, which turned out to be great sources of support. I asked questions (what kind of shoes are best for weak ankles? Which knee braces are easiest to pull on and off?) and kind strangers sent helpful advice. At the same time, scrolling through countless personal stories of pain, despair and shattered dreams made me feel terrified about what might lie ahead.\n\nI noticed common themes. Many EDS patients had spent years seeking the correct diagnosis; others felt they’d been neglected and gaslit by doctors.\n\nThere was also a lot of talk of zebras.\n\nLinda Bluestein, a Colorado-based physician who specializes in EDS and other hypermobility conditions, and has hEDS herself, explains why.\n\n“I was told in medical school, ‘when you hear hoofbeats think horses, not zebras,’” she says. Many trainee doctors receive the same advice – when a patient presents with symptoms, “look for the common thing.” That’s why EDS patients commonly refer to themselves as zebras – and also use the fabulous collective noun “dazzle.” The name represents rarity and evokes the stripy stretch marks that are a common feature on EDS skin.\n\nBut if people with hEDS are medical zebras, why am I encountering so many of them?\n\nBluestein says that for many years it was thought that one in 5,000 people had Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. But she says the limited research that’s been carried out into the prevalence of hEDS suggests the true number of cases is “much, much higher” than that.\n\nDr. Linda Bluestein has treated hEDS patients who have been searching for a diagnosis for decades. Linda Bluestein\n\nBluestein points me to a 2019 study carried out in Wales – a country of 3.1 million people. An examination of primary care and hospital records from 1990 to 2017 found that one in 500 people there has either hEDS or joint hypermobility syndrome (a similar condition with a slightly different set of symptoms). She says it’s “a good study” but believes it’s still an underestimate. The Ehlers-Danlos Society says more population studies need to be done to give a more accurate view of its incidence elsewhere.\n\nBut despite this possible prevalence, and how debilitating hypermobility disorders can be, the average time to diagnosis from the onset of symptoms is 10 to 12 years, according to The Ehlers-Danlos Society.\n\nBluestein has firsthand experience of this. Growing up, she wanted to become a ballet dancer and trained six days a week. When puberty hit, she started experiencing joint pain and migraines, and at 16 had her first orthopedic surgery. She realized she wouldn’t succeed in the ballet world and instead pursued her “back-up plan,” to become a doctor. But despite her career choice, Bluestein only received her hEDS diagnosis when she was 47 – more than 30 years later.\n\n“I told my doctor on numerous occasions, ‘there is something wrong with me, I don’t heal well, I get injured more easily than other people’,” she says. “And he just never, never listened.”\n\nWhy, for so many patients, does it take so long to get diagnosed?\n\n‘The worst possible model’\n\nIn 2014 a leading EDS expert, Professor Rodney Grahame, remarked at a conference that “no other disease in the history of modern medicine has been neglected in such a way as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.”\n\nFar more women than men are diagnosed with EDS, which could help to explain the neglect, because the medical profession has a long history of overlooking health complaints made by women.\n\nA 2009 study, conducted by the European Organisation for Rare Diseases, surveyed 414 families of EDS patients from five countries and found that the average delay to an EDS diagnosis was four years for men – but 16 years for women.\n\nThe report states that women with EDS tend to be “diagnosed later because their pain and hypotonia (poor muscle tone) aren’t considered as physical symptoms but rather as psychological symptoms or common complaints.”\n\n“We tend to get dismissed a lot more easily,” says Bluestein. “People jump to the conclusion that we’re histrionic females.”\n\nAnxiety is very common in patients with hypermobility issues, says Bluestein, which can cloud the picture. “When people with anxiety present to a physician, it can suck all the air out of the room, so that the physician almost can’t see anything else.”\n\nThis can ramp up the patient’s anxiety further “because people aren’t validating our symptoms, and then we start to doubt ourselves,” she says.\n\nWhat’s more, medicine is divided into silos which creates the “worst possible model” for EDS patients, says Bluestein.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'We're born with this and will never be free:' Hear stories from people with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome 05:02 - Source: CNN\n\nShe explains that undiagnosed patients might consult a neurologist for their migraines, a rheumatologist for joint pain, a cardiologist for palpitations, a gastroenterologist for digestive issues and a urologist for bladder symptoms. Each doctor focuses on the symptoms that fall within their specialty but doesn’t consider the other ailments. “Nowhere along the way does somebody realize that there are certain conditions that could tie all of these things together and explain everything,” says Bluestein.\n\nThe 2009 rare diseases study found that during the quest for a diagnosis, 58% of EDS patients consulted more than five doctors, and 20% consulted more than 20.\n\nThe consequences of not getting diagnosed for years can be devastating.\n\nMelissa Dickinson, a psychotherapist in Atlanta, Georgia, says she experienced symptoms of a “mystery illness” since childhood. Then in 2013, she “went on honeymoon to Mexico, relatively healthy, and came back disabled and with a dislocated neck.”\n\nWhile on vacation, Dickinson says she got food poisoning and was prescribed ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic that can pose a serious risk of aortic aneurysm to people with EDS. Instead, she says it triggered significant nerve damage, digestive issues that almost made her go blind because her body wasn’t absorbing nutrients, and put her in a wheelchair.\n\nDickinson, who finally received her hEDS diagnosis in 2014, says taking the wrong medication “wrecked me from head to toe.” Now that she’s receiving treatment, “I can walk with mobility aids, but most of my body has to have constant support to function.”\n\nLara Bloom, president and CEO of The Ehlers-Danlos Society, who herself has hEDS, says many patients have “medicalized PTSD.”\n\n“They have had to stop their careers, they’ve had to drop out of school, their relationships have broken down.” The delay inevitably results in worsening symptoms and a declining quality of life, she says. In worst-case scenarios, patients “are dying by suicide, they’re self-harming.”\n\nSometimes, the failure to diagnose EDS has led to children being taken away from their parents.\n\nIn 2010, Americans Rana Tyson and her husband Chad were falsely accused of harming their 4-week-old twin daughters, who had unexplained fractures in their legs.\n\nAlong with their older sister, the baby girls were taken by state authorities in Texas and sent to live with relatives. “It was the worst day of my life,” Tyson tells me in a phone call.\n\nFive months later, a geneticist identified the twins as having a connective tissue disorder, and they were subsequently diagnosed with EDS and a vitamin D deficiency. The family was reunited but “12 years later, it still hurts,” says Tyson.\n\nBloom says some other parents of children with EDS have been wrongly accused of “fabricated or induced illness (FII)” – a rare form of abuse, formerly known as Munchausen’s syndrome by proxy, in which a parent or care giver deliberately causes symptoms or tries to convince doctors that a healthy child is ill.\n\nEllie Pattison, who has hEDS, has been repeatedly misdiagnosed as having an eating disorder. Ellie Pattison\n\nEllie Pattison, a 19-year-old student who lives in County Durham, England, suffers from severe digestive issues linked to hEDS.\n\nThroughout her childhood, Ellie was repeatedly misdiagnosed as having an eating disorder, she says, while her mother Caroline was accused of FII on three separate occasions. Caroline successfully fought to keep her daughter at home, says Ellie, but the ordeal has left the whole family with “an unimaginable amount of trauma.” Ellie says she suffered from PTSD and endured years of horrific nightmares, triggered by living with the fear from a young age that she could be forcibly separated from her family.\n\nThis underlines why prompt diagnosis is so important, says Bloom. “Our hope and dream is for people to get diagnosed when their symptoms begin.”\n\nThe search for answers\n\nIn the case of hEDS, a crucial first step is to find out what causes it.\n\nCortney Gensemer, a biomedical scientist in the Norris Lab at the Medical University of South Carolina’s department of Regenerative Medicine and Cell Biology, is trying to solve this mystery. She and research mentor Russell Norris, head of the lab, have been studying a gene mutation they believe causes hEDS (the results of the study are currently under peer review).\n\nLike Poppy, Gensemer was diagnosed with hEDS as a teenager. She says the disease affects every aspect of her work. Looking down a microscope is particularly painful at times – her neck is unstable because of her hEDS, and she’s had metal screws put into some of her neck vertebrae to fuse them.\n\nCortney Gensemer working in the Norris Lab and recovering from neck surgery earlier this year. Cortney Gensemer\n\nNorris kitted the lab out with special equipment, including motion sensor doors (standard lab doors are very heavy), adjustable chairs and ergonomic pipettes that are gentle on the hands. “If I didn’t have all that stuff, I don’t think I’d be able to do it,” says Gensemer.\n\nTo find a hEDS-causing gene, Gensemer says she and Norris sampled DNA from a large family with cases spanning four generations and looked for a mutation that appears only in relatives who have the disease. They identified a “strong candidate gene” and inserted it into mice using gene editing tools.\n\nGensemer and Norris found that the hEDS mice had significantly more lax tissues, and floppier tails than regular rodents. “You can tie a loose knot into the mutant mouse tail. With a normal mouse tail, you can (only) bend it into a circle,” Gensemer says.\n\nThe gene that Gensemer and Norris found won’t account for all hEDS cases, she says. They believe that eventually multiple genes will be identified, and hEDS may be split into different subtypes. This would help to explain why different patients have different symptoms. Crucially, if genetic information sheds light on how the connective tissue is “messed up,” it could lead to effective treatments, says Gensemer.\n\nThe Ehlers-Danlos Society is also looking for genes as well as blood markers, working with a team of experts to sequence and analyze the DNA of 1,000 hEDS patients from around the world. And at the UK’s University of Warwick, Ph.D. candidate Sabeeha Malek, another scientist with hEDS, has proposed that EDS might be caused by a fault in the way that collagen binds to cell membranes in connective tissue. If she’s right, she hopes her work will lead to a skin biopsy test that could identify all forms of the disease.\n\nSabeeha Malek is working to identify biomarkers that could make EDS diagnosis easier. Sabeeha Malek\n\nProgress is being made but on a very small scale. “If you look at any major academic institution, there are multiple labs studying cancer, multiple labs studying heart disease. When you look at a disease that affects one in 500 people, and probably more than that, there should be a lab studying it at every single academic institution,” says Gensemer.\n\nGensemer hopes that as more discoveries are made and data is accumulated it will “change the way the medical community looks at the disease” – and that it will be taken more seriously.\n\nA giant kitten for my zebra\n\nA year has passed since Poppy’s diagnosis. The initial shock has subsided, and while I’m still grieving the loss of her health, we’ve both learned to accept our new reality and have adjusted to living with EDS.\n\nI’ve assembled a team of supportive doctors and therapists and acquired an arsenal of paraphernalia to fight pain and manage symptoms, including braces and kinesiology tape to hold her joints in place; ice packs, heat pads, tiger balm and arnica gel for sore muscles; and a cupboard full of medications and supplements.\n\nWith Poppy often stuck at home, I also got her a giant kitten that she calls Bagel, and he provides the best therapy.\n\nPoppy with Bagel. Tom Booth/CNN\n\nWriting this article has taught me a lot more about EDS: It’s been upsetting to report on the terrible experiences some have suffered, but I’ve been awestruck by the dedication of people, many with the condition themselves, who are working to find solutions.\n\nI don’t know what the future holds for Poppy.

Go figure.”\n\nBolsonaro has been in full campaign mode just days ahead of the election.

Then they ...", "text": "Lviv, Ukraine CNN —\n\nBefore the war broke out, Igor Kurayan, a 55-year-old from the southern Ukrainian port city of Kherson, shared frequent gardening updates on social media. His feeds were full of palms, pomegranate trees, marigolds, bamboo and avocados, grown at his home and small business near the Black Sea. He called it his “fairytale garden.”\n\nOn February 25, a day after Russia invaded Ukraine, Kurayan posted a selfie on Instagram with a rifle, announcing he had volunteered to fight in the Territorial Defense Forces, reserve units of Ukraine’s military. Soon after, Kherson fell to Russian troops and in early April, after weeks living under and protesting against their occupation, Kurayan was abducted. He was watering plants in his shoe store when he said Russian soldiers dragged him outside and threw him into a van.\n\nSoon after Kurayan’s kidnapping, his Facebook and Instagram pages, and a new TikTok account registered under his name, began posting messages entirely out of character for the man known to family and friends as a proud Ukrainian, a passionate activist and avid gardener.\n\n“They started to use my father’s social media … they wanted to make a puppet out of him.” Karyna Kurayan, Igor’s daughter\n\nAt first, Kurayan’s captors painted him as a patriot, posting old photos from his time running supplies to Ukrainian soldiers on the front line in Donbas, where Russia-backed separatists have been battling Ukraine’s government since 2014.\n\nThen strange videos started to surface. In one, Kurayan looked gaunt and ashen, flanked by two armed, masked men holding the blue and yellow Ukrainian flag and a red and black flag associated with the Ukrainian nationalist movement. He said that Kherson was occupied and rallies were pointless, adding that the Territorial Defense there had disbanded. In another, he denounced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s government and called on his countrymen to surrender.\n\n“I think that further resistance is useless,” said Kurayan in the clip, which was shared across his social media accounts and aired on Russian state TV. Standing in front of a cache of weapons, his hands bound, he said he had been part of a plot to attack Russian soldiers and free activists, but that he’d given up, adding: “I suggest that all fighters of the Territorial Defense surrender their weapons.”\n\n“They started to use my father’s social media. They saw he was active on Facebook … They registered him on TikTok — my dad does not even know what TikTok is,” Kurayan’s daughter, Karyna, a 23-year-old journalist who left Ukraine after the war began, told CNN. “They wanted to make a puppet out of him.”\n\nKaryna provided the videos and screenshots of posts made on her father’s original social media accounts to CNN. The posts, which she shared with Ukrainian authorities, were removed by Kurayan after his release.\n\nA propaganda video of Igor Kurayan, which he said was posted on a TikTok account that his Russian captors created. courtesy Igor Kurayan\n\nKurayan, who was freed in a prisoner exchange in late April after nearly a month of detention, is one of several Ukrainians to be abducted from occupied areas of the country’s southeast in recent months and then sucked into the Kremlin’s propaganda machine. Some of their social media pages have been used to promote pro-Kremlin talking points, while others have appeared in staged TV interviews in support of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war.\n\nSpeaking with CNN on an encrypted video call, Kurayan said that Russian soldiers alternated between torturing him for information — twisting his fingers with pliers and beating him bloody with a truncheon — and using his iPhone to access his social media accounts, sharing images portraying him as a hero-turned-traitor. “They started using these photos to play their game,” Kurayan said, adding that his captors showed him how they were hijacking his accounts, taunting him. “They used my Facebook, my Instagram, and TikTok, which I didn’t have, they made a page there.”\n\n“The Russians offered me to betray Ukraine, to cooperate with them. They first wanted to show, ‘look here is a patriot, and then he betrayed his country,’” Kurayan added, describing how his captors had articulated the arc of their strategy in using his social media. “They said, ‘you are a very famous person in Kherson … we want to make you mayor.’”\n\nCNN has reached out to TikTok for comment about the account created using his name, which is still active. Nothing has been posted since April 24, four days before his release.\n\n“They started using these photos to play their game … They used my Facebook, my Instagram, and TikTok, which I didn’t have, they made a page there.” Igor Kurayan, who was kidnapped by Russian soldiers\n\nAs the war in Ukraine stretches on, the battle for hearts and minds is entering a new phase. Moscow is shifting its strategy from a national to a local level, attempting to bring Ukrainians living in occupied territories onto Russia’s side. But after struggling to find willing collaborators, it has resorted to new tactics.\n\n“In the beginning, in the blitzkrieg phase, Russia’s propaganda machine was working on the national level — now these efforts are localized, they’re trying to convince local people, particularly in occupied areas, that Ukraine has abandoned you,” Mykola Balaban, deputy head of the Centre for Strategic Communications and Information Security (Stratcom Centre UA) under Ukraine’s Ministry of Culture and Information Policy, told CNN.\n\n“In the case of Igor and many others, they use this content inside of Russia too, to show, ‘look this Ukrainian he was an activist, pro-Ukrainian, but now he understands, we show him what is the real situation and now he is pro-Russian, and he understands what we are fighting for.’”\n\nThe Kremlin meanwhile has repeatedly accused the West of disseminating falsehoods, with Russia’s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia claiming in May that countries that call themselves a “community of democracies” were building a “cyber-totalitarianism” and, along with technology giants like Meta, marking any alternative viewpoint as “propaganda.”\n\nPutin’s information war shifts\n\nMore than any other country, Ukraine has borne the brunt of Russia’s so-called “hybrid warfare” — an insidious blend of disinformation campaigns, cyber attacks and ground combat. Ever since the Euromaidan revolution in 2014, which transformed Ukraine’s political landscape and society, ushering in closer ties with the West, it has been Moscow’s chief target.\n\nThe Internet Research Agency (IRA), the notorious Kremlin-linked troll factory that whipped up discord in the 2016 US presidential election, used Ukraine as a testbed for its tactics for years. But, following revelations of Russian interference in the election, tech giants like Facebook and Twitter have stepped up efforts to crack down on coordinated inauthentic activity.\n\nAs a result, Russia has come to rely increasingly on what experts call “information laundering,” legitimizing false or duplicitous narratives through a network of pro-Kremlin actors, journalists, activists and other proxies — a practice known as “dzhynsa” in Ukrainian (a reference to money being kept in a jeans pocket for illicit dealings).\n\nSince Russia’s invasion, hackers have broken into social media accounts and telecoms networks of trusted sources in Ukraine — government officials, media outlets, Ukrainian soldiers and civilians — to spread false messages that Ukrainian troops were surrendering and, more broadly, to sow confusion. Meta, Facebook’s parent company, said in April that it had traced one campaign targeting Ukrainian military officials to state-sponsored group of hackers in Belarus known as Ghostwriter. It also said its systems detected and thwarted attepts by a network linked to the IRA to return to Facebook.\n\n“They can capture real people and do whatever they want with their social media, this social mirror of this real person.” Mykola Balaban, deputy head of Stratcom Centre UA\n\nGovernments are hitting back too. In May, UK-funded research claimed that a new Russian troll farm allegedly operating out of an arms factory in St. Petersburg — with suspected links to Yevgeny Prigozhin, a key Putin ally and the man believed to be behind the IRA — was hijacking discussions on social platforms, including Facebook, Twitter and TikTok, targeting world leaders’ accounts and promoting pro-war messages. The British government said it had alerted platforms to the activity, and that the evidence would help root out Russian influence operations.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Russia is having to find fresh strategies. Now its forces are seeking out real people to promote their narratives — whether they’re willing or not.\n\n“They can capture real people and do whatever they want with their social media, this social mirror of this real person,” said Balaban, who has been tracking Russia’s disinformation strategies for years — first as a historian, then as a soldier and now as a government official. “Of course, when you’re talking about resources, it’s much more expensive and complicated, because you need special people to work with these captives, like Igor Kurayan, it’s not as simple as fake accounts and bot farms.”\n\nBalaban’s Stratcom Centre UA collaborates closely with fact-checking and civil society groups to track the social accounts of Ukrainians at risk of kidnapping, influence operations and hacking. As part of this work, the centre also manages a database of Ukrainian official sources, which it regularly shares with Meta and other social networks for monitoring purposes.\n\nCNN has identified at least five abducted Ukrainians whose Facebook accounts were used to spread messages in support of Russia’s war, or appeared themselves in propaganda videos shared across social networks. All were public figures — prominent local activists, officials and veterans. All except for Kurayan remain missing, according to their friends and families.\n\nThe cases, while concerning, do not appear to constitute a trend, according to Meta.\n\nThe company announced several safety features for users in Ukraine in response to the war, and has encouraged those likely to be targeted to install two-factor authentication.\n\n‘Russian media is 100% a lie’\n\nAs it turned out, Russia’s propaganda saved Kurayan.\n\nAfter he was transferred from a basement in Kherson to a barracks in Sevastopol, Crimea, Kurayan was filmed in a report on Ukrainian prisoners of war. In it, he appears for a moment, sitting among other detainees gathered together in a room to watch Russian state TV. Many avoid looking at the film crew, some with their heads in their hands.\n\nThe footage was aired on several Russian channels, including state-owned NTV, which described the “good conditions” at the barracks and claimed that prisoners “want the war to end, to live in peace.”\n\nDays later, in a surreal, through-the-looking-glass scene, Kurayan said that he was in the same viewing room, when he saw himself appear on the screen. “When I was in Sevastopol, I saw these Russian channels, we were forced to watch them. All the information from the Russian media is 100% a lie,” he said. “But thanks to this report, I was released.”\n\nSome of Kurayan’s relatives in Transnistria, a breakaway region on Moldova’s border with Ukraine, which is allied with Russia, recognized him in the footage, took a screenshot and sent it to his daughter, Karyna.\n\n“We saw dad there, and we understood exactly where he was. Then I collected all the materials, screenshots (from social media), everything that I had, all the information and submitted it to the (prisoner of war) hotline,” Karyna told CNN. After days of silence, her phone rang. It was Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk, who was in charge of negotiating prisoner swaps at the time, calling to tell Karyna that her father was being released, she said. “I’ve never been so happy,” she added.\n\nCNN has reached out to Vereshchuk’s office, as well as the Main Directorate of Intelligence, which now manages prisoner exchanges, and the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), which runs the hotline, for comment. The SBU told CNN in a statement that it could not comment on specific cases.\n\nBefore the war began, the United States government warned in a letter to the United Nations that it had “credible information” Russian forces had compiled a list of Ukrainian citizens, including activists and journalists, to be kidnapped and tortured, or killed.\n\nFor this reason, many people living in occupied territories don’t leave home with their personal phones, using burner devices where possible instead. Kurayan didn’t have his iPhone with him when he was kidnapped, but after days of torture, he said he told his captors where it was hidden.\n\n“Russian military try to get control over devices (of activists, local influencers, public figures), to check their social media accounts, they see the value of that … to see what people are publishing, to see how influential he or she might be, but also to check identity,” Yevhen Fedchenko, co-founder and editor-in-chief of prominent Ukrainian fact-checking organization StopFake, told CNN.\n\n“Russian military try to get control over devices, to check their social media accounts, they see the value of that … to see what people are publishing, to see how influential he or she might be.” Yevhen Fedchenko, co-founder of StopFake\n\n“I know that I’m on their wanted list. If they can grab ahold of me they would use me for the same purposes, to disseminate propaganda … or just be eliminated,” he added.\n\nFor Fedchenko and others on the frontline of Russia’s information war, the Kremlin’s strategy is nothing new. The information vacuum and climate of fear created in occupied territories is a tactic Moscow used in 2014, when it annexed Crimea and fomented a war in Ukraine’s east.\n\nBut this time around, Ukrainians have become hardened to these tactics — ready to call them out or even counter them online.\n\nWhen Kurayan regained control of his social media accounts and started sifting through posts, it was discomfiting to read what his captors had written, posing as him. But, he said, as he scanned the comments it became clear how ineffective their strategy was.\n\n“I read how my friends reacted to these videos. And they commented on them immediately, knowing it was the Russians,” he said, laughing. “They realized it wasn’t me.”", "authors": ["Eliza Mackintosh Yuliia Presniakova", "Eliza Mackintosh", "Yuliia Presniakova"], "publish_date": "2022/08/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/18/tech/twitter-ban-social-media-links/index.html", "title": "Elon Musk says Twitter will ban some links to other social media ...", "text": "New York CNN —\n\nTwitter said Sunday it would ban links to other social media services and suspend accounts that try to direct users to alternative platforms, in an apparent attempt to stem user defections to competitors.\n\nBut Twitter CEO Elon Musk later relented, loosening the policy and causing widespread confusion about what kind of linking was allowed and disallowed on the platform.\n\nUnder the new policy stated Sunday afternoon, links to content on Facebook and Instagram would be prohibited, as well as links to content on emerging Twitter alternatives, including Mastodon and Post. The rule also covers Truth Social, the Twitter clone backed by former President Donald Trump.\n\nTwitter’s move signals a shift toward a more closed environment, one that still accepts incoming traffic from other sites but makes it more difficult for users to leave Twitter’s website for other destinations.\n\n“Specifically, we will remove accounts created solely for the purpose of promoting other social platforms and content that contains links or usernames for the following platforms: Facebook, Instagram, Mastodon, Truth Social, Tribel, Nostr and Post,” Twitter’s support account tweeted.\n\nDespite the bans, Twitter said the new policy will still “allow paid advertisement/promotion for any of the prohibited social media platforms.”\n\nHours after the policy’s rollout, Musk appeared to relent under criticism by other users and agreed to loosen the rules. In an exchange involving Box CEO Aaron Levie — who called the new policy “sad” — Musk agreed it was “reasonable” that some might want to link to their Instagram profiles to promote their own businesses.\n\n“Policy will be adjusted to suspending accounts only when that account’s *primary* purpose is promotion of competitors, which essentially falls under the no spam rule,” Musk tweeted.\n\nThen, amid the continuing backlash, Musk opened a Twitter poll asking whether he should “step down as head of Twitter.”\n\n“I will abide by the results of this poll,” Musk wrote.\n\nAs of early Sunday evening, “Yes” was winning by a margin of 58% to 42%.\n\nInconsistent policy\n\nNotably absent from the list of Twitter’s banned social media platforms was TikTok, one of the internet’s fastest-growing social media platforms whose links to China have sparked national security concerns among US policymakers. Musk’s own significant stake in China through his other company, Tesla, have raised doubts among critics as to whether the CEO would stand up to China if the country’s leaders sought to apply pressure on Twitter.\n\nTwitter’s abrupt policy change Sunday afternoon prompted confusion from the platform’s former CEO, Jack Dorsey, who replied: “Why?” Dorsey followed up with: “doesn’t make sense.”\n\nThe policy change came after some Twitter users announced their intention to move to other platforms last week, in the wake of Twitter’s suspension of a number of journalists who cover Musk. Amid the backlash to the journalists suspensions, Twitter quietly began blocking links to Mastodon.\n\nSunday’s initial announcement appeared to formalize that ban to become official Twitter policy, a move that could further raise eyebrows among Twitter’s regulators.\n\nAs part of Twitter’s new policy, the company said users may not “link out” to social media platforms subject to the restrictions. Users were also prohibited from updating their Twitter profiles to include their account names on other platforms, a way to inform followers where they might be found elsewhere on social media.\n\nFor example, posting encouragement to “follow me @username on Instagram” or “username@mastodon.social” is restricted, Twitter said in a blog post.\n\nAttempts to circumvent that policy will also be enforced against, the company said. For example, use of link-shortening services to obscure the true destination of a URL or attempts to spell out a URL in plain text will also run afoul of Twitter’s rules, the company said.\n\n“If violations of this policy are included in your bio and/or account name, we will temporarily suspend your account and require changes to your profile to no longer be in violation,” the blog post said. “Subsequent violations may result in permanent suspension.”\n\nFirst offenses or isolated incidents may result in temporary suspensions or requirements that users delete the violating content, Twitter said.\n\nIt’s unclear how or if the policy will be implemented after Musk’s apparent decision to loosen the restrictions Sunday evening.\n\nUsers may continue to use third-party software to simultaneously publish their social media content to multiple sites, including Twitter, the company said.\n\nMeta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, as well as Truth Social’s parent Trump Media & Technology Group, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/12/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2023/04/22/bud-light-marketing-shake-up-following-dylan-mulvaney-controversy/11719274002/", "title": "Bud Light marketing leadership 'adjustments' made after ...", "text": "Anheuser-Busch has decided to shake up its marketing leadership after its Bud Light brand became, quite literally, a target for conservatives angered by a campaign featuring a transgender social media influencer.\n\nAlissa Heinerscheid, who oversaw Bud Light marketing, has taken a \"leave of absence\" and Todd Allen, vice president of global marketing for Budweiser, has been appointed, Beer Business Daily reported.\n\nAnheuser-Busch confirmed Allen's new duties in a statement to USA TODAY: \"We have made some adjustments to streamline the structure of our marketing function to reduce layers so that our most senior marketers are more closely connected to every aspect of our brands activities.\"\n\nThe moves, the statement said, \"will help us maintain focus on the things we do best: brewing great beer for all consumers, while always making a positive impact in our communities and on our country.\"\n\nThe actions come after prominent conservatives criticized Bud Light for partnering with TikTok star Dylan Mulvaney to promote a contest.

This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/26/health/mouth-taping-tiktok-dangers-sleep-wellness/index.html", "title": "A TikTok trend about mouth taping while you sleep can be dangerous", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Sleep, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe social media platform TikTok has helped spread yet another potentially dangerous idea: taping your lips shut to stop mouth breathing at night.\n\n“If you have obstructive sleep apnea, yes, this can be very dangerous,” said sleep specialist Dr. Raj Dasgupta, an associate professor of clinical medicine at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California.\n\nObstructive sleep apnea, which is the complete or partial collapse of the airway, is one of the most common and dangerous sleep disorders: Over 1 billion people between the ages of 30 and 69 are thought to have the condition, according to a 2019 study published in the journal Lancet Respiratory Medicine. Millions more are undiagnosed, experts say.\n\n“There is limited evidence on the benefits of mouth taping and I would be very careful — and even talk to your health care provider before attempting it,” Dasgupta added.\n\nYet none of the TikTok videos CNN viewed mentioned the practice might be harmful in any way.\n\nOne young woman touts the benefits of beauty sleep as the reason to imprison her lips each night.\n\n“I tape my mouth shut every single day. … Sleeping properly is really important to anti-aging and looking and feeling your best.”\n\nDespite the downsides of painfully losing facial hair or damaging soft tissue around the mouth, another TikTok video recommends “regular old paper tape.”\n\n“I know there’s lots of fancy mouth-taping tapes on the market but you don’t need it. You just need this little square right here across the lip.”\n\nAll of this could be written off as silly, except one video appears to breed another as people pick up the challenge. One woman couldn’t even recall why she started taping her mouth at night:\n\n“Truth be told, I don’t know. I saw on TikTok and I can’t remember what the benefits were. But it helps me stay asleep!”\n\nDangers of mouth breathing\n\nAs with many things “discovered” by TikTok presenters, mouth taping isn’t new. People have been searching for years for ways to shut their mouth at night, and with good reason. Mouth breathing can lead to snoring and excessive thirst at night, as well as dry mouth and bad breath in the morning. Over time, breathing this way is linked to gum disease and malocclusion, where the upper and lower teeth don’t align.\n\nIn childhood, when the tendency to breathe via the mouth often starts, the condition can lead the child to develop a “mouth breathing face” — a narrowed face with receding chin or jaw, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Children are also at risk for developing obstructive sleep apnea, which has been linked to learning difficulties and behavioral problems in childhood.\n\nJournalist James Nestor allowed scientists to stop up his nose with silicone and surgical tape for 10 days in order to see just what mouth breathing would do to his health. As he described in his book “Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art,” the impact was shockingly fast. He developed obstructive sleep apnea, his blood pressure, pulse and heart rate shot up and his blood oxygen levels plummeted, sending his brain into a murky fog.\n\n“We had no idea it was going to be that bad,” Nestor told CNN in 2020. “The snoring and sleep apnea was so dramatic, and it came on so quickly, that everyone was pretty floored.”\n\nWhy nose breathing is best\n\nBreathing via the nostrils is healthier, experts say. Fine hairs in your nose called cilia filter out dust, allergens, germs and environmental debris. Nose breathing also moisturizes incoming air, while dry air breathed in through the mouth can irritate the lungs, Dasgupta said.\n\n“Nasal breathing may lower blood pressure by increasing nitride oxide, a compound in your body that can be helpful for keeping your blood pressure under control,” he added.\n\nIn addition, breathing through the nose is relaxing, which is why it is often recommended, along with yoga and meditation, as a way to promote sleep.\n\nCheck first for sleep apnea\n\nIf, however, you decide you do want to give mouth taping a try, don’t tape your mouth horizontally like you’re the hostage of a serial killer — even TikTok users stress that. Just a bit of tape placed vertically over the lips is supposed to work.\n\nOne small March study, however, found people who did that just replaced mouth breathing with “mouth puffing,” in which the research participants puffed air in and out of their mouths on each side of the tape.\n\nOverall, the “most important message” is to first be evaluated for obstructive sleep apnea before you try sleeping with your mouth taped, Dasgupta said.\n\nObstructive sleep apnea has been linked to hypertension, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, depression, even an early death. Max Pepper/CNN\n\n“Once obstructive sleep apnea is ruled out completely, then we can call it snoring,” he said. “Also, there are many other options to address snoring beside mouth taping such as nasal strips, nasal dilators and mouth (and) throat and tongue exercises.”\n\nAvoid sleeping on your back as well, a position that encourages the mouth to fall open and the tongue to fall back into the throat. Pushing air past that blockage is what causes snoring.\n\nMouth breathing is often linked to allergies, colds and chronic nasal congestion. A deviated septum, which is the cartilage that separates your nostrils can also be a cause — a crooked septum can block your airway. Nasal polyps can do the same, Dasgupta said.\n\nChildren may have enlarged adenoids, glands behind the nose that are designed to ward off bacteria and viruses. They shrink with age, so this is not a common cause of mouth breathing for adults, according to the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nAll of these underlying medical issues can be handled by a visit to an ear, nose and throat doctor or a sleep specialist who can create a personalized treatment plan for you.\n\n“These issues should be addressed and evaluated first before mouth taping. In my opinion taping your mouth shut is not likely to help you sleep better,” Dasgupta said.", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/10/26"}]}

Chiefs games with us when Swift attended. You were with us from the hot summer night when Swift cheered for her boyfriend Travis Kelce the first time (when we still didn't know if we should call him her boyfriend!).

The two collaborated on \"Snow on the Beach\" on Swift's Grammy-winning album. And the two sat next to each other at the Grammys a week ago. Swift even took her hand and brought her to the stage when she won.\n\nThis Sunday, Swift brought her with her again. By the second quarter, Del Rey was in the suite with Swift, Ice Spice and others.\n\nIs there really a Taylor conspiracy?\n\nThere has been much discussion about a conspiracy with Taylor Swift and the Chiefs making the Super Bowl. But we don't think even Swift herself could create so many coincidences with 13.\n\nIt’s the Super Bowl of “13”s. It’s SB58 (5+8), held on Feb. 11 (2+11), where the Chiefs play the 49ers (4+9) and the halftime score continues the trend. San Francisco leads 10-3.\n\nIs Taylor also playing Taylor Swift Bingo?\n\nSo the Jumbotron on Allegiant Stadium showed Taylor Swift chugging a beer, or was it a wine? That is savage. Maybe she saw herself on the Jumbotron and is playing the same drinking game we are? Drink when the cameras show Taylor?\n\nOr is she giving her best Jason Kelce impersonation?\n\n'Barbie's' Ryan Gosling joins in on Taylor Swift fun\n\nRyan Gosling has joined in on the Taylor Swift wave, as he was featured in a comical Super Bowl commercial crying to Swift's song \"All Too Well\" in a promotion for his new movie, \"The Fall Guys.\"\n\nEvery photo of Taylor Swift at the Super Bowl\n\nWe are so lucky to have our USA TODAY photographers at the game - and bringing us some close ups of Taylor, so we can really discuss her fit - and her lipstick, and play our favorite game: How many people can you identify in the Super Bowl suite?\n\nTaylor Swift is at Super Bowl LVII cheering on Travis Kelce: See all the photos\n\nUsher and Taylor collab?\n\nAnd they said sing now-ow… Taylor Swift has collaborated with many of the top music industry names and Usher is no exception.

And why not?\n\nAre you googling how to get Taylor's red lip?\n\nJust stop. We've got you.\n\nThe lip formula that Swift is rumored to wear is Pat McGrath’s LiquiLUST Legendary Wear Lipstick in the shade \"Elson 4\" lined with Pat McGrath’s PermaGel Ultra Lip Pencil in “Structure” (mid-tone nude).\n\n“I’m sure you’ve seen footage of Taylor Swift dancing in the rain,” says Cincinnati Makeup artist Julie Niesen. “More than likely, she’s wearing a product like LiquiLUST that will endure dancing, and rain, kissing Travis Kelce.” The formula can last because it’s silicon-based, which is “very water proof” and requires an oil-based remover to take off, Niesen says.\n\nSad news though, Swifties. This exact makeup product has been sold out for months.\n\nShe recommends a handful of other formulas that offer slightly different shades at various price points. These recommendations include Rouge Dior Forever in the shade 999 \"Forever Dior”, which is also available in the liquid version, the Sephora Collection Cream Lip Stain Liquid Lipstick in shade 01 “Always Red” and NYX’s Suede Matte Liquid Lipstick in the shade “Kitten Heels.”\n\n-Bebe Hodges\n\nOur favorite description of Travis Kelce\n\nNickelodean for the win.

Cutting away from the action on the field, Taylor Sniffed and Travis Klawce were featured in the stands, enjoying the action.\n\nKlawce wore his namesake’s trademark “87” jersey, while Sniffed donned a sparkly kerchief around her neck.\n\nThey’re not the only doppelgangers at the bowl.

The \"87\" marks the launch of Stephanie Gottlieb’s new Varsity pendant, giving shoppers the opportunity to customize their own necklace with letters and/or numbers of their choosing, and characterized by the iconic varsity-letterman font. The necklace is $2,950.\n\nCan I buy that '87' football-shaped purse?\n\nIf you have $4,495, yes! According to one of our favorite Swifties, Instagram account @TaylorSwiftStyled says it's a Judith Leiber bag, a favorite you usually see on red carpets.\n\nWhat did Donna Kelce wear to the Super Bowl?\n\nNo one will mistake Donna Kelce for anyone else at this year's Super Bowl. Her custom jacket says, \"Mama Kelce\" on it.\n\nWhat did Taylor Swift wear to the Super Bowl?\n\nWhat we know: Taylor Swift arrived in a black corset style top and black jeans with rhinestone cutouts, $695 from AREA and similar to the AREA rhinestone embellished shorts she wore to an earlier game.\n\nShe also wore a gold \"87\" necklace. Her purse? An adorable football shaped purse with an \"87\" on it. Guess we know who she's rooting for!\n\nSwift walked with a red bomber jacket slung over her left shoulder. The jacket is a Kansas City Chiefs WEAR by Erin Andrews. It’s red with two white lines along the collar, base and vest stitched area. Andrews, a FOX Sports reporter, sells fashionable fan gear for women. This is the second time that Swift has sported one of her jackets. On Oct. 12 when the Chiefs played the Broncos, she wore a similar outfit to her Super Bowl appearance.\n\nWho is in Taylor Swift's Super Bowl suite?\n\nWe spied Taylor Swift with fellow Grammy nominee and \"Karma\" collaborator Ice Spice, producer RIOTUSA, along with Blake Lively, who attended an earlier Chiefs game with Swift, and close friend Ashley Avignone. Travis Kelce's close friend Aric Jones was there, too.\n\nThe Kelce family was there. She also is hosting Travis Kelce's mom, Donna Kelce! Donna Kelce had said earlier in the week that the suites were \"pricey\" so she figured she'd be in the stands, and be happy. We also spied Travis' dad, Ed Kelce, and, of course, Jason Kelce. We're wondering if he's going to keep his shirt on.\n\nJason Kelce's wife Kylie was in the suite, too. You have to love Kylie, who as a die-hard Eagles fan refused to wear Chiefs gear and instead wore a red long sleeve T-shirt repping the University of Cincinnati, where the Kelce brothers played football before going pro.\n\nWe also saw her Swift's mom, Andrea Swift, her dad, Scott Swift, brother Austin Swift, and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell.\n\nFriends who celebrated her birthday last year were also there: Miles and Keleigh Teller.\n\nDid you love Jason Kelce's overalls? We did!\n\nTaylor Swift arrives at the stadium\n\nMore than two hours before kick off, CBS showed an image of Taylor Swift in a sleek black corset style top, red satin Chiefs jacket over her shoulder and her hair in a pony with a tiny braid, next to Ice Spice and Blake Lively at the stadium.\n\nWho was Taylor Swift with as she arrived at the Super Bowl?\n\nTaylor Swift walked into the stadium following her mother, Andrea Swift. She walked with Blake Lively, who has attended a Chiefs game with Swift, and she brought \"Karma\" collaborator Ice Spice, whom she was spotted with at the Grammys last week. Ashley Avignone, one of her close friends, was there, as was her dad, Scott Swift, and brother Austin Swift.\n\nBlake Lively wore Adidas red track pants with a cropped white tank and a matching red jacket. Ice Spice was sleek in all black.\n\nWhat did Travis Kelce wear for his gameday fit?\n\nTight end Travis Kelce was \"shimmering\" on his way to get on the Chiefs' team bus, CBS analyst Nate Burleson gushed on the network's pregame show.\n\nDressed in all-black as he left the hotel (\"Reputation?), Kelce will change into the Chiefs' home red jerseys when he arrives at Allegiant Stadium.\n\nNot to be outdone by his brother’s Amiri jacket and trousers, Jason Kelce showed up to Super Bowl LVIII in colorful Kansas City Chiefs overalls.\n\nYou can buy Jason Kelce’s overalls on pre-order and his bright red “big yeti” tee is available in multiple locations online.\n\nThe brothers have a knack for fashion, and Travis purchased designer jumpsuits for his teammates in the past, so neither Jason’s plaid overalls nor the shiny Amiri suit are out of character.\n\nWhat were Taylor Swift's best looks during the NFL season?\n\nSwift fans were treated to 12 game looks this season – from popping up in a box at Arrowhead Stadium in October in an Erin Andrews’ WEAR jacket to the AFC Championship game where Swift wore a bright red sweater and black mini.\n\nShe showcased vintage looks from Kansas City’s West Side Storey, a retro style jacket that was a replica of the one boyfriend Travis Kelce wore in December, and independent (and now NFL-licensed) designer Kristin Juszczyk. And she had us all seeing red!\n\nDid you have a favorite? USA TODAY’s Victoria Hernandez broke down Swift’s best game day looks.\n\nIs Taylor's dad giving off Big Dad Energy?\n\nWe love what a big Chiefs fan Scott Swift has become.\n\nThis fit is peak dad!\n\nAlyssa (@alyssaash1ey) on Threads\n\nIs Taylor Swift in Las Vegas yet?\n\nWe are waiting with you!\n\nAnd NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported on NFL GameDay Morning that Taylor Swift has officially arrived in Las Vegas and is expected to attend Super Bowl LVIII to watch her boyfriend, Travis Kelce and the Kansas City Chiefs take on the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nGracie Hunt, daughter of Kansas City Chiefs CEO Clark Hunt, told People on Saturday that Swift will attend the big game.\n\n\"She's coming!\" Hunt told People. \"We're excited.\"\n\nWhen is Taylor Swift's next concert?\n\nSwift’s next Eras Tour concert is Friday, Feb. 16 in Melbourne, Australia. She performs three nights in Melbourne before heading to Sydney and then to Singapore on March 2.\n\nFollow Bryan West, the USA TODAY Network's Taylor Swift reporter, on Instagram, TikTok and X as @BryanWestTV who will report live from Melbourne.\n\nIt's a love story. Will Travis Kelce propose at the Super Bowl?\n\nWe’ve seen proposals at so many of the Eras Tour shows, that why wouldn’t Kelce propose to Swift if the Chiefs win?\n\nIt could be a very good end to what feels like a real-time rom-com for Swifties.\n\nKelce was actually asked this very question in one of many pre-Super Bowl Interviews. His answer, classic Kelce: \"I'm focused on getting this ring, and that’s all that my mind’s focused on right now.\"\n\nIs Taylor Swift in a Super Bowl commercial?\n\nThe most Taylor Swift of commercials doesn’t even feature the singer.\n\nBut you’ll feel like you saw her after watching Cetaphil’s early Super Bowl Commercial, which as of Friday had been viewed almost 3 million times.\n\nThe video shows a \"real-life father and daughter living in New York\" who are struggling to connect with each other.\n\nThe father, who is a football fan, has a difficult time figuring out how to interact with his teen, who only appears to be interested in her phone and skincare. The father approaches the daughter a couple of times over the course of the video, attempting to bond with little success.\n\nThe mere mention of “the most famous fan of the game” and suddenly dad and daughter are together – and we’re crying.\n\n-Amaris Encinas\n\nCan you bet on Taylor Swift at the Super Bowl?\n\nHow many times will CBS's Super Bowl broadcast show her on-air? Will the Super Bowl MVP mention her in his speech?\n\nSwift's relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has been one of the hottest topics of this NFL season.. The 14-time Grammy winner has attended all three of the Chiefs' playoff games up to this point but has a concert in Tokyo the day before the Super Bowl. That's left fans speculating whether she'll make it to Las Vegas in time for the big game.\n\nHowever, they won't be able to legally bet on such an appearance – or the number of them on the broadcast – at a United States-based sportsbook ahead of Sunday's game. Any such wagers are only available on betting sites outside those regulated in the U.S.\n\nThere are other prop bets not related to the outcome of the game that also aren't legal to bet on in the U.S. as well as some that are only available in certain states. But why is that?\n\n“The general rule of thumb in the U.S. for creating prop bets is that they need to be determined by action on the field and the result shown in the box score,\" BetMGM Senior Trader Tristan Davis told USA TODAY. \"This makes it difficult to offer prop bets on Taylor Swift since she doesn’t play the game.”\n\nIn other words, the name of the game in sports betting is wagering on the objective, on-field results, not the subjective decision-making of a TV broadcast director.\n\n-Jack McKessy\n\nCan Taylor Swift make it to the Super Bowl?\n\nThe big joke on Tiktok this week has been the math question: If Taylor Swift leaves Japan - and the time difference is +17 hours to Las Vegas an the flight takes about 13 hours, will she make it on time?\n\nLucky for us, our amazing graphics team has done the math - and has shown their work.\n\nEven the Embassy of Japan got in on this feat, as Swifties across the world suddenly have serious interest in air travel times.\n\n“Despite the 12-hour flight and 17-hour time difference, the Embassy can confidently Speak Now to say that if she departs Tokyo in the evening after her concert, she should comfortably arrive in Las Vegas before the Super Bowl begins,” the embassy said on Feb. 2, peppering the statement with references to popular Swift song titles.\n\nHas Taylor Swift played the Super Bowl half-time show?\n\nNo. Swift has never played at the half-time show, but she has performed at many big sporting events.\n\nIn 2022, the singer said she didn't want to perform until she finished rerecording all of her first six albums. She has two left: Reputation (Taylor's Version) and her debut album.\n\nHer first time singing at a major sporting event was in 2002 when as an adorable 12-year-old, she sang the national anthem before a Philadelphia 76ers Detroit Pistons game.\n\nShe has since performed at several other sporting events, including when Swift sang the national anthem at game 3 at the 2008 World Series in Philadelphia.\n\nHow did Taylor and Travis meet?\n\nWe could write a song about this, but honestly, don’t we just want Taylor to do it?\n\nTravis Kelce attended the second Kansas City show of Swift's Eras Tour. The tight end hoped to give Swift a friendship bracelet with his phone number on it but was unsuccessful.\n\nKelce called Swift out on his podcast New Heights.\n\n\"I was disappointed that she doesn't talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs that she sings,\" Kelce said to his brother, Jason.\n\nWhen word got to Swift, the singer reached out.\n\n“This all started when Travis very adorably put me on blast on his podcast, which I thought was metal as hell,” she said in her Time magazine interview for 2023 Person of the Year. “We started hanging out right after that. So we actually had a significant amount of time that no one knew, which I’m grateful for, because we got to get to know each other.\"\n\nThough they had been dating for weeks, Kelce made the first public comment about their relationship on the Pat McAfee Show in September.\n\n“I threw the ball in her court,\" he said, \"and you know, I told her, you know, ‘I’ve seen you rock the stage in Arrowhead. You might have to come see me rock the stage in Arrowhead and see which one’s a little more lit.'\"\n\nThis would set up the public launch of the duo's relationship.\n\nAdele is Team \"Taylor Swift's boyfriend\"\n\nTwitter/X user @picturetokurn joked the Super Bowl match-up is “Red” (49ers) versus “Red (Taylor’s Version)” (Chiefs), and Adele is team “Red (Taylor’s Version).” During her Las Vegas concert on Saturday, the singer said, “I think I want the Chiefs to win just because of Taylor Swift's boyfriend and all of you that are complaining about Taylor Swift being at games get a (bleeping) life.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/television/2024/02/10/detroit-lions-fans-have-5-good-reasons-sort-of-to-watch-super-bowl/72521844007/", "title": "Detroit Lions fans have 5 good reasons (sort of) to watch Super Bowl", "text": "With the Super Bowl hours away, Detroit Lions fans already have been through the five stages of grief. Denial, anger, bargaining and depression all arrived immediately after the team’s 31-34 loss to the San Francisco 49ers last month for the NFC Championship.\n\nAcceptance started to sink in a couple of days later. The conversation shifted from why that 17-point halftime lead disappeared faster than Taylor Swift’s 10-minute version of “All Too Well” to how the Lions would live to fight another day and could bite enough kneecaps to make it to the Super Bowl next season.\n\nBut a sixth stage of grief still lingers. It’s one that the Lions and their followers haven’t experienced before. Think of it as Big Game Malaise, or the loss of desire to make a seven-layer dip and invite your friends over to watch Super Bowl LVIII at 6:30 p.m. Sunday on CBS.\n\nThe malaise was apparent during Wednesday’s “Karsch and Anderson” show on WXYT-FM (97.1, the Ticket), when hosts Doug Karsch and Scott (Gator) Anderson talked about how little interest there is in talking about the game, watching the game or having a party for the game.\n\n“I just asked Detroit, 'Hey, has this changed the way we feel about the Super Bowl?' ... And our phones exploded with people who felt the same way,” says Karsch.\n\nFor years, Detroiters have enjoyed making plans for Super Bowl Sunday. When there was little to no chance of the Lions reaching the Super Bowl, aka no emotional investment in the result, the Motor City and suburbs could relax and treat the annual event as a reason to eat, drink and be merry.\n\nBut since the Lions came within four points of feeling the sweet sun of a Super Bowl spot, fans are left uttering a who-cares sigh about what happens inside Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas as San Francisco take on the Kansas City Chiefs for the title.\n\nAs Karsch says, “Now that our team felt involved and came that close, that tantalizing close, the whole idea of a party for the game feels kind of empty.” So will he even tune in on Sunday? It’s complicated.\n\n“As soon as the NFC title game ended, I said out loud, 'I’m not watching the Super Bowl.’ I knew for fact there was no way that was true, but in that moment I said it, and I said it the following Monday on the air,” he admits. “People called and said the same thing. I don’t think anybody really means it. … It feels authentic (to say), but I don’t think it is.”\n\nIf Lions fans are fated to watch reluctantly — and the other viewing choices include a rerun of the “Celebrity Jeopardy” finals on ABC, a “Law & Order: SVU” marathon on USA and a new “True Detective” and “Curb Your Enthusiasm” starting at 9 p.m. on HBO — let’s at least focus on some good reasons to spend time with the Super Bowl.\n\nAnd no, rooting for the 49ers to lose doesn’t count.\n\nWatch it as America’s last remaining shared experience.\n\nRemember when everyone watched the moon landing? Richard Nixon’s resignation? The final episode of “M*A*S*H”? \"Roots?\" The Super Bowl is basically the only communal show left in our culture of infinite streaming choices. No other TV event unites viewers of different ages, classes, races, religions and political stances the way the NFL’s ultimate spectacle does — and this was true even before Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce and pop superstar Taylor Swift became a couple.\n\nHands down, the Super Bowl is the most-watched TV event each year. And this year, the ratings for the AFC and NFC championship games leading up to Sunday were impressive.\n\nKansas City’s victory over the Baltimore Ravens for top AFC honors brought an average of more than 55 million viewers to CBS, or enough to become the AFC championship with the most viewers ever.\n\nThe Lions loss that advanced the 49ers to the Super Bowl? It drew an average of more than 56 million viewers to Fox. It was the most-watched NFC championship in a dozen years.\n\nSome are predicting that this Super Bowl could grab the most viewers ever because of the Taylor Swift effect (more on that later), the surge in online gambling and the popularity of the Chiefs and their star quarterback Patrick Mahomes.\n\nCan this game top the most-watched Super Bowl in history, last year’s win by the Chiefs over the Philadelphia Eagles that averaged slightly more than 115 million viewers? You won’t just be giving in by watching what happens. You’ll be helping make sports history.\n\nWatch it for the ads.\n\nSomewhere, a kid is still giving Mean Joe Greene a Coke, Betty White is still playing tackle football for Snickers and the Budweiser guys are asking each other “Wassup?”\n\n“Super Bowl ads are iconic. If they’re done really well — creative, great production quality, strategic and brand development — an ad can have a positive effect long after the game,” says Robert Kolt, a professor of practice emeritus in Michigan State University’s department of advertising and public relations.\n\nKolt should know. This is his 27th year coordinating the annual party for MSU faculty members that rates the ads, a gathering that attracts widespread coverage for its assessment of the Super Bowl commercials.\n\nThose 30-second spots that cost $7 million aren’t just pushing products and services. According to Kolt, the ads are “really the heart and soul of popular culture.”\n\nSays Kolt, “This is the biggest night of advertising for the year ... There will always be some surprises. You never know what’s going to happen. There are plenty of things people love, which are celebrities and animals. And the Clydesdales are back. And who doesn’t love a cat? And , come on, everybody loves dogs! There’s something (for everyone) to love in the Super Bowl.”\n\nSpeaking of the Clydesdales, they'll be co-starring with a Labrador retriever in a Budweiser ad that’s among those revealed before the game. Other spots that could win the night? A Michelob Ultra ad featuring soccer great Lionel Messi, a “Friends” reunion between Jennifer Aniston and David Schwinner for Uber Eats, a “Flashdance”-themed T-Mobile commercial with Jason Momoa and a Hellman’s mayonnaise ad with Kate McKinnon and a talking cat.\n\nWatch it for Usher.\n\nAn icon of contemporary R&B music, Usher is the latest legend to star in a Super Bowl halftime show. At a press conference Thursday, he hinted that he will have some special guests and include some nods to his recently concluded Las Vegas residency at the Park MGM, where he danced and sang while he was skating.\n\nUsher songs we want to hear at the Super Bowl 58 halftime show, from 'Yeah!' to 'OMG'\n\nAlthough he’ll likely perform plenty of hits from his 30 years as a recording artist, Usher also may use the halftime exposure to herald his new album, “Coming Home,” and his new North American tour, Usher: Past, Present, Future, which just added a second show in September at Detroit's Little Caesars Arena. And Usher is no stranger to the gig. He made a halftime appearance in 2011 at the Cowboys Stadium as a guest of the headliners, the Black Eyed Peas.\n\nThe stakes for halftime have been enormous ever since 1992, when Fox decided to air a live episode of the hit sketch show “In Living Color\" during the halftime break on CBS. More than 20 million viewers changed channels away from the game for the Fox comedy, a smart move considering the halftime show in Minneapolis had the theme Winter Magic and featured dancers dressed like snowflakes, giant inflatable snowmen, a routine by ice skating champs Dorothy Hamill and Brian Boitano, and only a brief appearance by singer Gloria Estefan.\n\nThe NFL responded by moving the chains, entertainment-wise. It booked Michael Jackson for the 1993 Super Bowl halftime.\n\nWatch it for Taylor Swift.\n\nThe Taylor Swift effect is an economic force to be respected, as demonstrated by the Eras tour. It’s the first tour to gross more than $1 billion, according to Pollstar.\n\nNo wonder the NFL is thrilled with Swift’s role in introducing her young female fans to watching football, thanks to her romance with Travis Kelce. Apex Marketing Group recently told Front Office Sports that Swift has generated the equivalent of more than $330 million in brand value for the Chiefs and the NFL overall, which has had its highest season viewing among female fans since it began tracking those numbers 24 years ago.\n\nAnnmarie Eovaldi, a teacher at Macomb County’s Dakota High School, is seeing the Swift effect happen in real time as the faculty adviser to a new club formed for Swifties, or Swift fans.\n\n“What I’ve heard from kids is (football) is an untapped field for Taylor Swift fans. Usually, Taylor Swift fans and football fans are opposite ends of the spectrum. They pay attention to one or the other,” says Eovaldi.\n\nAs Swifties learn about football from watching the Chiefs games that the superstar attends, some men have been complaining that Swift is somehow taking over the broadcasts and drawing the focus away from the sport, a gripe that doesn’t worry Eovaldi.\n\n“It’s honestly kind of funny to hear people complain about 27 seconds of broadcasting Taylor Swift (during) a three-hour football game. People are like, ‘She’s ruining football!,’” she says. In fact, a New York Times story said that ‘the reality is Ms. Swift typically being onscreen for less than 25 seconds over the course of broadcasts that run longer than three hours, with her name rarely being mentioned.”\n\nAs for the secret to Swift’s influencing powers, Eovaldi mentions the singer’s announcement of her new album, “The Tortured Poets Department,” at the Grammy Awards last Sunday. It will be her fourth album since 2020.\n\n“She’s just constantly creating new content. ... Especially (to) high schoolers, with the attention span and the way trends move through high school, that’s pretty important. That gets their attention, when an artist is cranking out good content frequently.”\n\nBy the way, the Taylor Swift fan club will probably have a listening party bound when Swift’s album drops on April 19, according to Eovaldi, who says she was a Swift fan herself in high school, back when \"it wasn't cool.\"\n\nWatch it for the extremely slim chance that Kelce will propose to Swift on camera after the game.\n\nAt a recent press conference, a reporter asked Kelce whether there was going to be “another ring besides the Super Bowl ring” if the Chiefs win on Sunday. Kelce answered, “I’m focused on getting this ring, and that’s all that my mind’s focused on right now.”\n\nIf Taylor makes it to the Super Bowl after her concert in Tokyo (and USA Today assures us she will have time), a proposal theoretically could happen. But realistically, it won't. Still, the rom-com ending would involve an engagement ring, a kiss, deafening cheers, confetti and a horde of sports reporters knocking over the crew on the field filming the obligatory “I’m going to Disney World” ad in their effort to reach Swift.\n\nContact Detroit Free Press pop culture critic Julie Hinds at jhinds@freepress.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/super-bowl/2023/09/24/super-bowl-lviii-usher-history-of-halftime-shows/70955305007/", "title": "Super Bowl LVIII: From Usher to Prince, history of halftime shows", "text": "Super Bowl LVIII has its halftime performer.\n\nApple Music announced via Instagram on Sunday morning that Usher will perform at halftime for the 58th edition of the big game.

There was another, more unexpected star of this year's big game, however, that seems to have tickled the fancy of people across the internet − cartoon channel Nickelodeon.\n\nFor the first time, Nickelodeon had its own broadcast of the Super Bowl on Sunday, an event some netizens have dubbed \"unhinged\" and \"superior\" to the traditional broadcast thanks to its antics and big-name hosts − SpongeBob SquarePants and Patrick Star.\n\nBesides enjoying the flurry of slime and on-field chaos, viewers even learned a thing or two along with SpongeBob, Patrick and Dora, leading brigades of non-football fans to take to the internet and promise to watch the sport more, but only if Dora continues to make appearances with explanations of the plays.\n\nPosts about the Nickelodeon broadcast quickly took off on X, formerly Twitter, TikTok, Instagram and beyond, stirring up virality before the game was even halfway through. Feel like you missed out? Here's what social media had to say about the broadcast.\n\nBest Super Bowl ads:Best 2024 Super Bowl commercials: All 59 ranked according to USA TODAY Ad Meter\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nSpongeBob, Patrick, Dora help Nickelodeon take Super Bowl coverage by storm\n\nHundreds of posts pointing out the wildest moments from the Nickelodeon stream have continued to flood social platforms since the game, with many people saying the kid-friendly stream was a next-level Super Bowl viewing experience.\n\n\"This is the only year I've been this into the Super Bowl. I need this every year,\" said one TikTok comment liked over 47,000 times.\n\n\"I’m getting cable next year just to watch the Super Bowl on Nickelodeon,\" said another comment with more than 29,000 likes. Many others echoed the sentiment, saying the Nickelodeon broadcast was \"better\" than any other option, like one comment with 11,000 likes saying, \"This is way better than the normal broadcast. Dora out here being savage asking if they need a map to find the end zone.\"\n\nYou read that right. Dora was throwing some serious shade during the broadcast, suggesting players may need some help from her famed map to find the end zone and throwing a jab at Leonardo DiCaprio's dating habits. Dora also served up some football knowledge to those who might not be diligent watchers, explaining things like holding calls, false starts and personal fouls.\n\nAs it turns out, Dora hasn't lost her magic touch, as plenty of netizens said her explanations were the first time they truly understood the game.\n\n\"Wait this is the most I've EVER understood about football keep going,\" said one comment with 30,000 likes.\n\nOthers expressed serious regret that they didn't know about the broadcast earlier, like one user who racked up 90,000 likes with the comment, \"I feel I didn’t get the right Super Bowl experience now.\"\n\n'Shrimpothee Chalamet,' 'Megan Thee Sturgeon' and Nickelodeon celeb spottings\n\nNickelodeon also took the opportunity to lean in on some classic jokes that were recognized by cartoon fans old and new, such as Patrick's yelling of the classic \"firmly grasp it!\" line during a fumble, the inclusion of the famous \"my leg!\" voice line also from SpongeBob, the appearance of Nickelodeon's iconic green slime and, of course, a performance of SpongeBob's famous \"Sweet Victory\" song at halftime.\n\nOther beloved characters made appearances, including Sandy Cheeks as a sideline reporter; Boots as Dora's friendly shade-throwing helper; Larry the Lobster, who made an unexpected appearance on the field; Squidward, who was stuck waiting for the bathroom, and Plankton being, well, Plankton.\n\nOther fan-favorite moments included the punny appearances of Bikini Bottom fish residents made to resemble real-life celebs. Taylor Fish, Olivia Codrigo, Snoop Fishy Dogfish, Herring Styles, LePrawn James, Billie Eelish, Shrimpothee Chalamet, Clamuel L. Jackson, Doja Catfish and Megan Thee Sturgeon were just some of the starfish studded audience members.\n\nAs it turns out, the internet still loves a good pun, especially in fish form. Some out-of-towners made an appearance in the audience as well, including Sonic, Tails and Knuckles and some of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.\n\nInternet begs for more\n\nThe internet loved the broadcast so much, in fact, that they have begun asking Nickelodeon for similar broadcasts covering other major events like the Daytona 500, presidential debates, the upcoming presidential election and, of course, all future Super Bowls.\n\nConsidering this is the first time the network has broadcast the entirety of the big game, its instant virality may be a good sign for fans hoping for more in the future.\n\nNick also has a weekly \"NFL Slimetime\" show that features highlights and clips from the previous week's NFL games in the channel's signature style, so viewer who can't wait a full year in between Super Bowls can get their fix of goofy football coverage there.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2023/12/19/usher-super-bowl-halftime-show-2024-guide/71963526007/", "title": "Super Bowl halftime show 2024: How to watch Usher and special ...", "text": "In announcing that Usher had agreed to headline the Super Bowl LVIII halftime show at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, the NFL proclaimed the singer “one of the most influential artists of a generation.”\n\nNFL Head of Music Seth Dudowsky promised “another Halftime Show for the history books,\" and Jay-Z called Usher “the ultimate artist and showman,” adding that “His remarkable journey has propelled him to one of the grandest stages in the world. I can't wait to see the magic.\"\n\nIn that same announcement, Usher said it was “an honor of a lifetime to finally check a Super Bowl performance off my bucket list,” adding, “I can't wait to bring the world a show unlike anything else they've seen from me before.”\n\nHere's what we know so far about what viewers can expect when Usher takes the world’s biggest stage in Paradise, Nevada.\n\nHow long is Usher’s halftime show?\n\nHalftime shows tend to last from 12 to 14 minutes at the Super Bowl.\n\nIn an interview with the Associated Press, the singer said, “Don’t take the moments for granted because you only get 13 of them. The hardest part is trying to figure out how to squeeze it all in when you actually have a large catalog, or a lot of records people celebrate and love.”\n\nHas Usher played the Super Bowl?\n\nYes, he descended from the ceiling to join Black Eyed Peas frontman will.i.am in 2011 in Arlington, Texas, to perform the single “OMG.”\n\nUsher told the Associated Press he’s looking at that Super Bowl performance as a “cheat sheet,” explaining, “I got a chance to see a bit of what it felt like.”\n\nWhat time is the Super Bowl on Sunday?\n\nSuper Bowl LVII will begin at 4:25 p.m. MST (3:35 p.m. Pacific, 6:25 p.m. Eastern) Sunday, Feb. 11, 2024.\n\nHow to watch the Super Bowl halftime show with Usher\n\nYou should probably check out the game while you're at it, but Usher's halftime show can be seen on CBS, Nickelodeon and Univision and streamed on Paramount+, the exclusive streamer for the Super Bowl.\n\nJim Nantz is expected to be the play-by-play announcer, while Tony Romo is expected as the analyst.\n\nLast time:Pregnant and stunning in red, Super Bowl MVP Rihanna crushed the 2023 halftime show\n\nDoes Usher have new music to perform?\n\nFunny you should ask.\n\nThe legend dropped his first new studio release in nearly eight years, “Coming Home,” two days before the Super Bowl.\n\nDoes Usher plan to follow his halftime show with a 2024 tour?\n\nFunny you should ask.\n\nUsher announced a tour in the week leading up to the Super Bowl with the general on sale starting at 10 a.m. Monday, Feb. 12, the morning after his performance.\n\nIs Usher bringing special guests?\n\nUsher will be bringing special guests to Vegas.\n\nHe shared his plans when he was presented with a Key to the City of Las Vegas in mid-October, as reported by the Las Vegas Review-Journal.\n\n“Without question, I am a man of collaborations, it’s part of the reason I have been as successful as I have been, both in creating music that the world sings, and also the moments that the world remembers,” he said. “I’m hoping that I can re-light the fire that all of it has come from, and maybe invite some of those people to join me in that incredible moment.”\n\nHe was not, however, naming names at that point.\n\n“I can’t give too much, because I don’t want to blow it,” he said. “But I will say that that moment will not only represent me, but it will represent my legacy and the things that I’ve been a part of in collaboration. It will remind the world that when you do collaborate, something amazing does happen.”\n\nWill Ludacris, Lil Jon and Alicia Keys join Usher at the Super Bowl?\n\nOn Friday, Feb. 9, TMZ reported that \"sources close to the production\" confirmed eyewitness accounts that Alicia Keys rehearsed with Usher inside Allegiant Stadium on Thursday, which means we may be seeing her join Usher on \"My Boo,\" which spent six weeks at No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100.\n\nHis Apple Music commercial to promote the halftime show heavily featured \"Yeah!,\" a track that features Ludacris and Lil Jon, and when Usher appeared on \"Entertainment Tonight\" recently he said he'd be a \"fool\" to not perform that hit from 2004.\n\n\"I would be a fool to not play 'Yeah!' let's just start there,\" he told ET. \"It would be foolish to make it all the way to Las Vegas, Jon is here, Luda's here and not play 'Yeah!'\"\n\nSo there's a chance you'll see those two pop up as well. Those are among his more successful collaborations, after all.\n\nWill Usher have Justin Bieber, Jungkook or J Balvin at the Super Bowl?\n\nTMZ has also reported that Usher has been talking to Justin Bieber as well, which means we could hear \"Somebody to Love\" on Sunday.\n\nJ Balvin and Jungkook of BTS have also been featured in Super Bowl Halftime Show trailers.\n\nOther hit collabs include “Love in This Club” with Young Jeezy; “OMG” with will.i.am.; “DJ Got Us Fallin’ in Love” with Pitbull; “I Don’t Mind” with Juicy J; “Come Thru” with Summer Walker; “I Need a Girl (Part One)” with P. Diddy and Loon; “Lovers and Friends” with Lil Jon & the East Side Boyz; “Without You” with David Guetta; “New Flame” with Chris Brown and Rick Ross; “Body Language” with Kid Ink and Tinashe; “Party” with Chris Brown and Gucci Mane; and “Love in This Club Part II” with Beyonce and Lil Wayne.\n\nWho was last year's Super Bowl halftime show?\n\nAsked by E! News if she had any advice for her halftime show successor, Rihanna said, “Hell no, I can’t give Usher no advice. Usher is a natural, he’s a legend, he’s been doing this since he’s a teenager. He is made for that show.”\n\nUsher replied to Rihanna's support on X (formerly known as Twitter), posting, “Real recognize real, Thank U Queen @rihanna.”\n\nHow did Usher prepare for the halftime show?\n\nUsher told Entertainment Tonight, \"In the process of getting ready for the Super Bowl, obviously I wanted to make certain that I was at my healthiest,\" he noted. \"I stopped eating gluten. I did cut sugar, all alcohol, I haven't had a cigar or anything.\"\n\nHow much will Usher get paid to do the Super Bowl?\n\nHalftime entertainers don’t get paid to play the Super Bowl.\n\nThey do make union scale. But that’s a tiny fraction of what entertainers make when they play Allegiant Stadium without a football game competing for their spotlight.\n\nAccording to Local 586 of the American Federation of Musicians, the flat union scale to play a room the size of State Farm Stadium in Arizona would be $450 for “the leader,” which in this case would be Usher, and $400 a person for the side musicians.\n\nWhat songs can we expect from Usher at the Super Bowl?\n\nIn an interview with Extra TV, Usher said, “You’re going to get hit records... I do want to play the songs that people obviously recognize and the ones that I celebrate. I’ve been able to laugh, I have been able to cry, I have been vulnerable, I’ve been telling and honest… I found really great ways to help us communicate better through my music and that celebration is inside this curation.”\n\nUsher has sent nine hit singles to the top of Billboard’s Hot 100: “Nice & Slow\" (1998), “U Remind Me” (2001), “U Got It Bad” (2001), “Yeah!” (2004), “Burn” (2004), “Confessions Part II” (2004), “My Boo” (2004), “Love In This Club” (2008) and “OMG” (2010).\n\nAnother song it would make sense to include in a Super Bowl halftime show is Usher’s multi-platinum 1997 breakthrough hit, “You Make Me Wanna….”\n\nHis most-streamed songs on Spotify, not counting features, are “Yeah!,” “DJ Got Us Fallin’ In Love,” “My Boo,” “I Don’t Mind,” “U Remind Me,” “OMG,” “U Got It Bad,” “Love In This Club,” “You Make Me Wanna…” and “Burn.”\n\nSports:Phoenix Suns guard Bradley Beal optimistic for quicker return from right ankle injury\n\nWhat to know about the team behind the Super Bowl Halftime Show\n\nThe Apple Music Super Bowl LVIII Halftime Show telecast will be produced by DPS with Roc Nation and Jesse Collins serving as executive producers and Hamish Hamilton serving as director.\n\nRoc Nation also serves as the strategic entertainment advisor of the live performance.\n\nEarlier this year, the Apple Music Super Bowl LVII Halftime Show Starring Rihanna became the most-watched halftime performance of all time. The performance garnered five Creative Arts Emmy nominations, including Outstanding Variety Special (Live).\n\nIn 2022, Super Bowl LVI Halftime Show Starring Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J. Blige and Kendrick Lamar garnered five Creative Arts Emmy nominations. The critically acclaimed performance won three Creative Arts Emmys, including Outstanding Variety Special (Live), a first ever for the show.\n\nWhere is Super Bowl 2024?\n\nThe Super Bowl is headed to Las Vegas in 2024, with two NFL teams facing off at Allegiant Stadium in what is technically considered Paradise, Nevada.\n\nThe stadium is located on about 62 acres of land west of Mandalay Bay at Russel Road and Hacienda Avenue, between Polaris Avenue and Dean Martin Drive, just west of Interstate 15.\n\nThe street address is 3333 Al Davis Way.\n\nThis is the first Super Bowl to be played in Nevada.\n\nSuper Bowl 2023 ticket prices\n\nOn Location has official Super Bowl tickets that are guaranteed by the NFL, which are included as part of packages with options like open bars, tailgate food and pre-game parties.\n\nThe most inexpensive ticket package still available at On Location is the Playmakers Club starting at $9,000. Other, price-upon-request luxury ticket packages are available through the site.\n\nTickets are also currently available via resale sites such as Vivid Seats and Seat Geek.\n\nReach the reporter at ed.masley@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4495.

Last year's championship game between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles averaged 115.1 million viewers to make the most-watched television show in history. That beat out Super Bowl XLIX for the top spot, which drew 114.4 million viewers in February 2015.\n\nWhile high viewership remains relatively constant, one part of the title game that's changed in recent years is the Super Bowl logo. Since Super Bowl LVI in 2022, the NFL's updated its graphics for the title game each season. It's even inspired a conspiracy theory about the matchup for the title game.\n\nIt's not the first change from the past 58 years, though, just the most recent. Here's a look at the history of Super Bowl logos:\n\nWhat is the Super Bowl logo conspiracy?Everything you need to know about the theory\n\nWhen did Super Bowl logos begin?\n\nThe first Super Bowl on Jan. 15, 1967 didn't have that title to begin with. Instead, it was called the \"AFL-NFL World Championship Game,\" as it featured the AFL's Chiefs taking on the Green Bay Packers. It was called Super Bowl I retroactively, same with Super Bowl II between the Packers and the then-Oakland Raiders.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nLamar Hunt, founder of the AFL and the Dallas Texans (now the Chiefs), came up with the \"Super Bowl\" title ahead of Super Bowl III between the New York Jets and the then-Baltimore Colts.\n\nThe first decades of the Super Bowl featured relatively basic logos using Roman numerals and typically red, white, and blue colors. Some exceptions include Super Bowl IV, VI, VIII, XV, and XVI, which included other colors like gold and purple.\n\nSuper Bowl halftime performers:Look back at every act including Michael Jackson, JLo, Beyonce\n\nWhen did unique Super Bowl logos begin?\n\nThe first major change to the Super Bowl logo began in 1987 for Super Bowl XXI between the New York Giants and Denver Broncos. That game was held at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California and the logo featured a rose with the name and roman numerals.\n\nThe NFL reverted back to red, white, and blue logos for the next five title games. When the Rose Bowl hosted Super Bowl XXVII in 1993, the logo again featured roses again along with the name and roman numerals. That started a new tradition of themed logos incorporating features of the host stadium and city.\n\nSuper Bowl XXVIII in Atlanta, Georgia featured a peach in its logo, a nod to the Peach State.\n\nThat continued for the next decade. Super Bowl XXXI in New Orleans, Louisiana included Mardi Gras-styled graphics; Super Bowl XXXVII in San Diego, California included a coastal lighthouse; Super Bowl XXXVIII in Houston, Texas featured NASA-inspired graphics.\n\nThese nods to host city and state history were dropped from Super Bowls XLI to XLIV. Those title games had unique designs but nothing that referenced local culture.\n\nGreatest Super Bowl teams:The 58 best NFL teams to play for a title – and not all won Lombardi Trophy\n\nSuper Bowl logos: All-silver and stadium highlights\n\nLogo designs made a significant change ahead of Super Bowl XLV. That title game was the first to be played in the new Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas. Instead of a unique logo, the NFL started a new trend of all-silver roman numerals, the Lombardi Trophy, and the Super Bowl name along with an outline of the host stadium's exterior, starting with Cowboys Stadium.\n\nThis remained the format for the next four Super Bowls (XLVI-XLIX).\n\nA golden anniversary Super Bowl logo\n\nSuper Bowl 50 saw roman numerals dropped for the first time in decades to honor the title game's golden anniversary. It continued the stadium outline theme and the Super Bowl name but used gold numbers.\n\nSuper Bowl rankings:All 57 Super Bowls from best to worst. How does first Chiefs-49ers clash rate?\n\nSuper Bowl logos: Back to basics\n\nFollowing the golden anniversary, the NFL kept things simple for title games. Super Bowls LI through LV had the Super Bowl title, roman numerals, and the Lombardi Trophy with very slight changes to the coloring.\n\nThemed Super Bowl logos return and a conspiracy\n\nThe NFL changed things up for Super Bowl LVI again in a move that harkened back to the themed logos of the 1990s and 2000s. For the title game in Los Angeles, the NFL included colored roman numerals for the first time in 11 years.\n\nThe red-, orange-, and yellow-colored numerals of Super Bowl LVI's logo included palm trees in a nod to the southern California setting. A year later, Super Bowl LVII's logo featured red-, purple-, and green-colored numerals incorporating desert rock formations in reference to the host city Phoenix.\n\nA conspiracy took hold ahead of Super Bowl LVIII this season because of the colors used in the logo. Super Bowl LVI's teams were the Los Angeles Rams, who have yellow as a primary color, and the Cincinnati Bengals, who have orange as a primary color. Similarly, Super Bowl LVII's contenders were the Chiefs (red) and Eagles (green).\n\nThat theme of teams with the logo's colors nearly continued this season. Super Bowl LVIII's logo of Las Vegas signs and buildings uses purple and red. The NFC title game featured the San Francisco 49ers, who use red as a primary color, and the Detroit Lions, who use blue. The AFC title game featured the Baltimore Ravens, who use purple, and the Chiefs.\n\nRed won out in the end with the 49ers and Chiefs securing the two spots in the title game.\n\nNext year's Super Bowl will be held at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans. No news yet on the logo but it could include Mardi Gras colors or themes in the roman numerals to continue the trend.\n\nWho are the Super Bowl announcers?Here's who is calling the game for CBS\n\nHow to watch 2024 Super Bowl\n\nWhen: Sunday, Feb. 11 at 6:30 p.m. ET\n\nWhere: Allegiant Stadium, Las Vegas, Nevada\n\nCable TV: CBS\n\nStreaming: Paramount+; YouTube TV; Sling; FuboTV\n\nHow to watch:Catch the Super Bowl with a Fubo subscription\n\nWe occasionally recommend interesting products and services.

Meanwhile, some politicians and advocates are again questioning where in America it is truly safe to gather in celebration.\n\nIn 2017 a gunman shot more than 11,000 rounds of ammunition at an outdoor country music concert near his Las Vegas hotel as fans crouched in terror, killing 60. In 2022, a man with a rifle fired into a July 4th parade outside Chicago. Parents frantically ran, some holding their children and seven died.\n\nAnd now, 11 children were shot in the moments after a Super Bowl victory parade in Kansas City on Wednesday, where thousands of red-clad fans ran for their lives across confetti-strewn streets. In total 22 people suffered gunshot wounds, including one fatality, Interim Fire Chief Ross Grundyson said.\n\n“I think that’s something that all of us who are parents, who are just regular people living each day, have to decide what we wish to do about,” said Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas, who attended the parade with his wife and mother and had to run for cover when gunfire broke out.\n\n“Parades, rallies, schools, movies. It seems like almost nothing is safe,” he said.\n\nShootings at US celebrations keep happening\n\nBullets at sports events, parades and concerts are still relatively rare. But they resonate deeply in a nation that has a long tradition of gathering and celebrating together. In recent years, numerous examples have made national headlines:\n\nBaltimore homecoming celebrations in October 2023 : A shooting at Morgan State University left five people wounded during homecoming celebrations in northeast Baltimore. The incident prompted an hourslong lockdown of the historically Black college and campus leaders canceled homecoming activities for the remainder of the week.\n\n: A shooting at Morgan State University left five people wounded during homecoming celebrations in northeast Baltimore.

Video game tournaments in 2018: Nearly 1,000 people were attending the Art All Night Festival in Trenton, New Jersey, when a shooting erupted in June. A dispute between rival gang members quickly turned into a shooting that killed one person and injured 22 others. About two months later, another shooting rampage occurred in Jacksonville, Florida. Three people died, including the shooter, and 11 others were wounded on Aug. 26 during a Madden 19 video game tourney in downtown Jacksonville.\n\nRenewed calls for stricter gun laws\n\nIn Kansas City, more than 800 law enforcement officers were on hand to provide security along the parade route, said Police Chief Stacey Graves.\n\nBut in a nation awash in guns, it's hard for law enforcement to prevent such attacks. Some leaders and activists say that means the nation needs stricter gun laws in general.\n\n“This shooting is yet another reminder that no parade, no church, no school – really, nowhere at all – is safe from America’s gun violence crisis,\" John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, said after the Kansas City shooting.\n\nLucas has joined with mayors across the country in calling for new laws to reduce gun violence, including mandating universal background checks.\n\nMoms Demand Action Executive Director Angela Ferrell-Zabala said the shooting should prompt politicians to tighten gun laws.\n\nShe said the Super Bowl victory parade should have been \"pure joy\" but became a tragedy for the community.\n\nAmerican attitudes toward gun violence seem to be shifting slightly. Six in 10 adults last year said gun violence was a very big problem in the country, up 9 percentage points from 2022, according to the Pew Research Center. Almost 2 in 3 said they expect the level of gun violence to increase over the next five years.\n\nThe Super Bowl – watched this year by more than 1 in 3 Americans – \"is the most unifying event in America,\" President Joe Biden said late Wednesday.\n\n\"Nothing brings more of us together. And the celebration of a Super Bowl win is a moment that brings a joy that can’t be matched to the winning team and their supporters. For this joy to be turned to tragedy today in Kansas City cuts deep in the American soul.\"\n\nHe called for a ban on \"assault weapons,\" limits on high-capacity magazines and strengthened background checks.\n\n\"Today’s events should move us, shock us, shame us into acting. What are we waiting for? What else do we need to see?\" he said.\n\nParade worries used to be different\n\nWhen the San Francisco 49s won the Super Bowl in 1982, their city threw a disastrous parade, in part, because officials had planned for 25,000 people to attend and instead 500,000 showed.\n\nIt was a case of “civic negligence,” the San Francisco Chronicle wrote, because police moved part of the parade route to accommodate the crowd, meaning many who had lined up for hours never got to see their team go by. “It was the worst parade I never saw,” 49ers fan John Sheridan told the paper.\n\nToday officials must speak to other issues.\n\n“I appreciate the bravery and coordination of the law enforcement officers, first responders, and health care workers for ensuring a swift, orderly evacuation and caring for the victims,” Rep. Sharice Davids, D-Kan., of neighboring Kansas City, Kansas, wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n“The traumatic memories of today will stick with children, families and community members for far too long. This does not reflect the spirit of Kansas City, and I support those asking for a chance to ensure a brighter and safer future,” she posted.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2024/01/22/nfl-playoff-predictions-2024-afc-nfc-conference-championships/72315263007/", "title": "NFL playoff predictions to win AFC, NFC brackets, Super Bowl ...", "text": "Only four teams remain as we are now just three weeks away from Super Bowl LVIII. This weekend will be the conference championship games. Both the AFC and NFC championships will feature the No. 1 and No. 3 seeds.\n\nIn the AFC, two usual suspects will duke it out for the right to go to the Super Bowl. After a thrilling victory over the Buffalo Bills, the Kansas City Chiefs will go to Baltimore for an opportunity to play in their fourth Super Bowl in the last five years. The Chiefs have reached at least the AFC championship game in each season that Patrick Mahomes has been their starter. That's six straight seasons of winding up no more than one game away from a Super Bowl appearance.\n\nAlthough the Baltimore Ravens have consistently been a strong team and playoff contender, they haven't played in an AFC championship game since they won the Super Bowl at the end of the 2012-13 season. Likely MVP Lamar Jackson has long seen his talents dismissed by NFL fans for his inability to win in the playoffs. Saturday marked Jackson's second-ever playoff win and now he faces the juggernaut that is the Chiefs. It will surely be a phenomenal test of the MVP's clutch factor.\n\nOn the NFC side, the San Francisco 49ers are playing in their fourth NFC championship game, but they will not face any of their usual competitors this time around. This Sunday, the Niners will face the Detroit Lions, who have not been to an NFC championship game since the 1991-92 season. Detroit appears to be the team of destiny throughout these playoffs. Every fan across the country is rooting for them. If their team can't win it all, it may as well be the team that hasn't won anything...ever.\n\nHere are some predictions from around the internet regarding who will represent the AFC and NFC in this year's Super Bowl, and who will wind up hoisting the Lombardi Trophy.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nNFL playoffs:Lamar Jackson vs. Patrick Mahomes is only one of the storylines for AFC championship\n\nAFC Standings:\n\n1.

As great as both teams defenses are, the quarterback play on both sides is arguably better. Look for both Patrick Mahomes and Lamar Jackson to constantly battle back and forth. As for a winner predictions, Sportsbook Wire points out that the underdog has covered in three of the last four games between these teams. That's good news for Taylor Swift fans, and Chiefs fans too I guess.\n\nCBS Sports: Chiefs 24, Ravens 20\n\nCody Benjamin writes, \"Plenty of fans will be pulling for Baltimore just for the sake of watching someone other than the Chiefs fight for the Lombardi Trophy, and certainly the Ravens defense has the tools to keep things tight. But even with Lamar Jackson, Baltimore was uneven with the ball to open its game against Houston, and K.C.'s 'D' under Steve Spagnuolo has been far stingier.\"\n\nBleacher Report: Kansas City Chiefs win\n\nErik Breaston writes, \"Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce got red-hot Sunday against the Buffalo Bills, and Isiah Pacheco is running as hard as ever. Perhaps it was for one game and the offense, which struggled at times in the 2023 season, merely took advantage of a depleted defense. Furthermore, the defense made just enough plays to contain Josh Allen, a running quarterback whose ability to escape and make an impact down the field with his legs is as impressive as what he can do with his arm. That experience will help against Lamar Jackson, the front-runner for the NFL MVP award and the most explosive player on any field on which he plays.\"\n\nNFL playoffs:NFL divisional playoff winners, losers\n\nNFC Standings\n\n1.

Aiyuk and Kittle also will explode for bigger games than St. Brown and LaPorta.\"\n\nBleacher Report: Niners win\n\nErik Breaston writes, \"If Aiden Hutchinson and the rest of the Lions' defense can get in Purdy's face and force him to make a quick throw, there is potential to force turnovers. Ultimately, though, the outcome of the game may come down to the sheer number of stars on the San Francisco side of the ball and their propensity for coming up big when it matters most.\"\n\nCBS Sports: 49ers 27, Lions 23\n\nCody Benjamin writes, \"Detroit is a feel-good story, living up to preseason hype as a hard-nosed fighter, and if Goff gets run support while feeding St. Brown early and often, the Lions are capable of the upset. But Goff has also been significantly less effective on the road than at home, and the 49ers tend to take advantage of defensive opportunities. While Purdy and Shanahan proved vulnerable in their decision-making against the Packers, the superior talent is the safer bet.\"\n\nSuper Bowl 58 Predictions\n\nCovers: Ravens win\n\nJason Logan writes: \"I’m going to back the Baltimore Ravens to win it all. Baltimore has proven its mettle against the likes of San Francisco, Miami, Detroit, Jacksonville, and other playoff-bound teams, boasting one of the top two-way teams in football.

However, his social media posts often show him placing high bets, and unfortunately, the team or person he supports usually ends up losing. This phenomenon has been dubbed the \"Drake curse.\"\n\nDespite the rumors of a potential curse, Drake seems to be undeterred from placing bets on the big game. He recently shared a photo on social media of his betting stake worth $1.15 million on the Kansas City Chiefs to win against the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl LVIII, with the caption \"I can't bet against the swifties.\" It seems that Drake is confident in the team's ability to win, and is willing to put a substantial amount of money on the line to prove it.\n\nRegardless of whether or not the \"Drake curse\" is real, this might be the one time that the 49ers will rejoice that the Toronto rapper is rooting for the Chiefs in Super Bowl LVIII in hopes that the omen that follows him is true.\n\n49ers vs. Chiefs preview:Predictions, odds, how to watch Super Bowl 2024\n\nWhat is the 'Drake curse'?\n\nThe \"Drake curse\" is a popular belief on the internet that any athlete or team that receives support from the Canadian rapper Drake will lose the sporting event in which they're participating.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nThis curse is believed to affect people even if Drake is only seen in a photo with an athlete or wearing a particular jersey.\n\nBut frequently, the supposed victims of the curse are the teams and athletes Drake favors to win their contests, with an Instagram photo of a betting slip providing the evidence. Believers claim his habit of sharing his large wagers on social media dooms the side he's rooting for.\n\nDrake’s betting history\n\nLike anyone who is an avid bettor, they have their good days and bad. The only difference is an average person may not be making million-dollar wagers on sporting events like Drake is.\n\nHere is a look at those the internet says have fallen victim to the “Drake Curse.”\n\nUFC 297: Sean Strickland vs. Dricus Du Plessis\n\nThe most recent victim of the “Drake Curse” was middleweight champion Sean Strickland, after Drake posted an image on social media showing a $700,000 bet in Strickland’s favor. Drake didn't start his 2024 betting campaign on the right foot and Strickland lost his middleweight title to Dricus du Plessis.\n\nUFC 293: Israel Adesanya vs. Sean Strickland\n\nIsrael Adesanya was stunned by Sean Strickland when he was defeated by unanimous decision in UFC 293, which resulted in Adesanya losing his middleweight title.

However, Fury emerged as the winner by a split decision. To add insult to injury, Paul even accused Drake of being the reason for his defeat.\n\nToronto Maple Leafs\n\nDrake, who is originally from Toronto, Ontario, has always been a vocal supporter of his hometown NHL team, the Maple Leafs. During the first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs in 2019, he was spotted cheering on the Maple Leafs from a box while they faced the Boston Bruins. However, despite his support, Toronto ended up losing 6-4.\n\nCollege Football Playoff National Championship game in 2019\n\nDrake posted a video of himself motivating the Alabama football team before the Crimson Tide's 2019 College Football Playoff National Championship game against Clemson. Alabama went on to lose 44-16.\n\nThe Philadelphia 76ers\n\nIn the 2019 NBA playoffs, Drake, a Toronto Raptors fan, decided to participate in the \"Drake Curse\" by wearing a Philadelphia 76ers jersey while watching his hometown team play against the 76ers. The unusual move seemed to work as Kawhi Leonard hit the game-winning shot, helping the Raptors advance to the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nConor McGregor at UFC 229\n\nDrake is a big fan of the Irish UFC star and was one of his main supporters before McGregor's UFC 229 fight against Khabib Numagomedov in 2018. The rapper even attended the UFC 229 weigh-in and took a photo with McGregor, holding an Irish flag.\n\nDuring the fourth round of the fight, Nurmagomedov put McGregor in a neck crank, which eventually forced McGregor to submit.\n\nJohnny Manziel\n\nAny fan of college football would know about Johnny Manziel, the Heisman Trophy winner who was drafted as the Cleveland Browns' 22nd overall pick in the 2014 NFL Draft. Drake even released a song titled \"Draft Day\" in honor of Manziel. However, Manziel only played two seasons in the NFL before being released due to his behavior and struggling to live up to expectations.\n\nThe song also mentions Andrew Wiggins, a native Canadian and former first overall pick in the NBA draft, who has had an up-and-down career in nine seasons.\n\nSerena Williams\n\nIn 2015, there were rumors that Drake was romantically involved with Serena Williams.

Because Spags will bend your ear without provocation on the subject of Purdy, who he will of course face this Sunday in Super Bowl LVIII.\n\n\"Part of it is that he’s so poised,\" Spagnuolo said on Monday's Opening Night, when I asked him why Purdy has been so very good against the blitz this season. \"I don’t think people give him enough credit for the talent he has. And then, he’s got all those weapons around him. I’ve been thoroughly impressed with what I’ve watched on tape over the last eight days. I’ve watched about every game now, and I don’t see the guy making very many mistakes.\"\n\nI then asked Spagnuolo how important it is to hide one's blitz intentions, and he took that as another opportunity to talk Purdy up.\n\n\"Yeah, you want to do that to a quarterback all the time. You don’t really want them to know you’re coming. You are trying to find ways to get free rushers. It doesn’t happen to him very often, and when it does, he’s got a really good knack for getting the ball out quickly. He gets the ball out before the receiver makes his break, and the timing they have is tremendous.\"\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nSoon after that, the conversation turned to the mobility Purdy has shown in the playoffs with some important run plays --yes, he is \"sneaky athletic.\" And Spags was all over that concept.\n\n\"Anytime you’re playing a quarterback who’s as talented as he is, and can run the football, you have to make a lot of decisions. How many guys you commit to rushing the passer, and how many guys you commit to scrambling. We have a little bit of everything [to deal with], and we have to get him in those situations. First and second down, they do such a good job of running the ball, you have to get them into those passing situations.\"\n\nAsked a few minutes later about the 49ers' offense in total... well, guess where Spags went in a big hurry?\n\n\"All the weapons they have, I mean, it’s multiple, right? We don’t have a lot of crossover from the AFC to the NFC, so I didn’t see them a lot. But I am thoroughly impressed with this quarterback. I don’t care where he came from, or what got him to this point. He’s the real deal. Not only throwing the ball, but you saw in these playoff games what he can do running the ball. And he’s as poised as I’ve seen at this early stage of his career.\"\n\nIt's been a highly interesting week of watching 49ers tape for Spagnuolo, and it's quite clear that Purdy has been the focus. Even a specific question about running back Christian McCaffrey eventually got the ball rolling back to No. 13.\n\n\"The thing that impressed me is that I was expecting to turn on the film and see someone who looked like a backup quarterback, and had a weakness somewhere. But the timing of his throws, and the anticipation of his throws, are really impressive. And the fact that he can scramble like a really good athlete – I was really impressed with that. I didn’t know that about him. He seems like a really experienced quarterback who’s been doing it for a long time. I often try to watch the broadcast views and not just the coach’s tape. You know how those cameras can get really close [on the quarterback’s face] and he never gets rattled. He always looks poised, and it’s really impressive.\"\n\nNot that Spags in unaware of Kyle Shanahan's other weapons, and how they'll be deployed. But this is a clear indicator that whatever negative impressions people outside the league may have of Purdy at this point in his career... well, those views are not shared by the guys who have to devise schemes to go against him.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/06"}]}

It is also protesting what it characterizes as the company’s refusal to bargain with the union on a first labor deal. There are 264 stores that have voted in favor of union representation. But no contracts have yet been negotiated even at stores which voted nearly a year ago.\n\n“This is to show them we’re not playing around,” said Tyler Keeling, a 26-year old union supporter who has worked at a Starbucks in Lakewood, California — near Los Angeles — for the last six years. “We’re done with the their anti-union retaliation and them walking away from bargaining.”\n\nKeeling and other union supporters say that it was up to each individual store as to whether or not to participate in the nationwide strike. Many stores have staged brief strikes already over specific issues. But this is the first nationwide action.\n\n“There’s a lot of fear before a store decides to go on strike,” said Michelle Eisen, an organizer of the first Starbucks store to vote in favor of the union last December. “Starbucks has been retaliating against union leaders across the country. But despite that fear, over 2,000 workers across the country are striking today and standing up for one another.”\n\nWhen Keeling’s store staged a one-day strike in August, Starbucks (SBUX) workers from nearby non-union stores joined the picket line, he said, and some customers brought food and drinks to the strikers.\n\nIt’s not clear how many of the stores affected by Thursday’s action will be able to stay open during the strike.\n\nThe protest comes on “Red Cup” day at Starbucks, when it gives out reusable holiday cups with certain drink purchases that entitle customers to discounts and extra bonus points on future purchases.\n\n“Culturally Red Cup Day is an important day at Starbucks. People do go crazy over it,” said Keeling. He said holding the strike on a day that has such a heavy volume of customers is a great way call attention to anti-union activities.\n\nThe union is calling its strike a “Red Cup Rebellion” and is handing out red Starbucks Workers United union cups to customers instead.\n\nStarbucks workers picket a location in New York City, as part of a one-day strike at more than 100 stores nationwide. Chris Isidore/CNN\n\nAt a store across from the Port Authority Bus Terminal in New York City, workers walked the picket line even though their store isn’t having a union vote until Dec. 8. The store was open, with the help of managers brought in from other stores, according to the strikers. Staff on the job in the store wouldn’t comment on the strike.\n\nAaron Cirillo, a 23-year old working at the store since August, said he’s not discouraged by the fact that the store was able to stay open or that many customers crossed the picket line.\n\n“We’re not trying to intimidate them. We just want them to hear our story about the need for a fair contract,” he said. Asked what he would tell customers if he could, he responded, “I would urge them to think about showing support by not getting a coffee this one day, or to go to any other store in the city for a coffee.”\n\nThe strikers chants were enough to prompt some customers to turn away, but there was a good flow of customers in the store.\n\nThe company was not immediately available for comment on the strike early Thursday. In the past it has denied it has retaliated against any employee for their support of the union, and it has blamed the union for lack of progress at the negotiating table. Starbucks has defended the firings of union supporters that have taken place as proper enforcement of rules that apply to all of its employees, who it refers to as “partners.”\n\n“Interest in a union does not exempt partners from following policies and procedures that apply to all partners,” Starbucks said in an earlier statement.\n\nBut this week, the National Labor Relations Board — which oversees union representation votes — filed in federal court for a national cease and desist order to prevent Starbucks from retaliating against union supporters.\n\nThe NLRB filing said that there had been a “number and pattern of Starbucks’ unfair labor practices … particularly discharges” against union supporters at it stores.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/05/business/ups-teamster-union-strike/index.html", "title": "One of the biggest strikes in US history is brewing at UPS | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nOver the past year, the nascent labor movements at mighty corporations like Starbucks and Amazon have grabbed national attention. But less well-known is a looming high-stakes clash between one of America’s oldest unions and the world’s biggest package courier.\n\nContract negotiations are set to begin in the spring between UPS and the Teamsters Union ahead of their current contract’s expiration at the end of July, 2023. Already, before the talks have even started, labor experts are predicting that the drivers and package handlers will go on strike.\n\n“The question is how long it will be,” said Todd Vachon, professor of Labor Relations at Rutgers. “The union’s president ran and won on taking a more militant approach. Even if they’re very close [to a deal], the rank and file will be hungry to take on the company.”\n\nIf that happens, a strike at UPS would affect nearly every household in the country. An estimated 6% of the nation’s gross domestic product is moved in UPS trucks every year. The explosive growth of online retail has made the company and its drivers more crucial than ever to the nation’s struggling supply chain. Beyond the company’s home deliveries, it also delivers many of the goods found in stores, factories and offices.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Starbucks employees at New York store vote to unionize (2021) 02:06 - Source: CNNBusiness\n\nAbout 350,000 Teamsters work at UPS as drivers and package sorters out of a global workforce of 534,000 permanent employees. And that’s growing fast — the company has added some 72,000 Teamster-represented jobs since the start of the pandemic.\n\nWhile there are competing services at FedEx (FDX), the US Postal Service and Amazon’s own delivery service, none of them have the capacity to handle more than a small fraction of the 21.5 million US packages that UPS moves daily.\n\n“We want a contract that provides wins for our employees and that provides UPS the flexibility to stay competitive in a rapidly changing industry,” the company said in a statement this month. “UPS and the Teamsters have worked cooperatively for almost 100 years to meet the needs of UPS employees, customers, and the communities where we live and work. We believe we’ll continue to find common ground with the Teamsters and reach an agreement that’s good for everyone involved.”\n\nThe union has not gone on strike against UPS since a nearly two-week protest in 1997. If the union does go on strike, it would be the largest strike against a single business in nation’s history.\n\nAnger over current contract\n\nThere are certainly signs of strain in relations between the company and the union — both its leadership and its rank-and-file members.\n\nA majority of members voted against ratifying the current contract in 2018, only to see the previous Teamster leadership, led by then-President James Hoffa, put it in place because not enough of the membership participated in the ratification vote to trigger a strike.\n\nThe union’s new president, Sean O’Brien, won his office earlier this year by making the UPS contract a central focus of his campaign. He has vowed to make UPS pay Teamster members far more this time and he often talks about a $300 million strike fund the union has accumulated to pay members in case they go on strike.\n\n“Do our members wake up every day wanting a strike. I’d say no. But are they fed up? Yes they’re fed up,” O’Brien told CNN Business last week. “Whether or not there is a strike, that’s totally up to the company. We’re going to utilize as much leverage as we can to get our members the contract they deserve.”\n\nUPS said the average pay for its delivery drivers is $95,000 a year, with benefits such as a traditional pension plan, worth an additional $50,000 a year. UPS’ semi-tractor drivers are paid even more. That’s far higher than most wages at FedEx and Amazon, where many drivers work for small independent contractors.\n\nThe current contract expires at 12:01 am August 1. O’Brien vows the union will not grant any kind of contract extension past that deadline.\n\nAnd he added that on top of improved pay and benefits, the union will demand better working conditions, including adding air conditioning in the panel trucks used for UPS deliveries which the union says poses a health risk for drivers.\n\n“It’s not a heavy lift for the company to install air conditioning,” he said. “There’s a lot of heat stroke going on.”\n\nRecord profits at UPS\n\nThe company often speaks about how much it values its Teamster-represented workforce.\n\nAnd in one important way – employment numbers – UPS is one of the best friends labor has in the ranks of US corporate management, despite the obvious tensions. UPS is one of the few unionized employers that is significantly adding payrolls, and to union membership. At other businesses, union membership numbers have been steadily declining or decades.\n\nThe increase in Teamsters jobs at UPS has come from the steady growth in online purchases, especially during the pandemic-era surge. Last year, it took only nine months to report what was already a record profit for a full year. UPS ended 2021 with operating income up 50% to $13.1 billion. In the first half of this year, earnings rose another 10% compared with a year ago.\n\n“Everyone keeps getting richer except for our members,” said O’Brien.\n\nUPS CEO Carol Tome, who started that job just as the pandemic began, says that the company’s union contract is a competitive advantage at a time of worker shortages.\n\nShe also is trying to assure both investors and UPS customers that the company will be prepared in case the union does go on strike. She declined to comment on what those preparations are.\n\n“Our goal with the Teamsters is win-win-win,” she told investors in July. But she added that UPS is “building contingency plans.”", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/22/americas/colombia-coco-decriminalize-intl-latam/index.html", "title": "Colombia's drug problem is worse than ever. But it has a radical ...", "text": "Bogota CNN —\n\nWhen Gustavo Petro, Colombia’s first progressive president, took office in August, he laid out an ambitious agenda.\n\nHis administration would finally achieve a stable peace with Colombia’s multiple rebel organizations; it would fight inequality by taxing the top 1% and lifting millions out of poverty; and it would abandon a punitive approach to drug policing that costed millions of lives around the world to little results, he promised.\n\nThree months later, there are signs for optimism: Colombia and the largest rebel group still active in its territory, the National Liberation Army ELN, have signed a commitment to restart peace negotiations after a four years hiatus; and Congress has passed a fiscal plan that aims to collect almost 4 billion USD in new taxes next year.\n\nBut drugs remain perhaps the hardest challenge for Petro.\n\nMore cocaine than ever before\n\nDrug production boomed in Colombia during the pandemic.\n\nThe total area harvested for coca leaves – the main ingredient for cocaine – grew 43% in 2021 according to a new annual survey by the United Nation’s Office on Drug and Crime. At the same time, the amount of potential coca produced per hectare grew a further 14%, the UN reported, leaving experts to believe Colombia is producing more cocaine than ever in its history.\n\nIn many rural parts of the country, the production of illicit drug became the only economic activity during pandemic lockdowns, the UN explains, as markets and agricultural routes shut down and farmers switched from food crops to coca.\n\nAccording to Elizabeth Dickenson, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, the spike in harvests has become so evident even the casual traveler can see it.\n\n“A few years ago, you’d have to drive for hours to see coca crops. Now they are much more common, less than one kilometer from the main highway,” she told CNN after a recent field trip to Cauca, part of a Colombian southwestern region that has seen a +76% increase in harvested area.\n\nColombian president Gustavo Petro speaks during a press conference about the first 100 days of his government in office, in Bogota on November 15. Chepa Beltran/Long Visual Press/Abaca/Sipa USA/AP\n\nIn the Indigenous reserve of Tacueyo, Cauca, the increase in coca and marijuana harvests have caused profound concern for the leaders of the community according to Nora Taquinas, an Indigenous environmental defender who has received multiple death threats from criminal organizations.\n\nTwo signs show a more sustained drug trade than in recent years, Taquinas says: informal checkpoints on the road leading up to Tacueyo and worrying trends of school dropouts as local children are pressed into service by criminal organizations for menial tasks around the production of narcotics.\n\n“The cartels pay about 15’000COP (about 3USD) to clean a pound of marijuana sprouts. A kid can do up to six pounds per day, and that is solid money down here. It’s hard to stop that.”\n\nThe only positive aspect, Taquinas says, is that the increase in drug production and trade in her community has not caused higher levels of violence. “We are on the lookout. But soon enough, the cartels will start competing for the harvests here, and the competition between them is to the death. Right now, it’s like the calm before the storm.”\n\nThe proliferation of armed groups in recent years is one of the greatest shortcomings of the Colombian peace process, which in 2016 brought an end to more than half a century of civil warfare.\n\nBefore the deal, most of the guerrilla groups were disciplined like a regular army and this helped war negotiations between public officials and rebel groups. Now, the armed actors who didn’t abandon armed struggle have splintered in up to sixty different groups often in competition against themselves, according to the United Nations.\n\nEven if the recently announced peace negotiation with the ELN succeeded, there are at least 59 more groups involved in the drug trade for the government to deal with.\n\nCompeting with cocaine\n\nConvincing farmers to stop growing coca has been one of Colombia’s largest problems for the last fifty years.\n\nThe traditional solution has been to punish the farmers by destroying crops through ever-more sophisticated and forceful measures: aerial fumigations, enforced eradication campaigns, aerial monitoring, and the deployment of troops to coca-growing regions.\n\nBut this cost millions of dollars, mostly financed through military aid from the United States to Colombia, and has claimed the lives of thousands of Colombian farmers and soldiers in clashes and drug-related violence. Until this year, few dared to question it from a position of power.\n\nWhile Petro bears no responsibility for latest the production increases – the report details narcotic trends until December 2021, before this year’s election – his message to ditch the war on drugs resonates with the United Nations’ finding that the billions of dollars invested in preventing Colombian farmers from growing coca could be put to a better use.\n\n“The first thing to notice from the report is the total failure of the war on drugs,” says Colombia’s Justice Minister Nestor Osuna and one of the people tasked with coming up with a new solution to the drug problem.\n\nThe government’s plan, Osuna told CNN, is centered on three key moments.\n\nIn the immediate, term, Petro’s administration aims to limit the spread of drug-related violence immediately, even if that means allowing further increases in coca harvesting areas might take place in the coming years.\n\nIn order to avoid confrontation with coca-growing communities and reduce retaliatory actions from the cartels, Colombia’s coca eradication campaign will be pared-down, although not completely suspended, and the justice ministry would embark in a series of ‘voluntary consultations’ to convince communities to replace illicit crops with legal ones in exchange for financial incentives.\n\nEventually, crop substitution will take place on a massive scale by expanding the farming frontier of Colombia, he says.\n\n“If we offer a sustainable alternative to the farmers harvesting coca, they will take it. It is true that right now no agricultural product can compete with the revenue coca makes, but it’s also true that coca remains illegal, and we believe the farmers have signaled us they would rather work under the law, even at lower margins, than in illegality,” the justice minister said.\n\nThe plan is to relocate thousands of farmers who are currently harvesting coca into unused agricultural for a fresh start with legal crops. Last month, the Colombian government agreed to the purchase of up to three million hectares from the country’s rancher association to expand the agricultural lands.\n\nColombia has tried crop replacement in the past, but failed to overcome the appeal of coca. The coca bush can produce a harvest up to six times a year and requires minimal care, as an invasive plant that grows even in unfavorable conditions.\n\nCoca buyers, the drug cartels, are willing to pay in advance for a harvest, often in cash, and crucially will also provide transport by picking it up from the farm – a significant incentive for farmers who live hours of unpaved road away from main market towns. That’s why the Petro government wants to relocate the cocaine workforce entirely.\n\nMembers of Colombia's anti-narcotics police seize a cargo of molasses mixed with cocaine that was being sent to Valencia in Spain in Cartagena, Colombia on February 4, 2022. Sebastian Barros/Long Visual Press/Universal Images Group/Getty Images\n\nThe areas that are currently devoted to coca, once abandoned, would go through a process of reforestation, Osuna said, thanks to a new public investment fund worth 120 million USD to pay farmers to protect the rainforest for the next 20 years. Each family would receive up to 600 USD per month to launch reforestation projects in areas affected by coca harvesting as well as illegal ranching and logging.\n\nUltimately, Petro’s ultimate goal is to de-criminalize cocaine. But Osuna is adamant the government would not launch such a move unilaterally – cocaine’s criminal status is globally codified in a series of international treaties.\n\nPetro has made a point of displaying the failures of the war on drugs at any international forum he took part to, from the official visit of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to the United Nations General Assembly in September.\n\nIt’s a strategy Osuna labelled as “nagging offensive”, with the hope that the world would one day hold an informed debate on whether narcotics should still be considered prohibited substances.\n\n“We must recognize that cocaine consumption takes place all around the world, it’s evident. For many people, that consumption is harmful, and that’s why it would be good if countries employed public health policies to deal with this issue,” said Osuna.\n\n(For his part, Osuna noted that his only experience with drugs was a marijuana joint in his twenties in Amsterdam that left him sick for two days.)\n\nCan it be done?\n\nWhile many world leaders have urged a global rethinking around the issues of drugs, this is the first time a sitting president of Colombia – the world’s largest cocaine producer – openly calls to give up the war on drugs.\n\nAccording to a 2019 study from the University of Oxford, the drug trade is worth almost 2% of Colombia’s GDP. Nobody can predict how a Colombia free from the drug trade would eventually look like, and Osuna is well aware of how difficult the task ahead is: “The war on drugs has failed for the past fifty years, it’s not like we can come and solve it in fifty days,” he told CNN.\n\nThe government’s critics, such as former Colombian president Alvaro Uribe, who presided over the greatest crop reduction in the country’s history through a controversial all-out military campaign in the early 2000, believe legalizing cocaine would only make the cartels wealthier, not poorer.\n\nBut recent development on marijuana legislation around the world, with countries as far as Germany and Uruguay, as well as more than fifteen US states, passing legislation to allow recreational use, prove that it is possible to turn the tide, Osuna says.\n\nColombia is also discussing legalizing weed, a move that just three years ago would have been unthinkable and that, if passed, has the potential to legalize the work of dozens of families in Tacueyo.\n\nA pilot project to produce textile fabrics made of hemp is already up and running, though demand for the fiber is very small compared to cartel demand for marijuana, Taquinas says. “What we need is more legal outlets, not fewer.”", "authors": ["Stefano Pozzebon"], "publish_date": "2022/11/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/17/politics/ridge-alkonis-jailed-japan-family-biden/index.html", "title": "Ridge Alkonis: Family of US Navy officer jailed in Japan over fatal ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe family of a US Navy officer imprisoned in Japan rallied outside the White House on Wednesday to protest his detention and try to attract President Joe Biden’s attention to the case.\n\nNavy Lt. Ridge Alkonis was sentenced to three years in a Japanese prison in October for what Japanese courts deemed to be the negligent driving deaths of two Japanese citizens in May 2021. Alkonis appealed, but his sentence was upheld last month.\n\nAlkonis has maintained that he suffered from acute mountain sickness as he was driving down from Mount Fuji with his family on May 29, 2021, and fell unconscious behind the wheel, leading to the deadly crash. An 85-year-old woman and her 54-year-old son-in-law died in the accident.\n\nThe Japanese high court did not believe Alkonis’ argument that he fell ill, and instead accused him of falling asleep at the wheel. Under those standards, Alkonis’ sentence could have been longer – under Japanese law, he could have faced up to seven years in prison, according to the Japanese government.\n\nBut Alkonis’ family has argued he was ill, not negligent, and therefore committed no crime. They have also noted that they offered the victims’ families over $1 million in restitution, as is customary in Japan.\n\n“The reason we think it’s unfair is because his Japanese attorney said that people that have been in situations like his that have made a complete settlement—0% of them have gone to prison,” Brittany Alkonis, Ridge’s wife, told CNN’s Jake Tapper in an interview on “The Lead” on Wednesday.\n\nReferring to the restitution payment, she told Tapper, “Our settlement, well, settlements in general, are very important. They’re a very important part of the Japanese judicial system. The one we made was incredibly large.”\n\nReferring to the restitution payment, she told Tapper, “Our settlement, well, settlements in general, are very important. They’re a very important part of the Japanese judicial system. The one we made was incredibly large.”\n\nNo member of the US government has publicly said Alkonis did not receive a fair trial, but discussions have been taking place about bringing him back to the US to serve out his sentence, multiple sources told CNN.\n\nAlkonis’ family and his supporters, including Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah and Democratic Rep. Mike Levin of California, have urged the Biden administration to do more to help free Alkonis. They have argued that he was improperly detained, put in solitary confinement, and interrogated by Japanese authorities for nearly a month after his arrest and before being charged, and that he did not receive a full medical evaluation after the accident that could have confirmed his mountain sickness.\n\n“My husband was the victim of a medical emergency, yet he’s being treated like a criminal,” Brittany Alkonis said during a press conference on Wednesday. “Who is being punished the most by this injustice? It’s our three innocent children that miss their father every day.”\n\nTwenty republican senators wrote to Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida earlier this month asking the Japanese government to consider expelling Alkonis, now serving a three-year prison sentence in Japan, as they made the case that the “full nature” of the situation had not been taken into consideration. They also noted that a Navy investigation concluded that Alkonis lost consciousness because of acute mountain sickness.\n\n“With these considerations in mind, we respectfully and humbly ask that you will consider our request for the expulsion of Lieutenant Alkonis from Japan, allowing him to return to his wife and three children in the United States,” the senators wrote in a letter reviewed by CNN, laying out specifics about the incident such as there being no alcohol or drugs involved in the crash.\n\n“We are extremely troubled by the three-year prison sentence Lieutenant Alkonis received on October 18, 2021,” they wrote. “Japanese nationals convicted of the same crime are routinely granted leniency. In fact, 95% of similarly charged defendants get a suspended sentence, meaning they do not serve prison time.” They did not provide a source for their claim about leniency being granted for similar cases.\n\nThis week the Japanese ambassador in Washington responded on behalf of the prime Minister to the letter, saying that the court verdict is final and that the government of Japan will continue to work with the US on “potential actions” going forward, Lee told CNN.\n\n“I am encouraged by it,” Lee said of the response, adding that it “didn’t dismiss the possibility of expulsion and expressed a willingness and an inclination to continue working with the US to discuss potential actions going forward.”\n\nLee said that Japan could expel Alkonis based on the status of forces agreement between the two nations.\n\nCNN has approached the Japanese embassy in Washington for comment.\n\nA US Navy spokesperson told CNN that the Navy believes Alkonis’ sentence is “uncommonly disproportionate.”\n\n“This was a tragic event that resulted in the loss of two precious lives, and tremendous pain for everyone involved,” said the spokeswoman, Cmdr. Katie Cerezo. “We respect the judicial process. However, we are disappointed with the result, which we believe is uncommonly disproportionate given the mitigating evidence.”\n\nDiscussions about a prisoner transfer\n\nMultiple sources told CNN that the US government has been in contact with the Japanese government regarding the case, and that US Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel as well as national security adviser Jake Sullivan have been urging Japan to agree to a prisoner transfer in line with rules set out by the Council of Europe.\n\nEssentially, the process would allow Alkonis to be transferred back to the US to carry out the rest of his sentence in an American prison, while the US sentencing commission reviews the appropriateness of his sentence.\n\n“I think our posture as a government is to try to make for a better resolution to this matter, recognizing a ton of heartbreak from many people involved in this,” said an administration official when discussing the situation. “There’s a relatively regular dialogue between the US and Japan on this. It is not just a one-time thing.”\n\nThe National Security Council declined to comment.\n\nEmanuel discussed the possibility of a prisoner transfer with Alkonis’ family in July, but a source close to the Alkonis family told CNN that the idea is “completely unacceptable” to Alkonis and his family.\n\n“The family is not OK with Ridge coming back in handcuffs, and for him to be a felon in two countries,” the source said, adding that Alkonis would lose his right to vote in the US, among other penalties. The source added that the idea appeared to simply be an “easy out” that elements of the US government were considering.\n\nJonathan Franks, a spokesperson for the family, echoed that sentiment during Wednesday’s news conference. “The Council of Europe treaty, also known as a prisoner of transfer treaty, is not an acceptable remedy here for the family,” he said. “That would involve Ridge coming home in custody, going to federal prison, waiting some period of months for the sentencing commission to act, and affix a charge and a sentence to the foreign offense, which would leave him a felon in his own country, for something that would never have been charged in this country and that’s unacceptable.”\n\nFranks added that “so far, none of the agencies nor the White House can explain an outcome under the prisoner transfer treaty that won’t be that, and it’s just not acceptable to ask someone that’s rendered extraordinary service to this country to come home in handcuffs.”\n\nIn addition to expelling Alkonis from Japan, there are other options the US could push Japan for, the source said, including urging the Japanese to commute Alkonis’ sentence or issue a pardon.\n\nState Department spokesperson Ned Price said on Tuesday that the department is “continuing to monitor the situation with the Department of Defense and our embassy in Tokyo to explore all options for finding a successful resolution that is consistent with US law, with Japanese law, as well as with existing treaties.”\n\nPrice confirmed that Emanuel had spoken with the Alkonis family as well as with lawmakers, his US military counterparts, and Japanese government officials.\n\n“Department of State officials here in Washington have also been in touch with their Japanese counterparts at the Japanese embassy here, and the embassy in Tokyo is coordinating with the Department of Defense to provide all appropriate assistance,” he said.\n\nTime running out\n\nBrittany Alkonis said on Wednesday, however, that time is running out – when her husband runs out of leave days from the US Navy, her family will lose “all pay and benefits,” she said.\n\n“We will be forced to leave Japan with no income, no insurance, and it will be impossible for me and my kids to visit or even speak to Ridge for the next three years,” Brittany Alkonis said. She told Tapper that “if we leave, that means that we’ll go three years without seeing Ridge, without talking to Ridge, there are no phone privileges.” She said that since her husband has been imprisoned, she’s been allowed one 20-minute meeting with him.\n\nBrittany Alkonis said she would remain at the White House today, tomorrow and as many days as it takes for her to be invited inside to have a meeting with the US government about her husband’s imprisonment.\n\nTrevor Reed, an American citizen and Marine veteran who was imprisoned in Russia for two years, claimed Alkonis is being held in harsh prison conditions that give him little access to communicate with his family. Reed attended the protest in front of the White House.\n\n“They’ve imprisoned him for three years, where he’s going to be in a place where he has the limited ability to even write and receive letters, no phone calls,” Reed said. “The conditions inside the Japanese prison are not a joke.”\n\nReed called on the White House and the Department of Defense to intervene.\n\n“The United States has the ability to get Ridge out and to get him out immediately, so they need to do that,” Reed said.", "authors": ["Natasha Bertrand Kylie Atwood", "Natasha Bertrand", "Kylie Atwood"], "publish_date": "2022/08/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/07/world/human-composting-natural-organic-reduction-scn-lbg/index.html", "title": "How human composting works and benefits the environment | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Greener newsletter. Our limited newsletter series guides you on lifestyle changes to minimize your personal role in the climate crisis — and reduce your eco-anxiety.\n\nCNN —\n\nYou probably know that composting banana peels and eggshells can help reduce your negative impact on the environment. But did you know that, once you die, you can do that with your body, too?\n\nHuman composting — also known as natural organic reduction or the reduction of human remains — is the practice of placing a dead body in a reusable vessel with biodegradable materials that foster the transformation into nutrient-dense soil that can be returned to loved ones or donated to conservation land.\n\nThe notion of going green even in death might sound far-fetched, but California has become the latest state to sign a human composting bill into law, set to go into effect in 2027. Washington became the first state to legalize human composting in 2019, followed by Oregon, Colorado and Vermont.\n\nAdvocates of human composting hope it can help slow the climate crisis driven by burning fossil fuels that produce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide and methane. Cremations require lots of fuel — cremating one corpse emits an estimated 418 pounds of carbon dioxide into the air, the equivalent of driving 470 miles in a car, according to Chemical & Engineering News, a publication of the American Chemical Society. In the United States, cremations account for 1.74 billion pounds of carbon dioxide emissions each year, according to Green Burial Council Inc., an organization that oversees certification standards for cemeteries, funeral homes and product providers engaged in sustainable burial practices.\n\n“Human composting … uses much less energy than cremation, which uses fossil gas to create heat of over 1,400 degrees Fahrenheit,” said Katrina Spade, founder and CEO of Recompose, a licensed green funeral home in Seattle. “When human composting transforms the organic material of our bodies, carbon is also sequestered in the soil created. Rather than being released as carbon dioxide gas through exhaust during a cremation, the carbon matter contained in each body returns to the earth.”\n\nCristina Garcia, the California Assembly member who introduced the state legislation, said wildfires and extreme drought are reminders that climate change is real, and that methane and carbon dioxide emissions must be reduced. “For each individual who chooses (natural organic reduction) over conventional burial or cremation, the process saves the equivalent of one metric ton of carbon from entering the environment,” Garcia said in a September news release.\n\nRecompose, Spade’s company, became the first human composting facility in the US when it opened in December 2020. Spade thought of human composting in graduate school after learning about livestock mortality composting, when farm animals are recycled back to the land, she said.\n\nHuman composting happens in steel cylinders known as vessels at Recompose. Sabel Roizen\n\nThe industry is new, and there is little research on how much better human composting is for the environment compared with traditional burials, cremation or green burials. And the process isn’t carbon-free since it still involves machinery operated by electricity and transportation of bodies, materials and remains, said Ed Bixby, president of the Green Burial Council.\n\nAs interest in more sustainable end-of-life options grows, transparency about the practice is crucial, Bixby said. A recent National Funeral Directors Association survey that found 60.5% of respondents were interested in exploring “green” funeral options because of potential environmental benefits, cost savings or other reasons.\n\n“With our families, we never want them to be disturbed or upset believing something that isn’t,” Bixby said. “If you’re going to do something, if it’s environmentally conscious, we think that’s wonderful. But we want to be sure that people understand what they’re buying into.”\n\nReducing death’s environmental and financial impact\n\nAt Recompose, human composting happens in a steel cylinder that’s 8 feet long and 4 feet tall, Spade said. A body is placed in the vessel on a bed of wood chips, alfalfa and straw.\n\n“Human composting creates an environment in which beneficial microbes thrive, with a specific moisture content and ratio of carbon and nitrogen materials,” Spade said.\n\nOver the next 30 days, everything inside naturally decomposes. One body creates a cubic yard of soil amendment — a substance added to soil to improve its texture or health — which is removed from the vessel and cured for two to six weeks. Afterward, it can be donated to conservation projects, or a certain amount can be returned to loved ones. But the amount loved ones receive can depend on what a state allows since the soil would still be legally considered human remains with regulations on what people can do with them, Bixby said.\n\nThe practice also avoids the introduction of nonbiodegradable materials — such as concrete or plastic vaults, steel caskets or lacquers — to the atmosphere or land, and forest depletion for wood caskets, Bixby said. Human composting would also protect funeral home workers from exposure to high levels of formaldehyde, which has been found to cause myeloid leukemia and rare cancers.\n\nHuman composting could lower the financial footprint of end-of-life arrangements, too. The median cost of a funeral with cremation in the US in 2021 was $6,971, and the median cost of a funeral with a viewing and burial was $7,848, according to the National Funeral Directors Association. But the median burial estimate doesn’t include a plot, headstone or other cemetery costs associated with a traditional burial, which can often double the cost, Spade said.\n\n“Recompose strives to keep the price for human composting comparable to other death care options,” Spade said.\n\nRecompose has composted more than 200 corpses into soil since opening nearly two years ago and has more than 1,100 people signed up for Precompose, the company’s prearrangement program, Spade said.\n\n“We hear from our clients that knowing that their body — or that of their loved one — will be able to return to the earth is deeply comforting,” Spade said.\n\nNot everyone is eligible for human composting. Natural organic reduction destroys most harmful pathogens, but there are three rare diseases that disqualify a body from undergoing human composting, Spade said: Ebola, tuberculosis and diseases caused by prions, which are abnormal, transmissible pathogenic agents that can cause abnormal folding of certain brain proteins.\n\nThe list of states allowing human composting may soon grow longer. A bill in New York state has passed both legislative houses and is on its way to the governor’s desk, Spade said. And in Massachusetts, state Reps. Jack Lewis and Natalie Higgins are leading a bill to legalize human composting there.\n\nMost funeral homes, however, might not be quick to adopt the practice, Bixby said. Once a permit is issued, direct cremation can be done the same day, he added. A burial typically takes three to five days, while human composting can take up to 120.\n\n“The problem I see, as far as this growing, is that you can’t do high volume,” Bixby said. “As long as this process is, having five or six (vessels) doesn’t do a lot of good. … As a businessman, my feeling is this really won’t gain much ground for that main reason.”\n\nHe added, “It doesn’t make a lot of practical sense. And I hate to make things about money because it shouldn’t be, but at the end of the day, when you’re providing a service, it has to be about the income because you have to keep the lights on.”", "authors": ["Kristen Rogers"], "publish_date": "2022/11/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/17/politics/why-liz-cheney-lost/index.html", "title": "How Liz Cheney lost Wyoming's lone seat in the House | CNN Politics", "text": "Jackson, Wyoming CNN —\n\nRep. Liz Cheney’s supporters say her reelection hopes were doomed on January 13, 2021, when a week after the insurrection at the Capitol, she and nine other House Republicans voted to impeach former President Donald Trump.\n\nEverything since that day – Cheney’s role on the House select committee investigating the insurrection; her ads featuring her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, eviscerating Trump; her speeches attempting to steer the GOP away from Trump’s influence – only served Harriet Hageman’s victory in Wyoming’s primary for its lone House seat on Tuesday.\n\nCheney’s ouster caps a summer in which Trump has purged the GOP of many of his critics, while elevating candidates – including Hageman – who have parroted his lies about widespread election fraud. Trump-aligned candidates have won primaries for governor in swing states such as Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, and Senate in Georgia, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Candidates backed by the former President have positioned themselves to take over the election machinery in a series of key states if they win in November.\n\nPrimaries in recent months have also brought into focus the role a handful of prominent Republicans, including Cheney and former Vice President Mike Pence, are seeking to play in moving the GOP beyond Trump and his election denialism.\n\nBut Wyoming’s results on Tuesday demonstrated the long odds those Trump critics face in a party in which the former President remains the most dominant figure and is teasing a third run for the White House in 2024.\n\nPresident Joe Biden called Cheney following her primary loss, according to a person familiar with the matter who declined to divulge the contents of the conversation. Bloomberg was first to report the call.\n\nCheney attempted to assemble a coalition of Democrats, independents and moderate and anti-Trump Republicans – many of them ideological opponents of the neoconservative congresswoman before the last 19 months – to save her seat. Her campaign sent information to registered Democrats in Wyoming about how to change their party registration, and in interviews across the state in the lead-up to the election, a number of Democrats did say they were voting for Cheney.\n\nBut the Cowboy State’s electorate is almost entirely Republican. Wyoming has more than 215,000 registered Republicans compared to just 36,000 registered Democrats, according to data from the secretary of state’s office. That’s a drop of about 15,000 registered Democrats from early 2021, but the pool of party-switchers, along with a fall-off of more than 3,000 independent voters who likely became Republicans, was nowhere near large enough to save Cheney from defeat in a Republican Party that had turned against her.\n\n“I think she stood up for what she believes in,” said John Grant, a Republican who cast his ballot for Cheney, even though he suspected she would fall short. “It took a lot of courage to stand against the Republican Party and Donald Trump.”\n\n‘Uneasy from the beginning’\n\nThe roots of Cheney’s loss were planted long before Tuesday’s primary. And in some cases, the seeds were planted during the factional battles within the Wyoming GOP that date back to the tea party era, when Cheney was still a resident of Virginia.\n\nThe state’s GOP, with no real competition from Democrats, has divided into two factions, with a more moderate establishment wing butting heads with a more conservative faction that has increasingly wrested away control.\n\nThe establishment wing retains some power in Wyoming. Gov. Mark Gordon, a part of that wing, won Tuesday. But the conservative faction has seized control of the state Republican Party and many of its local organizations.\n\n“In Wyoming, we don’t necessarily embrace the idea of a big tent,” Wyoming GOP Chairman Frank Eathorne said on Fox earlier this year.\n\nWyoming Republicans’ reservations about Cheney were first evident in 2016, when she won her House seat after winning just 39% of the vote in the GOP primary against a fractured field. She was cast as too close to the establishment by some rivals, and as a carpetbagger by others – including Tim Stubson, a former state lawmaker who now supports Cheney.\n\nBut, she was by far the best-known candidate in the race thanks to the decade her father spent representing Wyoming in Congress prior to becoming secretary of defense and later, vice president.\n\nCheney had coasted to reelection since then, largely because she had not broken with conservatives on major issues. Stubson said she was on course to do so again, until the aftermath of the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol, when Cheney became a leading critic of Trump’s actions and defender of the integrity of the 2020 election.\n\nThe makings for a divorce from Cheney were immediately evident. Though Wyoming’s GOP has been fractured by warring factions, one thing that has broadly united those factions is support for Trump. He won Wyoming in 2020 by 43.3 percentage points over Biden – Trump’s largest margin of victory anywhere in the nation.\n\n“Yes, there may have been an undercurrent there of anti-Liz sentiment, but there is no way she would have had any trouble getting elected,” Stubson said.\n\n“Her relationship with that portion of the party has been uneasy from the beginning, and they probably never totally embraced her because she has been the definition of an establishment Republican. But she was right on the policies,” he said. “In my mind, it’s a sort of binary issue: If she votes for impeachment, it doesn’t matter what she does afterward.”\n\nVoters say Cheney was too focused on Trump\n\nWhile Trump’s shadow loomed large over the race, conversations with voters across Wyoming over the last week often came across with a sense of disappointment in Cheney, more than a burning sentiment of anger. Several people said they felt Cheney devoted far more time on national issues – to the detriment of her focusing on energy and natural resource priorities of critical importance to the state.\n\n“I want Wyoming to be protected and I don’t feel Liz is doing that job,” said Jenille Thomas, who lives in the coal-mining town of Rock Springs in southwestern Wyoming.\n\nFor many Republican voters in Wyoming, though, it was Cheney’s vote to impeach Trump that spurred them to action.\n\nEsther Egan, a 68-year-old who cleans houses and lives in Jackson, said she voted for Hageman because Cheney “bailed on us when we need her the most.”\n\n“They can say whatever they want about Trump, but he did a damn good job. And then she turns tail,” Egan said. “She’s with Nancy Pelosi.”\n\nCatherine Norsworthy, a 68-year-old homemaker in Jackson, said she switched from being an unaffiliated voter to a Republican to vote for Hageman, citing Trump’s endorsement of her.\n\n“I’m not in favor of the January 6 hearings at all,” she said. “I didn’t like her voting against Trump. I’m very pro-Trump. I listen to him.”\n\nU.S. Representatives Liz Cheney (R-WY), Adam Kinzinger (R-IL) and Elaine Luria (D-VA) listen during a public hearing of the U.S. House Select Committee to investigate the January 6 Attack on the U.S. Capitol, on Capitol Hill, in Washington, U.S., July 21, 2022. Jonathan Ernst/Reuters\n\nGoing down swinging\n\nCheney was by far the most prominent of the 10 House Republicans to vote in January 2021 for Trump’s impeachment. She revealed her decision to do so the day before the House vote, saying in a statement that Trump “summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack. Everything that followed was his doing.”\n\nThe retribution she faced within the GOP built over the following months. In May 2021, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy publicly endorsed removing Cheney from her position as the No. 3 spot in the party’s leadership team.\n\nThat same month, the House GOP removed Cheney from her leadership post on a voice vote.\n\nShe followed the ouster by telling reporters, in a preview of how she would approach the following year and her reelection campaign: “I will do everything I can to ensure that the former President never again gets anywhere near the Oval Office.”\n\nIn July 2021, Cheney accepted a position as one of two Republicans, along with retiring Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, on the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\nAs the committee conducted its probe, Trump set his sights on revenge, endorsing challengers to most of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach him.\n\nTrump’s biggest target was Cheney. He endorsed Hageman, a former Republican National Committee member and lawyer who had once been a Cheney ally, on the day she entered the race in September 2021.\n\nFor the most part, Trump’s efforts have succeeded. Four of the 10 have retired. Three more, in addition to Cheney, lost their primaries. Only two survived their primaries, and California Rep. David Valadao and Washington Rep. Dan Newhouse did so in part because their states hold all-party open primaries.\n\nAs those retirements piled up and those primaries unfolded, Cheney was busy playing a leading role on that committee, in its interviews of former Trump administration officials and in its public hearings in which the panel has revealed some of its findings.\n\nShe has also sought out opportunities to confront the GOP’s direction. She delivered a searing rebuke of Trump and her party’s leadership in a late June speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.\n\n“We are confronting a domestic threat that we have never faced before – and that is a former President who is attempting to unravel the foundations of our constitutional Republic,” Cheney said then. “And he is aided by Republican leaders and elected officials who have made themselves willing hostages to this dangerous and irrational man.”\n\nWeeks after that speech, Cheney was elusive when asked about the possibility of running for president in 2024. She told CNN’s Jake Tapper in an interview that she will “make a decision on 2024 down the road.”\n\nIn an interview with CNN’s Kasie Hunt earlier this month, Cheney made clear she would not temper her criticism of Trump at all – even if it costs her the House seat that her father once held and that she has held since 2017.\n\n“We’re in a situation where former President Trump has betrayed the patriotism of millions and millions of people across our country, and many people here in Wyoming, and he’s lied to them,” she said. “And what I know to do is to tell the truth, and to make sure that people understand the truth about what happened and why it matters so much.”\n\nEven as polls showed Cheney was on her way to a resounding defeat, she stuck to a message focused squarely on Trump.\n\nHer campaign bought ad time on Fox for a spot featuring Dick Cheney, in which he called Trump a “coward” who lies to his supporters and “tried to steal the last election” using violence.\n\nRepublican candidate U.S. Representative Liz Cheney speaks during her primary election night party in Jackson, Wyoming, U.S. August 16, 2022. David Stubbs/Reuters\n\nWhat’s next\n\nIt didn’t take long for the outcome of Tuesday’s primary to become clear. Cheney had been badly defeated, and conceded the race to Hageman quickly.\n\nShe told supporters that she’d won the primary with 73% support two years ago, and “could easily have done the same again.” But doing so, she said, would have required embracing Trump’s lies about election fraud.\n\n“That was a path I could not and would not take,” Cheney said.\n\n“No House seat, no office in this land, is more important than the principles that we are all sworn to protect. And I well understood the potential political consequences of abiding by my duty,” she said.\n\nAfter a primary that Cheney and her allies knew she was set to lose, the question is, what’s next for the Wyoming congresswoman who had in a short time rocketed up the House Republican ranks?\n\nShe did not answer that question Tuesday night, at her election night event on a ranch in Jackson Hole. But overnight, her campaign filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission creating a leadership PAC to be called “The Great Task” – a nod to Abraham Lincoln, who spoke at Gettysburg of the “great task” facing the country. And on Wednesday morning, she told NBC’s “Today” show that she is “thinking about” running for president and will make a decision in “the coming months.”\n\nIn her election night speech, Cheney previewed a continued fight against Trump: “I have said since January 6 that I will do whatever it takes to ensure that Donald Trump is never again near the Oval Office, and I mean it. This is a fight for all of us, together.”\n\n“I ask you tonight to join me: As we leave here, let us resolve that we will stand together, Republicans, Democrats and independents, against those who would destroy our republic,” she added.\n\nAs she left the stage, Tom Petty’s “I Won’t Back Down” blared over the event’s speakers as the sun set over the Grand Teton mountain peak.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated.", "authors": ["Eric Bradner Jeff Zeleny", "Eric Bradner", "Jeff Zeleny"], "publish_date": "2022/08/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/30/business/railroad-strike/index.html", "title": "America may dodge a crippling rail strike. Here's how we got here ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nA crippling freight railroad strike that threatened to upend the US economy now looks unlikely, as Congress votes on bills that would impose a contract on freight railroads and the unions that represent their workers.\n\nThe House approved two pieces of legislation Wednesday, one to impose the tentative agreements that members of four of the unions have already rejected, keeping 115,000 rail workers on the job and averting a strike. The other will require railroads to give hourly employees up to seven days of paid sick time a year, a key point of contention in contract negotiations.\n\nBut it’s not over yet: Both will go to the Senate for votes as soon as Thursday. The one to keep workers on the job is likely to pass, but it is unclear if the one to require sick pay will get the Republican votes it needs to advance. But whether or not there is a strike that starts at the 12:01 am ET December 9 deadline will depend on whether all 100 senators agree to speed up the approval process.\n\nMore than just sick days\n\nThe fact that this is still an issue more than two months after an 11th-hour tentative deal was reached goes beyond the issue of paid sick days. It’s a sign of the deep antipathy between unionized workers and railroad management.\n\n“Some of this vote I think wasn’t necessarily a referendum vote against the contract as much as it was against their employers,” said Jeremy Ferguson, president of the transportation division of the Sheet Metal, Air, Rail Transportation union, or SMART-TD, the larget rail union which represents 28,000 conductors, brakemen and other workers.\n\nEven the eight unions that voted to ratify the deals did so by fairly narrow margins, demonstrating the level of anger at management, despite railroads agreeing to the largest pay raises in any rail labor contract in more than 50 years.\n\n“Members aren’t necessarily voting on the money issues. It’s quality of life, and how they’re treated,” Ferguson told CNN the day after his members narrowly rejected the contract last week. “When big corporations cut too deep and they expect everybody else to pick up the pace, it becomes intolerable. You don’t have family time, you don’t have time to get adequate rest.”\n\nSome rail workers are also angry at President Joe Biden and Democratic leaders in Congress who may be preparing to force them to accept the deals they don’t want.\n\n“Here we have someone who touted themselves as the most labor friendly president for many decades, and he basically just betrayed us,” said Gabe Christenson, a freight railroad brakeman who lives in Nevada. “There really is no difference between Democrats and Republicans anymore. They’re just feeding corporate greed.”\n\nChristenson is a leader of a group known as Railroad Workers United, a caucus of union activists that had campaigned against ratification of the tentative labor deals.\n\nThe votes also signal a split between union leadership and a considerable portion of their membership. All 12 rail unions agreed to the tentative deals that generated so much opposition. Those union leaders took what they thought were the best deals available, and worried that Congress could force even worse deals on their members if they didn’t agree to the deal.\n\n“I think we got everything we could,” Dennis Pierce, president of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers told CNN when the deal was reached in September. His membership only narrowly ratified the contract.\n\nLess staff, record profits\n\nWork conditions at the railroads have gotten worse as staffing has declined and profits have risen. There are about 30,000 fewer union members at the railroads than there were in 2015, according to statistics from group that negotiates on behalf of railroad management.\n\nThe lower staffing levels, and high freight rates means that all four major railroads - Union Pacific (UNP), CSX (CSX), Norfolk Southern (NSC) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA)’s Burlington Northern Santa Fe, reported some form of record profits in 2021. Wall Street analysts expect even better profits in 2022, at least for the three they cover.\n\nIf the railroad union members worked under the same labor laws as the roughly seven million union members at most other businesses, they could go on strike. America’s railroads and airlines work under a separate labor law, the Railway Labor Act, which puts restrictions on when unions can go on strike. So when the unions were initially prepared to go on strike in July, Biden ordered them to stay on the job during a 60-day cooling off period during which a panel he appointed heard proposals from both sides to try to come up with a compromise deal.\n\nThe proposal of that panel granted workers an immediate 14% raise, including back pay dating back to 2020, and raises totaling 24% over the four-year life of the contract that goes through 2024. It also has $1,000 annual bonuses. It was more than what the railroads were offering, but less than what the unions were asking for.\n\nBut the unions also wanted changes in schduling rules, such as those that force train crews to be on call on their days off, and compensation for out-of-pocket costs when workers are traveling for work. And of course, there is also the question of sickdays. The railroads insist that the workers can use off days when they need to call off sick, but the unions say that’s not realistic under current staffing levels and scheduling rules.\n\nThe railroads have refused to give on the issue of sick days, insisting they would only agree to new contracts that were within the “framework” of the presidential panel’s recommendations, meaning the unions would need to give up some other benefits in order to get the paid sick pay.\n\n“This became a glaring issue during the pandemic when we had members who were forced by their employers, the railroads to stay home and quarantine without pay,” said Michael Baldwin, president of the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen, one of the four union whose members rejected the contract. “But really it comes down to simple things like the flu for a day or two, or a sick child, and the ability to take.a day or two paid.”\n\nCounting on Congress to act\n\nThe railroads could take that hard line on sick days because it was confident that when push came to shove, Congress and even the labor-friendly Biden administration would blink and order the union membership to accept deals they didn’t like.\n\n“I don’t think it’s anyone’s goal to get Congress involved, but Congress has shown a willingness historically to intervene if necessary,” Ian Jefferies, the CEO of the Association of American Railroads, the industry’s trade group, told CNN two weeks ago. “The goal of the Railway Labor Act was to reduce the likelihood of a work stoppage. And it’s been remarkably effective in doing that.”\n\nAssuming the legislation to impose the unpopular contract passes, Baldwin said the unions will comply. But he said the issue of sick days will not be going away.\n\n“We will work under the agreement that is in force. We’ll continue to fight this battle as return to the bargaining in two years,” he said.\n\nWhat happens now\n\nThe big question is whether Congress can get a bill to Biden’s desk in time to avoid a strike – or some of the disruptions that can be caused by the threat of a strike.\n\nThe railroads could stop accepting some hazardous freights as soon as this weekend if there is no final Congressional action by the end of this week, due to concerns about that cargo being left unsecured if the trains stop on December 9.\n\n“For us, a strike effectively starts this weekend,” said Corey Rosenbusch, CEO of The Fertilizer Institute. “Rail carriers have already notified that ammonia shipments will need to be pulled off five days before [December 9], which means December 4. The fertilizer companies are already preparing for that reality.”\n\nAmtrak cut service on most of its long distance trains in the days leading up to the earlier September 16 strike deadline. The company owns roughly 700 miles of track, mostly between Boston and Washington, DC, but about 97% of its 22,000 mile nationwide system runs on freight lines.\n\nSo when Congress acts will be important. And it’s not certain whether it will be by this weekend.\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders, a close ally of the labor movement, tweeted “At a time of record profits in the rail industry, it’s unacceptable that rail workers have ZERO guaranteed paid sick days. It’s my intention to block consideration of the rail legislation until a roll call vote occurs on guaranteeing 7 paid sick days to rail workers in America.”\n\nHe has yet to say if he will allow the vote on imposing the contract if the sick days aren’t included.\n\nEven some Republicans have suggested they might not agree to quick action. Senator Marco Rubio said this week he would oppose an agreement rejected by workers.\n\nHowever there appears to be enough support in Congress to act at some point soon, so if there is a strike, it will likely be a short one.\n\nAnd even if there is a minor disruption to service, it won’t necessarily hurt the economy: The last strike deadline in September got within hours of a walkout without Congress acting. And while there were some disruptions, there was nothing major or long lasting.\n\n– CNN Business’ Matt McFarland contributed to this report", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/11/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/14/economy/heat-inflation-economy-drought/index.html", "title": "Extreme weather could push food inflation even higher | CNN ...", "text": "Minneapolis CNN Business —\n\nWeather has long been a fickle farmhand, devastating fields one year while delivering bountiful harvests the next.\n\nBut as extreme weather events increase in frequency or become even more intense, the unpredictability is becoming more of an economic liability.\n\nAs the United States continues to battle high inflation, the effects of prolonged droughts and extreme weather events could help keep the heat on prices for a long time to come.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index, which measures price changes for a basket of goods and services, showed inflation hit 8.3% in August from the year before. But food prices rose at an even faster pace, increasing by 11.4% during that period, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nScorching heat and drought continue to bear down on the American West, forcing farmers in vital agriculture-producing states to fallow land, pull up orchards, reduce livestock herds, and slash expected yields.\n\n“The prolonged droughts that we’re seeing [present] some increased risk that inflation remains higher for a longer time,” said Charlie Dougherty, a Wells Fargo economist who recently co-authored a status report on the economic state of American agriculture.\n\nThe high heat and drought have only compounded the issues facing American farmers, including supply chain ripple effects from Russia’s war against Ukraine that have caused inputs such as fertilizer to surge in price; nationwide worker shortages; and inflation and high energy prices, the economists noted.\n\n“When you’ve put all that together, farmers and ranchers have experienced extraordinary cost pressures,” Dougherty said. “And those higher costs are being passed on to consumers.” The rise in food prices is one of the key factors fueling inflation, according to recent CPI data.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of fruits, tree nuts and vegetables are sourced from drought-stricken states such as California and Texas, the American Farm Bureau Federation noted in a recent market update.\n\nThe drought and its effects “will likely result in American consumers paying more for these goods and either partially relying on foreign supplies or shrinking the diversity of items they buy at the store,” according to the Farm Bureau. “Drought conditions in the US also risk global access to some items like almonds, since California produces 80% of the world’s supply.”\n\nWhile the majority of those specialty crops are holding up, one of the hardest-hit crops in California has been rice, according to Aaron Smith, UC Davis’ DeLoach professor of agricultural economics.\n\nRice acres have dropped by 55% this year, Smith said, noting US Department of Agriculture data showing an increase in prevented-planting acres, or land intended for a crop but prevented by natural disaster or inadequate water.\n\nCalifornia, which is second to Arkansas in rice production among US states, generates about $900 million of rice annually, he said. California is a key producer and exporter of medium-grain rice, found in sushi and risotto dishes. While the acreage drop represents a big hit to US rice production, the effects could be mitigated by other sources, he said.\n\n“If you look in a global perspective, which is what drives the price of rice, California is not a very big producer relative to the whole world,” Smith said. “The local impact is very big; the global impact and the consumer impact for now — not so big.”\n\nA worker walks along a dried-up field of sunflowers while extreme weather conditions, including record-breaking heat waves, are the latest sign of climate change in the western United States, where wildfires and severe drought have emerged as a growing threat, near Sacramento, California, U.S., August 18, 2022. Carlos Barria/Reuters\n\nThe globalized economy and trade serve as a buffer to an extent, said Josué Medellín-Azuara, an associate professor of environmental engineering at UC Merced who studies climate change adaption and the economics of agricultural, environmental and urban water uses.\n\n“I don’t think we’re in a situation of food insecurity at this point, but it’s really just a reminder that warmer temperatures can bring some more challenges to produce many of the agricultural commodities we traditionally see,” he said. “There’s a recognition that the groundwater reserves won’t always be there to help us weather future droughts, if we don’t use those more sustainably.”\n\nWeather whiplash\n\nIn far western Minnesota, a few miles from the South Dakota border, Anne Schwagerl and her family run a 400-acre organic farm.\n\nLast year, Schwagerl and other farmers across the North Star State endured the worst drought seen in decades. Some of the yields were halved on her family’s farm, where they grow crops such as corn, soy beans, oats and rye.\n\nThis year brought the rain. By mid-June, about 75% of the state saw above-average levels of precipitation, according to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.\n\n“We had a really challenging fall harvest and then a wet winter, which was great,” Schwagerl said. “We needed that rain, but then it kept coming, and we had a very wet late spring. So it was this whiplash feeling of knowing that this could change [at] the drop of a hat.”\n\nA soaked field of newly planted corn at Anne Schwagerl's Prairie Point Farm in western Minnesota after a heavy storm in the spring of 2022 dropped 3.5 inches of rain. The heavy rain came months after Schwagerl and other Minnesota farmers endured the worst drought in decades and exemplifies the \"whiplash\" nature of extreme weather, she said. Anne Schwagerl\n\nAnd in the past couple of years, the intensity of those weather events has only increased and relatively infrequent weather phenomena like derechos — long-lasting and high-powered wind storms that can crush grain bins like they were soda cans — have joined the vernacular, she said.\n\n“2019 was a historically wet year. All throughout the year, we couldn’t miss a rain for love or money,” she said. “2020 was Covid, our first Covid year, where everything was locked down. And then 2021, we went through a once-in-a-generation drought.”\n\n“It feels like you can’t use those words like ‘once-in-a-generation’ anymore because they keep happening. Does that still have meaning?” she added.\n\nSchwagerl is feeling uneasy about what 2023 might bring in terms of input costs, commodity prices and weather.\n\n“We’re riding along on this endless roller coaster at the same time as everyone else,” she said.\n\nCompounding factors\n\nAriel Ortiz-Bobea, an applied economist at Cornell University working on agricultural and resources economics, is optimistic about the private and public sector investing in research and development and other mechanisms to improve productivity and conserve resources. He expressed concern about lesser-developed countries and the effect of global events such as the war in Ukraine.\n\n“If things get more politically hairy, those [drought] events become more painful,” he said.\n\nExtreme weather also can negatively affect companies’ bottom lines, according to research from Paul Griffin, professor of management at UC Davis.\n\nGriffin’s research of heat effect found that every degree over 77 degrees Fahrenheit (25 degrees Celsius) translates into an annualized loss of sales of 0.63% and a profit margin decrease of 0.16%. Stock prices dropped by an average of 22 basis points in response to a heat spell, Griffin found.\n\nCorn crops that died due to extreme heat and drought during a heatwave in Austin, Texas, on Monday, July 11, 2022. Jordan Vonderhaar/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\n“The implication there is that if sales are decreasing, then firms will have an incentive to raise prices,” he said.\n\nThe exact extent to which extreme heat, drought and, more broadly, climate change will play a role in prices and inflation is extremely difficult to estimate, Smith said.\n\nThere are far more costs baked in to the price of a product than what consumers pay at the grocery store — including wages, materials, production, processing, transportation, distribution, retailing, and marketing, he said. Farmers and ranches receive an estimated 8 cents from every dollar spent on food at home and away from home, according to the Farm Bureau.\n\n“All those costs are much bigger pieces of the food pie than the actual value of the food that’s produced by the farmer,” he said. “So when we’re looking at food prices and worrying about things that might increase food prices, we probably should be paying more attention to those costs of processing and transportation and marketing rather than what’s happening on the farm.”\n\nRussia’s war in Ukraine helped fuel a sharp rise in oil prices, which filtered down through key inputs such as fuel and fertilizer; and it complicated already tangled supply chains, further raising costs for all the businesses that help bring farm products to the table.\n\nStill, the very prospect of more extreme weather could further sap away groundwater and limit the cultivation potential in the future, Smith said.\n\n“That’s probably going to mean, as we look forward, fewer acres of the different fruits and vegetables that are grown in California and that people around the country eat,” he said. “So that, inevitably, in the long run will raise prices — maybe not this year, but they will go up.”", "authors": ["Alicia Wallace"], "publish_date": "2022/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/26/economy/railroad-strike-holidays-economic-impact/index.html", "title": "A rail strike won't screw up your holidays. Here's how it'll affect you in ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nSo once again the nation and its economy is facing the risk of a massive freight railroad strike, this one as soon as Dec. 9. But about the only thing you don’t need to worry about it is whether it will affect your holiday shopping plans. (It won’t.)\n\nA prolonged rail strike could create all types of shortages, from gasoline to food to automobiles, and cause a spike in the prices of all types of consumer goods. It can screw up the commutes of tens of thousands of workers who take the train to work, slow the delivery of parts and force factories to shut down. But one area that most likely won’t see immediate or severe disruptions will be Christmas.\n\n“The stuff that needs to move for the holidays has already moved by rail,” said Balaji Guntur, vice president in global consultancy Kearney’s transportation practice and a logistics veteran. The goods that retailers are counting on for the holidays are already in stores or nearby warehouses.\n\n“Christmas is not canceled,” Brian Dodge, president of the Retail Industry Leaders Association, told CNN in a phone interview earlier this week. His group includes Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), Home Depot (HD) and dozens of other major brands.\n\nA previous strike threat in September risked causing greater problems with goods slated for holiday sales, but that strike threat was averted by an 11th-hour tentative labor deal. But that strike threat is back, worrying shippers, after rank-and-file members of four rail unions rejected the earlier tentative deals. Negotiators for the two sides are back at the table.\n\nWhile the railroads say they are hopeful of reaching new deals, they have so far rejected the demands that union negotiators say their members want.\n\nA strike would “would utterly upend the supply chain,” Dodge said, adding that concern among retail CEOs is “high” because of the increasing risk of a national rail strike. About 30% of the nation’s freight, when measured by weight and distance traveled, moves by rail, and there just isn’t enough capacity on trucks or other modes to move those goods if the railroads grind to a halt.\n\nAnd a freight rail strike could cost the US economy $1 billion in its first week alone, according to a new analysis from the Anderson Economic Group. “Calculations show a first-day impact of approximately $60 million, including $30.9 million for lost freight, $3.8 million for long-term passenger rail disruption and $25 million in lost railroad industry wages,” the analysis revealed.\n\nSecond and third day strike losses would increase to $91 billion per day because of lost agricultural goods and food spoilage. The costs would escalate from there.\n\nMany people expect Congress to intervene, either to order rail workers to stay on the job or quickly return to work if there is a strike, because of such severe economic ramifications.\n\nThe unions oppose Congressional intervention, saying the risk of a strike is the only way to get the railroads, many of which reported record or near record profits last year and will do so again this year, to make meet workers’ demands for better working conditions, including sick pay policies common for most workers in other industries.\n\nBut if a strike starts, and stretches on, here’s how it could affect other sectors, and many Americans:\n\nGasoline\n\nRefineries get most of their crude oil via pipelines and ship most of the products they produce, such as gas, diesel and jet fuel, via pipelines. Still, railroad tank cars are a key part of that process.\n\nJust about all ethanol that goes into gasoline moves by rail; gasoline wouldn’t be compliant with some environmental regulations without it. But even if those regulations could be waived, the cost of a gallon of gas without ethanol would jump by about 16 cents due to the loss of tax breaks, according to Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for OPIS.\n\nPipelines carry most of the nation’s crude oil to refineries, but each day about 300,000 barrels move by rail, a volume that would supply about two mid-size refineries, according to data from the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, the refineries’ trade group. Numerous chemicals used in the refining process also are transported via rail, as do some lower-grade products and waste materials.\n\n“If rail cars aren’t coming in regularly to pick up facility products, including the sulfur that refiners remove from crude oil, production will have to curtail,” the refineries’ trade group said earlier this fall.\n\nFood\n\nFood prices might not be as negatively affected by an early December strike date,as they would have been in September amid the fall harvest. But grain and other food products still need to move by rail.\n\nThat, coupled with low water levels on the Mississippi that have slowed barge traffic amid a Midwest drought, has the nation’s agricultural industry very worried about possible strike.\n\n“Any additional disruption of rail service would immediately impact the nation’s food and agriculture and broader supply chains,” said Mike Seyfert, CEO of the National Grain and Feed Association. “The risk in both domestic and international markets is real.”\n\nCars\n\nDecember is a major month for auto sales. But car and truck production is currently hampered by a shortage of numerous essential parts, most notably computer chips that in turn has created a dearth of vehicles available for sale on dealer lots. That’s why car prices are now at record highs.\n\nBut that’s nothing compared to what would happen with a prolonged rail strike. About 75% of completed cars built in US factories or imported here move by rail. So do many of the parts used to build vehicles, moving between suppliers and car assembly plants, and production will quickly halt if those rail links are severed. It would take time to make up for lost output, creating upward pressure on car prices.\n\nManufacturing\n\nMost factories aim to have parts and raw materials delivered right before they’re used in assembly lines — a process known as “just-in-time” delivery. Many factories depend on rail to receive those parts and supplies and then ship out them out for delivery.\n\n“We already face economic turmoil with rising costs, product shortages and high inflation. Any nationwide rail strike or shutdown will cause even more economic pain,” said a statement from the National Association of Manufacturers earlier this month, adding that it’s crucial that a strike be avoided.\n\nA lengthy rail strike could result in temporary plant closures, which is what happened across the global auto industry in recent years due to the shortage of parts and computer chips.\n\nCommuting\n\nOnly the nation’s freight rail lines face a pending strike, but commuters would likely be affected, too. Many commuter trains travel on tracks maintained and operated by the freight railroads and passenger railroads expect they’ll have to shut down their operations once the freight strike starts.\n\nAmtrak cut service on most of its long distance trains in the days leading up to the earlier Sept. 16 strike deadline deadline. The company owns roughly 700 miles of track, mostly between Boston and Washington, DC, but about 97% of its 22,000 mile nationwide system runs on freight lines.\n\nMany commuter railroads also move over freight rail lines and could not operate if a strike was called. That could mean more commuters driving to work, and more traffic and congestion even for those who don’t normally take a train.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore Vanessa Yurkevich Matt Egan", "Chris Isidore", "Vanessa Yurkevich", "Matt Egan"], "publish_date": "2022/11/26"}]}

The alerts stretch across 37 states, dipping as far south as the Texas/Mexico border.\n\nThe number of people under winter alerts and wind chill alerts has grown to over 100 million people, or roughly a third of the US population, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThe cold will stick around for Christmas weekend, making this the coldest Christmas in roughly 40 years for portions of the Plains and Midwest.\n\nLIVE UPDATES ON THE WINTER STORM FOR THURSDAY\n\nStorm timeline:\n\nWednesday: The storm will strengthen over the Northern Plains through the day as heavy snow falls across much of the Rockies, the Northern Plains and into the Midwest. Slick roads will lead to travel headaches and airport delays through places like Minneapolis, Omaha and Rapid City.\n\nThis system will bring 5 to 9 inches of light fluffy snow across the region, with “the highest amounts just north and west of the Twin Cities,” said the weather service office in Twin Cities. While snow will steadily fall across the region, the high winds won’t kick in until Thursday.\n\nDenver will go from a high of 47 on Wednesday to 10 degrees below zero by daybreak Thursday. That would be the city’s coldest day in 32 years, according to the weather service. Cheyenne, Wyoming, recently dropped 32 degrees in just eight minutes.\n\nTemperatures in the Denver metro area will drop drastically once the front passes in the next couple of hours.\n\nBy sunrise, the temperature is expected to be around 10 degrees below zero and gusty north winds will create a wind chill of around minus 25. The high-temperature tomorrow will likely not make it above zero degrees.\n\nA wind chill warning is in effect as well as a winter weather advisory. Several inches of snow will also make for difficult travel late this afternoon through early Thursday.\n\nThursday: Thursday will be the most difficult day for travel. The storm will be hitting the Midwest extremely hard with heavy snow and strong winds. Western Minnesota will face not only blizzard conditions, but potentially deadly wind chills Thursday and Friday.\n\n“Whiteout conditions are expected during that time with travel becoming very difficult or impossible,” said the weather service. “This event could be life-threatening if you are stranded with wind chills in the 30 below to 45 below zero range.”\n\nChicago could also face blizzard conditions with winds gusting as high as 50 mph, with 2 to 4 inches of snow forecast.\n\n“Overall, concern continues to increase in the quick development of dangerous conditions Thursday afternoon with potentially significant impacts to the evening peak travel window,” warned the weather service office in Chicago.\n\nSnowfall early Wednesday in Glasgow, Montana. Angel Enriquez\n\nAdditionally, strong winds may knock out power lines in the Midwest, especially in areas where heavy snow fell last week and is already weighing down tree branches. This will leave millions finding a way to stay warm as temperatures plummet to well below freezing.\n\nSnow could fall as far south as Jackson, Mississippi, Memphis and Nashville in Tennessee and even Birmingham, Alabama, on Thursday. Little to no accumulation is expected for most of the southern cities, however, Nashville could pick up about an inch of snow.\n\nIn anticipation of what will be a week of travel nightmares, United, American, Delta, Southwest and Jet Blue have issued travel waivers for dozens of airports across the country from the South to the Northeast, because in addition to snow covering roadways, low visibility could make air travel dangerous.\n\nAt least 1,000 flights had been canceled across the US, according to the flight tracking site Flightaware on Wednesday evening.\n\nChicago’s O’Hare International Airport leads the way, followed by Denver International and Chicago’s Midway International.\n\nCancellations at those airports could have a wider impact because they are busy hubs where travelers often change planes in order to reach other destinations. Thursday is expected to be the busiest pre-Christmas day for travel.\n\nFriday: The storm is expected to become a “bomb cyclone” Thursday evening into Friday. A bomb cyclone is when a storm rapidly intensifies – and drops 24 millibars (a term used to measure atmospheric pressure) in 24 hours.\n\nThe storm is expected to reach the pressure equivalent of a Category 3 hurricane as it reaches the Great Lakes, with the weather service describing the strength of the low a “once-in-a-generation” event.\n\n“This is a case in which snow totals may not tell the whole story. Even small snow amounts, when combined with very strong wind gusts and plummeting temperatures, can cause poor visibility and slick spots on roads. The sudden arrival of these conditions can increase the danger,” the weather service explained.\n\nThe storm will be over the Great Lakes on Friday and continuing to produce heavy snow across much of the Midwest. Portions of Michigan could pick up more than a foot of snow by Friday, making travel impossible at times.\n\nBlizzard warnings are in effect for parts of the Dakotas, Montana, Minnesota, Iowa, Indiana and Michigan – where travel conditions will become difficult to impossible as the storm peaks Thursday into Friday. Major cities like Chicago, Kansas City, St Louis, Twin Cities and Detroit are under winter storm warnings for heavy snow and near blizzard conditions.\n\nHeavy rain will also blanket much of the I-95 corridor, adding to the travel troubles and lengthy airport delays.\n\nEven in places where the snow has ended, strong winds will continue to blow 30 to 40 mph across much of the Midwest and into the Northeast.\n\nFriday night into Saturday morning, New England will get a quick shot of snow and windy conditions.\n\nTravelers check in at Minneapolis' St. Paul Airport, Wednesday, December 21, 2022. Abbie Parr/AP\n\nLife-threatening cold\n\nPlaces that will escape the snow, won’t escape the cold. Areas from eastern Montana through the Dakotas will experience the coldest air beginning Thursday morning. Current wind chills across Montana and the Dakotas are as cold as 50 to 60 degrees below zero and will fall even further after dark Wednesday.\n\nRapid City will feel like 45 degrees below zero on Thursday morning. By Friday morning, Chicago’s wind chill will bottom out at 30 degrees below zero.\n\n“The dangerously cold wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 5 minutes,” warned the weather service office in Bismarck.\n\nEven the South will be dangerously cold. Nashville and Atlanta’s wind chill will drop to minus 11 on Saturday morning and Birmingham will feel like minus 5.\n\nGeorgia Gov.

The storms toppled trees, sent power lines crashing into roads and some homes and ripped roofs from buildings, according to preliminary reports from the National Weather Service.\n\n“We saw the clouds coming and could hear a rumbling in the distance,” Don Tomovich, whose home was damaged, told 6ABC-TV in Philadelphia. “We went into the house and we were on the first floor, and before we could blink an eye the winds just came right through the back of our house.”\n\nStorms bring damaging winds, hail and flash flooding\n\nOrrison said there were numerous reports of golf-ball-sized hail across the mid-Atlantic and flash flooding in the Baltimore metropolitan area as the storms swept through. The Knoxville Utilities Board said on X, formerly Twitter, that the damage across its service area in Tennessee was “widespread and extensive” and probably will take several days to repair.\n\nIn Westminster, Maryland, dozens of people, including 14 children, were rescued after 34 cars were trapped on Route 140 by downed power lines, according to Maryland State Police. The motorists were trapped for more than five hours, according to local media reports. Police said Tuesday that they were still working to return car keys to the owners of stranded vehicles.\n\nMore than 29.5 million people were under tornado watches Monday afternoon, according to the weather service, and more than 1.1 million customers lost power as the storms struck. Orrison said he was not aware of any confirmed reports of tornadoes, but that could change as local weather services crews conduct damage surveys.\n\nBob Van Dillen, a Fox Weather meteorologist, told USA TODAY that he has seen more than 530 reports of wind damage in Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, the Carolinas and \"all the way up the eastern seaboard\" to Northern Virginia. He said tornado damage may be seen in upstate New York, Northern Virginia, eastern Kentucky, central West Virginia and possibly North Carolina.\n\n\"This storm was unusual because it was so powerful,\" Van Dillen said. \"It's something you would see really in springtime.\"\n\nSevere weather could continue this week\n\nOrrison said the same system brought heavy rainfall to parts of New England on Tuesday.\n\n\"There will be concerns for flash flooding there today where locally a few inches of rain may occur,\" Orrison said.\n\nHe said large hail and strong gusty winds were possible across the Gulf Coast states and parts of the Southeast, including areas of Mississippi, Alabama and southern Georgia Tuesday evening. He said severe weather also could hit portions of the central High Plains region, including areas of eastern Colorado, Nebraska and parts of Kansas Tuesday afternoon and overnight.\n\nThe turbulent weather could plague much of the East for the rest of the week, forecasters said.\n\n\"The pattern this week will feature frequent showers and thunderstorms, typically every other day or so, across much of the East,\" AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Alex Sosnowski said. \"Even though it may not rain as much or as often as it did in July, conditions may again pose daily challenges for outdoor plans and travel.\"\n\nHeat still plagues the South\n\nThough forecasters said storms probably would keep intense heat at bay in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic, \"dangerously hot daytime temperatures\" were expected across the South, according to the National Weather Service. The record highs would persist from the Desert Southwest into Texas and extend eastward along the Gulf Coast into parts of the Southeast and Florida, the weather service said.\n\nHighs could hit the upper 90s to the lower 100s with a heat index − what the temperature feels like when relative humidity is combined with the air temperature − of 105 to 115 degrees in those areas, according to the weather service. The heat, dry ground conditions, low humidity and gusty winds would elevate the wildfire risk in the Four Corners states into Texas, the weather service said.\n\n\"We'll have more severe weather for the South today,\" Van Dillen said. \"And of course, it's still smoking hot across the Gulf Coast.\"\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/07/05/its-hot-sioux-falls-but-rain-way-tuesday-nws-says/7809343001/", "title": "NWS confirms derecho swept through southeastern South Dakota ...", "text": "For the second time since mid-May, residents of southeastern South Dakota, including Sioux Falls, are picking up debris from backyards and fallen trees after another derecho moved its way through the tri-state area.\n\nThousands across the state, stretching from Woonsocket to Canton, were also left without power for hours after the long-lasting wind storm swept through, according to data from Xcel Energy's outage map online.\n\nThe storm moved into the Sioux Falls area between 3 and 3:30p.m., bringing black, blue, grey and even murky green skies and dumping a swath of rain from Huron to Iowa, with anywhere from 3 to 5 inches throughout, according to Community Collaborative Rain, Hail and Snow Network, a grassroots network of backyard weather observers who help gather information for meteorologists, including the National Weather Service.\n\nBy the end of the storm close to 5:30 p.m., nearly 30,000 people were without power, of which more than 26,000 were in the Sioux Falls area.\n\nBy 10 p.m., roughly 7,000 were still without, as law enforcement and first responders helped neighborhoods and drivers navigate downed wires and localized flooding from rush hour onward.\n\nAs of 11:30 a.m. Wednesday, an estimated 3,500 customers in the Sioux Falls area were still without power, according to Xcel Energy.\n\nA derecho is \"a widespread, long-lived wind storm that is associated with a band of rapidly moving showers or thunderstorms,\" according to the service's website.\n\n\"By definition, if the wind damage swath extends more than 240 miles and includes wind gusts of at least 58 mph (93 km/h) or greater along most of its length, then the event may be classified as a derecho,\" the NWS website states.\n\nHow high did winds get?\n\nPeak winds so far were measured at 96 mph in Huron, and 99 mph near Howard, the NWS stated via social media.

They’ve done business dealings with me,” he added.\n\n“I’m not going to make excuses for this, but a lot of people overstate in their resumes, or twist a little bit. … I’m not saying I’m not guilty of that,” he said.\n\nSantos also admitted that he never worked directly for the financial firms Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, as he has previously suggested, but claimed that he did do work for them through his company, telling the New York Post it was a “poor choice of words” to say he worked for them.\n\nHe also told the Post that he didn’t graduate from any college or university, despite claiming he had degrees from Baruch College and New York University.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Reporter who broke the inconsistencies of GOP Rep.-elect Santos' resume says there's more to explore 06:35 - Source: CNN\n\n“I didn’t graduate from any institution of higher learning. I’m embarrassed and sorry for having embellished my resume,” he told the Post, adding that he owns up to that and that “we do stupid things in life.”\n\nHe told WABC, “I want to make sure that if I disappointed anyone by resume embellishment, I am sorry.”\n\nThe New York Times first revealed last week that Santos’ biography appeared to be partly fictional. CNN confirmed details of that reporting, including about his college education and employment history.\n\nCNN’s KFile also reported last week that claims by Santos that his grandparents “survived the Holocaust” as Ukrainian Jewish refugees from Belgium who changed their surname are contradicted by sources including family trees compiled by genealogy websites, records on Jewish refugees and interviews with multiple genealogists. A lawyer for Santos had declined to comment to CNN.\n\n“I never claimed to be Jewish,” Santos told the Post. “I am Catholic. Because I learned my maternal family had a Jewish background I said I was ‘Jew-ish.’”\n\nSantos had said he was “very proud” of his “Jewish heritage” as recently as a late November 2022 appearance with the Jewish News Syndicate.\n\nCNN has reached out to House GOP leadership and the National Republican Congressional Committee in the wake of Santos’ admissions. House GOP leadership was silent amid last week’s revelations. Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy would not answer CNN’s questions Thursday when asked if he was concerned about apparent misrepresentations.\n\nSantos defeated Democrat Robert Zimmerman in a newly drawn district covering parts of Queens and some nearby Long Island suburbs, flipping control to Republicans, who dominated the New York suburbs on their way to winning a House majority.\n\nIt was Santos’ second run – he lost to Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi in 2020 – and most of the criticism he faced during his recent campaign centered on his attendance of former President Donald Trump’s rally in Washington on January 6, 2021, and a video in which he claimed to have written a “nice check” to help alleged rioters with their legal fees.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional context.", "authors": ["Kyle Blaine"], "publish_date": "2022/12/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/12/01/george-santos-expelled-house-ethics/71720258007/", "title": "Who voted to expel George Santos? Congressman receives ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – Embattled Rep. George Santos was expelled from Congress Friday after a scathing House Ethics Committee report found substantial evidence Santos misused campaign funds for his own personal benefit and committed federal crimes.\n\nThe House voted to boot Santos, R-N.Y., from the lower chamber by a bipartisan vote of 311-114. An expulsion vote requires a two-thirds vote to pass − a heavy lift in the divided House.\n\nDespite the early momentum for his expulsion, Santos' removal was still in question the morning of the vote as lawmakers demurred over whether they were certain they had the votes to oust him. All of the top House GOP leadership, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., announced they would vote against his expulsion.\n\nSpeaking outside the Capitol steps, members of New York's GOP delegation, who spearheaded the efforts to expel Santos, took a victory lap but lamented that Santos hadn't stepped down in the first place.\n\n\"It's a sad day,\" Rep. Anthony D'Esposito, R-N.Y., said. \"We hear about Santos every single day. You go to the barber shop, you go to church, you go to the post office, you go get a slice of good New York pizza and people want to talk about George Santos.\"\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n\"Santos should have held himself accountable and he should have resigned when he had the chance,\" he added.\n\nLawmakers who voted against Santos' expulsion sought not to defend the first-term lawmaker's alleged misconduct but expressed concerns over setting new precedent in Congress. Only two House members have been expelled in modern times and both were convicted of crimes before their expulsion.\n\nTrouble from before Day One\n\nThe New York native has been mired in controversy since before he entered Congress, when it was reported Santos had baldly embellished and fabricated parts of his resume and background, including claims that he'd worked at the Goldman Sachs investment bank and that his grandmother was a victim of the Holocaust.\n\n\"I've been a terrible liar,\" he said during a TV interview last February.\n\nDuring his brief tenure in Congress, the Long Island Republican was slapped with a multitude of federal charges, including money laundering, wire fraud, identity theft, credit card fraud and lying to Congress.\n\nSantos faced calls to resign from both sides of the aisle in the face of those controversies, but he remained defiant up until his expulsion. While he has admitted to lying about his background, he has denied all wrongdoing and has pleaded not guilty to the federal charges.\n\nHis opponents have pushed to remove him from Congress twice already, but those efforts ultimately failed while lawmakers awaited the House Ethics Committee to release its report.\n\n\"I've been very clear. He's unfit to serve and I've been clear from the start that he needed to go,\" Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., said Friday. \"You cannot allow a sociopath to serve in public office when you know full well that he defrauded voters and donors and the evidence was overwhelming.\"\n\nHouse report: Santos 'cannot be trusted'\n\nAfter the damning report was made public last month, momentum to expel Santos once and for all swiftly gained traction, leading to Friday's vote on an expulsion resolution introduced by Rep. Michael Guest, R-Miss., chairman of the Ethics Committee.\n\nThe 56-page ethics report found evidence Santos sought to “exploit” his House campaign for his financial benefit including “blatantly” stealing from his own campaign and deceiving campaign donors.\n\n“Representative George Santos cannot be trusted. At nearly every opportunity, he placed his desire for private gain above his duty to uphold the Constitution, federal law, and ethical principles,” the Ethics Committee report read.\n\nDisgrace, or a 'badge of honor'?\n\nIn one instance, Santos allegedly used $50,000 in campaign funds to pay off his own personal debt; make a purchase at Hermes, a luxury apparel store; make smaller purchases on OnlyFans, a subscription service for explicit content; at the personal care retailer Sephora; and for meals and parking.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Santos’ lies were so extravagant, his own campaign staff called him a “fabulist” and encouraged him to “seek treatment,” according to the report.\n\nDespite the clear resounding support among both Democrats and Republicans to expel him in advance of the House’s vote, Santos refused to resign and accepted his fate, saying in a three-hour conversation on X spaces, formerly Twitter spaces, that he would take his removal in stride and “wear it like a badge of honor.”\n\nTrouble for the GOP\n\nSantos has also derided the ethics report as an attempt to “smear me” and “force me out of my seat,” saying it “wasn’t a finding of facts.”\n\nSantos’ expulsion is a rare sight for Congress. Santos is the sixth member ever to be expelled from the House and is the first member in modern times to be expelled without having been convicted of a crime. His absence will shrink the House GOP's already razor-thin majority to 221 seats over Democrats' 213 seats.\n\nTo make matters worse for Republicans, Santos' district leans Democratic, according to the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, offering Democrats a pick-up opportunity to narrow the GOP's majority further. New York law mandates Gov. Kathy Hochul must declare a special election within ten days of a seat's vacancy, and the state must hold the election between 70-80 days after Hochul's proclamation.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2023/01/20/george-santos-congress-members-degrees-education/11034419002/", "title": "Is Santos the only one? We investigated all 93 new members of ...", "text": "USA TODAY checked all freshman members of Congress\n\nThat should be simple but federal privacy laws and university bureaucracies get in the way\n\nNote: USA TODAY is continuing to update this story as additional information becomes available. Correction: An earlier version of this story misidentified the spokesman for North Carolina A&T, he is Todd Simmons.\n\nGeorge Santos is an anomaly among lawmakers when it comes to fabricating his education credentials, based on a USA TODAY review of his fellow freshmen members of Congress.\n\nBut it turns out those credentials are rarely vetted.\n\nThe Long Island congressman claimed to have degrees from Baruch College and New York University, neither of which have a record of Santos earning a degree – a fact only publicized after he was elected in November.\n\nEducational background checks for 91 out of 93 freshman members held up, in most cases for all of their cited degrees. About a dozen universities did not respond and the two discrepancies that emerged both were minor compared to Santos’.\n\nIn reaching out to 139 schools named in official biographies, campaign materials and news articles by the new senators and congress members, reporters heard back from dozens that few media outlets, sometimes none, had tried to verify the then-candidates’ educational credentials during the past year.\n\n“We firmly believe in the importance of checking credentials and resume claims of all individuals who run for public office. You are the first and only reporter to request this info from A&T,” Todd Simmons, spokesman at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University wrote in confirming the degree of Rep. Jonathan Jackson, a Democrat elected this year to represent Illinois’ 1st Congressional District.\n\nOne of the discrepancies was Rep. Mary Sattler Peltola, D-Alaska, whose congressional biography states she attended the University of Northern Colorado from 1991 to 1994. The university confirmed her attendance, but only from 1991 to spring 1993. And it added in an email, “our records reflect that no entity has requested this information except for you, today.”\n\nLate Friday, Sam Erickson, a spokesperson for Peltola, said the representative has never claimed to earn a degree and “ended her studies to focus on addressing problems at home in the state legislature.\"\n\n\"We're unsure and are investigating why some websites claim she attended NCU from '91 - '94,\" Erickson said. \"To our knowledge, she was there until '93 and spent the fall of '94 working on a Republican state house race.\"\n\nRep. Troy Carter, D-Louisiana, stated on his congressional website that he earned a Master of Business Administration from Holy Cross University. A June 2021 press release from the institution – actually named University of Holy Cross – said Carter earned a Master of Science in Management, a degree that typically takes less time to complete than an MBA. The private university in Louisiana confirmed to USA TODAY that its news release was correct.\n\nThough the differences might seem superficial, an MBA carries more prestige, said John Byrne, the editor in chief of Poets and Quants, a publication focused on business schools.\n\nByrne said masters of science in management programs are typically geared toward people with less work experience, are easier to get into and don't usually require the same depth of study as MBA programs.\n\nThose in the business field would “know the difference immediately” between the two degrees, he said, adding, “there’s no doubt that the MBA is a more prestigious degree and it’s a degree that would get you a better job.”\n\nFollowing USA TODAY’s inquiries, Carter’s page was updated to the correct degree and university name. “The discrepancy was a staff error and has since been corrected,” said Sara Severens, a spokeswoman for Carter.\n\nVetting is a tradition of campaigns\n\nRevelations about inaccuracies in Santos’ education and employment background broke open after he was elected, in an investigation by the New York Times. The discrepancies, which he has called “embellishments,” have led to criminal investigations, calls for a House Ethics Committee probe and calls for his resignation.\n\nThey also have caused political officials and the media to take a hard look at their vetting processes.\n\nIn finger-pointing about missed Santos red flags, Democratic party officials pointed back at the media. Jason Kaplan, a campaign consultant for Santos’ Democratic opponent Robert Zimmerman tweeted that, “we’ve been screaming it from the rooftops since September.”\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Committee distributed its research book – traditionally sent to reporters and party officials – well before the election. It raised questions about some of Santos’ record, but not all. His college credentials, for instance, were not questioned.\n\nNew York University sends third party requests to a clearinghouse to process validation requests, potentially a roadblock that could explain how Santos’ record went unnoticed.\n\n“My biggest concern is that this story gets forgotten,” Zimmerman said. “We need to toughen the laws that hold you accountable for lying on your ethics forms and invest in the local media because journalism is the front line defense to this.”\n\nColleges cite privacy restrictions\n\nVetting college credentials is traditionally a simple process for media and political researchers alike. Still, several universities either didn’t respond to USA TODAY, demanded formal written state records requests or declined to provide information citing federal privacy laws – laws that allow people to put a hold on their own files.\n\nAmong the schools that did not verify degrees by the deadline for this story: Yale University and the Morehouse School of Medicine. Yale later confirmed degrees for Rep. Daniel Goldman, D-N.Y.; Rep. Kevin Kiley, R-California; Rep. Seth Magaziner, D-R.I. and Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio.\n\n'Stunning' lies:Nassau County district attorney to investigate GOP Rep.-elect George Santos\n\nThe University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill confirmed a 2009 law degree for Rep. Jeff Jackson, D-N.C., but not for Rep. Rob Menendez, a Democrat who represents New Jersey and is the son of Sen. Rob Menendez. The congressman’s staff later sent a certificate of his degree from the university confirming he had earned a bachelor’s degree in 2008.\n\nMiddle Tennessee State University said the university would only answer questions about Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn. with his permission.\n\nA spokesman for Ogles did not respond to questions about whether the congressman had put a hold on the records or whether he would lift it. The office later shared a photo of Ogle’s bachelor’s degree certificate as proof.\n\nNova Southeastern University, where Rep. Jared Moskowitz, D-Florida, stated he earned his law degree, said it was the institution’s policy to “not provide information on its students without the expressed consent and authorization of the student(s) in question.”\n\nAfter this story's publication, Moskowitz and his office contacted USA TODAY and the university. Nova Southeastern has since confirmed that Moskowitz graduated from its school of law in 2007.\n\nCornell University also provided information about some, but not all of its graduates. It confirmed that Rep. Wesley Hunt, R-Texas, had earned an MBA and Master of Public Health in 2015, and another master’s degree in 2016. But the university initially said that it had “no information available” on Rep. Melanie Stansbury, D-N.M.\n\nThe university had touted Stansbury as a graduate in June 2021, however, when she won a special election to fill a vacancy left by Deb Haaland, who became secretary of the Interior. After USA TODAY contacted Stansbury’s office, the university confirmed she earned a master’s degree in sociology in 2007.\n\nMike Klocke, spokesman for the University of the Pacific-Stockton said it was news to them that an alumnus had just been elected to Congress. The campus then located California’s newly minted representative John Duarte, R-Calif. on their MBA rolls.\n\nPartnerships with nonprofit add complications\n\nSome universities sent reporters to the National Student Clearinghouse, a non-profit based in Virginia that performs degree verification for employers and alumni, for a $14.95 per search fee and only with the applicant’s permission.\n\nThe service has drawn the ire of online reviewers, who filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau.\n\n“I'm now being arbitrarily charged $13 for a glimpse at a pdf proving my degree's existence.” one user wrote. “This kind of service is easily offered by universities for free (and it WAS free until my school partnered with SCH), as students have already paid tremendous sums of money for their degree. Unnecessary middleman businesses like Student Clearinghouse should be ashamed of their own existence. This is a straight up ransom.”\n\nThe nonprofit reported about $80 million in revenue in 2021, according to IRS records.\n\nA company spokesman said it “needs to charge a fee to offset the time and expense to create and upkeep the verification technology that helps institutions focus on their mission and to support students.”\n\nHe noted that the service claims to have saved institutions $750 million annually and added that media or other interested parties can still contact universities directly to verify credentials.\n\nTrends in college degrees\n\nThe freshmen class in the House and Senate holds a wide variety of educational credentials.\n\nEight members of the new class graduated from military schools, including West Point, the U.S. Naval Academy in Maryland and the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado. Representatives Patrick Ryan, D-N.Y., Wesley Hunt, R-Tex. and John James, R-Mich. all graduated as members of the 2004 class at West Point, according to university records. Additionally, Rep. Keith Self, R-Tex. graduated as a member of the USMA Class of 1975.\n\nYale and Harvard are well-represented as well, with nine alumni joining in the freshmen class.\n\nSeveral new members are highly educated, including Democrat Yadira Caraveo, a pediatrician serving Colorado's 8th congressional district. In all, 23 new representatives and senators hold law degrees; two hold PhD’s: Rep. Shri Thanedar, D-Mich. In chemistry and Rep. Julia Letlow, R-La in communication.\n\nAmong the less highly educated: Rep. Eli Crane, R-Ariz. attended college but didn’t graduate. Rep. Chuck Edwards, R-N.C. attended but didn’t graduate from Blue Ridge Community College and Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla. is several credits short of a degree at Valencia College, the university confirmed. Rep. Marcus Molinaro, R-N.Y. graduated from Dutchess Community College, a public school in New York, and is one of the few lawmakers with only an associates degree.\n\nNone of these lawmakers suggested they had done more than attend these institutions in their congressional biographies.\n\nResearcher notes decline in elite credentials\n\nCraig Volden, a professor of political science at University of Virginia said the number of lawmakers who have attended elite Institutions – largely those atop the U.S. News and World Report rankings – have fallen since the 1970s.\n\nVolden included among elite schools Ivy League institutions such as Dartmouth College and Brown University and public institutions such as the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nThe decline in elite educated lawmakers occurred mainly among Republicans in both the Senate and House. In the Senate, more than half of Democrats attended elite colleges whereas only about a quarter of Republicans had done so. In the House, about a third of liberal lawmakers attended top colleges compared to just 13% of Republicans.\n\nIvy leagues and other highly selective colleges still remain highly represented in the freshmen class.\n\nAbout 20% of the new members attended a school Volden and his coauthors identified as elite, according to USA TODAY’s analysis. Some, such as Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pennsylvania, attended public institutions, the University of Connecticut, and private schools, Albright College and Harvard for Fetterman.\n\nVance attended Ohio State University before Yale Law School. (Ohio State said no one had checked Vance’s Buckeye bonafides). Others, such as Magaziner, D-R.I. attended only Ivies: Brown for undergrad and Yale for business school in Magaziner’s case.\n\nIn a November 2022 paper analyzing Congress members’ educations from 1973 to 2015, Volden and his coauthors – Jonathan Wai at University of Arkansas, and Alan E. Wiseman at Vanderbilt University – found Democrats in the House with elite educations are more effective than Senate Democrats or Republicans in either chamber.\n\nVolden said the team determined effectiveness by measuring how far a lawmaker’s legislation moved through Congress, whether it was taken up in committees and if it became law. Commemorative bills, such as those renaming buildings, were given less weight than those that changed federal policy.\n\nAmong lawmakers, the most common advanced degree is a juris doctor – a law degree – although Volden said he found little evidence to suggest that members with law degrees are more effective than those without one. Just under a quarter of the new members hold a law degree, according to a USA TODAY analysis.\n\nVolden and coauthors also found that lawmakers, both Democratic and Republican, who attended elite colleges were more likely to be liberal compared to their party peers than lawmakers who graduated from other institutions.\n\nThe researchers suggested further study could reveal what’s driving these shifts. Is it that elite-educated Republicans fell out of favor as their base moved farther right? Or did diminishing numbers of lawmakers with that educational background enable a more conservative shift? And Volden questioned whether a similar decline in the number of elite-educated Democrats could be looming.\n\n“The Republican trends are probably going to level out.” Volden said. “Currently, Democrats are dramatically overeducated relative to the public.”\n\nChris Quintana and Nick Penzenstadler are reporters on the USA TODAY investigations team.

Matt Gaetz of Niceville played a key role in finally bringing enough Republicans together to support Kevin McCarthy's election to the speaker's role in January. And on Tuesday, the Florida congressman led the effort to oust him in a historic, 216-210 vote.\n\nMcCarthy failed to deliver on all of the terms of a deal to land Gaetz's support, including holding votes on term limits and a balanced budget, and the Florida firebrand called him on it.\n\n\"Mr. Speaker, you are out of compliance with the agreement that allowed you to assume this role,\" Gaetz said, complaining that McCarthy's Congress has yet to subpoena President Biden's son Hunter and use the \"power of the purse\" to rein in spending.\n\n\"The only thing the 118th Congress is known for at this point is electing Kevin McCarthy speaker and underwriting Biden's debt, and unfortunately there's only one of those things we can remediate,\" Gaetz said.\n\nWhile the vast majority of Republicans voted no, Gaetz found seven other GOP representatives, none from Florida, to join him and Democrats in voting to oust McCarthy.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n'The right person':Congressman Cory Mills endorses Donald Trump's 2024 presidential bid\n\nA 'circular firing squad'\n\nThe two congressmen who represent Volusia and Flagler counties, Michael Waltz and Cory Mills, both voted no, but made different kinds of statements about the speaker's tenure.\n\nWaltz posted twice on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Tuesday.\n\n\"In the military, we call this a circular firing squad,\" the former Green Beret wrote.\n\nLater, after the vote, Waltz wrote: \"Biden, Schumer and Pelosi are the happiest people in Washington.\"\n\nMills and Waltz were among the 90 Republicans who opposed the short-term funding bill that averted a government shutdown on Saturday. Mills talked about McCarthy's inability to bring appropriations bills to the floor as \"a failure\" to lead the GOP.\n\n\"But I would argue that doing a motion to vacate will also prevent us from achieving our goal, because we have 43 days left to get an appropriations bill,\" Mills said on Fox Business earlier Tuesday. \"Without a speaker, we cannot vote for policy. We cannot vote for appropriation bills, and this would actually hinder us.\"\n\nRepublican John Rutherford of Jacksonville took aim at Gaetz, saying it was a \"personal vendetta\" against McCarthy and calling his concerns for cutting spending and securing the southern border \"hollow.\"\n\n\"Rep. Gaetz is driving our nation toward the brink of another government shutdown, all for clicks and cash and a boost in his national profile,\" Rutherford said in a prepared statement. \"His disrespect for his colleagues, this institution and the people we serve is a clear reflection of his lacking fitness to serve in Congress and has made him President Biden's greatest ally.\"\n\nThe seven Republicans who voted in favor of ousting McCarthy were Reps. Andy Biggs of Arizona, Ken Buck of Colorado, Tim Burchett of Tennessee, Eli Crane of Arizona, Bob Good of Virginia, Nancy Mace of South Carolina, and Matt Rosendale of Montana\n\nDemocrats vote to oust McCarthy\n\nAll 208 Democrats in attendance voted in favor of ousting McCarthy, including Florida Reps. Darren Soto of Kissimmee, Maxwell Frost of Orlando, Kathy Castor of Tampa, Sheila Cherifilus-McCormick of Miramar, Lois Frankel of West Palm Beach, Jared Moskowitz of Parkland, Frederica Wilson of Miami and Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Davie.\n\nMoskowitz expressed concern prior to the vote, tweeting: \"I do not believe this is a time for celebration. Our institutions are in great peril. But that is not the fault of Democrats.\"\n\nBut he later joked with fellow Democrat Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland about disgraced New York congressman George Santos as a potential replacement for McCarthy.\n\nFrankel, meanwhile, defended her vote to remove McCarthy by saying he \"catered to the will of MAGA extremists to win their votes, pushing deeply partisan bills that would criminalize abortion, take child care away from families, destroy public education and attack crucial benefits for seniors,\" while also \"wasting people's time\" with the impeachment inquiry into President Biden.\n\nWho didn't vote?\n\nRep. Anna Paulina Luna of St. Petersburg, an outspoken Trump supporter who voted against McCarthy on the first 11 ballots in January, did not vote Tuesday. She spun the discussion ahead with a comment about the type of candidate she'll support when voting on McCarthy's replacement.\n\n\"I will vote for the Speaker who publicly and clearly commits to defunding (Special Counsel) Jack Smith's anti-American election interference witch hunts and subpoenas Hunter Biden while bringing a vote on the impeachment of Joe Biden to the floor of the House,\" Luna posted on social media.\n\nCelebrity Mug Shot Hall of Fame:Trump's photo is one of many.

A CNN review of claims Santos has made about his education and employment history found the same discrepancies.\n\nCNN has reached out to Santos for comment. The Times report says Santos did not respond to repeated requests to furnish documents that would help to substantiate the claims while campaigning.\n\nThe discrepancies raise ethical and legal questions for Santos as he prepares to officially take on his role as a lawmaker in January as part of the new Republican majority in the House of Representatives.\n\nJoseph Murray, an attorney for Santos, told CNN in a statement that the Times was attempting to “smear” the congressman-elect with “defamatory allegations.”\n\n“Santos represents the kind of progress that the Left is so threatened by - a gay, Latino, immigrant and Republican who won a Biden district in overwhelming fashion by showing everyday voters that there is a better option than the broken promises and failed policies of the Democratic Party,” Murray said.\n\nSantos’ biography has at times listed an education at Baruch College and New York University, earning degrees in finance and economics. A NYU spokesperson, John Beckman, told CNN, “the University’s records do not reflect anyone with that name [George Anthony Devolder-Santos] having attended NYU.” A spokesperson for Baruch College told CNN it could not find a record of anyone with his name or birthday ever attending the school.\n\nOn a biography of Santos on the National Republican Congressional Committee website, he claimed he received degrees from New York University and Baruch College. CNN found that Santos specified in at least two separate interviews in the fall of 2020 that he received an MBA from NYU, adding in one interview that he had “zero debt” from his undergraduate and graduate studies. A review of his campaign websites, however, does not show references to a master’s degree.\n\nSantos’ campaign biography also included mention of experience at financial firms Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, but both told CNN they had no record of his employment.\n\nCNN also confirmed that Santos listed on his 2022 financial disclosure a salary of $750,000 this year and last at the Devolder Organization, which Santos has claimed is a “family firm” managing $80 million in assets.\n\nA search for the Devolder Organization found that the business was registered in Florida in 2021 and was most recently temporarily deemed “inactive” by the state after failing to file the required annual reports. A website or LinkedIn profile could not be found, and Santos failed to report any of the clients he served in his financial disclosure.\n\nSantos also claimed he founded and ran his own charity called “Friends of Pets United.” But no such organization was found in the IRS’ searchable database, nor in the registered charities in New York state and Florida. The nonprofit supposedly ran from 2013-2018, according to a story from a local newspaper, The Queens Gazette, announcing Santos’ first run for Congress in 2019.\n\nSantos defeated Democrat Robert Zimmerman in a newly drawn district covering parts of Queens and some nearby Long Island suburbs, flipping control to Republicans, who dominated the New York suburbs on their way to winning a House majority. The GOP mini-wave outside the city set off roiling recriminations among New York Democrats, including calls for the state party chair to step down.\n\nIt was Santos’ second run – he lost to Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi in 2020 – and most of the criticism he faced centered on his attendance of former President Donald Trump’s rally in Washington on January 6, 2021, and a video in which he claimed to have written a “nice check” to help alleged rioters with their legal fees.\n\nHis campaign message was largely focused on crime and inflation.\n\nIn a brief interview with CNN, New York state Democratic Party chair Jay Jacobs pushed back against suggestions the party or Zimmerman campaign had dropped the ball and sought to redirect attention to questions about Santos’ financial statements.\n\n“It’s unfair to blame the campaign for opposition research work that it did because the resources of a campaign are not as significant as a paper like The New York Times, that can do a lot more with its investigation,” Jacobs said. “The important thing is to focus on George Santos. He’s got a lot of explaining to do. And I think that his biggest vulnerability is in the area of campaign finance.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting and reaction.", "authors": ["Em Steck Chandelis Duster", "Em Steck", "Chandelis Duster"], "publish_date": "2022/12/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/09/politics/senate-race-rankings-july-elections/index.html", "title": "The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022 | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nWith more than half of this year’s competitive Senate matchups set, the overall electoral environment remains consistent: President Joe Biden’s poor approval numbers, combined with a pervasive sense that the country is headed in the wrong direction, are weighing down Democrats looking to maintain control of Congress.\n\nBut bruising Republican primaries and the US Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade last month offer a few – albeit potentially ephemeral – glimmers of optimism for Democrats.\n\nAny big Supreme Court-related development can raise the stakes of Senate races because of the chamber’s role in confirming future justices. But last month’s ruling that found there was no longer a federal constitutional right to an abortion could drive even more attention to the Senate since it’s Congress that would set any future nationwide abortion policies.\n\nPressed on how to respond to the ruling in an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash last month, Vice President Kamala Harris repeatedly said, “There’s an election happening.”\n\nFor Democrats or Democratic-leaning voters, especially those feeling uninspired by Biden’s first term so far, the ruling could motivate them to vote this fall. It remains to be seen, however, how much of that energy is sustainable and to what degree the ruling also persuades independents or moderate Republicans to vote Democratic. In the immediate term, the elimination of federal abortion rights has resulted in Democratic outside groups such as Planned Parenthood Votes and Women Vote!, the super PAC arm of EMILY’s List, going up on the air attacking Republicans.\n\nAnother bright spot for Democrats, underscored by the abortion issue, is that the Senate playing field includes states such as Nevada, New Hampshire and Colorado that have recently voted blue. In fact, seven of the 10 races on this list of seats most likely to flip are in states Biden won in 2020.\n\nThe addition of Colorado at No. 10 on this latest ranking, however, speaks to the challenging national environment for Democrats. Economic issues – high inflation and gas prices this summer travel season – are still weighing on voters and are often cited as their most pressing concern. Republicans have also tried tapping into Americans’ post-pandemic anxieties about safety, with ads suggesting Democrats are soft on crime. Some Democratic candidates have worked to get ahead of those attacks early by featuring uniformed police in their own spots and directly refuting the idea of “defunding the police.”\n\nBesides Colorado’s appearance on the list, the biggest change to this month’s ranking is Nevada and Georgia trading places. It may seem somewhat counterintuitive, especially in this era of hyper-nationalized elections and considering Nevada is a more Democratic state than Georgia. But the change was driven by the candidate matchups in the two states, as things stand now. The ranking is based on CNN’s reporting, fundraising and advertising data, and polling, as well as historical data about how states and candidates have performed.\n\nJust a handful of important Senate primaries that will shape the November midterms remain. They key ones to watch in August and September: The Republican primaries in Arizona, Missouri and New Hampshire and the Democratic primary in Wisconsin.\n\n1. Pennsylvania\n\nIncumbent: Republican Pat Toomey (retiring)\n\nSarah Silbiger/Pool/Getty Images\n\nThe start of the general election in the Keystone State was a mixed bag for Democrats trying to flip the seat of retiring GOP Sen. Pat Toomey. Their nominee, Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, was sidelined by a stroke just before he won the primary and has been off the trail recuperating. But then they got the Republican opponent they wanted in celebrity surgeon Mehmet Oz.\n\nThe Donald Trump-backed candidate narrowly won the GOP nomination after a recount, but not without his image taking a serious hit – weeks of attack ads from Republican rival Dave McCormick and his allies had driven up Oz’s negatives. (In a Fox survey ahead of the primary, for example, 46% of GOP voters had an unfavorable view of Oz.) The race is expected to tighten as some of those Republican voters get behind Oz now that he’s the party nominee.\n\nBut Democrats’ message is picking up where the primary left off. Fetterman’s TV spots, which lean into an “us vs. Washington” theme that never mentions the candidate’s party ID, repeat that he’s “from Pennsylvania, for Pennsylvania” – an implicit knock on Oz, who has said he moved from New Jersey in late 2020. Republicans are equally happy to be running against Fetterman, a former Bernie Sanders supporter who handily defeated his more moderate primary challenger. But in a state that Biden carried and with the GOP primary forcing Oz to the right, this seat is still the most likely to flip in the fall.\n\n2. Nevada\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto\n\nCNN\n\nNevada moves up one spot, trading places with Georgia, where the fundamentals of the state (for example, past presidential performance) would seem to give Republicans a better chance of unseating a Democratic incumbent. But the Republican Senate nominee in the Silver State, former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt, is a more tested candidate than the GOP nominee in Georgia, ex-NFL star Herschel Walker.\n\nThat may not be saying much considering Walker, a political neophyte, is widely seen as the biggest wild-card candidate of the cycle and Laxalt lost his last bid for statewide office (the 2018 gubernatorial race). Laxalt, however, has held statewide office before and is the grandson of the former governor and senator with the same last name. Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock, who was on the ballot just last year, also started the cycle as a better defined (and funded) Democratic incumbent than Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, who hasn’t faced voters in this transient state in six years. Masto has a tough road ahead, to be sure – and fissures in the state Democratic Party aren’t helping – but the Supreme Court ruling on abortion could work in Democrats’ favor in a state where even the most recent GOP governor supported abortion rights.\n\nLaxalt sought to downplay the political impact of the court’s decision last month, saying in a statement that abortion rights were “settled law” in the state. But that likely won’t stop Democrats from pointing to his praise for the decision and arguing that he’d be another Republican vote in the Senate should Congress attempt to pass an abortion ban.\n\n3. Georgia\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Raphael Warnock\n\nMegan Varner/Getty Images\n\nEven Democrats are somewhat skeptical about a recent Quinnipiac University poll that showed Warnock, who’s running for a full six-year term after winning a special election last year, ahead of GOP challenger Walker by 10 points among registered voters. But even if that margin was too big to be true – there aren’t yet many other public surveys for comparison – it was notably wider than Georgia’s gubernatorial matchup, suggesting there’s something specific to this race, rather than the poll itself, going on here.\n\nThe margin was also a departure from Warnock’s and Walker’s neck-and-neck standing in Quinnipiac’s January poll, which could reflect recent troublesome headlines for Walker, who received negative ratings for honesty in the June survey. His campaign recently acknowledged, for example, that he has three children by women he was not married to, in addition to his son by his former wife. That’s opened him up to charges of hypocrisy given his public criticism of absentee fathers, especially in Black families. (Walker just went up with his first ad of the general election, and the positive spot – a hybrid ad paid for by the National Republican Senatorial Committee – doesn’t offer more than bland platitudes about him wanting to serve Georgia.)\n\nWhat’s most encouraging for Democrats facing a tough national environment may be that Warnock is still viewed more positively than Biden. The senator’s job approval rating was at 49% in the Quinnipiac poll, compared with 33% for the President. That’s some impressive separation the first-term senator has been able to create from the White House in a state not predisposed to vote Democratic. The poll was mostly conducted after the Supreme Court’s abortion decision on June 24, so Warnock’s advantage over Walker may also reflect some of the immediate backlash to that ruling, which won’t necessarily be sustained through the fall.\n\nThe good news for Republicans? A plurality of Georgians said inflation was the most urgent issue facing the state, which means the GOP still has four months to double down on messages like this one, from One Nation, accusing Warnock of voting for “reckless spending” that, the ad contends, has led to higher costs for Georgians.\n\n4. Arizona\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Mark Kelly\n\nCourtney Pedroza/Getty Images\n\nArizona is hosting one of the few outstanding GOP primaries that will help shape how competitive things are in the fall. Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly is running for a full six-year term after winning a special election in 2020. He’s used his fundraising advantage to go on the air while his would-be GOP opponents duke it out amongst themselves.\n\nTrump-backed Blake Masters has the support of billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel and the Club for Growth. Solar energy entrepreneur Jim Lamon is largely self-funding his campaign, which has spent nearly $8 million on TV, including future reservations, according to AdImpact data from the beginning of July. State Attorney General Mark Brnovich – a frequent Trump target for having helped certify Biden’s win in the state – was once thought to have been the front-runner because he holds statewide elected office, but there’s little sign he’s put together a competitive campaign.\n\nThe Trump backing should position Masters well in a GOP primary, but he’s embraced the former President’s election lies and downplayed the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol – a potential vulnerability in a purple state in the fall. More worrisome for some Republicans may be Masters’ suggestion, as reported by CNN’s Kyung Lah, that the US could privatize Social Security, which isn’t likely to go over well in retiree-heavy Arizona. While he doesn’t yet have an opponent, Kelly hasn’t escaped scrutiny. GOP-aligned groups are trying to tie the freshman senator, who now has a voting record, to Biden and the party in power in Washington.\n\n5. Wisconsin\n\nIncumbent: Republican Ron Johnson\n\nLeigh VogelPool/Getty Images\n\nSen. Ron Johnson is the most vulnerable Republican incumbent of 2022. And with his favorability numbers mired in the 30s, it’s no surprise his campaign has been rolling out a series of positive ads featuring constituents testifying directly to the camera about what a good senator he’s been. In a June Marquette Law School poll, 37% of Wisconsin voters viewed Johnson favorably. The two-term senator, who broke a term limit pledge to run again, has been known to generate controversy. Revelations that his office was involved in an effort to send then-Vice President Mike Pence a slate of fake electors prompted several of his Democratic challengers to call on him to resign. (Johnson has dismissed the story, saying they were staff-level discussions.)\n\nBut Democrats have discounted him before. His 41% favorability rating in October 2016 – just before he won a second term – isn’t much better than his numbers now. And even if their incumbent isn’t in as strong a position as they’d like, the good news for Republicans is that Biden’s job approval in the Badger State is at 40% – the lowest mark in Marquette’s polling since he took office. GOP enthusiasm to vote also outpaced Democratic enthusiasm – 67% to 58% – in the Marquette survey.\n\nThe task for Democrats, who pick their nominee on August 9, is to show that Johnson has changed and is no longer the senator Wisconsinites elected twice. The primary is the last truly unsettled Democratic contest in a competitive general election state. Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes continues to lead the primary field with 25% in the Marquette poll, but his lead over Milwaukee Bucks executive Alex Lasry (21%) is within the margin of error. State Treasurer Sarah Godlewski was at 9%, while Outagamie County Executive Tom Nelson was at 7%. Marquette tested hypothetical general election matchups for the first time this cycle, finding a margin-of-error contest regardless of the pairing.\n\n6. New Hampshire\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Maggie Hassan\n\nErin Scott/Getty Images\n\nA recent 30-second, direct-to-camera spot from Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan says a lot about the contours of this race. “The Supreme Court has taken away a woman’s most fundamental freedom,” the first-year senator says, before raising the specter of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and a GOP-controlled Senate trying to ban abortion nationwide.\n\nHassan is running for reelection in a state that increasingly votes blue in federal elections and has a GOP governor who supports abortion rights. Still, a bad national environment for Democrats, combined with the Granite State’s swingy nature, has Hassan on notice. Even if most of her would-be GOP challengers aren’t very well known ahead of the September 13 primary, it may not take much more than a generic Republican to unseat her if that’s the way the winds are blowing in November.\n\nThat explains why Hassan, whose campaign announced it had raised more than $5 million in the second quarter, is using the Supreme Court’s abortion ruling to try to shift the conversation toward a hypothetical Republican-controlled Washington that New Hampshire voters may not like. The great unknown, however, is whether frustrations with the economy and dissatisfaction with the direction of the country will outweigh other concerns in November.\n\n7. North Carolina\n\nIncumbent: Republican Richard Burr (retiring)\n\nDemetrius Freeman/Pool/Getty Images\n\nRepublican Rep. Ted Budd enters the general election with a built-in advantage in the race to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Richard Burr given that Trump twice carried the state. And while the conservative congressman’s fundraising hasn’t impressed, outside GOP groups are carrying the weight on TV, attacking Democratic nominee Cheri Beasley’s judicial record. Local TV stations took down one of those ads, but the soft-on-crime attack line is a central message Republicans are deploying against the first Black woman elected as chief justice to the state Supreme Court.\n\nBeasley has responded by touting her law enforcement support, including with a spot that features sheriffs and police captains. “Cheri’s always had our backs, and we know she always will,” Richmond County Sheriff Mark Gulledge says. Another recent Beasley ad tries to distance the candidate from Democratic control of Washington, as she says, “Neither political party is getting it right” while promising to hold Washington accountable.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, are trying to portray Budd, who was boosted by the campaign arm of the Club for Growth in the primary, as too extreme for the state. Senate Majority PAC, a major Democratic super PAC, invested in this race after initially leaving it off its early reservations – a sign that Democrats haven’t counted this one out even if it’s less of a priority than other GOP-held seats in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\n8. Florida\n\nIncumbent: Republican Marco Rubio\n\nDREW ANGERER/AFP/POOL/Getty Images\n\nGOP Sen. Marco Rubio still has the advantage in this race, but Democratic Rep. Val Demings, who’s heavily favored to win the Senate nomination on August 23, is keeping the race interesting by raising impressive money.\n\nWhile Rubio has the backing of some major law enforcement groups in the state, Demings is leaning into her background as the former Orlando police chief to try to refute his attempts to tie her to the national party. “In the Senate, I’ll protect Florida from bad ideas like defunding the police. That’s just crazy,” she says in her first ad.\n\nBut in a state that has grown incrementally Republican in recent elections, Demings would face a difficult general election against Rubio, who has built a national profile over his two terms in the Senate and should benefit from political tailwinds this fall.\n\n9. Ohio\n\nIncumbent: Republican Rob Portman (retiring)\n\nTING SHEN/AFP/POOL/Getty Images\n\nRep. Tim Ryan, the Democrat running an uphill campaign to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Rob Portman, is also trying to show his support for law enforcement. “Tim Ryan knows defunding the police is ridiculous,” the Stark County sheriff says in a recent ad for the Democratic nominee.\n\nRyan, a 10-term congressman who easily won his May primary, is up against “Hillbilly Elegy” author JD Vance, who emerged from one of the ugliest GOP contests of the cycle helped by Trump’s backing. The former President has twice won Ohio, which hasn’t been very hospitable of late to Democrats running for federal statewide office – US Sen. Sherrod Brown being the notable exception.\n\nThat’s why Ryan, who once challenged Nancy Pelosi for House Democratic leader, is being vocal about distancing himself from his party. “When (President Barack) Obama’s trade deal threatened jobs here, I voted against it,” he says in another ad as he walks through Youngstown sporting a gray hoodie. “And I voted with Trump on trade,” he adds, trying to project an image of Buckeye State authenticity. It’s not clear that’ll be enough against a Trump-backed candidate in a nationalized election, but it may be Ryan’s best shot. And with his campaign announcing that he raised $9 million in the second quarter that ended June 30, it looks like he’ll at least have the resources to carry that message.\n\n10. Colorado\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Michael Bennet\n\nGraeme Sloan/SIPA USA/AP\n\nColorado steals the 10th spot on this list from Missouri. What’s going on in the Centennial State? Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet is running for a third full term against businessman Joe O’Dea, whose emergence from last month’s GOP primary makes this race competitive. (Democrats had spent millions trying to help his primary opponent win because they thought he’d be a weaker general election candidate.)\n\nAs a Republican who supports abortion rights in the early stages of pregnancy, O’Dea brings a unique profile to the race. Colorado has trended blue in recent federal elections – Biden won it by more than 13 points in 2020, the same year GOP Sen. Cory Gardner was unseated by 9 points. But Bennet’s previous elections have been close. In 2016, for example, he prevailed by only about 6 points against an underwhelming opponent whom the national GOP had abandoned. Against a more formidable Republican challenger in a tough year for Democrats, Bennet could be vulnerable.\n\nIn Missouri, meanwhile, the Republican field is still unsettled ahead of the August 2 primary. Looming over the party is the possibility of disgraced former Gov. Eric Greitens winning the nomination, which is the only way this seat would be competitive for Democrats.\n\nThe entrance of independent candidate John Wood could potentially complicate the race. Wood, a former senior investigator for the House January 6 committee, describes himself as a “lifelong Republican” and has said he would back McConnell for Senate leader, if elected. But if Greitens is the GOP nominee, Wood’s candidacy could end up splitting the anti-Greitens vote in the general election, making it more likely the controversial Republican keeps this seat in party hands. We’ll revisit Missouri’s spot on the list after the crucial GOP primary.\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct Adam Laxalt’s relationship to the former Nevada governor and senator with the same last name.", "authors": ["Simone Pathe"], "publish_date": "2022/07/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/01/politics/senate-race-rankings-may-elections/index.html", "title": "The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022 | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe month of May brought the first Senate primaries of the year. Ohio voted first, followed by a near weekly stream of contests that are shaping the midterm campaign for control of the chamber. At the close of the month, the general election matchups in almost half of this year’s most competitive races are nearly set, with the exception of Pennsylvania, where the Republican primary has gone to a recount.\n\nRepublicans only need a net gain of one seat this fall to win the Senate, and much of the intrigue about primaries has so far been on the GOP side. Former President Donald Trump endorsed in all four Senate contests that were on the ballot in May that are expected to be competitive in the fall – Ohio, where his chosen candidate won on May 3; North Carolina, where his chosen candidate won on May 17; Georgia, where his chosen candidate won on May 24, and in Pennsylvania, where his chosen candidate leads by roughly 900 votes. Those primaries cemented his hold on the party because of the way so many GOP candidates, even those without his endorsement, tried to appeal to him – in some cases, twisting themselves into almost unrecognizable versions of their former selves.\n\nTrump’s support played differently in each state. In Ohio, it helped “Hillbilly Elegy” author J.D. Vance win the primary, likely blunting the biggest attack attack on him – the candidate’s past criticism of Trump.\n\nThe former President’s backing of Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania did not have as clear of an immediate impact, especially considering voters might have already associated the two celebrity Republicans together. Near the end of the race, the millions of dollars spent attacking Oz and former hedge fund executive David McCormick seemed to open a lane for conservative commentator Kathy Barnette, but she’s in a distant third place behind Oz and McCormick.\n\nTrump weighed in on the North Carolina primary nearly a year ago, but his backing of US Rep. Ted Budd didn’t clear the GOP field immediately. In Georgia, however, his commitment to Herschel Walker likely kept other top-name Republicans out of the race, leaving the former NFL star gliding to the GOP nomination.\n\nDemocrats argue that messy and expensive GOP primaries will leave Republican nominees bruised heading into the general election. (Democrats also had a crowded primary in Pennsylvania, but it didn’t attract anywhere near the level of spending or vitriol as the GOP contest.)\n\nAfter watching Republican candidates run to the right to try to win their party nods, Democrats are hoping to make general election matchups a contrast in candidates. But that gets harder to do if the national environment continues to work against the party. President Joe Biden’s approval rating was at 41%, with 59% disapproving, according to a CNN poll, conducted by SSRS from April 28-May 1. Democrats know Republicans will tie them to him, which is one reason why a number of them broke with the White House on lifting Title 42, a Trump-era public health authority that allows border authorities to turn migrants back to Mexico or their home countries.\n\nSenate contests are increasingly becoming nationalized affairs, so while candidate quality does matter (see No. 10 on this list), Democrats face a tough challenge in holding their razor-thin Senate majority, regardless of which Republicans they’re facing.\n\nCNN’s ranking of the Senate seats most likely to flip saw a few changes in May, all in Republicans’ favor. But the states that held May primaries remain in the same positions for now, with uncertainty still reigning in Pennsylvania. The ranking, which will be updated in June, is based on CNN’s reporting and fundraising and advertising data, as well as historical data about how states and candidates have performed.\n\n1. Pennsylvania\n\nIncumbent: Republican Pat Toomey (retiring)\n\nSarah Silbiger/Pool/Getty Images\n\nPennsylvania – a state Biden won in 2020 – has long been the seat most likely to flip, but the May 17 GOP primary hasn’t yet given us an answer to what the general election matchup to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Pat Toomey will look like in November. Celebrity heart surgeon Mehmet Oz, who has Trump’s backing, and former hedge fund executive David McCormick finished in a near tie – with a margin close enough to trigger the state’s automatic recount process.\n\nCounties need to finish recounting – which they must do using a different device than the one used in the initial tabulation – by noon on June 7 and submit their results by noon on June 8. CNN has not made a projection in the race.\n\nThe winner will face Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, who easily won the Democratic nomination on May 17.\n\nOz has declared himself the “presumptive” nominee, following the lead of Trump, who urged him to declare victory while counting was still underway. While Oz had tried to capitalize on the former President’s support after receiving his endorsement in early April, McCormick and his allies argued that McCormick is the real conservative. “I like Trump … but not his Senate pick,” voters said in one McCormick ad ahead of the primary.\n\nPolitical commentator Kathy Barnette emerged as a late electoral threat to both men, with the political arm of the Club for Growth announcing a nearly $2 million investment to boost her candidacy, as well as the anti-abortion Susan B. Anthony List and CatholicVote backing her. That late surge wasn’t enough, though. Barnette trailing Oz and McCormick.\n\nThe lingering question in the Keystone State is whether Trump’s backing of Oz will have made a difference if he holds on to his narrow lead after the recount – and what that means for the general election. Oz’s negatives were notably high compared with his opponents in a Fox poll ahead of the primary. Forty-six percent had an unfavorable view of Oz, while 27% and 12% had unfavorable views of McCormick and Barnette, respectively.\n\nFetterman already debuted a general election message in one of his ads ahead of the primary, in which he vowed to “take on Washington,” coming across as a progressive trying to run as a populist outsider. His primary opponents had trained their attacks on him in debates, especially over a 2013 incident in which he brought along his shotgun to confront someone who later turned out to be an unarmed Black jogger. And the primary had been rocked in the final days by news that Fetterman had suffered a stroke, leaving him in the hospital on election night.\n\nThe former Braddock mayor finished with about 59% of the vote to 26% for US Rep. Conor Lamb, who’s also from western Pennsylvania, but ran as more of a moderate and highlighted his success defeating “Trump Republicans” in his Pittsburgh-area House seat.\n\n2. Georgia\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Raphael Warnock\n\nMegan Varner/Getty Images\n\nDespite enduring attacks from GOP opponents, former NFL player Herschel Walker, who has the backing of both Trump and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, easily won the GOP nomination to take on Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock.\n\nHaving won a special election runoff in January 2021, Warnock is now seeking a full six-year term. He raised an astounding $13.6 million in the first three months of the year, which follows impressive earlier quarterly hauls, and is running direct-to-camera ads on issues with bipartisan appeal such as jobs, infrastructure and health care. Meanwhile, Democrats hope that Warnock and gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams will generate the base turnout they desperately need in a midterm year.\n\nBut Warnock is in serious jeopardy, even against a wildcard candidate like Walker, who faces a myriad of questions about his business background and allegations of threats he made against women. Much of the GOP establishment viewed Walker as a liability at the beginning of the cycle but have, publicly at least, come around, while his team has worked to keep him relatively on script. Democrats’ road to Senate control ran through Georgia last cycle, but it’s still challenging political terrain for them, especially in a midterm year with an unpopular Democratic President.\n\nOne unknown wrinkle, however, is how the loss of Trump’s endorsed candidates for other statewide offices in the Peach State’s GOP primaries could shape turnout in the fall. Georgia proved that Republican voters, even committed Trump supporters, won’t necessarily follow his lead at the ballot box. They chose to stick with GOP Gov. Brian Kemp, for example, despite the former President railing against him for refusing to help him overturn the 2020 election. But some GOP strategists are still afraid of a repeat of the January 2021 Senate runoffs, when Trump’s outspoken criticism of the election system may have kept some of his voters home, allowing Democrats to pick up both of the state’s Senate seats.\n\n3. Nevada\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto\n\nCNN\n\nThe Silver State moved up two slots in May’s ranking. Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto faces a tough race in a transient state that Biden won by 2 points in 2020. The President’s approval rating has sunk since then, and Nevada has some of the highest gas prices in the nation, which could play into the GOP messaging that’s trying to pin steep daily living costs on the party in power. Even if Cortez Masto manages to differentiate herself from generic Democrats, that effort could be overtaken by a bad national environment, especially if Republicans are able to make more inroads with Latino voters. It doesn’t help that the state Democratic Party is fractured.\n\nCortez Masto, the former chair of Senate Democrats’ campaign arm, outraised likely GOP nominee Adam Laxalt in the first quarter of the year – $4.4 million to $1.6 million. But money isn’t expected to be an issue for Laxalt, a former state attorney general – he succeeded Cortez Masto in that role – and grandson of a former senator and governor, who will benefit from GOP outside spending. Democrats argue that Laxalt, who co-chaired Trump’s 2020 campaign in the state, has gone too far down the election conspiracy road and that his anti-abortion positions will alienate voters. But that may not matter as much if voters decide it’s time for a change in Washington.\n\nLaxalt first faces a primary on June 14. Club for Growth Action, which is backing him, is on the air attacking Army veteran Sam Brown, who’s proven to be a competitive fundraiser. Laxalt is touting Trump’s backing in his own recent spot.\n\n4. Arizona\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Mark Kelly\n\nCourtney Pedroza/Getty Images\n\nHolding steady in fourth position is Arizona, where Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly is running for a full six-year term after winning a special election in 2020. He’s one of the best-positioned Democratic incumbents when it comes to his personal story and campaign coffers. But the former astronaut has a voting record now and is running in a purple border state that only narrowly backed Biden. Kelly is trying to stake out differences from the White House – such as his opposition to lifting Title 42. But regardless of any real separation between him and Biden, messaging those nuances is an arguably tougher job than it is for Republicans to blanketly tie him to an unpopular President.\n\nLuckily for Kelly, the messy Republican primary field won’t be sorted until August. So while he’s facing attacks from the National Republican Senatorial Committee, he doesn’t yet have a well-defined opponent. Trump has teased that an endorsement is coming. It’s unlikely to be for state Attorney General Mark Brnovich, who’s been a target of the former President’s wrath for not doing more to investigate the 2020 election. Venture capitalist Blake Masters is backed by Peter Thiel, who was also behind Trump’s chosen candidate in Ohio. But Masters also has the endorsement of the Club for Growth, which may not sit well with Trump given his differences with the group over the Ohio Senate primary.\n\n5. Wisconsin\n\nIncumbent: Republican Ron Johnson\n\nLeigh VogelPool/Getty Images\n\nGOP Sen. Ron Johnson finally stepped up his fundraising – he brought in about $6 million in the first three months of the year after announcing in January that he was breaking his pledge to only serve two terms. He’s been running positive spots, featuring families who say their terminally ill loved ones benefited from Johnson’s support for so-called Right to Try legislation.\n\nThat’s not why Wisconsin slides down two spots on this list. The senator remains unpopular – 36% of registered voters viewed Johnson favorably while 46% viewed him unfavorably, according to a Marquette University Law School poll released Wednesday. (In February, the same poll found him underwater by a slightly worse 12 points.) Half of voters in the April Marquette survey said the phrase “cares about people like me” did not describe Johnson. That explains why Democrats continue to believe this seat is a better pickup opportunity with Johnson running than had it been an open seat.\n\nBut Biden is also unpopular in Wisconsin. After winning the state with about 49% in 2020, his approval rating has hovered at about 43%, with some 53% disapproving, since last fall. The winner of the Democratic primary in August will likely be tied to Biden, especially with inflation emerging as a top concern, according to the Marquette poll, and worries over the coronavirus (about which Johnson has said plenty of controversial things) reaching a new low.\n\nThe Democratic field is still uncertain. Support for Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, who has been seen as the front-runner, declined slightly among likely primary voters in the Marquette poll, while support for Milwaukee Bucks basketball team executive Alex Lasry ticked up. State Treasurer Sarah Godlewski and Outagamie County Executive Tom Nelson remained in the single digits. Nearly half of those likely primary voters, however, said they hadn’t picked a candidate. Lasry and Godlewski are pouring their own resources into the race to go up on TV. Barnes, who raised $1.7 million in the first quarter of the year, went up with his first TV ad in mid-May. But none of the candidates has emerged as a fundraising powerhouse the way other Democrats challenging unpopular Republicans (think Sens. Ted Cruz or Lindsey Graham) have in cycles past.\n\n6. New Hampshire\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Maggie Hassan\n\nErin Scott/Getty Images\n\nNew Hampshire remains at No. 6 as the Republican field – upended late last year by Gov. Chris Sununu’s decision not to seek the nomination – develops. Republicans looking to challenge Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan include state Senate President Chuck Morse, former Londonderry town manager Kevin Smith and retired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc, who unsuccessfully sought the nomination for the state’s other Senate seat in 2020. And other Republicans have been throwing their hats in the ring ahead of New Hampshire’s late primary in September.\n\nHassan, a former two-term governor, is seeking a second Senate term in a state that, on paper, should be more favorable to Democrats than any other state on this list. Biden carried New Hampshire by 7 points in 2020. An unfavorable national environment, however, could hurt her reelection chances, even without an opponent of Sununu’s caliber. Hassan has come out against the Biden administration’s plan to lift Title 42, making her own trip to the border last month that angered several Latino leaders back home.\n\n7. North Carolina\n\nIncumbent: Republican Richard Burr (retiring)\n\nDemetrius Freeman/Pool/Getty Images\n\nOne of Trump’s earliest Senate primary endorsements – for US Rep. Ted Budd last June – resulted in victory here on May 17, with Budd easily dispatching former Gov. Pat McCrory and former US Rep. Mark Walker for the GOP nomination to succeed retiring Sen. Richard Burr.\n\nThe Trump endorsement didn’t clear the field for Budd, but heavy spending from the conservative Club for Growth Action helped boost him. One spot ahead of the primary featured Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson praising Budd and knocking McCrory. “Pat’s a nice guy, but he’s no conservative,” Robinson says, admitting that he’d voted for McCrory in the past “but not this time.” McCrory and his allies touted his record on immigration and argued that Budd is “weak” on a host of issues.\n\nOn the Democratic side, former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Cheri Beasley, who won 81% of the vote in the primary, had essentially already cleared the primary field and pivoted to the general election. “Looking at Washington, I think both parties are doing the job wrong,” she said in an ad ahead of the primary. Beasley had outraised all the Republicans in the first quarter of this year, but money won’t be enough in a state Trump won twice, especially in a midterm year, when Democratic turnout has often waned. Senate Leadership Fund, the GOP super PAC aligned with McConnell, made ad reservations in the state ahead of the primary to help the GOP nominee. The Democratic equivalent, Senate Majority PAC, announced an ad buy defending Beasley after the primary, despite leaving North Carolina off its list of initial reservations earlier this spring.\n\n8. Florida\n\nIncumbent: Republican Marco Rubio\n\nDREW ANGERER/AFP/POOL/Getty Images\n\nDemocratic Rep. Val Demings, a former Orlando police chief with a compelling story, continues to outraise Republican incumbent Marco Rubio, bringing in more than $10 million during the first three months of the year to Rubio’s $5.8 million. Her campaign recently announced a Hispanic outreach effort and a $3 million investment in a state bilingual coordinated campaign.\n\nBut while money is important in this expensive state, it won’t be enough to flip the seat. And none of the major outside groups have made ad reservations here, signaling that they view the race as less competitive. Demings already started at a disadvantage in a state where Trump expanded on his victory margin in 2020 from four years earlier, but her job would be even harder if the national mood continues to sour on Democrats this fall. She and Rubio have traded barbs on gas prices and immigration. Rubio’s campaign has tried to tie Demings to Biden’s decision to rescind Title 42. Demings’ team recently said she does not support lifting the measure “until there is a plan to put more boots on the ground and support our law enforcement officers at the border.”\n\n9. Ohio\n\nIncumbent: Republican Rob Portman (retiring)\n\nTING SHEN/AFP/POOL/Getty Images\n\nThe first major test of Trump’s endorsement in a Senate primary this year was a success for the former President. “Hillbilly Elegy” author J.D. Vance, who received Trump’s backing in mid-April, won the nomination on May 3 with about 32% of the vote, finishing ahead of former state treasurer Josh Mandel (24%) and state Sen. Matt Dolan (23%).\n\nVance’s public criticism of Trump from 2016 had been a treasure trove for his primary opponents and their ad-makers. The former President, though, was willing to look past that. And it paid off for Vance, who saw his support double in a Fox poll ahead of the primary. It was a topsy-turvy race, but it’s likely that Vance landed on top at just the right moment for it to matter.\n\nStill, missing out on Trump’s endorsement didn’t stop the jockeying among some other candidates (and their allies) to tie themselves most closely to him. Club for Growth Action, for example, which had backed Mandel and is in an open spat with Trump, ran more clips of Vance’s past criticism of Trump. Another Club ad featured people, some of whom said “they love Trump,” questioning the former President’s judgment on endorsements past and present.\n\nOnly Dolan ran truly outside the Trump election conspiracy lane in the GOP primary. Interestingly, his stock had risen in polling right before the election, presaging his third-place finish ahead of candidates who had tried to tie themselves more closely to Trump, including former state party chair Jane Timken, who had the backing of retiring Sen. Rob Portman, and businessman Mike Gibbons.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Tim Ryan easily won his party’s nomination but starts at a disadvantage in this reddening state.\n\n10. Missouri\n\nIncumbent: Republican Roy Blunt (retiring)\n\nSaul Loeb/Pool/Getty Images\n\nIt’s still all about Eric Greitens in Missouri – does the former governor, who resigned in disgrace in 2018, stay in the Republican race? Does he score Trump’s endorsement? And does he win the GOP nod in August? Those are the series of questions that will determine whether Missouri – a red state that shouldn’t otherwise be competitive – remains on this list.\n\nConcerns about Greitens deepened in March after court documents revealed that his former wife had alleged he was physically abusive toward her and his children, which he denies. Greitens is no stranger to controversy, having resigned as governor amid allegations of sexual misconduct. Many of his primary opponents have called on him to drop out. Anxious Republicans would like to see their primary field thin, fearing that such a crowded pool of candidates could end up splitting the anti-Greitens vote and handing him a victory.\n\nSome Democrats smell opportunity. Trudy Busch Valentine, a nurse and Anheuser-Busch beer heiress, jumped into the race this spring. She hasn’t said how much she’ll invest in her campaign, but should this race become competitive, Democrats may benefit from having a candidate with her own money to spend. But Valentine first has a primary to win – while one Democrat dropped out of the race and endorsed her, the top fundraiser, Marine veteran Lucas Kunce, doesn’t look like he’s going anywhere.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details in Pennsylvania, Georgia and North Carolina.", "authors": ["Simone Pathe"], "publish_date": "2022/05/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/03/03/murdaugh-found-guilty-house-investigate-santos-5-things-podcast/11389380002/", "title": "Murdaugh found guilty, House to investigate Santos: 5 Things podcast", "text": "On today's episode of the 5 Things podcast: Murdaugh found guilty\n\nAlex Murdaugh has been found guilty of murdering his wife and son.

This transcript was automatically generated, and then edited for clarity in its current form. There may be some differences between the audio and the text.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nGood morning. I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things you need to know Friday, the 3rd of March 2023. Today, Alex Murdaugh has been found guilty of murder. Plus, former president Donald Trump could be sued, connected to January 6th, and we'll hear about mental health challenges in Congress.\n\n♦\n\nAlex Murdaugh has been found guilty.\n\nCourt Clerk:\n\nIndictment for murder. SC code 16-3-0010 CDR code 0116. Guilty verdict.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThe disgraced South Carolina lawyer was found guilty by a jury last night for the murders of his wife, Maggie, and son Paul. The pair were found fatally shot at the family's home in 2021, and Murdaugh admitted in court that he lied to investigators when he told them he was not at the property's dog kennels before finding their bodies.\n\nSo, how did we get to this point? I spoke with Hampton County Guardian Managing Editor Michael DeWitt Jr after closing arguments to find out how the prosecution wrapped up its case.\n\nMichael DeWitt Jr.:\n\nProsecution stressed the mountain of circumstantial evidence and the mountain of lies and inconsistent statements that Alex Murdaugh made. They don't have a smoking gun. They don't have the clear murder weapon and there were no eyewitnesses. But as the prosecution said, I would bring you two eyewitnesses, but they're both dead.\n\nThey stressed the main pieces of evidence, cell phone video. For months, Alex Murdaugh repeatedly told authorities that he wasn't at the crime scene when it happened, he hadn't seen his family in an hour and a half, two hours. And this video finally emerged after a year of forensics that required the FBI to lend a helping hand. It took a year to get everything in and they found a video that puts him at the crime scene at 8:45 and they think that they were killed just four to five minutes later.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd do you see that video as being one of the most critical parts of this trial?\n\nMichael DeWitt Jr.:\n\nThat cell phone video taken by his son, Paul Murdaugh, is the most critical piece of evidence. It puts him where he said he wasn't. It puts him there just minutes before they were gunned down. And the second most compelling piece of evidence would be the fact that there are two family weapons that are missing and the shell casings found at the scene match shell casings found all over the Moselle property.\n\nSo, it's quite clear, it's hard to say that a drug gang, drug dealer or a unknown gunman showed up and just took the chance that there were going to be weapons at the scene. Most killers bring their own guns to the party. So, those are the two biggest pieces of evidence.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nMichael told me that the defense tried focusing on possible mistakes made by police after the crimes were committed.\n\nMichael DeWitt Jr.:\n\nOf course, any defense attorney is going to take the state's case like a shopping list and go down the list and try to find a way to discredit anything and everything. If there's a reasonable doubt that there's a one in 100 chance that fingerprint doesn't match or that DNA isn't a hundred percent foolproof, they're going to do that. But their biggest argument is shoddy police work.\n\nThere were some mistakes that were potentially made early in the investigation. When police arrived at the home of a prominent man from a prominent family, they kind of extended them some courtesies that might not have been made to a normal blue collar defendant. Murdaugh's law partners were all around the crime scene. They didn't search Murdaugh's home as thoroughly as they probably should have. They didn't search his parents' home where they think he disposed of evidence and disposed of the weapons.\n\nSo, there were some mistakes made early. They also criticized state police for zeroing in on Murdaugh early as their prime suspect and not really, they claimed, taking the time to rule out any other suspects.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd another big moment in the trial's final days this week happened when a member of the jury was removed. I asked Michael why exactly that happened.\n\nMichael DeWitt Jr.:\n\nAccording to what we learned, a juror was overheard talking to at least three people not associated with the case about the case, and we're told even expressing her opinion on the evidence or on the guilt or innocence of Murdaugh. It must have been a juror who was inclined to be favorable toward Murdaugh because when the judge said he was going to excuse the juror and replace her with an alternate, the state did not object, but Murdaugh's team objected.\n\nSo, obviously the information she passed on, informed speculation here, they didn't have enough evidence, or maybe she thought he was innocent. And so naturally, the defense is going to say, \"Hey, we don't want to get rid of her.\" But in the end, the judge excused her.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nMurdaugh's sentencing is set for 9:30 this morning. The minimum sentence for murder is 30 years in prison, though the South Carolina Attorney General's Office is seeking life in prison without the possibility of parole. Murdaugh will later stand trial for more than a hundred other criminal charges related to alleged crimes, including money laundering, stealing millions from clients, drug trafficking, and a botched life insurance scheme.

That means he can be sued over his role in the riot. A three judge panel of the DC Circuit Court of Appeals will decide whether to allow the lawsuits to continue.\n\nThe suits each accused Trump of inciting the riot. One rioter was shot to death inside the House chamber by a police officer, and an officer who was sprayed by chemicals during the attack died the next day from a stroke. Nearly a thousand people have been charged.\n\nTrump's lawyers urged the appeals court to dismiss the lawsuits by arguing that contentious speeches like the one he gave on January 6th, 2021 are part of a president's job. His lawyers also argued that he told his supporters to peacefully make their voices heard. But others, including US District Judge Amit Mehta have noted that Trump urged his supporters to quote, \"fight like hell,\" before his supporters fought police and barged their way into the capitol.\n\n♦\n\nThe House Ethics Committee has voted to investigate New York Congressman George Santos over a number of allegations surrounding his campaign last year and time in office. A subcommittee of two Democrats and two Republicans will look into whether Santos engaged in unlawful activity during his campaign last year, and they'll investigate sexual misconduct allegations involving a staffer. The freshman Republican has already stepped down from committee assignments after he admitted to embellishing his resume, including lying about his academic credentials. Still, he's refused to leave Congress despite calls for his resignation from both parties.\n\n♦\n\nSenator John Fetterman checked into a hospital last month and the reason was connected to his mental health. As USA TODAY Congress Reporter Candy Woodall told me, he's not alone.\n\nCandy, thanks for coming on the show.\n\nCandy Woodall:\n\nThanks for having me on. I appreciate it.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nI want to start by talking about Senator John Fetterman. What is he receiving treatment for in the hospital?\n\nCandy Woodall:\n\nHe's receiving treatment for severe clinical depression. This is something he has battled off and on throughout his life, but his staff said in recent weeks it became severe.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd other members of Congress are sharing their stories about mental health challenges. What did Congressman Ritchie Torres say about his experiences with depression?\n\nCandy Woodall:\n\nHe told us that hospitalization changed his life, that he was hospitalized in 2010 and he was in his early 20s then, and he stayed for some time at New York Presbyterian. He said he had world-class treatment there and Senator Fetterman is also in for a few weeks now. And by the way, that's standard.\n\nA lot of doctors say that that is a necessary timeframe to adjust medications, if medication is needed. And Ritchie Torres told us he did need medication and that he has been taking medication since that time and it helps him live a healthy, full and productive life, that there are still struggles, but the struggles are manageable now.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd I know you heard from lots of other lawmakers about their experiences. Can you just tell us about some of the other things you heard?\n\nCandy Woodall:\n\nOverall, what I heard is this is normal. A lot of people experience this. And we know that statistically from CDC and other federal data that it's more than half now of Americans who experience depression, anxiety, other types of mental illnesses in their lifetime.\n\nThe difference maker is getting help. And it can be hard to reach out for the first time or try to get help for the first time, but they say it is way scarier to leave mental illness untreated.\n\nOne lawmaker shared with us that her late partner had died by suicide, and that's Representative Susan Wild. She has been working since then in Congress to try to legislate on this issue and try to pass solutions for a mental health care. That has actually helped her win reelection.\n\nWhat I heard from every lawmaker is there is help available and not all of it involves a hospital stay. Often it is a mix of therapy. Sometimes it's trying a few medicines to find the one that works. And I think what our story shows is people at the highest levels of power in this country and with some enormous means, they struggle with this, too. This really can afflict anyone.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nWhen it comes to legislation, Candy, what is Congress doing to address mental health challenges in America? And do you find that Republicans and Democrats differ when it comes to this or is it pretty bipartisan?\n\nCandy Woodall:\n\nThere are certainly some bipartisan efforts. They do differ to some degree and a lot of it will come down to the insurance lobby quite honestly. But there have been efforts through the years to treat mental healthcare the same way that you would treat physical healthcare. They call that parity. As you know, there are so many issues right now before Congress that it is unclear where this falls among the priorities.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right. Candy Woodall covers Congress for USA TODAY. Thanks Candy.\n\nCandy Woodall:\n\nThank you.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nCollege graduation season is right around the corner, and seniors might be wondering about their career choices and how much they might earn at a first job. If you're an engineering major, the answer is a lot. Americans with only a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering make a median salary of $75,000 within five years of graduation. That's according to recent rankings by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. And other types of engineers earn more than 70,000 in that same timeframe.\n\nOf the 73 majors studied by Fed researchers, graduates in six, all liberal arts, earn a median pay of less than $40,000 in that timeframe. Still, college is generally worth the average cost of $35,000. The New York Fed says college graduates with no advanced degree still earn more than people with only a high school diploma.\n\n♦\n\nToday is National Anthem Day. The Star Spangled Banner was first declared the national anthem on this day 92 years ago by President Herbert Hoover.\n\nThanks for listening to 5 Things.

Roy Rochlin/Getty Images\n\nYou’ll remember that when the couple revealed their intention to step back as senior royals two years ago, they also expressed a desire to be “financially independent.” After moving to the United States, they inked multiple deals to produce content with several of the world’s biggest streaming services.\n\nSpotify landed an exclusive partnership with the Sussexes’ Archewell Audio production company back in December 2020, with a press release revealing the pair would “host and produce podcasts that build community through shared experience, narratives, and values.”\n\n“What we love about podcasting is that it reminds all of us to take a moment and to really listen, to connect to one another without distraction,” Harry and Meghan said in a joint statement at the time.\n\n“With the challenges of 2020, there has never been a more important time to do so, because when we hear each other, and hear each other’s stories, we are reminded of how interconnected we all are.”\n\nThey released a holiday special later that month and their first series was expected last year but the airwaves have been silent since.\n\nAs well as the audio offerings on the way, it looks like things are also full steam ahead for Meghan’s animated Netflix project, “Pearl.”\n\nThe streamer is searching for a production designer for the series, which follows the adventures of a “12-year-old girl who finds inspiration in a variety of influential women throughout history,” according to a job ad posted to LinkedIn.\n\nThe couple walk onstage during Global Citizen Live, New York on September 25, 2021. Theo Wargo/Getty Images\n\nAnother venture in the works from Archewell’s multi-year deal with Netflix is “Heart of Invictus,” a docu-series following “a group of extraordinary competitors from around the globe, all service members who have suffered life-changing injuries or illnesses on their road to the Invictus Games The Hague 2020, now set to take place in 2022,” according to a press release last April. Director Orlando von Einsiedel and producer Joanna Natasegara, who won an Oscar for their 2016 short film “The White Helmets,” are also attached to the project.\n\nThe team at Archewell are tight-lipped on what to expect this year so we’ll have to wait on the announcement for the specifics.\n\nWhat we now know is that production is ramping up and the next test for the Sussexes will be the same as for any media execs – how will their content rate? It’s payback time for Netflix and Spotify and, when you look at the way they are hiring, both seem confident of Sussex success.\n\nWHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING?\n\nQueen travels to her country retreat.\n\nThe Queen has made a special pilgrimage to her country home of Sandringham. A palace spokesperson told CNN she relocated on Sunday and is expected to stay at the sprawling 20,000-acre estate for the next few weeks. This means she is likely to be there for Accession Day – the day she ascended the throne – on February 6. The Queen’s annual trip at Christmas, which usually involves immediate family, was canceled as a precaution amid concerns over the Omicron variant. She instead celebrated the holiday season at Windsor. (Reporting by CNN’s Eleanor Pickston)\n\nAndrew demands trial by jury in Virginia Giuffre lawsuit.\n\nWe’ve all been curious about how the Duke of York intends to address the civil suit against him in the US, and this week he gave us the strongest signal yet. Prince Andrew formally denied allegations that he sexually abused Virginia Giuffre, and demanded a jury trial, according to a legal filing Wednesday in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. In the 11-page filing, Andrew’s lawyers responded paragraph-by-paragraph to the allegations in Giuffre’s lawsuit. “Prince Andrew denies that he was a co-conspirator of Epstein or that Epstein trafficked girls to him,” his attorneys Andrew B. Brettler and Melissa Y. Lerner wrote. He also denied he was a “close friend” of Ghislaine Maxwell or that he became a “frequent guest” in Epstein’s homes around the world. On other points, the attorneys wrote that the prince “lacks sufficient information to admit or deny the allegations.” Giuffre’s attorney, David Boies, said in a statement that they looked forward to a trial. Read more on this story here.\n\nCourt to hear legal challenge over Prince Philip’s will.\n\nThe UK Court of Appeal will hear a fresh legal challenge from the Guardian newspaper over Prince Philip’s will. We told you a few months back that the paper wanted to take action over the media’s exclusion from a private hearing on the Duke of Edinburgh’s will, after which the document was sealed for 90 years. The media wasn’t told of the July hearing or permitted to attend, with the public interest represented by the attorney general. A Guardian News & Media spokesperson previously told us in an emailed statement that the High Court’s decision to block the media was “a clear threat to the principles of open justice.” This week, Lady Justice King gave her permission and said: “There is a real prospect of the applicant succeeding on the ground that the High Court erred in law in denying the media an opportunity to make submissions, or at least to attend and hear submissions, as to whether the substantive application to seal the will of His Late Royal Highness, The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh should be heard in private.” A court date has not yet been set.\n\nDID YOU KNOW?\n\nThe Prince Andrew High School in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, is getting a new name as the sex abuse civil case against the British royal moves forward in the US. “We are changing the name to move in a different direction due to the negative reports about Prince Andrew,” school principal Craig Campbell told CNN in an email. “We hope to build our identity as a positive, supportive school community with a name to match.” Local residents will have a chance to submit name suggestions to a six-person renaming committee that includes students, staff and community members. Get the whole story.\n\nPrince Andrew High School in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia will be renamed based on submissions from the general public and a vote by its student body.

The Prince of Wales commissioned seven portraits of some of Britain’s remaining Holocaust survivors for a new Buckingham Palace exhibition. Attending the unveiling at The Queen’s Gallery on Monday, Charles, who is patron of the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, spoke with several sitters.\n\nThe prince also wrote the foreword for the exhibition’s program, in which he said “these portraits represent something far greater than seven remarkable individuals.” He continued: “They stand as a living memorial to the six million innocent men, women, and children whose stories will never be told, whose portraits will never be painted.” Charles also wrote of his hope that the special collection of portraits will become a reminder “not only about history’s darkest days, but of humanity’s interconnectedness as we strive to create a better world for our children, grandchildren and generations as yet unborn; one where hope is victorious over despair and love triumphs over hate.”\n\nIN THE ROYAL DIARY\n\nPrince William checks out the new BAFTA HQ.\n\nPrince William took in a tour of the newly refurbished British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) building on Thursday.

Marking the developments in service provision for survivors in the decades since, Camilla said she remembered “how different life was for women and, above all, for women living with abuse” who were “prisoners in their own homes; held captive by the one person they should have been able to trust.” The duchess also said Refuge had brought domestic abuse “into the national consciousness” before sharing her hope the problem would one day be entirely eradicated.", "authors": ["Max Foster Lauren Said-Moorhouse", "Max Foster", "Lauren Said-Moorhouse"], "publish_date": "2022/01/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/09/08/gander-newfoundland-september-11-terror-attacks-kindess-come-from-away/631329001/", "title": "On 9/11, how Gander, Newfoundland, welcomed 6,700 strangers", "text": "GANDER, Newfoundland — They still don't know what all the fuss is about.\n\nSixteen years ago, this small Canadian town on an island in the North Atlantic Ocean took in nearly 6,700 people – almost doubling its population – when the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks in New York and Washington forced 38 planes to land here.\n\nTheir simple hospitality to the unexpected house guests drew worldwide accolades and even inspired a Broadway musical.\n\n“Everyone looks at us and says that’s an amazing thing that you did, and the bottom line is I don’t think it was an amazing thing, I think it was the right thing you do,” says Diane Davis, 53, a now-retired teacher who helped 750 people housed at the town's elementary school.\n\nIn a world today seemingly fraught with division, terrorism and hate, they’d do it all over again. Kindness is woven into the very fabric of their nature — they don’t know any other way to live.\n\n“What we consider the most simple thing in life is to help people,” says Mayor Claude Elliott, who retires this month after serving as the town’s leader for 21 years. “You’re not supposed to look at people’s color, their religion, their sexual orientation — you look at them as people.”\n\nTo give you a glimpse of life here, start with this: Many Ganderites don’t lock the doors to their homes or cars. Everyone says hello to everyone. People know their neighbors. “My love” or “my dear” adorn every other sentence — except the Newfie accent makes the “my” sound like “me.”\n\nStill, there’s a wariness here: Not for the town itself, nor its future, nor the anchor of civility it represents. Instead, there’s a concern for the rest of the world, especially the U.S., as it faces terrorism, rogue nations and violent protests in the streets.\n\n“I'm scared at the way we're going and what the world will look like in 10 years,” says Elliott, 67. “If we keep on going, we’re going to set our world back 100 years.”\n\nA sinking feeling\n\nWhen Garry Tuff, then acting manager of safety and security for emergency response services at Gander International Airport, saw the second plane hit the World Trade Center, he knew his town of 10,000 people would be impacted. The airport here marks the closest point between Europe and the U.S. and is a preferred emergency landing spot for medical and other emergencies.\n\nThe 38 planes came “fast and furious” into the airport a short while later.\n\nAfter figuring out how to park all the planes, some of which later started sinking into the pavement because of their weight and the warm temperatures, officials spent the next 24 hours unloading luggage and people. Passengers faced intense scrutiny as they passed through customs. “Everybody was a suspect,” says Des Dillon, 75, then the manager of the Canadian Red Cross in Gander.\n\nBut everyone was a guest, too. Beyond the basics of food and water, some passengers on board needed medicine. Many left prescriptions in checked, inaccessible luggage. Pharmacists in town worked around the clock, calling dozens of countries to fill prescriptions.\n\nThen, there were the smokers on board, unable to get a fix for hours. “We bought every bit of nicotine gum that was in town,” Tuff says.\n\nWelcome to Gander, casserole city\n\nTo say this town of 10,000 people and its surrounding communities welcomed the passengers and crew from nearly 100 countries with open arms is an understatement. The town all but shut down for the “plane people,” inspiring the Tony-award winning Broadway musical Come From Away.\n\n“We did not know how we would be affected, if these people were staying, if the people who were coming were good people or not so good people,” says Linda Sweetapple, 54, business manager and partner at Sweetapple Accounting Group. “We just knew that we had to make room for them and take care of them. They were here, and they needed our help.”\n\nAs the planes, still packed with passengers, sat for hours at the airport, the town bustled with activity. Volunteers readied makeshift shelters — every school, gym, community center, church and camp, any place that could fit a planeload of people. Gander’s 500 hotel rooms were reserved for pilots and flight crews.\n\nBus drivers in the middle of a nasty strike laid down picket signs. Donations of toiletries, clothes, toys, towels, toothbrushes, pillows, blankets and bedding piled up. For security reasons, passengers weren’t allowed to take checked bags.\n\nGander residents began cooking — a lot. Grocery store shelves went bare. The Walmart ran out of nearly everything — underwear was a particularly hot commodity — and the local hockey rink transformed into the world’s largest refrigerator.\n\n“It was like casserole city,” says Reg Wright, 43, president and CEO of Gander International Airport.\n\n‘Poster child for hospitality’\n\nStuck on planes for up to 31 hours since taking off from Europe and in the age before smartphones and social media, many passengers didn’t know exactly what caused their diversion to this tiny Canadian province. Those who did still couldn’t fathom the terror attacks in the U.S. without seeing them.\n\nWhen passengers finally saw the destruction, Gander Police Constable Oz Fudge, 62, remembers the gasps.\n\n“You hear this ‘huh’ when the plane hit the towers,” says Fudge, the town’s police constable. “That sound I hear all the time, of the shock that’s on their faces as they’re standing there looking at this TV and the look of loss on their faces.\n\n\"I’ll live with that for the rest of my life.\"\n\nThe outpouring of kindness in the town only multiplied over the next five days. Gander residents took passengers sightseeing, moose hunting, berry picking and barbecuing. They entertained with music, stopped anyone walking down the street in case they wanted a ride and brought strangers into their homes for showers or even as guests for a few nights. They refused to accept money, though passengers later donated thousands to the town.\n\n“They couldn’t comprehend what we were doing,” says Dave Blundon, 67, who took in one of the families. “The way they looked at you — they almost wanted to touch you to make sure you’re real.”\n\nRobert Steuber, 55, stranded with his wife and elderly father-in-law after their Paris to St. Louis jet diverted, never felt like an outsider.\n\n“That whole community is the poster child for how hospitality and just a sheer act of humanity should be because they had such a high level of open arms, and come in and welcome and here’s my house,” says Steuber, whose St. Louis family eventually ended up with the Blundons. “It just absolutely floored me.”\n\nThe 'come from aways'\n\nIsrael, Austria, Spain, Poland, France, the Philippines, Iran, Italy, England, Germany, Thailand, Belgium, Ukraine, Africa, Hungary, Uganda, Senegal, Russia, United Arab Emirates and just about every state in the USA. The “come from aways,” as Newfoundlanders call anyone not from the island, were from all over the world, and despite the intense situation, no one in Gander batted an eye — prejudice against anyone is an entirely foreign concept here.\n\nToday, the crosswalk in front of Gander’s town hall is painted as a rainbow, and churches raised thousands of Canadian dollars to welcome four Syrian refugee families into the community, with a fifth scheduled to arrive next year. Many here don’t understand the division and hate in other parts of the world.\n\n“One thing this world is lacking today is common sense, that’s going out the door. We have to set more of an example and show the world we can all live in harmony regardless of what we are,” Elliott, the mayor, says.\n\nThat lesson wove its way into and changed Kevin Tuerff’s life. Sixteen years after his Air France flight from Paris to New York diverted to Gander, Tuerff, 51, is a character in the musical, author of the book Channel of Peace: Stranded in Gander on 9/11 and the force behind a Pay It Forward 9/11 movement that urges everyone to perform acts of kindness each year.\n\nGander is like a second home to him. “They are a shining beacon for how America once was kind to strangers, immigrants and refugees, and we need to get back that way,” he says.\n\nYet, over and over again, residents here say what happened in Gander isn’t unique, that anyone would lend a hand in a crisis, even pointing to residents in Texas and around the U.S. who helped during Hurricane Harvey.\n\n“No matter where you go people are good. I truly believe that in my heart. There’s 1% arseholes everywhere and if this happened where you live, you would help,” says Karen Mills, 54, manager of the Comfort Inn in Gander. “But Newfoundlanders, we’re a different breed in a lot of ways.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2020/01/09/prince-harry-meghan-instagram-duchess-kate-happy-birthday/4418085002/", "title": "Meghan Markle, Prince Harry wish Duchess Kate a happy birthday", "text": "Duchess Kate turned 38 Thursday, and her in-laws Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan are showing their support – just a day after news broke that they plan to \"step back\" as senior members of the British royal family.\n\nIn the comment section of a birthday post about Kate on the official Kensington Palace Instagram account, the couple shared a reply.\n\n\"Wishing a very happy birthday to The Duchess of Cambridge today!\" the comment from their @sussexroyal account read, with a cake and heart emoji.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex's birthday wish garnered plenty of attention, quickly becoming the top comment with over 7,550 likes and over 550 replies an hour after it was posted.\n\nPrince Harry and the former Meghan Markle said in a statement issued by Buckingham Palace Wednesday, they are stepping down from their senior royal roles and plan to split their time between North America and the United Kingdom.\n\n\"We intend to step back as ‘senior’ members of the Royal Family and work to become financially independent, while continuing to fully support Her Majesty The Queen,\" the statement read.\n\nAbout an hour later, another palace announcement, sent in an email from the office of the private secretary and the spokesperson for Queen Elizabeth II, landed in media inboxes.\n\n\"Discussions with The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are at an early stage,\" the statement said. \"We understand their desire to take a different approach, but these are complicated issues that will take time to work through.\"\n\nTheir latest (much smaller) move of commenting on Kate's Instagram is perhaps a precursor to their plans of becoming more independent, both in communications and finances.\n\nThey announced they will break another longtime tradition and no longer participate in the palace's \"Royal Rota\" system of inviting long-standing U.K. outlets to report exclusively on their activities.

Thousands of people lined up through the night in Edinburgh to pay their last respects.\n\nAnne was on the military C-17 Globemaster carrying the coffin when the plane touched down at RAF Northolt, an air force base west of the city, about an hour after it left Edinburgh.\n\nIt's the same Royal Air Force plane that has in the past been used to evacuate people from Afghanistan and to take humanitarian aid and weapons to Ukraine following Russia’s invasion, U.K. Air Chief Marshal Sir Mike Wigston said.\n\nMourning the queen:Queen Elizabeth II's coffin at cathedral in Edinburgh for memorial service\n\nQueen Elizabeth's coffin is back in London\n\nThe queen's coffin lay in St. Giles' Cathedral for most of Tuesday before being flown back to London and driven from the air force base to her official London home, Buckingham Palace, after darkness fell.\n\nThousands of bystanders gathered outside the palace in near silence on a rainy evening as they waited for the Royal Hearse to arrive at the monarch’s home for the final time.\n\nAfter the flag-draped coffin passed by, onlookers broke into a slow clap and even cheers as some shouted, “God save the king!” Margaret Pioro of London was among those waiting for the “historically very important” moment.\n\nThe queen meant “the continuity of the country, the strength, a sense of national identity … she was a unifying factor in the life of the nation beyond politics, beyond social changes,” Pioro said. “It’s a very befitting farewell and a welcome to the new king, who will be a wonderful king.”\n\nPresidents at Queen's funeral?:Ex-presidents, including Trump and Obama, aren't likely to attend.\n\nIn the early hours of Tuesday, scores of workers were seen cleaning litter and weeds from the road between the air force base where the plane carrying the queen’s coffin landed and the palace in central London.\n\nEven earlier on Tuesday, a military rehearsal took place for the transfer of the monarch’s coffin from Buckingham Palace to the Palace of Westminster, where she will lie in state until the funeral on Monday.\n\nAt about 4 a.m. local time, a horse-drawn carriage was observed carrying a black coffin along the route in preparation for the queen's arrival.

While Scotland has been almost universal in its praise for the queen, Northern Ireland comes with more mixed emotions about the monarchy.\n\nThere are two main communities in Northern Ireland: Protestant unionists who consider themselves British and largely Roman Catholic nationalists who see themselves as Irish.That split fueled three decades of violence known as “the Troubles” involving paramilitary groups on both sides and U.K. security forces, in which 3,600 people died.\n\nBut in a sign of how far Northern Ireland has come on the road to peace, representatives of Sinn Fein — the main Irish nationalist party — are attending commemorative events for the queen and meeting the king Tuesday.\n\nHundreds of people lined the street leading to Hillsborough Castle near Belfast as. Charles and Camilla got out of their car to greet villagers and the new king petted a corgi, the breed of dog synonymous with his mother, that was held up by one wellwisher.\n\nCharles offered “the most heartfelt thanks” for the public’s condolences.\n\n“I am here today at a time of great personal sorrow as we mark the death of my beloved mother, after a life most faithfully dedicated to the duty to which she had been called,” he said.\n\nCharles added: “It is fitting that we should meet at Hillsborough, which my mother knew so well, and in whose beautiful rose garden she always took such pleasure.”\n\nThe royal standard was raised on the castle’s flagpole as the monarch came in, and a 21-gun salute rang out on the castle grounds.\n\nCharles pledged to follow in the footsteps of his late mother and work for peace in Northern Ireland.\n\nSpeaking Tuesday to Northern Ireland’s political leaders, including those from nationalist parties who want Northern Ireland to leave the United Kingdom and become part of the Republic of Ireland, the new monarch said he would draw on his mother’s “shining example” and seek the welfare of everyone in Northern Ireland.\n\nCamilla's new title, explained:What's the difference between queen and 'Queen Consort'?\n\nIrish nationalist Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly praised Elizabeth II’s role in the peace process, in a message of condolence to Charles.\n\nAlex Maskey, a member of Sinn Fein, said at the Belfast ceremony that the example of the queen had helped “break down barriers and encourage reconciliation” in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe money behind the crown:What happens to Queen Elizabeth II's personal assets?\n\nContributing: Maria Puente, Elise Brisco, Naledi Ushe and Jane Onyanga-Omara in London, USA TODAY, and The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2014/05/02/memphis-bbq-joint-owner-the-brits-love-their-jack-daniels/8595497/", "title": "Princes Will, Harry dine in Memphis, enjoy BBQ", "text": "Arienne Thompson\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nMEMPHIS — Princes William and Harry jumped right into the local Memphis scene Thursday night, dining on the city's most famous barbecue at Charlie Vergos' Rendezvous downtown.\n\nA crowd of more than 100 onlookers gathered on the sidewalk outside the restaurant hoping to catch a glimpse of the young royals, who touched down in the city Thursday evening.\n\nSeveral black SUVs, full of earpiece-wearing security, idled outside while the princes, along with their friend Guy Pelly, his bride-to-be, Holiday Inn heiress Lizzy Wilson, and the rest of the wedding party dined inside.\n\n\"I think everybody had a really good time,\" Rendezvous owner John Vergos told USA TODAY in the first post-dinner interview. \"Everybody complimented us on the food and that was important.

He did not − the family members who appeared on the balcony were all working royals; Harry stepped back as a senior member of the royal family in 2020.\n\nThe past few years have brought to light the complicated relationship between the next heir to the British throne, Prince William, and his younger brother, referred to as the Spare in the palace growing up, as Harry recounted in his tell-all memoir earlier this year.\n\nHarry arrived at Westminster Abbey with his cousins, Princess Eugenie and Princess Beatrice along with their husbands, Jack Brooksbank and Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, respectively. Prince William arrived a few minutes later with Princess Kate and their children, Prince George, 9, Princess Charlotte, 8, and Prince Louis, 5.\n\nHarry sat in the pew behind William's, on the opposite end. William briefly participated in the ceremony, kneeling before the new king, pledging loyalty to him. At the end, William, Kate, and their three children participated in the royal procession. Harry was again spotted outside the abbey with his cousins as the king and queen settled into their gold carriage.\n\nWhile both princes along with Kate were in attendance, Harry’s wife, Duchess Meghan of Sussex was not: She stayed in California with the couple's children, Prince Archie, 3, and Princess Lilibet, 1.\n\nWith all eyes on William and Harry, here’s a refresher on how the brothers’ relationship has grown more contentious over the last few years.\n\nMore:Everything that happened at King Charles III's coronation\n\nWhat Prince Harry wrote in his tell-all book about Prince William\n\nIn January, Harry’s highly-anticipated memoir, “Spare,” aired decades of his family’s dirty laundry.\n\nAfter he and Meghan stepped down from their senior roles in the royal family in 2020 and moved to the U.S., Harry reunited with his family for the first time a year later at his grandfather Prince Philip's funeral. King Charles and Prince William had \"come ready for a fight,\" Harry began the book. Harry remembers William, whom he calls \"my beloved brother, my arch nemesis,\" and his father saying they \"honestly\" didn't know why Harry left. The memoir was a way of attempting to explain, he wrote.\n\nHe and his brother shared moments of bonding and disagreement through the years. They occasionally reflected together on their mother’s death. In the early aughts, they begged Charles not to marry Camilla. But their rift had also been brewing since their childhoods. When Harry joined his brother at boarding school, William told his little brother to pretend they didn’t know each other, Harry wrote. Though the palace told the public the brothers were each other’s best men at their weddings, that wasn’t the truth, he added.\n\nAnd William once physically attacked Harry in a dispute over Meghan, he claimed: \"He grabbed me by the collar, ripping my necklace, and he knocked me to the floor. I landed on the dogs' bowl, which cracked under my back, the pieces cutting into me. I lay there for a moment, dazed, then got to my feet and told him to get out.\"\n\nMore:Physical attacks, drug use, Diana's death and more bombshells from Prince Harry's 'Spare'\n\nPrince Harry has sued the media\n\nHarry, who has several lawsuits against the news media, has vowed to make reforming the British tabloids his life's work. He blames an overly aggressive press for the 1997 car crash death of his mother, Princess Diana, and has accused reporters and photographers of hounding his wife, Meghan.\n\n\"I have always had an uneasy relationship with the press,\" Harry wrote in his witness statement. \"However, as a member of the Institution, the policy was to 'never complain, never explain.' There was no alternative; I was conditioned to accept it.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Harry blamed the royal family for a delay in bringing a phone hacking lawsuit against the publisher of The Daily Mail as lawyers for the newspaper argued that the case should be thrown out because he didn't file it soon enough.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex said \"the Institution\" – a term he has used in other contexts to refer to the inner workings of Buckingham Palace – had prevented him from learning sooner about the activity of The Daily Mail and related publications by withholding information about phone hacking by other tabloids.\n\n\"The Institution made it clear that we did not need to know anything about phone hacking, and it was made clear to me that the royal family did not sit in the witness box because that could open up a can of worms,\" Harry wrote in a witness statement for his lawsuit.\n\nMore:Prince Harry blames royal family for delay in tabloid privacy suit\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle’s Oprah interview\n\nBefore “Spare,” Harry spilled plenty of royal tea in a joint interview with Meghan on CBS with Oprah in 2021. The two spoke openly of the serious pain and mental health struggles that ultimately led them to step down as senior members of the royal family the year prior.\n\nBombshell anecdotes included Princess Kate making Meghan cry a week before her wedding, Harry feeling let down by his father and having a strained relationship with his brother.\n\n\"I love him to bits, we've been through hell together, we had a shared experience, but we’re on different paths, Harry said, later calling their relationship \"spaced at the moment. And, you know, time heals all things, hopefully.\"\n\nHarry also said a member of the royal family — who he did not name but later clarified was not the late Queen Elizabeth II or her husband, Prince Philip — expressed concerns over how dark Harry and Meghan’s biracial child’s skin would be.\n\nMore:'I didn't want to be alive anymore': Duchess Meghan opens up in Oprah interview, more major moments\n\nContributing: Associated Press\n\nRead all our King Charles III coronation coverage:\n\nBiggest moments: Charles and Camilla crowned, royal family appears on balcony\n\nThe balcony:See who greeted the crowd with Charles and Camilla (not Harry)\n\nKing Charles III formally crowned: A recap of the monarch's coronation day\n\nQueen Camilla looks regal: She is also crowned at King Charles III coronation\n\nPrince Harry: Royal attends but misses balcony palace moment\n\nPrince George, Princess Charlotte, Prince Louis: See the royal grandchildren on coronation day\n\nPrince Harry and Prince William: Look back their complicated relationship\n\nCoronation photos: See all the best photos from the ceremony and procession", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2015/03/17/usa-set-to-welcome-prince-charles-duchess-camilla/24847377/", "title": "Prince Charles, Duchess Camilla arrive in USA", "text": "Maria Puente\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThey're back.\n\nPrince Charles and his wife, Camilla Duchess of Cornwall, arrived in Washington, D.C, Tuesday evening for a four-day visit that also includes a day in Louisville, Ky.\n\nThey landed at Andrews Air Force Base at 6:30 p.m. and headed to the residence of British Ambassador Peter Westmacott for a reception with embassy staff and British media, according to the pool report.\n\nCharles, wearing a blue suit, and Camilla, wearing an ivory coat and dress outfit, her blond hair whipped by the wind, were greeted by Mark Walsh, the U.S. deputy chief of protocol, Col. Larry Riddick, and Ian Wiggins, a British Embassy official.\n\nTheir blue-and-white plane bore the American flag, the British flag and the Royal Standard.\n\nAt the ambassador's residence, head chef Craig Harnden showed reporters some of the tiny, tasty hors d'oevres: baby fish and chips, deviled quail eggs, cheese sticks and chicken liver parfait.\n\nEmbassy staffers were thrilled at mingling with the prince and duchess, who worked the room separately, shaking hands and talking to people individually, according to the pool report.\n\n\"It's wonderful to see how the royal family spends time with staff,\" said one staff member who like everyone at the event was not allowed to be quoted by name.\n\nCamilla's matching coat and dress was by British designer Bruce Oldfield, embassy officials said.\n\nThe couple's jammed schedule over the next two days includes a tête-à-tête with President Obama in the Oval Office, and historical-cultural-themed engagements aimed at the usual royal purpose when in America: Polishing the \"special relationship.\"\n\nLately, with the U.S. annoyed with Britain's ties to China and its reduction in military spending, the relationship is looking a little worn, analysts say. \"Our special relationship hangs by a thread,\" reported The Telegraph in January.\n\nTime to send in the royals. The Prince of Wales, the next king of the United Kingdom and second only to Queen Elizabeth II in rank, is making this visit at the request of the British government, and to highlight environmental and conservation projects close to his heart.\n\nIt's the 20th time Charles has visited the USA in an official capacity, and the third time for his wife. The royal couple, who celebrate their 10th wedding anniversary next month, first visited as a newlywed couple a few months after their controversial, and unprecedented, nuptials in April 2005 in Windsor.\n\nOn their first trip, Camilla, 67, was clearly nervous in the media glare, and still fending off her reputation as the \"most hated woman in Britain.\" Charles' first wife, the late Princess Diana, accused Camilla of ruining her marriage and many of her American loyalists agreed, greeting the newlyweds with jeers and nasty signs.\n\nBut a decade later, the British public have come around according to polling conducted for CNN, which aired a rare interview of Charles on Saturday night in advance of the trip.\n\nThe new poll found that opposition to Camilla eventually being called Queen — once as high as 73% — had dropped to 35%, and nearly one in four Brits said they liked her more now than they did 10 years ago.\n\nCharles spent most of the half-hour special declaring his love and praising her efforts to define her public role. \"You can imagine it is a real, real challenge,\" Charles said. \"But she's, I think, been brilliant in the way she's tackled these things.\"\n\nThis trip could provide a sign of whether American royal fans have changed their view of Camilla or remain indifferent to the couple.\n\nDespite their frequent worldwide travels on behalf of the Queen and their prodigious charity work, Charles and Camilla are often overshadowed by Charles' charismatic son and daughter-in-law, Prince William and Duchess Kate, and grandson Prince George, third-in-line to the throne.\n\nTheir schedule in Washington includes meeting with President Obama and Vice President Biden and also with congressional leaders on Thursday. They will attend multiple receptions and visit the Lincoln Memorial, Martin Luther King Jr., Memorial, a public charter school, Mount Vernon, the National Archives, the Armed Forces Retirement Home/Lincoln Cottage, the Shakespeare Theatre Company and a police sexual-assault response team.\n\nCharles will get a conservation award, attend a conference on reducing plastic in the oceans, and in Kentucky will give a speech on health and the environment at a health summit. They will attend an African-American cultural festival and also explore a food literacy project at a local farm.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/03/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2020/01/09/prince-harry-meghan-step-back-everything-you-need-to-know/2852615001/", "title": "Meghan Markle, Prince Harry step back: Why? How did the queen ...", "text": "Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan made waves Wednesday with an historic announcement that they would \"step back\" from their roles as senior members of the British royal family.\n\nThe royals said they intend to \"work to become financially independent while continuing to \"fully support\" his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II. . \"We now plan to balance our time between the United Kingdom and North America, continuing to honor our duty to The Queen, the Commonwealth, and our patronages,\" their statement said.\n\nBut what does that mean? We're answering all your burning questions about what could be next for the couple shaking things up in the royal family.\n\nWhy are Harry and Meghan 'stepping back'?\n\nThey haven't voiced exactly why. But the decision comes after the couple's vocal frustration with British media coverage of their family, including lawsuits against three British tabloids for alleged mistreatment, including copyright infringement, invasion of privacy and phone hacking.\n\nIn October, Prince Harry, 35, and Duchess Meghan, 38, appeared in ITV's documentary, \"Harry & Meghan: An African Journey,\" and opened up about their struggles coping with overwhelming and often critical media coverage. Harry also voiced his lingering resentment over how his mother, Princess Diana, was treated by the media before her 1997 death.\n\nMeghan, who at one point in the interview teared up, said she had tried and failed to acquire a traditional British \"stiff upper lip\" and regrets discounting her British friends' warnings and her own underestimation of British tabloids' zeal.\n\n“I never thought that this (media scrutiny) would be easy, but I thought it would be fair. And that’s the part that’s really hard to reconcile,” she said.\n\nWhat does Queen Elizabeth II have to say about Harry and Meghan's decision?\n\nAbout an hour after their announcement, another palace announcement, sent in an email from the office of the private secretary and the spokesperson for Queen Elizabeth II, landed in media inboxes. It suggested fraught times ahead.\n\n\"Discussions with The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are at an early stage,\" the statement said carefully. \"We understand their desire to take a different approach, but these are complicated issues that will take time to work through.\"\n\nThe 93-year-old monarch moved Thursday to take control of the situation. Britain’s national news agency, Press Association, reported that the queen had ordered officials representing the monarch, Charles, Prince William, and Harry and Meghan to meet and find \"workable solutions\" within \"days not weeks.\"\n\nHarry and Meghan wish Kate a happy birthday via Instagram after their decision to step back\n\nWhat does 'stepping back' as a senior royal entail?\n\nThe use of the term \"stepping back\" is the same phrase that was used by Prince Andrew in November when he announced he had gotten permission from the queen to \"step back from public duties for the foreseeable future\" amid scandal over his involvement with late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nHarry and Meghan haven't gotten into specifics on what their scaled-back roles will look like, though they still plan to focus on charity endeavors.\n\nAnd the move doesn't mean they stop being royal. Harry is sixth in line for the throne and that doesn't end with his announcement.\n\nThey also announced they'll break another longtime tradition and no longer participate in the palace's \"Royal Rota\" system of inviting long-standing U.K. outlets to report exclusively on their activities. Their new media policy will invite a wider array of \"credible media outlets focused on objective\" and \"appropriate\" coverage. They noted in a pointed message that they \"value privacy as individuals and as a family.\"\n\n\"The Duke and Duchess believe in a free, strong and open media industry, which upholds accuracy and fosters inclusivity, diversity and tolerance,\" the new Sussex Royal website states.\n\nWhat does it mean to be financially independent?\n\nThe Duke and Duchess say they're parting ways with the Sovereign Grant, money from British taxpayers that supports the queen and senior royals for public duties, that makes up 5% of the Sussex office's total costs.\n\nWhat will apparently continue: Money from Harry's father, Prince Charles, who has supported their private life and the other 95% of their office. And Meghan made plenty of money as an actress on \"Suits,\" while Harry inherited a considerable amount of money from his mother which has likely grown since 1997.\n\nThe couple also recently made headlines for publishing a trademark for their \"Sussex Royal\" brand, a move that could theoretically pave the way for Harry and Meghan merchandise. It could simply be a measure to block others from producing unofficial knockoff products, but it also gives the royals ample room to create branded items themselves.\n\nThe trademark covers a myriad of goods and services, including books, magazines, posters, apparel, charity campaigns, fundraisers, classes, training, sporting activities and counseling services.\n\nWhat are Harry and Meghan thinking? They don't want to be 'senior royals' anymore?\n\nWhere will Prince Harry and Meghan live?\n\nWe don't know yet. All their release said was they plan to split their time between the U.K. and North America. By North America, they could mean Canada or the U.S. (They're not likely to choose Mexico, also part of North America.) There are pros and cons to either country for the pair. Or, they could choose to spend time in both.\n\nWhile in the U.K., Harry, Meghan and baby Archie will still use Frogmore Cottage on the Windsor Castle estate as their official residence, though it will continue to be property of the queen, according to the Sussex website.\n\nWhen it comes to potential North American locations, Harry and Meghan have ties to both Los Angeles and Canada. L.A. is where Meghan's mother, Doria Ragland, lives. Canada, in addition to being one of the largest of the U.K.'s 53 Commonwealth nations, is where the Duchess spent seven years living in Toronto while acting on the TV show \"Suits.\" Canada is also where the Sussexes spent time off over the holiday break.\n\n\"This geographic balance will enable us to raise our son with an appreciation for the royal tradition into which he was born, while also providing our family with the space to focus on the next chapter, including the launch of our new charitable entity,\" the couple's statement said.\n\nDuchess Meghan's dad, celebrities and fans express shock over her, Harry's 'major' step back\n\nContributing: Cydney Henderson, The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2020/01/08/harry-meghan-were-stepping-back-senior-royals/2845950001/", "title": "Harry & Meghan: 'We're stepping back' as senior royals", "text": "Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan of Sussex came back from their time off with a big announcement: They're stepping down from their senior royal roles and plan to split their time between North America and the United Kingdom.\n\n\"We intend to step back as ‘senior’ members of the Royal Family and work to become financially independent, while continuing to fully support Her Majesty The Queen,\" the couple said in an announcement Wednesday issued by Buckingham Palace. \"We now plan to balance our time between the United Kingdom and North America, continuing to honor our duty to The Queen, the Commonwealth, and our patronages.\"\n\nIt was stunning news, even for the frequently surprising Sussexes. About an hour later, another palace announcement, sent in an email from the office of the private secretary and the spokesperson for Queen Elizabeth II, landed in media inboxes. It suggested fraught times ahead.\n\n\"Discussions with The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are at an early stage,\" the statement said carefully. \"We understand their desire to take a different approach, but these are complicated issues that will take time to work through.\"\n\nThe news didn't stop there.\n\nHarry and Meghan also published updates to their website Wednesday, including a bespoke media guide. They announced they will break another longtime tradition and no longer participate in the palace's \"Royal Rota\" system of inviting long-standing U.K. outlets to report exclusively on their activities.\n\nInstead, the website says, they intend to engage \"with grassroots media organisations and young, up-and-coming journalists\" and will invite \"specialist media\" to specific events.\n\nThey made no bones about their feelings toward the British media who consistently cover them.\n\n\"Britain’s Royal Correspondents are regarded internationally as credible sources of both the work of members of The Royal Family as well as of their private lives,\" their website reads. \"This misconception propels coverage that is often carried by other outlets around the world, amplifying frequent misreporting.\"\n\nWith interest hitting a crescendo, website briefly crashed late Wednesday.\n\nThe Sussex site further broke down their decision to become financially independent. They noted that though the publicly financed Sovereign Grant, which funds the monarchy, covers just 5% of the costs for the duke and duchess and is used for their official office expenses, \"their Royal Highnesses prefer to release this financial tie.\"\n\nThe couple stressed that public funding \"has never been used, nor would it ever be used for private expenditure,\" by Meghan and Harry, \"who also do not receive any tax privileges.\"\n\nAccording to the Sussex's website, Charles' Duchy of Cornwall supports 95% of Harry and Meghan's royal office costs. Harry and Meghan have their own resources as well: Harry inherited a substantial sum from his mother, Princess Diana's, estate and Meghan came into the marriage after a successful run as an actress on \"Suits.\"\n\nAnd their residence, aka the newly renovated Frogmore Cottage?\n\n\"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will continue to use Frogmore Cottage – with the permission of Her Majesty The Queen – as their official residence as they continue to support the Monarchy, and so that their family will always have a place to call home in the United Kingdom.\"\n\nThe Sussex Instagram announcement said Harry and Meghan were encouraged by their many supporters in Britain to make this move.\n\n\"It is with your encouragement, particularly over the last few years, that we feel prepared to make this adjustment,\" the statement said.\n\nAmerican-born Meghan, 38, has close family in California and close friends in Canada, so their desire to spend more time in North America suggests this plan might be designed to help her stay in touch with people on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\n\"This geographic balance will enable us to raise our son (8-month-old Archie) with an appreciation for the royal tradition into which he was born, while also providing our family with the space to focus on the next chapter, including the launch of our new charitable entity,\" the statement said.\n\n\"We look forward to sharing the full details of this exciting next step in due course, as we continue to collaborate with (Harry's grandmother) Her Majesty The Queen, (Harry's father) the Prince of Wales, (brother Prince William) the Duke of Cambridge and all relevant parties. Until then, please accept our deepest thanks for your continued support.”\n\nHarry, 35, and Meghan just returned to Britain after six weeks off at the end of 2019, following months of exasperation with coverage and widespread mocking in the media for such issues as their use of private planes while campaigning against climate change.\n\nBoth had expressed publicly, in media interviews, their unhappiness as the year wound down: He said he was in a \"different place\" from brother Prince William at the moment, and she lamented the unstinting media scrutiny. Both have filed lawsuits against major newspapers complaining about copyright violations and hacking.\n\n“I never thought that this (media scrutiny) would be easy, but I thought it would be fair,\" she told ITV in a film about their wildly successful 10-day tour of southern Africa with Archie.\n\nAll this angst was a dramatic change from the happy days following their May 2018 wedding at Windsor Castle, when the two were the toast of the United Kingdom and hailed as the future faces of the modern royal family.\n\nSoon after Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor was born last May, things took a different turn, at least in the royals-focused tabloids.\n\nIn November, the couple announced they were suspending their royal duties temporarily to take some \"family time,\" and would spend Christmas away from the royal family.\n\nAgain, Brits were shocked and some were peeved that the couple were turning away from the tradition of spending Christmas at Sandringham; in effect, some said, Harry and Meghan were snubbing the queen, even though the palace denied it.\n\nOn Wednesday, even their biggest fans were shocked and headed to the couple's popular Instagram page to say so.\n\n\"I don’t understand this. I mean Prince Harry never had any issues being apart of this family until recently. I mean you got to do what you got to do, but this is sad,\" wrote @emmylew0726.\n\nAlthough the palace never said precisely where they were, except that they would spend Christmas with her mother, Doria Ragland, it turned out they spent at least part of that time in Canada.\n\nOn Tuesday, the couple made their first public appearance since returning, visiting Canada House in London to thank Canadians for their \"warm hospitality\" during their stay.\n\nIt was perhaps a signal that the couple would spend at least some of their time in the future in this part of North America, as Canada is a major Commonwealth country where the royal family is popular. Meghan lived in Toronto for seven years while filming her TV series, \"Suits.\"\n\nAt the time of the couple's announcement about their Christmas plan, the palace said in an announcement that the queen was fine with it.\n\nIs she fine with this new plan as well?\n\nContributing: Andrea Mandell", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2023/07/24/mlb-trade-deadline-tracker-2023-will-shohei-ohtani-be-traded/70457296007/", "title": "MLB trade deadline tracker 2023: Latest news, deals, analysis", "text": "Editor's note: Follow the latest MLB trade deadline news, rumors and analysis from USA TODAY Sports here.\n\nAug. 1: Recapping deadline day moves\n\nAstros get RHP Justin Verlander from Mets\n\nOrioles get RHP Jack Flaherty from Cardinals\n\nDiamondbacks get OF Tommy Pham from Mets\n\nRangers get C Austin Hedges from Pirates\n\nMarlins get INF Jake Burger from White Sox\n\nBrewers get LHP Andrew Chafin from Diamondbacks\n\nPhillies get RHP Michael Lorenzen from Tigers\n\nBlue Jays get INF Paul DeJong from Cardinals\n\nPadres get LHP Rich Hill and 1B Ji-Man Choi from Pirates\n\nMarlins get 1B Josh Bell from Guardians for Jean Segura and Kahlil Watson\n\nRed Sox get INF Luis Urias from Brewers\n\nDodgers get LHP Ryan Yarbrough\n\nPadres get 1B Garrett Cooper from Marlins\n\nAngels get RP Dominic Leone from Mets\n\nPadres get RP Scott Barlow from Royals\n\nPhillies get INF Rodolfo Castros from Pirates for LHP Bailey Falter\n\nAug. 1: Braves add veteran depth to bullpen\n\nVeteran reliever Brad Hand is joining his ninth different MLB team, the Atlanta Braves announced on social media.\n\nHOT STOVE UPDATES: MLB free agency: Ranking and tracking the top players available.\n\nThe Braves acquired Hand, 33, from the Colorado Rockies in exchange for minor-league right-hander Alec Barger. He'll add depth to the Braves bullpen as they look toward the postseason.\n\nAug. 1: Royals acquire lefty Tucker Davidson\n\nThe Los Angeles Angels continue their flurry of deals, but in this particular case they're subtracting rather than adding. The Angels sent left-hander Tucker Davidson to the Kansas City Royals on Tuesday for cash considerations.\n\nDavidson joins the Royals' 40-man roster and will join the Royals as they begin a series on Tuesday against the New York Mets.\n\nJuly 31: Cubs go from sellers to buyers\n\nOnce thought to be looking to unload veterans Cody Bellinger and Marcus Stroman, the Chicago Cubs have reversed course as the deadline approaches.\n\nThe Cubs added third baseman Jeimer Candelario from the Washington Nationals in exchange for Class AA left-hander DJ Herz and 20-year-old shortstop prospect Kevin Made. Candelario, signed as a free agent by the Nationals this past offseason, is hitting a .258 with 53 RBI and 16 home runs.\n\nThe Cubs also landed right-handed reliever José Cuas from the Kansas City Royals for outfielder Nelson Velázquez, who has split time this season between Chicago and Class AAA Iowa.\n\nJuly 31: Outfielder A.J. Pollock headed to San Francisco\n\nThe San Francisco Giants acquired outfielder A.J. Pollock and utilityman Mark Mathias from the Seattle Mariners for cash or a player to be named later. While Pollock has been on the injured list with a strained hamstring, he's expected to be cleared to return on Tuesday.\n\nHe slashed .173/.225/.323 with five home runs in 138 plate appearances for the Mariners, but he has a lengthy history of success against left-handed pitchers. That should make him a good fit with the platoon-heavy Giants, who just lost outfielder Mike Yastrzemski to the injured list with a hamstring strain.\n\nJuly 31: A's, Reds make pitching swap\n\nThe Oakland Athletics and Cincinnati Reds have traded pitchers, with the A's adding minor-league right-hander Joe Boyle and the Reds getting southpaw Sam Moll and international pool money.\n\nMoll has appeared in 45 games for the A's this season, going 0-3 with a 4.54 ERA.\n\nBoyle had a 6-5 record and 4.50 ERA in 19 starts at Class AA Chattanooga.\n\nJuly 31: Brewers add to offense with veteran Mark Canha\n\nThe Milwaukee Brewers are strengthening their roster by adding outfielder/first baseman Mark Canha from the New York Mets. The Brewers are sending minor league pitcher Justin Jarvis to the Mets in exchange.\n\nCanha brings nine years of major league experience to the Brewers. He is hitting .245 with six home runs and 29 RBI in 89 games.\n\nJuly 31: Diamondbacks pick up closer Paul Sewald, infielder Jace Peterson\n\nIn contention for one of the NL wild-card spots, the Arizona Diamondbacks addressed their revolving door at the back end of their bullpen by acquiring closer Paul Sewald from the Seattle Mariners.\n\nSewald will give the D'backs bullpen some stability after posting a 2.93 ERA and 21 saves in 45 games for the Mariners. Arizona has had five different pitchers record saves this season, with none garnering more than nine.\n\nIn return, Seattle will get infielder Josh Rojas, infield prospect Ryan Bliss and outfielder Dominic Canzone.\n\nTo fill Rojas' utility role, the Diamondbacks made another deal with the Oakland A's, getting veteran Jace Peterson for minor league right-handed pitcher Chad Patrick.\n\nPeterson, a 10-year veteran, is hitting .221 with 28 RBI and six home runs. Patrick was the Diamondbacks' fourth-round pick in the 2021 draft. He is 4-7 with a 4.71 ERA in 19 starts for Class-AA Amarillo.\n\nJuly 31: Rays bolster rotation with veteran Aaron Civale\n\nTampa Bay Rays netted some much-needed rotation help by trading for right-hander Aaron Civale from the Cleveland Guardians. Civale has been outstanding over the past month, going 3-0 with a 1.45 ERA in six July starts. He won't be a free agent until after the 2024 season.\n\nThe addition didn't come cheaply, however. The Rays had to give up one of their top prospects in first baseman Kyle Manzardo, a left-handed hitter ranked No. 37 overall, according to MLB Pipeline. After zooming up prospect lists with a stellar 2022 season, Manzardo, 22, has struggled a bit at Class-AAA Durham, hitting .238 with a .442 slugging percentage, 11 home runs and 38 RBI.\n\nJuly 30: Braves pick up infielder Nicky Lopez\n\nThe Atlanta Braves added to their infield depth on Sunday by acquiring utilityman Nicky Lopez from the Kansas City Royals for left-hander Taylor Hearn.\n\nLopez, considered an above-average fielder at second base and shortstop, primarily gives Atlanta some late-inning defensive help. Lopez is hitting .210 in 67 games this season for the Royals, however he did hit .300 with a career-high 22 stolen bases for them in 2021.\n\nHearn, 28, was just acquired a week ago in a deal with Texas. He made one appearance for the Braves.\n\nJuly 30: Angels deal with Rockies for C.J. Cron, Randal Grichuk\n\nThe Los Angeles Angels continue to bolster their roster in what might be Shohei Ohtani's final season with the team. The Angels have reacquired slugger C.J. Cron and outfielder Randal Grichuk in a trade with the Colorado Rockies.\n\nThe Angels sent minor league pitchers Mason Albright and Jake Madden to the Rockies in the deal that brought two former Angels first-round draft picks back to the team.\n\nThe Angels have a major league-leading 17 players on their injured lists after outfielder Taylor Ward joined the group Sunday before their extra-inning victory in Toronto. Ward was moved to the 60-day injured list later in the day, effectively ending his regular season.\n\nJuly 30: Cardinals begin their fire sale\n\nIt has been more than 20 years since the St. Louis Cardinals have been sellers at the trade deadline, and as much as they may dread it, they sure are taking full advantage being a bullseye in a seller’s market.\n\nThe Cardinals traded closer Jordan Hicks to the Toronto Blue Jays and starter Jordan Montgomery and reliever Chris Stratton to the Texas Rangers on Sunday and came away with a slew of prized prospects.\n\nThey received the Blue Jays’ No. 7 prospect in Class AA starter Sem Robberse and fellow starter Adam Kloffenstein, their No. 18 prospect. They also picked up the Rangers’ No. 11 prospect (pitcher Tekoah Roby) No. 14 prospect (shortstop Thomas Saggese) and major-league left-handed pitcher John King. – Bob Nightengale\n\nJuly 29: Mets move one of their three-time Cy Young winners\n\nThe New York Mets took the field five months ago believing they were headed to the World Series with the biggest payroll in baseball history.\n\nWho could have imagined they’d turn around and engineer one of the quickest teardowns in baseball history?\n\nOn Saturday, the Mets traded three-time Cy Young winner Max Scherzer to the Texas Rangers for prized prospect Luisangel Acuña, and have opened trade talks with the Astros to send Justin Verlander back to Houston.\n\nThe deal, with the Mets covering all but $22.5 million owed to Scherzer, became official when Scherzer waived his no-trade clause and agreed to exercise his $43.3 million player option in 2024. – Bob Nightengale\n\nJuly 28: Dodgers land starter and an old friend from White Sox\n\nThe Dodgers continued their moves ahead of the deadline, agreeing to a deal with the White Sox for starting pitcher Lance Lynn and reliever Joe Kelly, who was with the team from 2019-2021 and won the World Series in 2020.\n\nLynn, 36, has been inconsistent this season, posting a 6.47 ERA in 21 starts and has surrendered an MLB-worst 28 home runs. He had been one of baseball's better starters for the past few years with a 3.42 ERA in 95 starts with the Rangers and White Sox from 2019-2022. He has an $18.5 million team option for 2024 with a $1 million buyout.\n\nKelly's return is another reunion in Chavez Ravine, days after the Dodgers traded for fellow 2020 champ Kiké Hernández. Los Angeles also traded starter Noah Syndergaard to the Guardians for infielder Amed Rosario on Wednesday.\n\nThe White Sox are set to receive prospects Nick Nastrini, Jordan Leasure and outfielder Trayce Thompson from the Dodgers.\n\nJuly 28: Astros bringing back reliever in White Sox firesale\n\nThe Astros bolstered their bullpen by making a trade with the White Sox for right-handed reliever Kendall Graveman, who spent part of 2021 in Houston.\n\nGraveman, 32, joined the Astros ahead of the 2021 trade deadline in a deal with the Mariners, ultimately helping Houston reach the World Series. He had a 3.48 ERA in 45 games for the White Sox this season, including eight saves, and is in the second season of his three-year, $24 million deal.\n\nRookie catcher Corey Lee, ranked by MLB.com as the Astros' No. 5 prospect, is heading to the White Sox in the deal.\n\nGraveman is the fifth pitcher traded by Chicago in recent days, joining Lance Lynn, Joe Kelly, Lucas Giolito and Reynaldo Lopez.\n\nJuly 28: Mets trade veteran reliever to NL East rival\n\nThe disappointing Mets shipped veteran reliever David Robertson to the Miami Marlins for prospects Marco Vargas (infield) and Ronald Hernandez (catcher).\n\nRobertson, 38, has 14 saves on the season and is sporting a 2.05 ERA. He figures to boost the Marlins' bullpen as Miami battles for a wild card berth.\n\nJuly 27: Brewers land veteran first baseman from Pirates\n\nIn an attempt to bolster its lineup for the stretch run, NL Central division-leading Milwaukee picked up veteran first baseman Carlos Santana from the Pirates.\n\nIn return, Pittsburgh will be getting infielder Jhonny Severino, an 18-year-old infielder who signed with the Brewers last year as an international prospect from the Dominican Republic.\n\nSantana, who will be a free agent at the end of the season, is hitting .235 with a .321 on-base percentage and .412 slugging. He ranked first on the Pirates in RBI (53) and second on the team in home runs (12).\n\nThe Brewers lead the division by just 1.5 games over the Reds, whom they've beaten seven out of nine times since July 7.\n\nJuly 26: Angels acquire two pitchers in trade with White Sox\n\nIn a move that strongly suggests Shohei Ohtani isn't going anywhere, the Angels acquired pitchers Lucas Giolito and Reynaldo Lopez from the White Sox for two of their top three prospects (catcher Edgar Quero and pitcher Ky Bush).\n\nGiolito, a free agent after this season, has a 3.79 ERA in 20 starts this season and has been one of baseball's most consistent starters in recent years with a 3.85 ERA since 2019.\n\nJuly 26: Dodgers acquire shortstop in trade with Guardians\n\nThe Dodgers made a move to bolster their infield, acquiring shortstop Amed Rosario from Cleveland for pitcher Noah Syndergaard and cash considerations.\n\nRosario entered Wednesday slashing .265/.306/.369 on the season. Syndergaard, a one-time All-Star back in 2016, has struggled this season; he's gone 1-4 in 12 starts and is sporting a 7.16 ERA. He hasn't appeared in a game since June 7.\n\nJuly 26: Contending Twins, Marlins swap relief pitchers\n\nThe Minnesota Twins acquired Dylan Floro from the Miami Marlins in exchange for Jorge López on Wednesday in a swap of struggling right-handed relievers on contending teams.\n\nFloro is an eight-year big league veteran with a career 3.32 ERA, but the 32-year-old is 3-5 with a 4.54 ERA and seven saves this season.\n\nLópez was an All-Star in 2022 with Baltimore before being traded to Minnesota at the August trade deadline and has went 3-2 with a 5.09 ERA in 37 relief appearances for the Twins this season. He returned from the 15-day injured list earlier this month after stepping away to address his mental health.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nJuly 25: Dodgers bring back Kiké Hernández in trade with Red Sox\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers are reuniting with an old playoff hero in hopes of shoring up several spots on their roster.\n\nKiké Hernández, whose six years with the Dodgers included a pennant-clinching three-homer performance in the 2017 National League Championship Series and one of the biggest hits in their run to the 2020 World Series title, has been traded by the Boston Red Sox to the Dodgers in exchange for two minor-league pitchers.\n\nThe Red Sox needed to move a body or two with the imminent return of shortstop Trevor Story from elbow surgery. So the Dodgers decided to take a chance that they can rehab the performance of yet another veteran - this one they're all too familiar with. − Gabe Lacques\n\nJuly 24: Braves acquire RPs Pierce Johnson, Taylor Hearn\n\nThe Atlanta Braves picked up a pair of bullpen arms for the stretch drive by getting a part-time closer in Johnson from the Colorado Rockies and veteran left-hander Hearn from the Texas Rangers.\n\nBoth will give the Braves additional pitching depth, but perhaps even more important, both have minor-league options remaining, which will give Atlanta additional roster flexibility.\n\nThe Braves sent a pair of minor league pitchers to Colorado for the 32-year-old Johnson, who has a 1-5 record and 6.00 ERA with 13 saves for the Rockies this season.\n\nHearn, 28, arrives for cash considerations from Texas after posting a 10.29 ERA in seven innings with the Rangers, but a 3.66 ERA and 54 strikeouts in 39 1/3 innings at Class AAA Round Rock (Texas).", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/24"}]}

Muslims refrain from eating pork.\n\nIslamic Center of Murfreesboro has been the center of controversy for nearly a decade. The ICM was formerly housed in a small facility and in May 2010, a Rutherford County judge approved construction for a new center.\n\nA contingency of community members took the matter to court to halt construction and the ICM became embroiled in a legal battle.\n\nHowever, ICM opened the current facility on Aug. 10, 2012. The 12,000-square-foot center will become part of a 53,000-square-foot facility complete with athletic fields. Currently there is a basketball court as well as a picnic pavilion and playground on the grounds.\n\nJavier Alan Correa from Corpus Christi, Texas, was indicted in June 2012 for phoning in a bomb threat to the ICM on Sept. 5, 2011.\n\nIn 2010, the congregation also experienced vandalism to two signs announcing the 15-acre property as being the future home of the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro. The first time a tagger spray-painted \"Not Welcome\" on the first sign in January 2010 before the ICM requested a site plan approval from Rutherford County Regional Planning Commission.\n\nThe congregation put up another sign about a month later. After planners unanimously voted in favor of the mosque plans on May 24, 2010, a vandal cut in half the second sign in June 2010.\n\nIn August 2010, federal agents were called to the ICM after someone poured flammable liquid on four pieces of construction equipment and ignited them at the site. The case was ruled an arson, according to Rutherford County officials.\n\nAt least $4,000 in cash donations were stolen from the ICM on July 6, 2016, after the mosque's celebration of Eid al-Fitr, a holiday that marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan.\n\nHate crimes have not stopped the Murfreesboro Muslim community from doing acts of kindness throughout the community. Each year the Murfreesboro Muslim Youth do various service projects, including donating food to local homeless shelters as well as giving funds to charities.\n\n“We hope that this incident is not a setback to all the progress we have made in our community since the opposition we faced when we built our new facility, just a few years ago. We are certain that this incident will reinforce our unity and will not negatively impact our beautiful city and county,” said Sbenaty, chair of the Outreach Committee at the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro and an American Muslim Advisory Council Board member.\n\nFollow Nancy De Gennaro on Twitter: @NanDeGennaro.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/07/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/07/us/power-outage-moore-county-investigation-wednesday/index.html", "title": "Moore County power: Investigators are zeroing in on 2 possible ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nInvestigators – who have found nearly two dozen shell casings from a high-powered rifle – are zeroing in on two threads of possible motives centered around extremist behavior for the weekend assault on two North Carolina electric substations, according to law-enforcement sources briefed on the investigation.\n\nThe news comes as the primary utility company in Moore County restored electricity to the final customers of the 45,000 homes and businesses that initially lost power.\n\nOfficials on Wednesday also announced a total of $75,000 in reward money for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or people responsible for Saturday’s attacks.\n\nOne thread involves the writings by extremists on online forums encouraging attacks on critical infrastructure. The second thread looks at a series of recent disruptions of LGBTQ+ events across the nation by domestic extremists.\n\nThe FBI and the NC State Bureau are assisting in the investigation.\n\ninvestigators have no evidence connecting the North Carolina attacks to a drag event at the theater in the same county, but the timing of two events are being considered in context with the growing tensions and armed confrontations around similar LBGTQ+ events across the country, the sources told CNN.\n\nIn the past two years, anti-government groups began using online forums to urge followers to attack critical infrastructure, including the power grid. They have posted documents and even instructions outlining vulnerabilities and suggesting the use of high-powered rifles.\n\nOne 14-page guide obtained by CNN cited as an example the 2013 sniper attack on a high voltage substation at the edge of Silicon Valley that destroyed 17 transformers and cost Pacific Gas and Electric $15 million in repairs.\n\nIn that case, the shooter fired more than 100 bullets in about 20 minutes, disappearing a minute before police arrived. The case remains unsolved.\n\nWhile investigators haven’t found a rifle in the North Carolina shootings, the casings still could offer critical evidence. A law enforcement source told CNN that the caliber of the bullets in the California incident is different from those used in North Carolina.\n\nInvestigators are taking into consideration that the timing of Moore County shootings – 7 p.m. on a Saturday night – coincided with the time a drag performance sponsored by the local LBGTQ+ community began, according to the sources. Audience members used their phone flashlights to light the stage for one last song, but after that the performance couldn’t continue due to the power outage, according to Sandhills PRIDE.\n\nOfficials have said the gunfire, which left much of the county without electricity for days, were a “malicious” and “intentional” attack. The two substations are about 10 miles apart.\n\nNo suspects in the outages have been announced.\n\nSheriff Ronnie Fields has said whoever fired at the substations “knew exactly what they were doing.” No group “has stepped up to acknowledge or accept they’re the ones who (did) it,” the sheriff said Sunday.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning there were 35,000 customers without power, but that number had decreased to 1,200 by the time a 4 p.m. news conference began, according to Duke Energy spokesperson Jeff Brooks. A few hours later the company’s website showed zero outages in the area.\n\nGiven the information, county officials said a nightly curfew will end for good at 5 a.m. Thursday.\n\nShell casings and bullets offer clues\n\nBullets recovered from the sites, and the brass shell casings found a short distance away, are the few pieces of physical evidence that investigators have.\n\nBecause of the heat generated in a high-powered rifle’s chamber during rapid fire, fingerprints are burned away – and nearly impossible to recover from spent casings. Still, the brass may offer valuable clues.\n\nInvestigators can enter the casings into the National Integrated Ballistic Information Network, a database from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The database records three-dimensional images of shell casings and can match them to any other shell casings that may have been fired by the same gun at another crime scene or to the gun if the weapon is recovered.\n\nThe spot where the casings were found can give investigators a way to pinpoint the firing positions. Knowing where the shooter fired from could lead to discoveries such as shoe prints and tire tracks.\n\nResidents head to shelter for hot food and showers\n\nFor now, schools are closed through Thursday, many stores and restaurants are shut, homes are without heating or running refrigerators, drivers are traversing intersections with no traffic lights.\n\nNakasha Jackson, who came to the shelter to pick up some hot food, said the outage has been difficult with her 1-year-old child. CNN\n\nA Red Cross-run emergency shelter was set up at the Moore County Sports Complex to help provide shelter, food, showers and other services to people impacted. It will remain as a shelter through noon on Thursday, officials said.\n\nNakasha Jackson, who came to the shelter to pick up some hot food, said the outage has been difficult for her 1-year-old child.\n\n“No lights, no power, can’t really do nothing. The kid is scared of the dark,” she told CNN.\n\nJackson said sometimes she has to travel up to an hour one way to buy food. “It’s ridiculous. It should never have been done,” Jackson said.\n\nResidents who rely on electricity-powered medical equipment have also seen their lives upended. One woman told CNN she came to the shelter because she had no power for her CPAP machine at night.\n\nAfter two days of sleeping without it, she said she began to feel ill and came into the shelter for help.\n\nOthers have sought shelter fearing for their safety as they struggled to keep their homes warm.\n\n“It’s different. It’s kind of hard to sleep, you know. But at the end of the day, I’d rather be somewhere where it’s warm, where we have food, where we’re taken care of than to be somewhere it’s freezing cold,” said Amber Sampson.\n\nOn top of having to stay at the shelter, Sampson hasn’t been able to work since Sunday after her employer also lost power – an issue that could end up costing her hundreds of dollars.\n\nAuthorities have expressed anger over the attack, with Carol Haney, mayor of Southern Pines – a town of about 15,900 residents that completely lost power – calling it a cruel and selfish act.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper voiced concern over businesses and residents in nursing homes.\n\n“When we look at all the money that’s being lost by businesses here at Christmastime, when we look at threats to people in nursing homes having lost power, hospitals having to run off generators and not being able to do certain kinds of operations at this point – all of those are deep concerns here, and we can’t let this happen,” the Democrat told CNN on Tuesday.\n\n“This was a malicious, criminal attack on the entire community.”", "authors": ["John Miller Steve Almasy Whitney Wild", "John Miller", "Steve Almasy", "Whitney Wild"], "publish_date": "2022/12/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/11/04/anti-jewish-muslim-attacks-rising-across-the-u-s-colleges/71457844007/", "title": "Jewish and Muslim organizations denounce attacks against college ...", "text": "American colleges have reported a surge in crimes that appeared to target Jewish and Muslim people as the war between Israel and Hamas moved into its fourth week.\n\nSeveral colleges, from the San Francisco Bay Area to Upstate New York, have seen antisemitic and Islamophobic incidents that prompted politicians and civil rights organizations to speak out about students feeling vulnerable on campuses.\n\n\"Let me be clear: we cannot allow hate and intimidation to become normalized,\" New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a statement Tuesday after a Cornell University student was accused of making antisemitic threats at the Ithaca, New York, campus. \"As Governor, I reaffirm that there is zero tolerance in New York for antisemitism, Islamophobia, or hate of any kind, and it’s critical we deploy every possible state resource to keep New Yorkers safe.\"\n\nHigh-profile incidents under investigation at American universities\n\nThe targeted threats being investigated by officials at campuses around the country include the following.\n\nTense debates:Israel-Hamas war stirs free-speech battles at college campuses across US\n\nJewish, Muslim organizations denounce attacks against college students\n\nNonprofit and activist organizations for Jewish and Muslim students have condemned the attacks, harassment and intimidation of students since the conflict broke out on Oct. 7.\n\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations’ Maryland office said in an Oct. 11 statement the organization is concerned about Muslim and Arab students reporting more harassment and intimidation incidents as the crisis overseas continues. The organization pleaded with college and high school administrators to devote attention and take action to protect these students and investigate all reports of targeted attacks or threats.\n\n“In this politically-charged environment, many Muslim and Arab students feel increasingly vulnerable and targeted because of their diverse identities,” said CAIR’s Maryland director Zainab Chaudry.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League, a civil rights organization focused on addressing acts of hate and antisemitism, issued a statement on Oct. 25 with the Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law, urging universities to investigate their chapters of Students for Justice in Palestine to see whether they are possibly supporting a terrorist organization.\n\n“If universities do not check the activities of their SJP chapters, they may be violating their Jewish students’ legal rights to be free of harassment and discrimination on campus,” the statement read.\n\nNational Students for Justice in Palestine previously told USA TODAY in an Oct. 18 statement it is troubled by how the ADL has labeled its organization and student chapters. They added the league is “pro-Israel before anything else” and linked part of the statement to a 2019 opinion piece by the magazine Jewish Current on the ADL.\n\n“As for the ADL labeling our organization antisemitic: they have zero credibility to decide what is and isn't antisemitic,” National Students for Justice in Palestine said. “ADL director Jonathan Greenblatt has claimed that anti-Zionism – opposition to Zionism, a political project of the late 19th century – is equivalent to antisemitism.”\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union responded to the ADL’s letter, sending a similar letter to hundreds of colleges and universities, urging leaders to reject calls to investigate pro-Palestine student groups “for exercising their free speech rights.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/05/us/us-power-grid-attack-north-carolina-extremist-terrorism/index.html", "title": "Attacks on US power grid have been subject of extremist chatter for ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAttacks on the United States’ power grid have been the subject of extremist chatter for some time, notably ticking up in 2020, the same year a 14-page how-to on low tech attacks, including assaulting power grids with guns, circulated amongst extremist communication channels.\n\nA Department of Homeland Security bulletin reported by CNN just days before a weekend attack on a North Carolina substation indicated there was a heightened threat posed by domestic violent extremists in the US against targets including critical infrastructure.\n\nThe electric grid has been described as an “attractive target” for domestic violent extremists in US, CNN reported earlier this year, citing an intelligence report.\n\nIn 2020, intelligence analysts saw major uptick in online chatter focused on attacking the power grid.\n\nNotably in 2020, a 14-page document released in a Telegram channel favored by accelerationists groups seeking to speed the overthrow of the US government featured a white supremacist instruction guide to low-tech attacks meant to bring chaos, including how to attack a power grid with guns.\n\nThe document has been cited by DHS officials and was obtained by CNN.\n\n“The powergrid would be crippled for a very large area. Armor piercing rounds shot into the transformers would destroy them,” the colorful how-to describes.\n\nThe writer goes on to frame how massive blackouts would aid in the toppling of society which is a key accelerationist goal.\n\n“But with the power off, when the lights don’t come back on… all hell will break lose, making conditions desirable for our race to once again take back what is ours,” the document reads.\n\nSeveral unique attempts to attack various grids have been cited by intelligence officials that analyze these specific threats.\n\nInvestigators discovered a four-rotor drone on July 16, 2020 in Pennsylvania recovered from the roof of a power station, according to a DHS bulletin in October 2021.\n\nThe drone had nylon cords that dangled below holding a two-foot section of copper wire, and the investigative theory is that the drone was to hover over the live high-voltage wires, then make contact with the lines with copper wire it dangled and short-out the station, according to the intelligence briefing.\n\nCNN reported earlier this year that In May 2020, three people claiming to be Boogaloo adherents allegedly conspired to attack an electrical substation in Las Vegas as part of an attempt to incite riots and violence amid demonstrations in the city.\n\nThe suspects were charged with conspiracy to damage and destroy by fire and explosives and with possession of unregistered firearms.\n\nA DHS bulletin reported by CNN just days ago indicated there was a heightened threat posed by domestic violent extremists in the United States, against in part, critical infrastructure targets.\n\nOn November 30th, DHS renewed a national bulletin warning that lone offenders and small groups motivated by a range of ideological beliefs and personal grievances pose a lethal threat to the US.\n\nThe advisory said in part “DHS maintained that potential targets include but are not limited to public gatherings, faith-based institutions, the LGBTQIA+ community, schools, racial and religious minorities, government facilities and personnel, US critical infrastructure, the media and perceived ideological opponents.”\n\nThe unsolved case of the attack on the Metcalf Pacific Gas and Electric substation in Coyote, California, on April 16, 2013 set the bar for these types of attacks and has been a case study for intelligence officials\n\nAccording to several in person briefings on this attack, two underground vaults were entered where fiber-optic cables were cut breaking down phone and internet service for much of the area.\n\nShortly after, at 1 a.m., over a hundred rounds fired at the station by snipers hit key transformers and an oil drum that caused 52,000 gallons of oil meant to cool the high voltage transformers to leak\n\nThe plant overheated causing an alarm to go off. Authorities believe the timing suggests they may have been monitoring the police radio because they had been firing for almost twenty minutes before leaving.\n\nThe vulnerabilities of the power grid have been closely examined by the Department of Energy, DHS and Congress.\n\nAccording to the National Research Council, tasked by Congress to examine these vulnerabilities, the US grid consists of 6,400 power plants, 55,000 substations, 450,000 miles of transmission lines, and 3,000 companies.", "authors": ["John Miller"], "publish_date": "2022/12/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/17/us/antisemitic-graffiti-maryland-high-school/index.html", "title": "Antisemitic graffiti found at Maryland high school | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nPolice responded to reports of antisemitic graffiti at a Maryland high school on Saturday, school officials and police say.\n\nGraffiti reading “Jews Not Welcome” was discovered spray-painted on a sign outside Walt Whitman High School in Bethesda, Maryland, just outside Washington, DC, according to the school’s principal.\n\nThis is the second time in just over a month that antisemitic vandalism has been discovered in Maryland’s Montgomery County, according to police. In mid-November, Bethesda Trolley Trail, a local recreation trail, was also vandalized.\n\nIn a written statement, Montgomery County Police Department Chief Marcus Jones said officers responded to the scene just after 8 a.m. ET and are investigating the incident and have coordinated with the Anti-Defamation League.\n\n“Acts of hate and bigotry are on the rise across the country and in Montgomery County,” Marcus wrote. “Officers are also actively increasing patrols to include community centers, schools, and places of worship throughout the county.”\n\nPolice said they are working to obtain potential photos of any suspects but no one is in custody.\n\nIn a letter to the school community, Walt Whitman High School Principal Robert Dodd confirmed that the words “Jews Not Welcome” were written on the school sign. CNN journalists at the scene noted the graffiti had been washed away and was illegible by Saturday afternoon.\n\n“This behavior is abhorrent, extremely hurtful, and will not be tolerated at Walt Whitman High School,” Dodd wrote.\n\nThe school will use the incident as an opportunity to continue education around antisemitism and “celebrating our diverse community,” the principal added.

At least eight of the incidents in Arizona happened in schools. Six of the 2017 incidents are classified as vandalism.\n\n\"The sharp rise was due in part to a significant increase in incidents in schools and on college campuses, which nearly doubled for a second year in a row,\" according to the ADL's website.\n\nBayless Feldman said she urged the school to reach out to the Anti-Defamation League so it could record the vandalism at Camelback High in its 2018 audit. She said did not believe her daughters were targeted by the perpetrators in this case, but added that they've been targeted in school before for being Jewish.\n\nBayless Feldman said In one case, when one daughter was in the eighth grade, a student started placing pennies on the floor by the girl to see whether she would pick them up, implying an anti-Semitic stereotype.\n\nAnother daughter said a student played a Hitler speech as a joke when she walked into a room. When a friend pointed out that playing the speech wasn't funny, the student apologized, Bayless Feldman said.\n\nShe hopes learning moments like those will prevail — and that other Camelback High parents will talk to their kids about the drawings.\n\n\"I hope parents tell their kids, 'Help out the people who are potentially being targeted,' \" Bayless Feldman said. \"If it’s your friends doing this, be strong and tell them it’s not OK.\"\n\nOther instances of anti-Semitism\n\nSeveral instances of anti-Semitic vandalism marked last year.

His death led to scores of policing reforms some now predict will be undermined by a law enforcement approach that largely targets communities of color. Floyd’s fatal police encounter started with a 911 call about a counterfeit $20 bill used to buy a pack of cigarettes.\n\n“A lot of the quality-of-life offenses that communities are complaining about they don’t know who else to call but the cops,” said Jennvine Wong, a staff attorney with The Legal Aid Society’s Cop Accountability Project in New York.\n\n“Our society has been conditioned to call the cops for every single issue when we shouldn’t necessarily be doing that… We throw the cops at everything, which means they are now expected to do more and be more and wear more hats – many of which they are not able to or qualified to do.”\n\n‘You’re not going to just do whatever you want’\n\nNYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell on Wednesday unveiled an initiative to reduce shootings and thefts, as well as quality-of-life offenses such as drinking on the streets, loud parties in public spaces and driving with suspended or revoked licenses.\n\nSewell and Mayor Eric Adams insist the strategy is not a return to a broken windows policy that helped spur another controversial NYPD practice known as stop-and-frisk – which was ruled unconstitutional nearly a decade ago for unlawfully targeting Blacks and Latinos.\n\n“To be clear, this is not a return to ‘Stop, Question, and Frisk’ – nor is it ‘policing for numbers,’ ” Sewell said in a statement. “This enforcement will be responsive to community complaints and concerns.”\n\nJeff Asher, a crime analyst who co-founded Datalytics, which evaluates criminal justice data, said studies have shown more aggressive policing to be ineffective in reducing violent crime.\n\n“We’ve learned that stop and frisk is not the answer, that violence reduction can happen independent of that, and we saw that in New York over many years,” he said. “So as far as … data providing credence that we should have more of those policies, I don’t think there’s any evidence of that.”\n\nThe NYPD said that since 2019, calls about drinking on the street more than doubled to 3,193 from 1,452, while calls about loud parties in public spaces jumped to 9,013 from 3,338.\n\nReports of people with knives in the transit system have increased 139% in the same time period, according to the NYPD. Calls about subway drug sales jumped by 71%.\n\n“You’re not going to walk into Duane Reade and take whatever you want and walk out,” Adams said. “You’re not going to hop over the counter and take codeine and other drugs… You’re not going to drive motorcycles through the streets, pulling people out and assaulting them merely because of a traffic accident. You’re not going to openly inject yourself with drugs. You’re not going to just do whatever you want in the city.”\n\n‘We won’t go back to abusive policing’\n\nWhen major crimes in New York City spiked nearly 60% in February compared to the same month in 2021, Adams announced a plan to combat gun violence, crime and homelessness in the subways. Advocates accused the city of criminalizing homelessness.\n\nCrime in New York reached historic lows over the past three decades before numbers started to go up in 2020 – a trend that has continued over the last two years and mirrors what is happening in big cities around the country.\n\nPart of the mayor’s response was to bring back the NYPD’s controversial anti-crime unit, which was disbanded in August 2020 following racial justice protests and unrest across the country. The unit has been rebranded as Neighborhood Safety Teams tasked with patrolling high-crime neighborhoods.\n\nOn Monday, after another weekend plagued by gun violence, Adams announced the deployment of five additional Neighborhood Safety Teams (NST) across the city. They will work with patrol officers in a more proactive role expanding duties beyond 911 calls.\n\nThe first plainclothes teams, the mayor said, were deployed a week earlier and conducted more than 30 arrests in neighborhoods with 80% of the city’s gun violence. Ten of those arrests were for gun possession. The others involved drug sales, suspended or revoked licenses and criminal possession of a knife.\n\nAdams, a former NYPD lieutenant, insisted this week that the NYPD is not resurrecting the broken windows approach but bolstering public safety while ensuring civil liberties.\n\n“We are not going back to the policing that I fought to change,” said Adams, noting that video technology will be used to monitor the behavior of officers.\n\n“We won’t go back to abusive policing,” he added.\n\nPatrick Lynch, president of the Police Benevolent Association, the union representing rank-and-file members of the NYPD, voiced support.\n\n“We will do our part to confront these quality-of-life issues,” Lynch said in a statement. “Our communities have been pleading with us to put an end to the lawlessness.”\n\n‘Association between urban blight and crime’\n\nMiami Beach imposed a midnight spring break curfew after two shootings left five people injured. Courtesy Mitch Novick\n\nOther cities around the country also are dealing with not only the third year of a pandemic but also responding to the deadly crisis of gun violence.\n\nIn Detroit, Police Chief James White this week released a 244-page community safety strategy in response to an increase in violent crime that jumped 13% in 2020 compared to the previous year. In 2021, violent crime increased by just 3%, according to the police department.\n\nThe goal of the plan is to reduce violent crime by 10% in part by focusing on quality-of-life issues such as large, loud gatherings and public consumption of drugs and alcohol. The department will also use body-worn cameras to monitor the interactions of officers with the public.\n\n“There is an association between urban blight and crime, including violent crime,” the document said. “We want to continue reducing violent crime in neighborhoods by closely monitoring vacant lots and abandoned or neglected buildings.”\n\nIn Miami Beach, the city commission voted on Tuesday to impose a curfew during spring break this weekend. Some nighttime alcohol sales were banned. The dramatic move and emergency order came after five people were injured in two shootings on Miami Beach’s iconic Ocean Drive last weekend.\n\n“I’m at my wit’s end trying to figure out how to be able to deal with this crowd, with the numbers that are here, and with what we are encountering during the policing of this particular event,” Miami Beach Police Chief Richard Clements told commissioners at an emergency meeting.\n\nSince the spring break season began in February, nine officers have been injured in some capacity, Clements said.\n\nAsher, the crime analyst, questioned the strategy.\n\n“Instituting a curfew is unlikely to have much of an effect on violence,” he said. “You’re basically removing witnesses, removing people from the streets. If you have a curfew it plausibly could lead to more crime and more shootings because people feel freer to act more brazen. There’s little evidence that something like a curfew is going to have an effect.”\n\n‘We’ve tried this before’\n\nAsher said homicides have risen more than 5% in 99 US cities so far this year – to 1,313 compared to 1,248 during the same period in 2021. But he cautioned against drawing conclusions from the numbers in March, noting that the summer and fall data provide a clearer picture of the national trend.\n\n“It is clear the police can curb violence in the short run or crime in the short run,” said Cornell University criminal justice expert Jamein Cunningham. “But then the question is at what cost? That’s the policy question. I don’t think we have a really good answer.”\n\nCunningham and other experts acknowledge that policing aimed at high-crime areas is effective in the short term. But they warn of high costs from further straining relations with communities of color while ignoring social services and neighborhood programs.\n\nWong, the Legal Aid attorney, said a return of more confrontational practices, particularly in marginalized communities, undermines the reforms and other small gains brought about by the protest movement after Floyd’s death.\n\n“We’re coming off the heels of nationwide protests calling for police accountability for police brutality,” she said.\n\n“Many of those encounters were because of broken windows policing… You never see a police department apply broken windows policing to themselves when it comes to accountability and transparency for their own misconduct. We’ve tried this before.

The video has been viewed millions of times.\n\nHere is what you need to know about the trial, vehicle thefts and reckless driving in Milwaukee.\n\nWho are the \"Kia Boyz\"?\n\nMilwaukee has long had a reckless-driving problem — but in 2021, police and other officials began focusing on a troubling new angle: people as young as 12 years old stealing cars and using them for joyriding and driving dangerously.\n\nAt the time, Ald. Michael Murphy said it is not uncommon for law enforcement to find children between the ages of 12 and 14 in stolen cars as many as four separate times.\n\nIn late 2021, some began using the hashtags #theKiaboys and #Kiaboyz to post videos of themselves driving on sidewalks at MPS schools, running red lights, and leading police on high-speed chases.\n\nOthers videos also demonstrate a method to easily gain entry to Kia and Hyundai automobiles and steal them.\n\nThe Kia Boyz videos spread across social media and led to skyrocketing car thefts in the city and similar trends popping up in cities around the country.\n\nMore:It only took two minutes for our daughter to become Milwaukee's 1,544th car theft victim of 2022\n\nMarkell Hughes charged after Kia Boys video got millions of views\n\nMarkell Hughes, now 18, of Milwaukee, was identified as one of the participants in a \"Kia Boys\" documentary-style video that has been viewed 6 million times on YouTube.\n\nThe roughly 16-minute video, released May 31, 2022, follows a host called \"Tommy G\" as he spends time with \"Kia Boys\" in Milwaukee.\n\nThe video, filmed on May 17, 2022, shows a red car driving erratically and, at times, coming close to striking pedestrians. Police said the vehicle was a 2021 Hyundai Elantra, rented from Hertz, that was reported stolen on May 17 in Oak Creek, according to a criminal complaint.\n\nA couple weeks later, police said they received an anonymous tip that the driver of the red Hyundai was Hughes.\n\nHughes was arrested June 9 after police say he attempted to flee from officers. He admitted on June 10 to being the driver of the vehicle, according to police.\n\nMore:Criminal charges filed against a participant of the 'Kia Boys' video. He could face 22 years in prison.\n\nHughes will be tried on two separate cases\n\nHughes has two separate, unrelated cases against him.

A manufacturing glitch makes it easy for these cars to be stolen using just a couple household items.\n\nThe two car companies began providing free steering wheel locks to owners through the Milwaukee Police Department.\n\nBoth car companies also vowed to make an anti-theft system called “engine immobilizers” standard in new vehicles.\n\nEarlier this year, Kia and Hyundai announced they will provide a theft deterrent software update for millions of their vehicles that lack an engine immobilizer.\n\nTwo class-action lawsuits have been filed in Wisconsin against the automakers, citing the vehicles lacking immobilizers that prevent vehicles from starting without a code from a smart key.\n\nMore:Motor vehicle thefts in Milwaukee are up 152%.

Manufacturers that supply lock cases and devices to chain stores have seen their businesses boom.\n\nWalgreens and Rite Aid have said that the problem of organized retail crime – rings of criminals that steal products from stores and then often resell them on online marketplaces – is causing them to lock more products up and close some stores.\n\nEven toothpaste is locked up these days. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nLocking up their shelves is a last resort for stores, but it has never been more widely practiced. It’s also become a growing irritation for shoppers and a source of frustration for some employees who must walk around the store with keys at the ready.\n\n“It’s extremely discouraging to customers,” said Paco Underhill, the founder of behavioral research and consulting firm Envirosell. “It is a brutal experience for the merchant, too.”\n\nThe reason why stores resort to locking up these products is simple: to prevent shoplifting. But these decisions are far more nuanced and fraught for stores than you may think. Companies must walk a delicate line between protecting their inventory and creating stores that customers don’t dread visiting.\n\nShoplifting in America\n\nUntil the early 20th century, locking up products was the norm. When customers visited a store, clerks would provide them with the items they wanted from behind a counter.\n\nThis changed as the first self-service stores like Piggly Wiggly in the early 20th century discovered they could sell more goods and reduce their costs by spreading out merchandise on an open sales floor.\n\nWhile having fewer workers in the store increased profits for chains in recent decades, it has left stores in some cases without as many visible personnel to deter shoplifting, crime prevention experts say.\n\nShoppers have become all too familiar with ringing a store worker to open a locked product. Lindsey Nicholson/Universal Images Group/Getty Images\n\nShoplifting has been around for centuries, but it “came of age in America in 1965,” author Rachel Shteir writes in “The Steal: A Cultural History of Shoplifting.” The FBI in 1965 reported that it had jumped 93% in the prior five years and “was the nation’s fastest-growing form of larceny.”\n\nThree years later, officials around the country said there had been an additional surge in young teenagers shoplifting. The trend became part of the counterculture, as exemplified by Abbie Hoffman’s 1971 “Steal This Book.”\n\nIn response, an anti-shoplifting industry and corporate “loss prevention” (LP) and “asset protection” (AP) teams sprang up. Technologies also emerged such as closed-circuit TV cameras, electronic article surveillance and anti-theft tags.\n\n‘Hot products’\n\nStores look to protect “the vital few” products that are most profitable for them to sell, said Adrian Beck, who studies retail losses at the University of Leicester. And they’re willing to accept higher theft on the lower-margin “trivial many,” he added.\n\nShoplifters target smaller items with higher price tags, often called “hot products,” which typically are what retailers most frequently lock up. One criminologist created an apt acronym, CRAVED, to predict the stuff at highest risk: “concealable, removable, available, valuable, enjoyable, and disposable.”\n\nThe dreaded lock and key. Richard B. Levine/Levine Roberts/Newscom/ZUMA Press\n\nThe most commonly stolen items at US stores include cigarettes, health and beauty products, over-the-counter medications, contraceptives, liquor, teeth-whitening strips and other products.\n\nDrug stores have a higher proportion of the items that are “hot products,” so they have more stuff under lock and key than other retail formats, Beck said.\n\nOrganized retail crime\n\nThere is only so much that can be done to to stop shoplifting. Companies prohibit retail staff from physically trying to stop a shoplifter for their own safety and must find other ways to protect the merchandise.\n\nThese include measures such as security tags on items that set off alarms when someone walks out without paying. But this is less valuable than it used to be because alarms have become part of the general cacophony of store noise and often go ignored.\n\nStores also use strategies such as shelves that allow a customer to take only one item at a time. This helps prevent shoppers emptying an entire shelf of products.\n\nLocking up a product is the final step a retailer will take before removing it altogether, and stores say they are resorting to this measure more frequently as theft continues to increase.\n\nThere is no national database on shoplifting, which often goes under-reported, and stores and prosecutors rarely press charges.\n\nOver-the-counter medications like eye drops are a hot target for shoplifters. Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nRetailers say organized retail crime has made their theft problems only worse. Crime gangs often look to steal products from stores that can easily and quickly be resold on online marketplaces such as Amazon and through illicit markets.\n\n“More products today are locked up because the problem has gotten so much bigger,” said Lisa LaBruno, the senior executive vice president of retail operations at the Retail Industry Leaders Association. “Criminal actors can steal high volumes of products and sell them with anonymity.”\n\nRetailers have supported a bipartisan bill that would require online marketplaces to verify state-issued IDs for millions of high-volume third-party sellers. President Joe Biden supports such a measure and this week also called on Congress to impose liability on online marketplaces that sell stolen goods on their platforms.\n\nAmazon said it does not allow third-party sellers to list stolen goods and works closely with law enforcement, retailers and other partners to stop bad actors.\n\n“We regularly request invoices, purchase orders, or other proofs of sourcing when we have concerns about how a seller may have obtained particular products,” a spokesperson said.\n\nIrritated customers and lost sales\n\nUnfortunately, many of these time-consuming anti-theft measures wind up irritating customers and cut into sales. One anti-theft device company’s CEO told Forbes that locked up stuff can result in sales reductions of 15% to 25%.\n\nShoppers today are more impatient. Some will walk out and buy the product on Amazon instead of hanging around for a worker.\n\n“You’re trying to be as frictionless for the customer but still prevent the loss,” said Mark Stinde, a former vice president of asset protection for Kroger and other large retailers. “You get a lot of pushback from operations and merchandising teams for locking stuff up.”\n\nStores are working on new ways to lock up products while reducing customer frustration, such as a new type of case that any employee can open with a smartphone. Other cases require shoppers to enter their phone number to open or scan a QR code.\n\n“Consumers understand why you have to lock up a fur coat or jewelry. But they say ‘why are we locking up deodorant?’” said Jack Trlica, co-founder of trade publication LP Magazine.\n\nTrlica expects companies will develop new technologies that protect products but don’t require flagging down an employee to unlock a shelf.\n\n“There’s going to be an evolution of security products,” he said.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story incorrectly identified Paco Underhill as the current CEO of Envirosell.

As the first-year student walked across the campus of San Diego State University four years ago, another student, a stranger, had approached her.\n\nSatnick's silver ring bore a Star of David, a symbol of the 18-year-old's Jewish faith. It had been a gift from her grandmother, who had connected her to her family's traditions.\n\nBut the moment quickly turned menacing.\n\nA group of students with the questioner began to surround her, Satnick recalled. \"You don't belong here!\" they yelled. \"K---!\" taunted another, using a slur against Jews. Satnick froze, then recovered and got out of there. For the rest of the day, she couldn't focus. Growing up in the suburbs outside L.A., she'd never experienced antisemitism personally.\n\nThe shock would stay with her: \"I took off my ring and began hiding the fact that I was Jewish,\" Satnick said in a recent interview. When she headed to synagogue or the campus Jewish center, she kept it to herself. She worried about how other students would react.\n\nFor Jews on American campuses, it's become an all-too-familiar tale.\n\nTracking a surge in antisemitism across the culture, U.S. colleges and universities have seen a rapid rise in anti-Jewish activity, according to government agencies and private watchdogs that track bias incidents. In April, the Anti-Defamation League said such reports had spiked by 41% in 2022 compared with the previous year, with incidents recorded at more than 130 schools.\n\nIn more than three dozen recent interviews with NorthJersey.com, Jewish students shared stories of harassment that bring those statistics to disturbing life. They spoke of slurs endured in class, expulsions from campus clubs and eggs thrown at Jewish fraternities. Of swastikas carved into their dorm walls, Holocaust-denying flyers and a growing feeling that they needed to conceal their Jewish identities to be accepted.\n\nMore:‘Fighting with love:’ Jewish students stand up, push back against campus antisemitism\n\n'Looming presence of antisemitism'\n\nAt Tufts University, outside Boston, Micah Gritz said he feels \"a looming presence of antisemitism ... I always have to evaluate where I feel safe as a Jew.\"\n\nGritz, an international security major from Rockville, Maryland, who just finished his junior year, said he's been told he must be rich if he's a Jew, and that he also bears responsibility for the deaths of Palestinian children. A psychology professor told him Israel had too much influence over the field, Gritz added.\n\n\"My father, who passed away last year, wore a Star of David necklace,\" said the 20-year-old. \"I wear it now but find myself tucking it in in certain classes because I have to worry about what my professor might think of me or what classmates might say. It's a balancing act every day.\"\n\nThe federal Department of Education has opened several investigations into whether U.S. colleges have violated Jewish students' civil rights by allowing a poisonous environment to fester. The agency has opened reviews at at least 10 schools, including the City University of New York and its law school, UCLA, UC Berkeley, George Washington University, the University of Vermont, the State University of New York at New Paltz and the University of Illinois.\n\nLast week, the White House unveiled what it called the first-ever national strategy aimed at combating antisemitism in America, and college campuses played a prominent role in the plan. The Biden administration called on colleges to condemn all forms of hate, to implement clearer mechanisms for reporting incidents and to create task forces to combat religious bias and ensure Jewish students are included in campus diversity, equity and inclusion programs.\n\nWhile the concept earned wide praise from Jewish groups, some complained that it lacked the substance to be effective. Alyza Lewin, president and attorney at the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law, a nonprofit that combats antisemitism on campus, applauded the Biden administration for the initiative because it \"demonstrates that they take antisemitism seriously\" and recognize \"that it's not just a Jewish problem, but one that needs to be addressed by the entire society.\"\n\nBut she also said the document was undermined by not embracing a definition of antisemitism that includes denials of Israel's right to exist. \"Targeting Jews on the basis of their connection to the state of Israel is just as antisemitic as targeting them on the basis of their Sabbath observance. Both are components of their Jewish identity,” she said.\n\nIsrael-Palestine at the heart of the rancor\n\nWhile antisemitism has come from both right- and left-wing sources, the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians is at the heart of much of the rancor. Students said they are often blamed collectively for missteps by Israel's government, although they themselves may disagree with those policies. The ADL said it received a sharp increase in complaints during a deadly flare-up between Israel and Palestinian forces in May 2021.\n\nTen years ago, such incidents were rare at U.S. colleges, said Matthew Berger, executive director of the Foundation to Combat Antisemitism, a nonprofit founded by New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft.\n\n\"Many college campuses have been experiencing these incidents now for the first time,\" said Berger, who previously worked at Hillel International, a Jewish campus organization.\n\nAt Rutgers University in New Jersey, a Jewish fraternity reported being targeted four times in the past two years. The Alpha Epsilon Pi house in New Brunswick was vandalized during a 2021 observance of Holocaust Remembrance Day in which the house was egged by unidentified perpetrators. A year later, in April 2022, eggs were thrown at the building during another memorial event, police records show.\n\nDays later, students told police that four carloads of people waving Palestinian flags stopped in front of the frat and yelled antisemitic slurs. After that report, the Rutgers chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine issued a statement saying it joined “the myriad voices in unequivocal opposition to antisemitism and all forms of racism and violence…The actions conducted were lone acts by individuals that have no formal or informal affiliation to our organization.”\n\nLast September, another egging at the fraternity was reported on Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year. There was no indication of who was responsible.\n\nInvestigations into all of the incidents are closed and resulted in no arrests or charges, said Dory Devlin, a Rutgers spokesperson.\n\nIn a report last October, the ADL tallied 359 anti-Israel incidents on American campuses overall during the 2021-22 school year. The group said the tally included one physical assault, 11 instances of vandalism, 19 instances of harassment, 143 events, 165 protests/actions and 20 resolutions and referenda on proposals to boycott or divest from Israel. “Many but not all incidents may be characterized as antisemitic,” the ADL said.\n\nSwastikas on campus\n\nAntisemitic vandalism has also increased on campus, the group found. In 2022, there were 90 incidents of anti-Jewish vandalism at colleges nationwide, 60% involving the use of a Nazi swastika, according to the ADL. The symbol of the regime that killed 6 million Jews in the Holocaust was spotted across the country, from William Paterson University in North Jersey to Ithaca College in upstate New York, Stanford University in California, the University of Delaware and Georgetown, in the nation's capital.\n\nThe most recent incidents occurred at the University of California-San Diego in May, when swastikas were found drawn in a dorm bathroom using human feces, and in April at the University of California, Santa Cruz, where a group of students allegedly gathered to celebrate Adolf Hitler's birthday.\n\nThe FBI's most recent statistics show that hate crimes against many groups are rising. But Jews, who make up less than 2% of the U.S. population, are the most targeted minority group in America on a per-capita basis. In 2021, over half of all crimes motivated by religious hatred were anti-Jewish, 51% of the total 1,590 incidents, according to the FBI, which compiles the reports from local law enforcement. There were no FBI statistics available for college campuses.\n\nThe numbers likely undercount the problem, because many incidents go unreported, the ADL says.\n\nHate turns deadly\n\nAt the University of Arizona last fall, the hatred allegedly turned deadly.\n\nOn Oct. 5 of last year — Yom Kippur, the most solemn day on the Jewish calendar — Professor Thomas Meixner was shot to death on the university's Tucson campus by a former student, police said. The student, Murad Dervish, had expressed antisemitic beliefs online and allegedly targeted Meixner because he wrongly believed the professor was Jewish.\n\nEyad Atallah, another instructor whom Dervish allegedly threatened, said in an interview that Dervish didn't believe him when he said Meixner, the head of the school's hydrology and atmospheric sciences department, was not Jewish. \"I really can't blame you. They've very deceptive,\" Dervish told him.\n\n\"I have numerous texts from him indicating antisemitic as well as anti-Asian sentiment,\" Atallah said, adding that he would describe Dervish's sentiments as \"white nationalist.\"\n\nDervish was charged with murder. A trial is scheduled for September. His attorneys did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn another incident, a group of demonstrators descended on Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton in January and set up a table at a campus club fair with a banner that declared \"Ye is Right. Change my Mind,\" said Ariana Hoblin, an FAU senior. The sign referred to Kanye West, the entertainer who now calls himself Ye, who was criticized for his antisemitic rants last year.\n\n\"A lot of Jewish students were upset,\" said Hoblin, president of the campus chapter of Students Supporting Israel. \"When there's a threat and students don't feel safe, it is no longer free speech.\"\n\nDo colleges take antisemitism seriously?\n\nWhile colleges usually issue condemnations after antisemitic incidents, many students who shared their stories with the USA Today Network said they didn't feel that administrators take their concerns as seriously as biases involving other groups.\n\nTessa Veksler, who is completing her junior year at the University of California-Santa Barbara, said she noticed the difference during a painful 48 hours in January.\n\nVeksler, a political science and communications major from San Francisco, said she walked into her Middle East politics class on Jan. 30 to find that someone had written \"F--- Israel\" on the chalkboard, as well as \"From the River to the Sea.\" The latter phrase refers to demands for a Palestinian state stretching from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea. Many Jews see it as a call for the expulsion or extermination of Jewish people from Israel, though Palestinian activists say it expresses only a desire for self-rule.\n\n\"We ended up having to switch classroom locations,\" Veksler said.\n\nThe next morning, she woke to another affront. Someone had distributed hundreds of antisemitic flyers in her neighborhood just off campus. They were filled with propaganda associating Jews with racism and pedophilia as well as Holocaust denial, tropes popular with right-wing hate groups.\n\nVeksler and her roommate spent the morning biking through the streets to collect the pamphlets.\n\nBoth episodes were traumatic, but she felt they weren't treated the same way by the campus community.\n\n\"The antisemitism in the classroom came from a left-wing contingent, and the flyers were from a right-wing extremist group,\" she said in an interview. \"Everyone was quick to condemn the flyers, but fewer people would condemn what happened in the classroom.\"\n\nKicked out of support group\n\nOfek Preis, an Israeli student at the State University of New York at New Paltz, said she and another Jewish student, Cassandra Blotner, were kicked out of a support group for sexual assault survivors in 2021. Blotner had written an Instagram post, which Preis shared online, describing the historical ties between Jews and the land of Israel.\n\n\"Israel is not a ‘colonial’ state and Israelis aren’t ‘settlers.’ You cannot colonize the land your ancestors are from,\" Blotner wrote.\n\nBlotner had helped found the support group, known as New Paltz Accountability, but she and Preis were expelled by the other members, accused of white supremacy and harassed online and on campus, according to a complaint filed in October with the U.S. Department of Education on the women's behalf. (The department has yet to rule on the case.)\n\nPreis, in an interview, said she was told, \"Zionism can't exist with fighting sexual violence. That was a huge shock to me. That felt violating. I should not have to choose between being Israeli or being a survivor. They didn't even let me explain my opinion.\n\n\"I went to the administration, and they were reluctant to get involved,\" she added. \"We are left unsupported within our institutions.\"\n\nIn an Instagram post in early 2022, New Paltz Accountability said: \"As a political organization, having unity among our members is necessary to successfully organize. Justifying the occupation of Palestine, in any way, condones the violence used to acquire the land. This does not mean that we do not support survivors of students with different political beliefs.\"\n\n'I don't want to hide who I am anymore'\n\nAs the threats multiply, Jewish students said they are tired of hiding their true selves.\n\nSatnick, the San Diego State student harassed because of her Star of David ring, recently graduated. She no longer conceals her Judaism.\n\n\"I decided I don't want to hide who I am anymore,\" she said.\n\nSatnick said she immersed herself in Jewish life at college and helped organize a campus event to counter antisemitism. It featured both entertainment and lessons about the ancient hatred.\n\nShe wanted to wear her ring again, but now she's working as an EMT and needs to wear gloves.\n\nSo several months ago, she said, she bought herself a silver necklace bearing a \"chai,\" the Jewish symbol for life.\n\n\"I wear it every day.\"\n\nDeena Yellin covers religion for NorthJersey.com.

Despite a historically divisive presidency and his own role in inciting an attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, Trump aimed to evoke nostalgia for his time in office, frequently contrasting his first-term accomplishments with the Biden administration’s policies and the current economic climate. Many of those perceived accomplishments – from strict immigration actions to corporate tax cuts and religious freedom initiatives – remain deeply polarizing to this day.\n\nAs Trump spoke to a roomful of Republicans who expect him to face primary challengers in the coming months, he also claimed the party cannot afford to nominate “a politician or conventional candidate” if it wants to win back the White House.\n\n“This will not be my campaign, this will be our campaign all together,” Trump said.\n\nTrump’s long-awaited campaign comes as he tries to reclaim the spotlight following the GOP’s underwhelming midterm elections performance – including the losses of several Trump-endorsed election deniers – and the subsequent blame game that has unfolded since Election Day. Republicans failed to gain a Senate majority, came up short in their efforts to fill several statewide seats, and have yet to secure a House majority, with only 215 races called in their favor so far out of the 218 needed, developments that have forced Trump and other party leaders into a defensive posture as they face reproval from within their ranks.\n\nTrump’s paperwork establishing his candidacy landed with the Federal Election Committee shortly before he delivered his announcement at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTo the delight of aides and allies who have long advised him to mount a forward-looking campaign, he spent only a fraction of his remarks repeating his lies about the 2020 election. Though he advocated for the use of paper ballots and likened America’s election system to that of “third world countries,” Trump also tried at times to broaden his grievances – lamenting the “massive corruption” and “entrenched interests” that in his view have consumed Washington. Many of Trump’s top advisers have expressed concern that his fixation on promoting conspiracies about the last presidential election would make it harder for him to win a national election in 2024.\n\nThroughout the hour-long speech, Trump made clear that he wants his campaign to be seen by Republicans as a sacrificial undertaking.\n\n“Anyone who truly seeks to take on this rigged and corrupt system will be faced with a storm of fire that only a few could understand,” he said at one point, describing the legal and emotional toll his presidency and post-presidential period has taken on his family members.\n\nOn the heels of last week’s midterm elections, Trump has been blamed for elevating flawed candidates who spent too much time parroting his claims about election fraud, alienating key voters and ultimately leading to their defeats. He attempted to counter that criticism on Tuesday, noting that Republicans appear poised to retake the House majority and touting at least one Trump-endorsed candidate, Kevin Kiley of California. At one point, Trump appeared to blame his party’s midterm performance on voters not yet realizing “the total effect of the suffering” after two years of Democratic control in Washington.\n\n“I have no doubt that by 2024, it will sadly be much worse and they will see clearly what has happened and is happening to our country – and the voting will be much different,” he claimed.\n\nBeating others to the punch\n\nTrump is betting that his first-out-of-the gate strategy will fend off potential primary rivals and give him an early advantage with deep-pocketed donors, aides say. He is widely expected to be challenged by both conservative and moderate Republicans, though the calculus of some presidential hopefuls could change now that he is running. Others – like his former Vice President, Mike Pence – may proceed anyway.\n\nTrump’s third presidential bid also coincides with a period of heightened legal peril as Justice Department officials investigating him and his associates revisit the prospect of indictments in their Trump-related probes. The former president is currently being investigated for his activities before and during the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and his retention of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate after he left office. While Trump is counting on an easy path to the GOP nomination with his sustained support among the party’s base, his announcement is likely to dash the hopes of party leaders who have longed for fresh talent. In particular, top Republicans have been paying close attention to the next moves of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who won his reelection contest with a 19-point margin of victory and considerable support from minority and independent voters. Some Republican leaders may try to scuttle Trump’s campaign by elevating or encouraging alternative candidates, including DeSantis, who has been quietly laying the groundwork for a possible White House bid of his own.\n\nOf course, any countereffort to inhibit Trump’s path to the nomination is likely to prove difficult. Despite his myriad legal entanglements and the stain of January 6, the twice-impeached 45th president remains immensely popular among most Republican voters and boasts a deep connection with his core backers that could prove difficult for other GOP hopefuls to replicate or weaken. Even leading conservatives who disliked Trump’s pugnacious politics and heterodox policies stuck with him as president because he helped solidify the rightward shift of the US Supreme Court with his nominations – one of the most far-reaching aspects of his legacy, which resulted in the conservative court majority’s deeply polarizing June decision to end federal abortion rights. In fact, while Trump ended his first term with the lowest approval rating of any president, Republicans viewed him favorably, according to a May NBC News poll. That alone could give Trump a significant edge over primary opponents whom voters are still familiarizing themselves with.\n\nAmong those potential competitors is Pence, who would likely benefit from high name recognition due to his role as vice president. Pence, who has been preparing for a possible White House run in 2024, is sure to face an uphill battle courting Trump’s most loyal supporters, many of whom soured on the former vice president after he declined to overstep his congressional authority and block certification of now-President Joe Biden’s 2020 victory. Trump could also find himself pitted against DeSantis, who has risen to hero status among cultural conservatives and who is widely considered a more polished version of Trump. Even some of the former president’s advisers have voiced similar observations to CNN, noting that DeSantis also made inroads with major Republican donors during his quest for reelection and built a mountain of goodwill with GOP leaders by campaigning for federal and statewide Republican candidates in the middle of his own race.\n\nBeyond his potential rivals, Trump has another roadblock in his path as the House select committee continues to investigate his role in January 6, 2021, and Justice Department officials weigh whether to issue criminal charges. The committee, which subpoenaed him for testimony and documents in October and which Trump is now battling in court, held public hearings throughout the summer and early fall featuring depositions from those in Trump’s inner circle at the White House – including members of his family – that detailed his public and private efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results through a sustained pressure campaign on numerous local, state and federal officials, and on his own vice president.\n\nBut Trump’s desire to announce his campaign early can be especially traced to the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, which advisers say further emboldened his decision to mount what he believes will be a triumphant political comeback. The day after the search, the former president fielded calls from allies advising him to accelerate his 2024 timeline. That night, he huddled with House lawmakers in the Republican Study Committee and told them he’d “made up his mind” about launching a bid, though some of those same House Republicans later convinced him to wait until after the midterm elections to announce his next move.\n\nFew of those lawmakers were present for Trump’s speech on Tuesday, choosing to remain in Washington as House Republicans conducted their leadership elections and the party continues to grapple with its failures in highly prized midterm races. Rather, the room was filled with prominent election deniers like MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, several of Trump’s attorneys, and past and present aides. Before he entered the room on Tuesday alongside former first lady Melania Trump, several members of the ex-president’s family were also seen filtering into the ballroom, including Eric and Lara Trump, his son Barron, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is engaged to Donald Trump Jr. His eldest son was notably missing, along with daughter Ivanka, , who has since said she will no longer be involved in the political arena. A source close to Donald Trump Jr. said he was stuck on a hunting trip in the mountain west and unable to catch a flight back to Florida in time for his father’s announcement. Other guests included longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone; outgoing North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn; former congressman and the current CEO of Trump’s Truth Social app Devin Nunes; and his chief political adviser Susie Wiles.\n\nPreparing for 2024\n\nFrom the moment Trump left Washington, defeated and disgraced, in January 2021, he began plotting a return to power – devoting the bulk of his time to building a political operation intended for this moment. With assistance from numerous former aides and advisers, he continued the aggressive fundraising tactics that had become a marker of his 2020 campaign, amassing a colossal war chest ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, and worked diligently to elect steadfast allies in both Congress and state legislatures across the country.\n\nWhile maintaining a home base in Florida, he also regularly jet-setted across the country for campaign rallies that afforded him crucial face time with his base and with candidates he bet would become valuable allies in the US Senate and House.\n\nThrough it all, Trump continued to falsely insist that the 2020 election was stolen from him, indulging in far-flung conspiracy theories about voter fraud and pressuring Republican leaders across the party’s election apparatus to endorse changes that would curtail voting rights.\n\nTrump’s aides were pleased earlier this fall when his public appearances and rally speeches gradually became more focused on rising crime, immigration and economic woes – key themes throughout the midterm cycle and issues they hope will enable him to draw a compelling contrast with Biden as he begins this next chapter. Allies of the former president have long said that he views the 2024 contest as an opportunity to regain what he believes is his: another four years in the Oval Office.\n\nBut there is no guarantee that Trump will glide easily to a nonconsecutive second term. In fact, it could be quite difficult.\n\nNot only does history offer just one example of such a feat (defeated in 1888 after his first term, President Grover Cleveland was elected again in 1892), no previously impeached president has ever run again for office. Trump was first impeached in 2019 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of justice, and then again in 2021 for inciting the riot at the US Capitol. Though he was acquitted by the Senate both times, 10 House Republicans broke with their party the second time around to join Democrats in a vote to impeach him. Seven Republican senators voted to convict him at his Senate trial.\n\nTrump has also been the subject of a bevy of lawsuits and investigations, including a New York state investigation and a separate Manhattan district attorney criminal probe into his company’s finances, a Georgia county probe into his efforts to overturn Biden’s election win in the state, and separate Justice Department probes into his campaign’s scheme to put forth fake electors in battleground states and his decision to bring classified materials with him to Mar-a-Lago upon leaving office.\n\nTrump’s actions since he left Washington have, for the most part, signaled his interest in an eventual return. While most former presidents go quietly into retirement – resurfacing to assist their parties during midterm cycles or for the opening of their presidential libraries – Trump bucked tradition to instead plot the comeback he now hopes to make. Despite its distance from Washington, Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club has transformed into a new hub for Republicans and a home base for his political machine. Assisted by a small group of paid staffers, he has hosted numerous candidate and committee fundraisers and seen a rotating cast of party leaders and congressional hopefuls filter through its gilded hallways in the hopes of nabbing his endorsement or reingratiating themselves with his base. Trump’s schedule has enabled him to build close relationships with party leaders and fringe figures – from House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy of California to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia – whose support in a contested primary could ultimately help him clear the field. Many of the aides who have been with him since he left the White House are expected to continue on as campaign hands, as the former president and his de facto chief of staff, longtime Florida GOP strategist Wiles, aim to maintain a lean operation much like the early days of his 2016 presidential campaign. Among those who are likely to be involved are Wiles, Taylor Budowich, Chris LaCivita, Steven Cheung, Justin Caporale and Brian Jack. Brad Parscale, who managed part of Trump’s failed 2020 campaign will not be part of his 2024 operation, nor will Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who was deeply involved in his quest for reelection.\n\nTime in office\n\nAs president, Trump faced criticism over several of his actions, especially his management of the worst public health crisis in nearly a century – the Covid-19 pandemic – though his administration helped facilitate the development of vaccines to treat the novel coronavirus in record time. He also was blasted by critics over his handling of Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico in 2017; the White nationalist rally, also in 2017, in Charlottesville, Virginia, where Heather Heyer was killed while walking with a group of counterprotesters; and Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nWhile in office, Trump signed sweeping tax cuts into law, enacted controversial hard-line immigration policies, including a policy that separated migrant children from their families and one known as “Remain in Mexico,” which the US Supreme Court ruled in June could be ended by his successor, and appointed hundreds of federal judges with deep conservative credentials. He also successfully nominated three Supreme Court justices, whose decisions this year as part of the court’s majority have shifted American society and laws rightward on issues such as abortion, guns, religious freedom and climate change.\n\nThe former real estate businessman and reality TV star was first elected to office in 2016, beating out a wide field of more than a dozen GOP candidates in an ugly primary, and then prevailing over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a contentious general election, despite sexual misconduct allegations that would have typically been campaign-ending.\n\nAs president, Trump was an impulsive leader, who dispensed with long-standing norms, often announcing policy and Cabinet personnel changes on Twitter. (He was ultimately banned from the platform following the US Capitol riot and was later barred from Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube as well.)\n\nHe pushed an “America First” foreign policy approach, pulling the US out of international agreements such as the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal, a pair of controversial moves that were decried by many of America’s top European allies.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story mistakenly said who was likely to be involved in the Trump campaign. Brad Parscale will not be involved in the 2024 operation.

Here's a look at the former president's current timeline.\n\nWill December bring another fraud ruling?\n\nRight now, Trump is in the midst of a civil trial involving bank fraud allegations brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\nJudge Arthur F. Engoron , who has already ruled in James' favor on most of the allegations, is holding a trial over damages that's expected to run through mid-December. Engoron's eventual ruling could gut the family's business empire.\n\nTrump, who testified during the trial, plans to appeal adverse rulings, a process that could last throughout the election year.\n\nJan. 15: Iowa and E. Jean Carroll\n\nJan. 15 may turn out to be one of the most unique days in American political history.\n\nAs Iowa kicks off the Republican nomination process with caucuses, a defamation trial against Trump begins in New York City. Writer E.

If Trump wins those contests, it's over.\n\nIf an opponent like former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley or Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis break through in one or more of those states, it could be a months-long fight for delegates.\n\nMarch 25: Hush money trial begins\n\nTrump also faces state charges in New York over hush money payments designed to buy pre-election silence from adult film star Stormy Daniels.\n\nThe fate of that case is uncertain.\n\nJudge Juan Manuel Merchan has set a trial date for March 25, 2024 but has also suggested he may push that back because of the federal election conspiracy trial.\n\nMay: Trump's classified documents trial, maybe\n\nThere is also uncertainty over Trump's federal trial on his alleged mishandling of classified documents.\n\nU.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, has proposed the trial for a still-to-be-determined date in May. But she also continues to consider Trump's request to push it back until after Election Day on Nov. 5, 2024.\n\nA hearing on the schedule for the documents trial is scheduled for March 1, four days before Super Tuesday.\n\nTrump is accused of defying grand jury subpoenas for documents he removed from the White House when he departed on Jan. 20, 2021.

Trump's lawyers contend if he wins the election, he can't be tried in either state or federal courts while in office.\n\nWASHINGTON — The traffic jam of four criminal trials pending against Donald Trump has left prosecutors and judges struggling to get any of them moving while avoiding collisions.\n\nThe result leaves open the question of which – if any – will begin before the November election. Prosecutors are eager to get verdicts before Election Day, but legal experts say the first trial might not start until summer, as issues are debated and appealed.\n\nThe first trial, on federal charges the former president tried to overturn the 2020 election, is tentatively scheduled for March 4 in Washington. But preparations are on hold while Trump argues that he is immune to the charges at the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals − and potentially at the Supreme Court.\n\nAnother appeal before the Supreme Court – with potentially no answer for months – could upend two of the four charges against Trump, as well as those against hundreds of defendants in the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nNext up is a trial set for May 20 on federal charges Trump retained national defense records after leaving the White House. But legal disputes about how to handle classified records in the case could postpone it.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nIf either case slips too far, Justice Department policy is to not try politically sensitive cases within months of an election. But state prosecutors in Georgia and New York don’t face that restriction.\n\nSteering a wide berth around the federal cases, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis proposed to start her election racketeering trial against Trump and 14 co-defendants on Aug. 5, which could overlap with the election. Trump lawyer Steven Sadow called the schedule potentially the \"most effective election interference in the history of the United States.\"\n\nIdling in the wings, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has also waited on the federal cases for his trial on charges that Trump falsified business records.\n\nTrump has argued that each case represents Democratic political interference against his Republican campaign to return to the White House, so all should be postponed until after the election. If he wins, Sadow contends the Constitution would prevent any state or federal trial while Trump serves as president.\n\n“The preference would be that he’s not on trial while he’s campaigning,\" Sadow told Fulton County Superior Judge Scott McAfee earlier this month. But McAfee has not yet set a date.\n\nHere is what we know about the four trials and their potential delays:\n\nWhat could delay Trump's federal election interference case?\n\nU.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan rejected Trump’s request to dismiss the federal election interference case, when he argued he is immune to the charges for actions he took as president. But she put the case on hold while he appeals.\n\nRather than wait for the circuit court, Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith asked the Supreme Court to decide the case quickly. But the high court sent it to the circuit court, which could spend weeks or months weighing the case first at a three-judge panel and potentially before the full appeals court.\n\n\"The United States recognizes that this is an extraordinary request,” Smith wrote. “This is an extraordinary case.\"\n\nLegal experts said the eventual Supreme Court decision could take time for such a historic decision.\n\n“The fact that Jack Smith wants to go to trial by March 4, I don’t think they’re going to cause them to act precipitously,” Clark Cunningham, a law professor at Georgia State University, told USA TODAY. “Then they have to come up with a majority that’s going to be for the history books.”\n\nWhat other Supreme Court case could delay Trump's trial?\n\nThe Supreme Court could face another urgent case dealing with Trump over the holidays. The Colorado Supreme Court decided Tuesday to disqualify Trump from the state’s 2024 ballot for his role in the Jan. 6 insurrection, which his aides said they would quickly appeal.\n\nColorado’s secretary of state must certify the primary ballot by Jan. 5, which legal experts said might cause justices to cancel their holiday plans.\n\n“This likely takes priority over Jack Smith’s request for quick SCOTUS review of immunity question,” Barb McQuade, a former U.S. attorney and now law professor at the University of Michigan, said on social media.\n\nIn another case the Supreme Court agreed to hear Dec. 13, the justices will decide whether to overturn two of the charges pending against Trump. The ruling might not come until the end of June.\n\nThe case was filed by Joseph Fischer, who was one of more than 200 people charged in the Jan. 6 riot with “corruptly” obstructing an official proceeding.\n\nAn 'anti-shredding' law for walking through the Capitol for a few minutes?\n\nFischer described the statute as an “anti-shredding” law that shouldn't apply to his walking through the Capitol for a few minutes. Congress approved the legislation in 2002 after Enron’s financial meltdown, and Fischer argued it was intended to punish people for tampering with evidence rather than participating in a riot.\n\nBut the Justice Department argued the official proceeding he obstructed was Jan. 6, when Congress was interrupted while counting Electoral College votes. The law could cover someone lying to a grand jury or “burning a building to conceal the bodies” of murder victims, prosecutors wrote.\n\nCircuit courts have upheld the statute through several challenges, but the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case for potentially a different outcome. Two of Trump’s charges are based on the same statute.\n\nClassified documents case could be delayed: legal experts\n\nTrump's Florida trial features 40 federal charges associated with storing hundreds of national defense records at his Mar-a-Lago club after leaving the White House in 2021. The challenges in the case include how to allow lawyers for Trump and his two co-defendants to deal with classified documents to prepare their defenses.\n\nAt a November hearing, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon pushed back several deadlines in the case and stuck to her May 20 trial date. But she said she would reconsider the schedule at a March hearing about classified documents.\n\n“I think the classified documents issues will in fact prove to be more difficult than the judge in Florida has anticipated, and it will in fact get pushed back,” Stephen Saltzburg, a law professor at George Washington University, told USA TODAY.\n\nMcQuade, the former U.S. attorney, agreed that dealing with disputes over the Classified Information Procedures Act in March could postpone the trial.\n\n“That trial could get pushed until after the election interference case later in the summer,” she told USA TODAY.\n\nFederal prosecutors expected to keep election interference case ahead of documents case\n\nIf both federal trials are delayed, legal experts expect prosecutors to aim for keeping the Jan. 6 trial first.\n\nLegal experts say the documents case may be easier to prove than election interference because the documents shouldn’t have been outside a secure government facility and the FBI seized the documents at Mar-a-Lago. But former Vice President Mike Pence and President Joe Biden also mishandled classified documents and have not been charged.\n\n“In any other environment, the classified documents would be a slam dunk for the prosecutors,” Saltzburg said. “As bad as what happened in Mar-a-Lago was, I don’t think the public will respond to that in the same way they are likely to respond to a conviction for trying to steal the presidency.”\n\nIf the election interference trial is delayed a few months, it could basically take the place of the documents trial and coincide with a Supreme Court decision in the Fischer case resolving which charges are valid against Trump.\n\n“A June trial date seems about right,” McQuade said of the election interference case.\n\nJustice Department policy discourages politically sensitive trials months before election\n\nThe challenge with federal cases slipping into August is that the Justice Department has an informal policy − not a formal regulation or law − against trying politically sensitive cases within two to three months of an election.\n\nThe risk that an investigation could influence an election was illustrated in 2016. Then-FBI Director James Comey announced days before the election that he was reopening an investigation into Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s emails. She then lost to Trump.\n\nMichael Horowitz, the Justice Department’s inspector general, reported on the tradition of an “unwritten 60-day rule” for delaying overt investigative steps close to an election. But he found the practice was \"not written or described in any Department policy or regulation.\"\n\nFormer Attorney General Loretta Lynch told Horowitz’s team the general practice was not to take actions that might have an impact on an election, even if it wasn't an election case. Matt Axelrod, a former principal associate deputy attorney general, said there wasn’t a 60- or 90-day rule, but “the closer you get to the election, the more fraught it is.”\n\nCould Georgia or New York prosecutors leapfrog the federal cases?\n\nIn contrast to the federal policy, state prosecutors face no similar restrictions on the timing of their trials. Trump faces 13 charges in Georgia alleging he conspired to overturn the 2020 election and 34 charges in New York alleging he falsified business records to pay hush money to women who claimed to have had sex with him.\n\nSo far, the local prosecutors have waited for federal prosecutors to try their cases. But legal experts speculated that Willis or Bragg could start their trials in February or March if the federal cases are postponed.\n\nNeither prosecutor has actually proposed setting their case that early.\n\nBut Cunningham suggested Willis could hold a trial in February against Trump and a few co-defendants, such as campaign lawyers Rudy Giuliani and John Eastman, to resolve the case before the election. Giuliani spread baseless accusations of election fraud and Eastman developed a strategy for Republicans to field alternate presidential electors for Congress to count in states President Joe Biden won.\n\nBuddy Parker, one of Eastman’s lawyers, asked to separate his case from others to avoid having it delayed into 2025.\n\n“There are a number of defendants as noted who are not running for president of the United States,” Parker told McAfee during a Dec. 1 hearing. “We would like possibly to be earlier if we could be accommodated.\"\n\nWillis has said she was prepared for trial in October, when co-defendants Sidney Powell and Kenneth Chesebro pleaded guilty before their scheduled trial.\n\nMcAfee said he was inclined to divide the 15 remaining defendants and hold at least two trials to avoid straining the judicial system. The prosecutors could choose the order, if that happens, he said.\n\n“If you’re judge McAfee, certainly you would like for this trial to be over as early as possible in the election season,” Cunningham said.\n\nNew York, where Trump was first indicted, is another option. Bragg was initially given a trial date in March. His case has been on hold amid the legal jockeying, but would be another option for an early trial if the federal cases are postponed.\n\n“That trial seems to be under the radar at the moment, but might be ready to go first,” McQuade said. “The Georgia case seems unlikely to start until fall, and then, the judge may find it too close to the election to begin.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/08/03/donald-trump-indictment-arrest-arraignment-live-updates/70513060007/", "title": "Trump pleads not guilty to charges in 2020 election indictment: recap", "text": "WASHINGTON - Former President Donald Trump pleaded not guilty to charges that he tried to steal the 2020 election − following his third arrest and court arraignment in four months.\n\nA somber-faced Trump entered the courtroom at about 4 p.m. to be arraigned, wearing a navy blue suit, a red tie and a white shirt. He folded his hands on the table in front of him, put his head down and sat between his attorneys, Todd Blanche and John Lauro.\n\nTrump and his attorneys quietly talked among themselves, waiting for Magistrate Judge Moxila A.

He shook his head \"no\" as the criminal case was read.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nTrump offered his own plea: not guilty.\n\nBoth sides agreed to a \"speedy\" trial, though Trump's legal team has moved to delay court proceedings in previous cases.\n\nBefore his federal court appearance began, the former president called for the trial to be moved from heavily Democratic Washington, D.C., to a more Republican-friendly place like West Virginia.\n\n\"This Indictment is all about Election Interference!!!\" said the front-running Republican candidate on his Truth Social website.\n\nAs he left court late Thursday afternoon, chants of “lock him up” were heard outside the courtroom.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear if anti-Trump protesters outnumbered Trump supporters, but they were certainly louder.\n\nJust before Trump boarded his Boeing 757, he told reporters the legal process is unfair.\n\n“This is a very sad day for America,” he said before leaving Reagan National Airport for New Jersey. As he held an umbrella to block the ongoing rain, Trump called the case the “persecution of a political opponent.”\n\n“This was never supposed to happen in America,\" he said, leaving Washington under a dark cloud.\n\nTrump faces 55 years in prison on the latest charges, Magistrate Judge Moxila A. Upadhyaya says\n\nDuring Trump’s arraignment, the presiding judge, Magistrate Judge Moxila A. Upadhyaya, told the former president that he faces a maximum of 55 years in prison if convicted on all counts.\n\nThat includes a potential sentence of not more than 5 years on the first count of Conspiracy to Defraud the United States. On the second count of Conspiracy to Obstruct an Official Proceeding, Trump faces not more than 20 years in prison and a fine of not more than $250,000.\n\nIf convicted on the third count of Obstruction of and Attempt to Obstruct an Official Proceeding, Trump faces not more than 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 and supervised release of not more than 3 years.

Barrett Prettyman Courthouse in downtown Washington for his first court hearing in the case related to his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election.\n\nWhile Trump was fingerprinted, he was not subjected to a mug shot as part of the booking process. The former president did not have his mug shot taken at his arraignments in New York state court and in Miami federal court.\n\nTrump will now be escorted to the courtroom for his arraignment.\n\n− Miles J.

A grim-faced Trump entered the courtroom where he is expected to be arraigned wearing a navy blue suit, a red tie and a white shirt.\n\nSecurity monitored the room as Trump was led to his seat, and a group of spectators in the back of the courtroom watched Trump.\n\nMagistrate Judge Moxila Upadhyaya is overseeing Trump’s arraignment.\n\n-Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhat is an arraignment?\n\nAn arraignment is when formal charges against an accused defendant are read by a judge. This takes place during a defendant’s first appearance before a judge, where they are told about the specific charges they are facing.\n\nTrump on Thursday will be asked how he wants to plead to the official charges. The former president is expected to plead not guilty as he has in two previous indictments.\n\nThe judge will then decide if bail is required. They can also choose to set no bail, which would allow Trump to be immediately released without being placed in jail.\n\n- Olivia Munson and Rachel Looker\n\nWhere is the Trump arraignment? Elijah Barrett Prettyman Courthouse\n\nTrump's appearance today at the E. Barrett Prettyman Courthouse will be the latest historic moment in a federal courthouse that saw the Watergate trials and was home to parts of the Iran-Contra affair.\n\nSeven men, including two former White House aides, involved in the political scandal that led to President Richard Nixon's resignation stood before Chief Federal District Judge John Sirica there. The courthouse also saw trials in the Iran-Contra affair, the 1980s scandal in which senior officials from President Ronald Reagan's administration were found guilty of facilitating secret and illegal arms sales.\n\nThe building was named in 1997 after a chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and originally constructed in the mid-1900s in D.C.'s Judiciary Square.\n\n- Savannah Kuchar\n\nTrump surrenders as protesters, supporters gather at courthouse\n\nA group of anti-Trump protesters and Trump supporters gathered near the back of the courthouse where Trump entered.\n\nSome stood on large concrete planters to get a better view of his motorcade.\n\nBanging drums and speaking on microphones, Trump supporters yelled back and forth with those screaming “lock him up.”\n\n“Dirty Democrats,” one Trump supporter yelled on a megaphone.⁃ Rachel Looker\n\nIs Donald Trump going to jail?\n\nIf you're keeping score, this will be Trump's third arrest this year.\n\nA formal arrest is part of the arraignment process, as happened with Trump in New York state court in early April over hush money charges and in Florida federal court in June on allegations involving classified documents.\n\nThree arrests - and counting, possibly.\n\nA state grand jury in Atlanta is considering an indictment and arrest of Trump over efforts to reverse his election loss in Georgia.\n\nTrump is not in jail and will likely leave the courthouse after his arraignment.\n\nAfter the former president enters a plea to charges, the judge will decide if bail is required or set no bail, which would allow Trump to be released without serving jail time.\n\nHe has not been jailed after his previous indictments.\n\n-David Jackson and Rachel Looker\n\nWhat does indicted mean?\n\nAn indictment is a formal charging document that’s used when it’s believed a person committed a crime. It includes charges against a person and should be filed before a case can move forward in a court, David Weinstein, a former federal and state prosecutor, previously told USA TODAY.\n\nAn indictment means a grand jury decided that there’s “more likely than not” enough evidence – based on testimony – to move forward with charging a person, Weinstein said. In a federal court, all cases proceed via indictment.\n\n−Marina Pitofsky\n\nTrump indicted\n\nA grand jury in Washington indicted Trump on Tuesday on charges of conspiring with aides to overturn his 2020 election loss to President Joe Biden, efforts that led to the insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nHis two other indictments: A state case in New York involving hush money payments and a federal case in Florida alleging obstruction of justice and improper retention of classified documents.\n\nMagistrate Judge Moxila A. Upadhyaya\n\nTrump will appear before federal Magistrate Judge Moxila A. Upadhyaya to enter his plea. He is expected to answer not guilty to the four charges he faces.\n\nOnce the trial begins, Trump faces U.S. District Judge Tanya S. Chutkan. A nominee of President Barack Obama, Chutkan has presided over other cases related to the January 6, 2021 insurrection. She is the only judge in D.C. who has given longer sentences to these defendants than what was requested by the Department of Justice.\n\n-Savannah Kuchar\n\nTrump 757, Trump Force One: What kind of plane does Trump have?\n\nThe former president used a private jet, owned by the Trump Organization, to arrive in Washington.\n\nDubbed “Trump Force One” by the man himself, the massive Boeing 757 cost $100 million, according to reports.\n\nIt also received a facelift amid the indictments to include a new paint job with his name in gold at the front of the aircraft.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nTrump arrives in the D.C. area, headed to the courthouse\n\nThe former president's plane has touched down at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, across the Potomac River from the nation's capital.\n\nAnother Trump motorcade now heads to the federal courthouse in downtown Washington, where he will be arrested, arraigned, and likely released on bond.\n\nThe arraignment is scheduled for 4 p.m.; then he heads back to Bedminster, N.J.\n\n-David Jackson\n\nMore press than protesters\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is expected to arrive at 4:00 p.m. for his arraignment at the federal courthouse in Washington, but less than two hours before his anticipated arrival members of the press continue to overwhelmingly outnumber protesters in front of the courthouse.\n\nSeveral dozen journalists are waiting inside the courthouse for the hearing to begin, with countless more media personnel operating cameras outside.\n\nWhile there have been no large demonstrations as of yet, a handful of anti-Trump and pro-Trump protesters have appeared outside the courthouse.\n\n− Miles J.

Barrett Prettyman United States Courthouse in Washington 40 times in the last few months.\n\nOn the day of Trump’s indictment, he plans to stand there all day. This indictment is different, he said.\n\n“I think this one could possibly negatively affect him,” he said of Trump’s third indictment ahead of the 2024 election. “It’s like I’ve said to everybody, if they don’t knock him off of these indictments this election, they might just say he can’t run soon.”\n\nCorson has spent every night in Washington, D.C. outside of the prison where rioters from the Jan. 6 Capitol attack have been detained. He holds a two-hour vigil each night protesting what he says has been their unfair treatment.\n\nTo him, Trump’s third indictment differs from the past two.\n\n“It’s in the federal city. They’re making a big deal out of it. They’re allowing it to fester and grow and be a big deal,” he said.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nTrump supporters balk at indictment charges\n\nHours before Donald Trump arrived for his third indictment, a smattering of Trump’s supporters gathered outside the courthouse in Washington to support the former president and criticize the charges Trump faces.\n\nDaniel Demoura, 32, stood outside the courthouse clad in a t-shirt that read “free the J6 political prisoners.”\n\n“The people have their own freedom of choice to do whatever they want and protest,” Demoura told USA TODAY, saying the mob that breached the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, made their own choices and weren't incited by Trump. “I’m here, Trump didn’t tell me to come. I came because I support the man.”\n\n-Ken Tran\n\n‘The guy is a con artist:’ Chris Christie supporter knocks Trump\n\nDomenic Santana, 61, said he believes Trump should have been imprisoned and is not fit to hold office. Santana said he also appeared outside the courthouse where Trump was arraigned in Miami, Florida, last month in the classified documents case against him.\n\n“The reality is the guy is a con artist,” Santana said. “He’s gotten away with it.”\n\nSantana - a supporter of 2024 GOP candidate Chris Christie - said he supports the former New Jersey Gov. because he says what he means and means what he says.\n\n“We got to look at another game plan to be able to beat Trump at his own game and since he plays dirty, I’m telling the Democrats to wake up, change parties and vote on the Republican primaries for Christie and get Trump out of there,” Santana said.\n\n- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhen is Trump getting arraigned?\n\nThe former president is expected in court at 4 p.m. Thursday.\n\nIn anticipation of his arrival, television production trucks and cameras continued to line the street Thursday morning outside the E. Barrett Prettyman U.S. Courthouse. Security increased overnight outside the courthouse and fences appeared around the perimeter of the building, as former President Donald Trump is expected to make his first appearance in the case related to his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 president election results. Journalists are currently being let into the courthouse as they attempt to gain access to a seat in the courtroom or into the overflow room for members of the media. — Miles J.

W. Bush. He rejected Trump's defense that he was simply exercising his right to free speech talking about the 2020 election.\n\n\"He brought this on himself,\" Barr said. \"This is one of the reasons I oppose him for the Republican nomination, because he has this penchant for engaging in these reckless acts that create calamitous situations and then undercut the cause he's supposed to be leading.\"\n\n-Savannah Kuchar\n\nTrump: It would be 'very dangerous' to put me in prison\n\nWorries about violence permeate the atmosphere at the federal courthouse in Washington.\n\nAs the ex-president prepares to plead innocent to charges of attempted election theft, some are recalling a Trump comment last month that it would be \"very dangerous\" to put him in prison because his supporters might not stand for it.\n\n\"I think it's a very dangerous thing to even talk about, because we do have a tremendously passionate group of voters,\" Trump told an Iowa radio show on July 18.\n\nHe added: \"I think, uh, it would be very dangerous.\"\n\nIn any event, Trump is a long way from prison.\n\nEven if he is convicted in any of the cases against him, he would no doubt appeal and that process could take years.\n\n-David Jackson\n\nIs Trump running for president again?\n\nTrump can still run for president in the 2024 election.\n\nBarbara McQuade, a criminal law expert at the University of Michigan, told USA TODAY that even if Trump were charged, convicted and sentenced to prison, he would still be able to run for president.\n\nThe three exclusive requirements to run for president are to be a natural-born citizen, to be at least 35 years old and to have been a resident of the U.S. for at least 14 years, according to the U.S. Constitution.\n\nTrump told reporters in March that he “won’t even think about leaving” the 2024 race despite his legal troubles.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nDonald Trump wants to move the trial - to West Virginia\n\nHours before his arraignment, Trump says he wants his Jan. 6 trial moved out of Democratic-dominated Washington, D.C., to more Republican-friendly territory, perhaps West Virginia.\n\n\"IMPOSSIBLE to get a fair trial in Washington, D.C., which is over 95% anti-Trump,\" Trump said on his Truth Social account after suggesting West Virginia as an alternative.\n\nIt feels like a legal longshot, but venue will likely be one of many topics to be discussed in pre-trial motions and hearings.\n\nIn his post, Trump also said he he has \"called for a Federal TAKEOVER in order to bring our Capital back to Greatness,\" but didn't explain what he meant.\n\nPerhaps it was a reference to his 2024 presidential campaign.\n\n-David Jackson\n\nTrump has no post-arraignment speech scheduled - yet\n\nOne thing that's different, so far, about this third arraignment: Trump has no post-plea event scheduled, at least not yet.\n\nAfter previous arraignments in different cases in April and June, Trump hosted rallies at his homes. The first was at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla., the second at his summer home on the golf course at Bedminster, N.J.\n\nAfter his June arraignment in Miami, Trump also made an unscheduled stop at a local Cuban restaurant to soak up support from some of his voters.\n\nAs of now, the schedule calls for Trump to simply return to Bedminster after his court appearance in Washington, D.C. - though it seems likely that he will get his message out in some form or fashion.\n\n-David Jackson\n\nMike Pence: Trump relied on 'crackpot lawyers'\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence is mimicking Trump's defense that he relied on legal advice in pursuing protests of the 2020 election - but he has a much different assessment of the former president's attorneys themselves.\n\n\"President Trump and his gaggle of crackpot lawyers asked me to reject electoral votes and chaos would have ensued,\" Pence said on the social media website X.\n\nPence has repeated his \"crackpot\" jibe in interviews and public comments. Trump responded by saying on Truth Social that \"I feel badly for Mike Pence\" and that \"the V.P. had power that Mike didn’t understand.\"\n\nOne of his ex-lawyers, John Eastman, fired back with an insult of his own, telling an interviewer that Pence chose to act like \"a potted plant.\"\n\n-David Jackson\n\nAdvocates: Third indictment will ‘resonate more’ with Americans\n\nSvante Myrick, president of People for the American Way, a progressive advocacy group, said Trump’s third indictment is the most important one out of the three he faces.\n\n“This one he was trying to invalidate 80 million people’s votes,” he told USA TODAY, adding that the crimes the former president is accused of in the indictment are “the most serious I could imagine.”\n\nMyrick said the third indictment resonates more with the American people because they watched the culmination of the crimes on their TV screens during the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.\n\n“This we all saw,”” he said.\n\nHe thinks Trump faces greater legal jeopardy for charges included in the third indictment than in other cases\n\n“I for the first time thought oh Donald Trump might spend the rest of his life in prison because of what’s alleged,” he said.\n\nChristian Nunes, president of the National Organization for Women, told USA TODAY Trump’s third indictment unveils the gravity behind his actions to voters.\n\n“This indictment shows the seriousness of everything with the election. I think it’s more powerful and it’s putting more heat (on Trump) as people see everything as it starts to unfold,” Nunes said, adding she thought the indictment was “long overdue.”\n\n- Rachel Looker and Ken Tran\n\nWhat's next for Trump? A Georgia indictment?\n\nTuesday’s federal indictment of former President Donald Trump for efforts to overturn the 2020 election is focusing attention on a Georgia investigation that may soon deepen Trump’s legal peril.\n\nFulton County District Attorney Fani Willis is expected within the next few weeks to seek a grand jury indictment for efforts to overturn the state’s elections in 2020.\n\nIn Atlanta this week, recently erected orange barriers stood around the Fulton County courthouse, with one street lined with police cars as part of security preparations. Over the weekend, Willis shared a racist threat with county commissioners and urged them to “stay safe,” as first reported by the AJC.\n\nOn Monday, a Fulton County Superior Court Judge rejected a request from Trump to toss the findings of a special grand jury and disqualify Willis.\n\nDetails of the Georgia investigation that have become public have fed speculation that Willis, a Democrat, is building a case under the Georgia Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, which would allow her to charge numerous people in a potentially wide-ranging scheme, according to the AP.\n\nWillis’ investigation began more than two years ago, after a recording of Trump’s 2021 call to Georgia’s secretary of state asking him to “find” 11,780 votes.\n\nThat incident was part of Tuesday’s federal indictment, which alleged that Trump induced Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to alter the state’s count of the popular vote and questioned the validity of Biden’s electors’ votes.\n\nRaffensperger on Wednesday declined to comment on the federal indictment.\n\nSome Georgia Republican lawmakers dismissed it, with Republican Congressman Mike Collins saying it was a “sham prosecution” in statement posted on social media and calling for funding cuts to the DOJ.\n\nGeorgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene called it a “communist attack” on X, formerly Twitter, and said she would “still vote for Trump even if he’s in jail.”\n\n-Chris Kenning\n\nTrump plans post-indictment campaign stops in South Carolina and New Hampshire\n\nTrump's third indictment will in no way keep him off the Republican campaign trail - he has events coming up in two early primary states.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump is scheduled to headline the South Carolina Republican Party's annual Silver Elephant Dinner in Columbia.\n\nThe Trump campaign has also announced that Trump will travel on Tuesday to New Hampshire to deliver a speech at a high school in Windham.\n\n-David Jackson", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/02/15/new-york-judge-hearing-trump-hush-money/72586107007/", "title": "Donald Trump's hush money criminal trial will start March 25, New ...", "text": "Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg was the first to secure an indictment of a former president, but the pace of preparations for the case slowed after a federal trial was scheduled first.\n\nThe postponement of Trump's federal election interference case opened the door to New York trial happening first.\n\nDonald Trump’s hush-money trial will proceed as scheduled, with jury selection starting on March 25, a New York judge said, in what could be the first-ever criminal trial against a former president, on charges he falsified business records to cover up payments to women.\n\nTrump told reporters as he entered the courtroom that he committed no crime and that the charges were politically motivated. “This is a terrible time for our country,\" he said. \"This is a real dark period.”\n\nDespite receiving the least attention of the four criminal cases against Trump, the trial threatens to sideline the likely Republican nominee during the heart of the primary season while he campaigns again for the White House.

I’m running for election. How can you run for election and be sitting in a courthouse in Manhattan all day?”\n\nAfter Trump was indicted in two federal cases, the New York case took a back seat. But the federal election-interference trial that had been scheduled March 4 was postponed while Trump argues in appeals courts he is immune to the charges, which opened the door to the New York trial going first.\n\nMerchan said he was taking advantage of the delay in the federal election case to move ahead with the hush-money trial. The judge had long resisted defense requests for a delay. “I’m glad I took that position because here we are – the D.C. case did not go forward,” he said.\n\nDefense lawyer Todd Blanche launched into a long objection, calling the trial \"unconstitutional.\" “It is completely election interference to say ‘you are going to sit in this courtroom in Manhattan,'\" he told Merchan.\n\n“Stop interrupting me, please!” the judge replied.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty. If convicted, the maximum sentence for each felony count would be four years in prison, but first-time offenders typically get shorter sentences or probation.\n\nAs the Manhattan hearing got underway, a judge in Atlanta, 860 miles away, opened proceedings to decide if Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis should be booted from her sprawling election racketeering case against Trump and more than a dozen others over her affair with the private attorney she appointed as special prosecutor in that case.\n\nAnd Trump is bracing for a judge's decision in a $370 million fraud lawsuit by the New York state attorney general, where he was found to have inflated the value of his real estate. Trump said he expects that decision on Friday.\n\nMore:Expect drama in Trump election fraud case: Live updates from Fani Willis hearing\n\nTrump trashes 'zombie case' as politically motivated\n\nTrump had asked Merchan to dismiss the case, but the judge denied his request. Trump has argued that Bragg “filed a discombobulated package of politically motivated charges marred by legal defects, procedural failures, discovery violations, and a stubborn refusal to provide meaningful particulars regarding its theory of the case.”\n\nBragg’s predecessor as Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr., had decided against pursuing charges.\n\n“The charges against President Trump arise from a sprawling on-again, off-again investigation that lasted five years and has cost New Yorkers millions of dollars,” Trump’s lawyers, led by Todd Blanche and Susan Necheles, argued in one filing. They said that former prosecutors in the office had “dubbed the focus of the charges in the indictment the ‘zombie case’ because of how many times they abandoned the theory, only to revive it when other inquiries were even less fruitful.”\n\nBragg said in a statement Thursday: \"We are pleased that the Court denied the defense's motion to dismiss. We look forward to presenting our case in court on March 25, 2024.\"\n\nProsecutor calls Trump's arguments 'meritless'\n\nPreviously, Bragg’s office had called Trump's claims of selective prosecution “meritless.” Prosecutors alleged that, both before the 2016 election and after taking office, Trump orchestrated secret payments to suppress negative information involving a pornographic film actress and a former Playboy model.\n\n“Defendant Donald J. Trump is charged with thirty-four felony counts of falsifying business records in the first degree as part of an expansive and corrupt criminal scheme to conceal damaging information from the voting public in advance of the 2016 presidential election,” Bragg’s team wrote.\n\nBragg also brushed aside the argument that the case is politically motivated.\n\n“Defendant repeatedly suggests that because he is a current presidential candidate, the ordinary rules for criminal law and procedure should be applied differently here,” Bragg’s office wrote. “This argument is essentially an attempt to evade criminal responsibility because defendant is politically powerful.”\n\nTrump calls prosecutor 'a degenerate psychopath'\n\nTrump arrived at the courthouse around 9 a.m. After the hearing he complained again about the trial. \"I'll be here during the day and campaigning during the night,\" he said. During a rant to reporters, Trump accused New York officials of trying to derail his campaign, and complained about the city's crime rate .\n\n\"It's a rigged state,\" Trump said, using the same term he has applied to elections that went against him. \"It's a rigged city.\"\n\nThe trial, which Bragg estimated could last five weeks, threatens to take Trump off the campaign trail as states continue to hold primaries. Criminal defendants are expected to attend their trials, in contrast to civil trials where attendance is optional.\n\nThe former president has continued to rave against the prosecutors and judges in his civil and criminal cases, calling Bragg \"a degenerate psychopath that truely hates the USA!\" and Merchan a \"Trump-hating judge\" who he asked to have removed from the case. But Merchan remains.\n\nTrump also wanted to have the case moved to federal court, where he could have argued he was immune to prosecution for actions taken while he was president, as he has in other cases. But that request was rejected.\n\n“The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that the matter was a purely a personal item of the President − a cover-up of an embarrassing event,” U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein wrote in July 2023. “Hush money paid to an adult film star is not related to a President’s official acts. It does not reflect in any way the color of the President’s official duties.”\n\nWhat charges does Trump face in New York?\n\nThe 34 counts apply to payments the Trump Organization paid his former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, in the guise of a legal fees, according to the indictment and a statement of facts released by Bragg.\n\nCohen has testified that 11 reimbursements went to him – Trump signed nine of the checks – for arranging $130,000 payments to porn actress Stormy Daniels and $150,000 to Playboy model Karen McDougal to quash their claims of having had sex with Trump.\n\nCohen pleaded guilty to a federal campaign finance violation for his role in the affair and served time in prison.\n\nBragg's office said the Trump organization made a total of 34 false entries in business records to conceal the $130,000 payment. Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, has said she would be willing to testify.\n\nUnder New York law, falsification of business records can be a misdemeanor. But the charges can be elevated to felonies by alleging they were committed with the intent to defraud, such as by committing another crime or concealing another crime.\n\n'The stakes are very high,' legal expert says\n\nShan Wu, a white-collar defense lawyer who has served as counsel to former Attorney General Janet Reno, called it a serious case despite initial legal commentary that the prosecution was the “least important” against Trump or “kind of silly.”\n\n“The stakes are very high,” Wu said. “Certainly prison time is a possibility.”\n\nKaren Agnifilo, a former Manhattan prosecutor now in private practice, compared the local charges to mail fraud or wire fraud charges at the federal level. “This is pretty serious and this is certainly worthy of bringing,” Agnifilo said.\n\nWu and Andrew Weissmann, a former general counsel to the FBI, and prosecutor for special counsel Robert Mueller, each said falsified financial records and hush money were the tools for alleged election interference because Trump is accused of trying to hide information that could have tipped the results.\n\n“It really was about election interference,” Wu said.\n\nContributing: Associated Press\n\nMore:Former Trump fixer Michael Cohen acknowledges submitting AI-generated fake case citations", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/06/politics/trump-organization-fraud-trial-verdict/index.html", "title": "Trump Organization found guilty on all counts of criminal tax fraud ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA Manhattan jury has found two Trump Organization companies guilty on multiple charges of criminal tax fraud and falsifying business records connected to a 15-year scheme to defraud tax authorities by failing to report and pay taxes on compensation for top executives.\n\nThe Trump Corp. and Trump Payroll Corp. were found guilty on all charges they faced.\n\nDonald Trump and his family were not charged in this case, but the former president was mentioned repeatedly during the trial by prosecutors about his connection to the benefits doled out to certain executives, including company-funded apartments, car leases and personal expenses.\n\nThe Trump Organization could face a maximum of $1.61 million in fines when sentenced in mid-January. The company is not at risk of being dismantled because there is no mechanism under New York law that would dissolve the company. However, a felony conviction could impact its ability to do business or obtain loans or contracts.\n\nThe guilty verdict comes as Trump is under scrutiny by federal and state prosecutors for his handling of classified documents, the effort to overturn the 2020 election results, and the accuracy of the Trump Organization’s business records and financial statements. He is also facing a $250 million civil lawsuit from the New York attorney general alleging he and his adult children were involved in a decade-long fraud. The attorney general is seeking to permanently bar them from serving as an officer or director of a company in New York state, among other penalties.\n\nTrump Org. attorneys said they plan to appeal.\n\n“This was a case about greed and cheating,” Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said. “The Trump Corporation and the Trump Payroll Corporation got away with a scheme that awarded high-level executives with lavish perks and compensation while intentionally concealing the benefits from the taxing authorities to avoid paying taxes. Today’s verdict holds these Trump companies accountable for their long-running criminal scheme.”\n\nWhen asked on “CNN This Morning” Wednesday why charges weren’t brought against the former president, Bragg said the investigation is ongoing.\n\n“This was a chapter in it. A case against the corporations,” Bragg said.\n\nCNN senior legal analyst and former federal prosecutor Elie Honig said Bragg’s approach has been vindicated.\n\n“Obviously, this is a setback for the Trump Org. – a major setback for the Trump Org. They’ve now been found guilty of criminal conduct, criminal tax fraud,” Honig told CNN’s Victor Blackwell on “Newsroom.”\n\n“It’s also a victory of sorts for the Manhattan district attorney,” Honig said. “Their theory, now, that part of the income for employees, including Allen Weisselberg, was paid through fringe benefits in order to avoid tax liability – that theory has been vindicated.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear what jurors in Trump Org. trial said about Trump 03:29 - Source: CNN\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass told the jury in closing arguments that Trump “explicitly sanctioned” tax fraud and urged them to reject the defense’s argument that former Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg was a rogue employee motivated by his own personal greed.\n\n“This whole narrative that Donald Trump is blissfully ignorant is just not true,” Steinglass said.\n\nThe jury heard that Trump agreed on a whim to pay the private school tuition for his Weisselberg’s grandchildren and signed a lease for a Manhattan apartment to shorten the executive’s commute. Trump personally signed his employees’ bonus checks at Christmas time and he initialed a memo reducing the salary of another top executives, which prosecutors said suggested he knew all along about the fraudulent scheme.\n\nProsecutors alleged for years top executives reduced their reported salaries by the amount of company-issued fringe benefits to avoid paying the required taxes.\n\nWeisselberg, who is on paid leave from the company, spent three days on the witness stand. He pleaded guilty to 15 felonies for failing to pay taxes on $1.76 million in income. As part of his plea deal, he will be sentenced to five months in jail if the judge finds that he testified truthfully.\n\nTrump Org. attorney Susan Necheles pledged to appeal, laying all the blame for any wrongdoing on Weisselberg.\n\n“Why would a corporation whose owner knew nothing about Weisselberg’s personal tax returns be criminally prosecuted for Allen Weisselberg’s personal conduct, for which they had no visibility or oversight? This case was unprecedented and legally incorrect,” Necheles said in a statement. “We will appeal this verdict.”\n\nWeisselberg’s key testimony\n\nIn his testimony Weisselberg admitted he should have paid taxes on compensation, totaling roughly $200,000 in one year, which included a luxury Manhattan apartment overlooking the Hudson River, two Mercedes Benz car leases, parking, utilities, furniture and private school tuition for his grandchildren. He also testified that he paid himself and other executives’ bonuses as though they were independent consultants – enabling the Trump companies to evade paying taxes on them.\n\nWeisselberg testified that he pulled off the scheme with the help of his underling, Trump Organization controller Jeffrey McConney. McConney, who received immunity for testifying before the grand jury, admitted to some of the illegal conduct in his testimony.\n\nAfter Trump was elected president, Weisselberg testified, there was a “clean up” and many of the illegal practices stopped.\n\nHe revealed conversations he had with Trump, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., but told the jury when questioned by the Trump attorneys that he did not scheme or conspire with anybody in the Trump family.\n\nWeisselberg became emotional at times, telling the jury he was “embarrassed” by his conduct and that he “betrayed” the Trump family, who has been his employer for 49 years.\n\nProsecutors and defense attorneys called out Weisselberg’s split loyalties – wanting to live up to his plea deal and serve a lower jail sentence and his loyalty to the Trump family, who could pay him $1 million in compensation this year.\n\n‘In behalf of’\n\nTo prove the company’s guilt, prosecutors needed to demonstrate that Weisselberg or McConney was a “high managerial agent” who committed the crimes in the scope of his employment and “in behalf of” the company.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers went in circles arguing over what “in behalf of” meant.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan also struggled over how to explain the phrase to the jury and turned to two legal treaties to fashion a definition.\n\nThe judge explained it to the jury, saying, “Under the definition of ‘in behalf of,’ it is not necessary that the criminal acts actually benefit the corporation. But an agent’s acts are not ‘in behalf of’ a corporation if they were undertaken solely to advance the agents own interest. Put another way, if the agent’s acts were taken merely for personal gain, they were not ‘in behalf of’ the corporation.”\n\nAlan Futerfas, an attorney for the Trump Payroll Corporation, told reporters following the verdict the conclusion was incorrect.\n\n“A novel and really interesting issue developed during the trial. Obviously, the definition of ‘in behalf of’ – what that means. And we filed a lot of papers, the defense team, about what those words mean,” Futerfas said. “The judge recognized there was not a lot of definition on that at all and surely that will be one of the arguments we will make.”\n\nWeisselberg walked a fine line in his testimony, telling the jury he never wanted to hurt the company, he was driven by greed and mainly wanted to pay less in taxes. But, he also said, he knew at the time the company would benefit to some degree from his schemes.\n\nIn his testimony Weisselberg said, “It was a benefit to the company but primarily it was due to my greed.” He told the jury that the company saved money by paying less taxes on his off-the-books compensation and acknowledged when asked by prosecutor Susan Hoffinger if, while his primary goal was to avoid taxes, it also created a benefit to the company.\n\n“To some degree, yes,” Weisselberg testified.\n\nWeisselberg said he and McConney knew at the time that the company would pay less payroll taxes through the scheme although he said they never discussed it explicitly.\n\nThe Trump attorneys argued, repeatedly, to the jury that “Weisselberg did it for Weisselberg” to emphasize that he was motivated solely by his personal greed.\n\nOn cross examination, Weisselberg agreed that the decision to not pay taxes was his and made solely to benefit himself.\n\n“That was my intent,” Weisselberg said when questioned by the Trump attorneys, “to benefit myself.”\n\nThe lawyers for the Trump entities called just one fact witness, the real estate companies’ long-time accountant Donald Bender from Mazars USA, which dropped Trump as a client earlier this year.\n\nTrump attorneys said Bender was either aware of the off-the-books compensation or should have caught the tax fraud and they accused him of lying on the stand.\n\nWhen questioned by prosecutors Bender testified that he trusted and relied on Weisselberg, who testified that he hid the illegal scheme.\n\nSteinglass, the prosecutor, told the jury the Trump companies were guilty, and the illegal scheme was concocted “so the employees can get more net pay while costing the Trump Corporation less. It’s a win-win – unless you’re the tax authorities.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Kara Scannell Lauren Del Valle", "Kara Scannell", "Lauren Del Valle"], "publish_date": "2022/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/08/24/trump-surrender-arrested-georgia-election-live-updates/70662098007/", "title": "Donald Trump arrest photo from Fulton County jail marks historic first", "text": "Trump surrendered for booking at Fulton County jail and was released on $200,000 bond, for which he was required to post 10%.\n\nTrump faces 13 charges, including racketeering, soliciting state officials to violate their oaths of office, making false statements and conspiring to recruit alternate presidential electors.\n\nATLANTA − Donald Trump was arrested Thursday evening at Georgia’s Fulton County Jail on charges he tried to steal the 2020 election, the fourth criminal case he faces while campaigning for president next year.\n\nTrump is one of 19 defendants in the indictment that alleges racketeering by a criminal organization that tried to overturn the election results.

Bailey\n\nWhat is racketeering?\n\nThe federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act originated in 1970 to fight organized crime by allowing prosecutors to target people at the top of criminal organizations.\n\nStates then passed their own RICO laws so prosecutors could charge multiple people involved in a conspiracy together if they were working toward a common goal.\n\nGeorgia’s RICO law, adopted in 1980, makes it a crime to participate in, acquire or maintain control of an “enterprise” through a “pattern of racketeering activity” or to conspire to do so. The alleged scheme does not have to have been successful for a RICO charge to be proven.\n\n− Ryan Randazzo\n\nWhere is Fulton County?\n\nFulton County is located in northwest Georgia.

But defendants can have legal agreements that get them out of custody without having to post bail.\n\n“In this particular case, I don't expect anyone going into custody,” Timmons previously USA TODAY.\n\nThe time a booking takes depends on the person, Timmons added.

It includes the charges laid out against a person and is filed before a case can move forward in court, David Weinstein, a former federal and state prosecutor, previously told USA TODAY.\n\nWeinstein said that an indictment means a grand jury decided that there’s “more likely than not” enough evidence – based on testimony – to move forward with charging a person.

Georgia prosecutors allege Trump orchestrated a series of crimes with a common objective in mind – remaining in power despite his loss in the 2020 election.\n\nThe Georgia case is centered on the state’s RICO statute, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. The law was originally intended to combat organized crime, specifically aimed at prosecuting mafia bosses. Though the mafia is largely non-existent today, RICO laws are still used to battle other forms of criminal enterprise.\n\nRICO laws allow prosecutors to connect multiple crimes among multiple defendants for them to tell a clear story.

Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said Willis launched a fundraising website four days before the indictment was handed up, promoting her investigation into Trump. A county clerk inadvertently released the charges against Trump before the grand jury voted. And a judge barred Willis from investigating Lt. Gov. Burt Jones in the case because she held a fundraiser for his political opponent.\n\n“The timing of this prosecution reinforces concerns about your motivation,” Jordan wrote.\n\nJordan also questioned the timing of the indictment. Willis began her investigation in February 2021 and brought charges two and a half years later. She proposed the trial begin March 4, eight days before Georgia’s primary, when Trump is running for president and Willis is running for reelection.\n\n“It is therefore unsurprising many have speculated that this indictment and prosecution are designed to interfere with the 2024 presidential election,” Jordan said.\n\nJordan asked Willis to provide information by Sept. 7 about federal funding to her office and communications with Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith, who also charged Trump with interfering with the 2020 election.\n\nLegal experts and House Democrats argued Jordan was interfering with a local prosecution when he wrote a similar letter to Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who charged Trump with falsifying business records.\n\n–Bart Jansen\n\nRudy Giuliani's surrender demonstrated how Trump's arrest could be chaotic\n\nRudy Giuliani, a Trump lawyer and former federal prosecutor who was indicted with him, attracted a throng of reporters and a crowd of protesters supporting or opposing the charges when he surrendered at the Fulton County jail.\n\nGiuliani's political strategist, Ted Goodman, signaled to reporters he would give an impromptu statement after being booked. But he attempted to hold the gaggle in the middle of a two-lane street, which would have blocked traffic in an area sheriff's deputies spent hours trying to keep clear.\n\nResidents near the jail demanded vehicles be towed for parking along the neighborhood streets. One resident was so fed up with the national spotlight he screamed at people to leave the area while driving up the tiny road. The loudspeaker of a deputy's SUV blared orders for reporters to disperse.\n\nGiuliani’s team found another location, but reporters, protesters and body guards swarmed him before he took two paces out of his SUV.\n\n“This indictment is a travesty,” Giuliani said, as city crew workers began setting up portable toilets for tomorrow when Trump's booking is expected to bring an even larger crowd.\n\n– Phillip M.

This is not his only civil case.\n\nTrump is scheduled to go to trial again in January in a defamation lawsuit from E. Jean Carroll. The Justice Department earlier this year said the former president is not immune from a second defamation suit from Carroll that is pending against him over comments he made about her during his presidency.

There's no jury in the case, so the judge will decide on six other claims against the former president and his company.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James is seeking $250 million in penalties, as well as a ban on Trump doing business in the state. The judge’s ruling could force Trump to give up New York properties such as Trump Tower, a Wall Street office building, golf courses and a suburban estate.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nCameras in the courtroom just before Trump's trial\n\nThe judge did allow television and photographers into the courtroom - for a little while, before the hearing began.\n\nA television camera caught Trump at the defense table, James in the front row, and Judge Engoron on the bench before a photographer pool was escorted out of the room.\n\nPer usual, the trial itself is not being televised.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTrump's appearance in court is not required – and probably political\n\nDonald Trump doesn't have to be in a New York City courtroom today.

Indeed, Trump did not show up earlier this year for a sexual assault lawsuit filed by writer E. Jean Carroll.\n\nThis time around, however, Trump traveled to the courthouse with campaign aides as part of his entourage. At the same time, the campaign sent out fundraising emails, casting this lawsuit as part of an effort to derail his 2024 presidential campaign.\n\nTrump himself condemned the lawsuit (again) with an 8-minute campaign-style statement to reporters at the courthouse. After days of rumors, Trump confirmed he would attend the trial in a Truth Social post late Sunday night.\n\n\"I’m going to Court tomorrow morning to fight for my name and reputation,\" he said.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTrump claims ‘no crime’ in fraud case\n\nDonald Trump on Monday called the fraud case “election interference” and said no crime was committed. There is no evidence officials have targeted the former president's reelection bid.\n\nTrump argued that his properties are more valuable than appraisers or assessors found. He accused the attorney general and judge of corruption and said no crime was committed.\n\n“It’s a scam. It’s a sham.

Trump continued to insist the property is worth 50 to 100 times more than that.\n\nThe judge “is working diligently to misrepresent me, and my net worth, which is substantially MORE than is shown on my fully ‘disclaimed’ Financial Statements,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social. “I have not even included my most valuable asset - BRAND!”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nWhy isn’t Ivanka Trump part of the lawsuit?\n\nThe trial is the result of a $250 million lawsuit New York Attorney General Letitia James filed against Trump and several of his companies.\n\nOther defendants named in the case were executives in the company such as his sons, Eric and Donald Trump Jr., Allen Weisselberg and Jeffrey McConney.\n\nTrump’s daughter, Ivanka, wasn’t named as a defendant. But government lawyers have named her as a potential witness in the trial to determine what damages Trump and the companies must pay as a result of the fraud.\n\nGovernment lawyers didn’t have to say what they would ask her.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nLetitia James: ‘We won the foundation of our case’\n\nEarly Monday, Attorney General Letitia James reiterated her position that Trump for years “falsely inflated his net worth to enrich himself and cheat the system.”\n\n“We won the foundation of our case last week and proved that his purported net worth has long been rooted in incredible fraud,” James said in a statement, adding that she looked forward to “demonstrating the full extent of his fraud and illegality during trial.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nIs Trump's trial being televised?\n\nAn opening item of business for Trump's civil case: Whether to allow broadcast of the proceedings.\n\nNews organizations have asked Judge Arthur Engoron to allow cameras into the courtroom, at least for opening statements. No word yet on how the judge will decide, but the trial is expected to open at the top of the hour.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nIs Trump going to jail?\n\nNo, today the former president is facing a civil trial to determine how much he and his companies will be penalized for fraud. New York Attorney General Letitia James is seeking $250 million in damages.\n\nThat's different than the four sets of criminal charges that Trump faces.\n\nHe has been charged on the federal level with allegedly mishandling classified documents after he left office and attempting to steal the 2020 presidential election. In Georgia, he also faces allegations of trying to steal the 2020 race for the White House, and in New York state, he's accused of perpetrating a hush money scheme. Those cases to carry potential prison sentences.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nDonald Trump leaves for the courthouse, media in tow\n\nAs television cameras whirred, the former president departed Trump Tower en route to the courthouse.\n\nBroadcast choppers tracked the motorcade as it snaked south through the streets on Manhattan, just as they all did earlier this year as Trump went to a courthouse to plead not guilty to criminal charges in New York involving hush money.\n\nAgain, an army of media awaits Trump at the courthouse for this civil trial.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nA game of monopoly?\n\nLike a game of Monopoly, Trump may be forced to sell off his iconic properties under a New York judge's ruling that he committed fraud for years while building his real estate empire.\n\nAt stake is whether the former president will have to shutter or break up his namesake Trump Organization and sell off those famous properties − and whether he will have to pay millions.\n\nLast week, New York Supreme Court Justice Arthur Engoron canceled Trump's business certificates by ruling he committed fraud for years through \"pure sophistry,\" a \"fantasy world\" of real-estate valuations that \"can only be considered fraud.\"\n\nHe ruled that Trump companies often valued properties far higher than appraisers or tax assessors. Trump testified that a disclaimer on property values given to lenders meant they knew the estimates were “worthless,\" according to the decision.\n\nGovernment and defense lawyers have 30 days to submit proposals for who should manage what happens under the judge's ruling.\n\nLanguage accompanying Trump's estimated values acknowledged they “are not necessarily indicative of the amount that could be realized.” In a sworn deposition, Trump called it the “worthless clause” for stating property values are uncertain.\n\n“I think it had very little impact if any impact on the banks,” Trump said. “I felt it was a meaningless document.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/02"}]}

Kelly sentenced to 30 years in prison for federal racketeering and ...", "text": "New York CNN —\n\nDisgraced R&B singer R. Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison Wednesday following his conviction last year on federal racketeering and sex trafficking charges stemming from his efforts over years to use his fame to ensnare victims he sexually abused.\n\nProsecutors had asked the judge to sentence Kelly, 55, to more than 25 years behind bars, while his defense attorneys asked for 10 or fewer, saying prosecutors’ request was “tantamount to a life sentence.”\n\nSurvivors of Kelly’s abuse held hands and prayed as US District Court Judge Ann Donnelly began reading his sentence. Kelly – who wore a tan prison uniform, dark-rimmed glasses and a black mask at the hearing in federal court in Brooklyn – showed no emotion.\n\n“You left in your wake a trail of broken lives,” Donnelly told Kelly, whose full name is Robert Sylvester Kelly.\n\nIn deciding the sentence, Donnelly said she considered Kelly’s own traumatic childhood, during which his attorneys said he was repeatedly sexually abused by a family member and a landlord.\n\n“It may explain, at least in part, what led to your behavior,” the judge said. “It most surely is not an excuse.”\n\nJovante Cunningham, a former backup singer for Kelly, praised the sentence.\n\n“I started this journey 30 years ago,” Cunningham said outside the court after the hearing. “There wasn’t a day in my life up until this moment that I actually believed that the judicial system would come through for Black and brown girls. I stand here very proud of my judicial system, very proud of my fellow survivors and very pleased with the outcome.”\n\nA jury convicted Kelly last September on nine counts, including one charge of racketeering and eight counts of violations of the Mann Act, a sex trafficking law. Prosecutors from the Eastern District of New York accused Kelly of using his status as a celebrity and a “network of people at his disposal to target girls, boys and young women for his own sexual gratification.”\n\nThe five-week federal trial in Brooklyn included testimony from witnesses who said they were sexually and physically abused by Kelly. The court also heard from people involved with orchestrating the disgraced R&B singer’s 1994 marriage to the late singer Aaliyah when she was just 15 years old and he was an adult after she believed she’d gotten pregnant.\n\nKelly’s attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, said he would not address the court, pointing to the other criminal case faced by Kelly, but said before the sentence was read that her client “rejects that he is this monster.”\n\n“He accepts that he is a flawed individual,” Bonjean said, “but he is not this one-dimensional monster that the government has portrayed and the media has portrayed.”\n\nKelly made his only comment in response to the judge after Bonjean said he wouldn’t speak: “Yes, your honor, that’s my wish.”\n\nBonjean said she advised Kelly not to speak at the sentencing because of pending litigation against him, but added, “he has regrets. And he is sad. Nobody wants to hear what he heard today.”\n\nKelly and the judge are seen in a sketch of the sentencing. Sketch by Christine Cornell\n\n‘No one can undo the harm’\n\nPrior to sentencing, the court heard impact statements from seven of Kelly’s victims, including Jane Doe 2, who testified at trial.\n\n“It’s been 23 years since we knew each other, and you’ve victimized a lot of girls since then,” she said, addressing Kelly. She later added: “Now it’s your turn to have your freedom taken from you.”\n\n“No one can undo the harm that has been done to these victims,” attorney Gloria Allred, who represented three victims who testified, told reporters Wednesday outside court. “But at least it’s time for Mr. Kelly to be accountable.”\n\nDefense attorneys and prosecutors argued Wednesday in court over whether Kelly even could pay a fine. The defense said he is “pretty close to indigent” and could not. Prosecutors disagreed, saying money from the sale of some of his music rights and millions of dollars in royalties held by Sony could cover any fine.\n\nIn the nine months since his conviction, Kelly has replaced his entire legal team with Bonjean and her firm. Bonjean is the attorney who helped Bill Cosby get his sexual assault conviction overturned and also represented Cosby in a civil case he lost this month at trial.\n\n“We were prepared for it,” Bonjean said of the sentence outside the court. “We are now prepared to fight this appeal.”\n\nKelly is being held at a federal detention facility in Brooklyn and is expected to be moved back to Chicago, where he faces another federal trial in August on child pornography and obstruction charges.\n\nBonjean will ask for Kelly to continue to be held at the Brooklyn federal detention center as her team prepares for his upcoming trial, she told CNN on Thursday, adding she is based in New York. CNN has sought comment from the US Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Illinois, the Bureau of Prisons and US Marshals, who would be tasked with moving Kelly.\n\nKelly also has state cases pending in Illinois and Minnesota.\n\nChildhood trauma revealed\n\nIn over 14 hours of interviews with psychiatrist experts, Kelly said his closest relationship growing up was with his mother. His earliest memories were watching his mom perform as a singer in a band called “Six Pack,” and he would often accompany her to McDonald’s where she would drink coffee and they would share a pastry.\n\nKelly had never met his father and described his mother’s death as the most tragic event of his life, saying he would go to McDonald’s frequently to smell the coffee and remember her, according to a letter filed by Renee Sorrentino, a clinical assistant professor at Harvard Medical School.\n\n“To me, the ‘M’ stands for mom. Going to McDonald’s is always being around my mother,” Kelly said.\n\nBut his childhood was also marked by trauma.\n\nKelly saw a childhood sweetheart drown when he was a little boy. And people interviewed by psychiatrist experts say Kelly was repeatedly sexually abused beginning when he was a 6 or 7-year-old boy, his attorney wrote, saying he was abused by his older sister and also a landlord, at times on a “weekly basis.”\n\nSorrentino said in her letter Kelly’s childhood sexual abuse may have contributed to his “hypersexuality,” or difficulty controlling sexual urges, and believes it was a factor in his criminal convictions.\n\nWhile Kelly was convicted of sexual exploitation of a child, Sorrentino refused to diagnose Kelly with pedophilia because he told her his “sexual behavior has never involved prepubescent individuals,” she said.\n\nFaith, another woman who testified at Kelly’s trial, countered that defense argument Wednesday in her victim impact statement, saying her own father had also been sexually abused as a child but “never molested me.”\n\nSupport for the singer\n\nAmong the letters that asked for a shorter sentence for Kelly was one written by Diana Copeland, Kelly’s former assistant who testified as a government witness and said she wrote a letter in support of Kelly because it was the “right thing to do.”\n\n“God doesn’t want us to throw humans away,” Copeland wrote. “If we have the audacity to care for the perpetrators as well as the victims, we can all rise.”\n\nJoycelyn Savage, who was considered a victim of Kelly’s by prosecutors, also remains a supporter.\n\n“Robert and I are deeply in love and it breaks my heart that the government has created a narrative that I’m a victim,” Savage wrote. “I’m a grown woman, and can speak for myself which is why I wanted to provide this letter to the court.”\n\nIn her letter, Savage revealed she is now engaged to Kelly.\n\nProsecutors faced threats\n\nAhead of the sentencing, a Chicago man who had attended Kelly’s trial in Brooklyn was arrested and charged for making threats against the three US attorneys who prosecuted Kelly, a copy of his arrest warrant shows.\n\nChristopher Gunn was arrested Saturday for allegedly posting threats to kill or seriously injure the female prosecutors.\n\nAccording to the arrest warrant, Gunn posted video to his YouTube channel in October, shortly after Kelly was found guilty, that showed an image of the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York where the women work. Prosecutors believe a voice narrating the video is Gunn’s, and he says, “That’s where they at. That’s where they work at … We’re going to storm the office,” saying each of the three prosecutors’ names.\n\n“If you ain’t got the stomach for the sh*t we ‘bout to do, I’m asking that you just bail out,” he allegedly said in the video.\n\nProsecutors also analyzed a CashApp account linked to Gunn that shows multiple transactions from February 26, 2021, to June 1 that indicate Gunn “engaged in the sale of firearm ammunition in relation to the Kelly matter,” they said. Transactions included payments for $20 with descriptions saying “30 rounds.. free R kelly.” CNN has reached out to an attorney for Kelly for comment.\n\nProsecutors believe Gunn was planning to attend Kelly’s sentencing on Wednesday after he posted another video saying he had a “spot” for supporters to meet up near the courthouse.\n\nCNN has reached out to an attorney for Gunn, who is expected to have a detention hearing Friday. The session had been scheduled for Wednesday.", "authors": ["Sonia Moghe Dakin Andone", "Sonia Moghe", "Dakin Andone"], "publish_date": "2022/06/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2019/01/10/lady-gaga-apologizes-r-kelly-song-do-what-u-want/2534536002/", "title": "Lady Gaga pulls R.

Kelly was tried on charges of child pornography in Chicago in 2008. Kelly stood accused of making a 27-minute sex tape with an underage girl in 2002. The girl declined to testify, and it took only a few hours for a jury to declare him not guilty on all 14 counts.\n\n\"R.

Greenberg announced the change on Twitter Tuesday evening.\n\nWhy was Kelly in solitary confinement?

Kelly prison sentence: Prosecutors ask for 25 more years", "text": "Michael Tarm\n\nAssociated Press\n\nCHICAGO — Federal prosecutors Thursday asked a judge to give singer R. Kelly 25 more years in prison for his child pornography and enticement convictions last year in Chicago, which would add to 30 years he recently began serving in a New York case.\n\nThe 56-year-old wouldn't be eligible for release until he was around 100 if the judge agrees both to the 25-year sentence and another government request that Kelly begin serving his Chicago sentence only after the 30-year New York sentence is fully served.\n\nIn their sentencing recommendation filed late Thursday in U.S. District Court in Chicago, prosecutors described Kelly's behavior as \"sadistic,\" calling him \"a serial sexual predator\" with no remorse and who \"poses a serious danger to society.\"\n\n\"The only way to ensure Kelly does not reoffend is to impose a sentence that will keep him in prison for the rest of his life,\" the 37-page government filing says.\n\nKelly's sentencing in Chicago is set for Thursday next week.\n\nMore:R. Kelly convicted on child pornography charges in second federal trial verdict\n\nKelly's lawyer, Jennifer Bonjean, wrote in a filing last week that even with his existing 30-year New York sentence, \"Kelly would have to defy all statistical odds to make it out of prison alive.\" She cited data that the average life expectancy of inmates is 64.\n\nShe recommended a sentence of around 10 years, at the low end of the sentencing guidelines range, which she said could be served simultaneously with the New York sentence.\n\nIn arguing for the lesser sentence, Bonjean alleged Kelly, who is Black, was singled out for behavior that she said white rock stars have gotten away with for decades.\n\n\"None have been prosecuted and none will die in prison,\" she wrote.\n\nProsecutors acknowledged that a 25-year sentence in the Chicago case would be more time than even sentencing guidelines recommend. But they argued imposing a long sentence and instructing it be served only after the New York sentence was appropriate.\n\nMore:R. Kelly sentenced to 30 years in prison after NY sex trafficking conviction\n\n\"A consecutive sentence is eminently reasonable given the egregiousness of Kelly's conduct,\" the filing argued. \"Kelly's sexual abuse of minors was intentional and prolific.\"\n\nAt the trial in Chicago last year, jurors convicted the Grammy Award winning singer on six of 13 counts. But the government lost the marquee count that Kelly and his then-business manager successfully rigged his state child pornography trial in 2008.\n\nBoth of Kelly's co-defendants, including longtime business manager Derrel McDavid, were acquitted of all charges.\n\nKelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, rose from poverty in Chicago to superstardom, becoming known for smash hit \"I Believe I Can Fly\" and sex-infused songs such as \"Bump n' Grind.\"\n\nWhile the Grammy Award-winner went to trial in 2008, it wasn't until after the airing of Lifetime's 2019 docu-series, \"Surviving R. Kelly\" — featuring testimonials by his accusers — that criminal investigations were kicked into high-gear, ending with federal and new state charges.\n\nIn January, an Illinois judge dismissed state sex-abuse charges prior to a trial on the recommendation of Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx. Foxx said she was comfortable dropping the case because Kelly would spend decades in prison for his federal convictions.\n\nProsecutors at Kelly's federal trial in Chicago portrayed him as a master manipulator who used his fame and wealth to reel in star-struck fans to sexually abuse, in some cases to video record them, and then discard them.\n\nAfter deliberating over two days, jurors convicted Kelly of three counts each of producing child pornography and enticement of minors for sex, while acquitting him of obstruction of justice, one count of production of child porn and three counts of receiving child porn.\n\nThe Chicago verdict came months after a federal judge in New York sentenced Kelly to 30 years in prison for racketeering and sex trafficking.

Kelly child porn case: Sentenced to 20 years, 1 more year in jail", "text": "Staff and wire reports\n\nA judge sentenced R. Kelly, the once high-flying R&B star-turned-convicted sex offender, to 20 years in prison Thursday on another set of sex crimes, including several child pornography charges.\n\nBut 19 of those years will be served concurrently with his existing prison time, meaning only one year gets added to the end of his previous 30-year sentence.\n\nKelly, 56, was found guilty in September on three counts of child pornography and three counts of child enticement but was acquitted of a fourth pornography count, as well as a conspiracy to obstruct justice charge accusing him of fixing his state child pornography trial in 2008.\n\nHe is already serving 30 years for his 2021 racketeering and sex trafficking convictions in New York. U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber ordered that Kelly serve one year in prison following the racketeering sentence, imposed last year in New York.\n\nProsecutors in a sentencing memo last week recommended Kelly serve 25 additional years and that he serve it consecutively to the New York federal case sentence, meaning the former music star would essentially spend the rest of his life behind bars. With Thursday’s sentence, though, Kelly will serve no more than 31 years. That means he will be eligible for release at around age 80, providing him some hope of one day leaving prison alive.\n\nMore:R. Kelly sentenced to 30 years in prison after NY sex trafficking conviction\n\nProsecutors acknowledged a 25-year sentence would be higher than sentencing guidelines suggest, but argued Kelly’s \"desire to sexually abuse children is insatiable\" and such a sentence was required \"to protect the community from\" him.\n\nKelly’s lawyer, Jennifer Bonjean, asked for a sentence of around 10 years – on the low end of the guideline range.\n\nShe also requested in a series of pre-sentence filings that, whatever prison sentence Leinenweber imposed, he allow Kelly to serve it at the same time as the New York sentence.\n\nBonjean said a new consecutive sentence would be a \"second life sentence.\"\n\nMore:R. Kelly convicted on child pornography charges in second federal trial verdict\n\nWhat happened at the sentencing?\n\nLeinenweber said at the outset of the hearing that he did not accept the government’s contention that Kelly used fear to woo underage girls for sex.\n\n“The (government’s) whole theory of grooming, was sort of the opposite of fear of bodily harm,” the judge told the court. “It was the fear of lost love, lost affections (from Kelly). … It just doesn’t seem to me that it rises to the fear of bodily harm.”\n\nProsecutors say Kelly’s crimes against children and his lack of remorse justify the stiffer sentence.\n\nA calm Kelly spoke briefly at the start of the hearing, when the judge asked him if he had reviewed key pre-sentencing documents for any inaccuracies.\n\n“Your honor, I have gone over it with my attorney,” Kelly said. “I’m just relying on my attorney for that.”\n\nTwo of Kelly’s accusers asked the judge to punish him harshly.\n\nIn a statement read aloud in court, a woman who testified under the pseudonym \"Jane\" said she lost her early aspirations to become a singer herself and her hopes for fulfilling relationships.\n\n\"I have lost my dreams to Robert Kelly,\" the statement said. \"I will never get back what I lost to Robert Kelly. … I have been permanently scarred by Robert.\"\n\nThe woman was a key witness for prosecutors during Kelly’s trial; four of his convictions are tied to her.\n\n\"When your virginity is taken by a pedophile at 14 … your life is never your own,\" Jane’s statement read.\n\nAnother accuser, who used the pseudonym \"Nia,\" attended the hearing and addressed Kelly directly in court. Speaking forcefully as her voice quivered, Nia said Kelly would repeatedly pick at her supposed faults while he abused her.\n\n\"Now you are here … because there is something wrong with you,\" she said. \"No longer will you be able to harm children.\"\n\nR. Kelly found guilty on 6 counts in Chicago trial\n\nIn addition to the pornography and obstruction of justice charges that were tossed out, Kelly was also found not guilty on all three counts of conspiring to receive child pornography and for two further enticement charges.\n\nHis two co-defendants, associates Derrel McDavid and Milton Brown, were found not guilty on all charges. Jurors acquitted McDavid, a longtime Kelly business manager, who was accused of conspiring with Kelly to rig the 2008 trial. Brown, a Kelly associate for years, was acquitted of receiving child pornography.\n\nThe verdict followed a four-week trial and jurors deliberated for 11 hours over two days. Kelly faced 13 charges, filed in 2019, including producing child pornography, enticing a minor to engage in criminal sexual activity, and conspiracy to obstruct justice.\n\nIn Chicago, a conviction of just one count of child pornography carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years, while receipt of child pornography carries a mandatory minimum of five years.\n\nProsecutors rested their case on Aug. 30 after presenting two weeks of testimony, including from four Kelly accusers, in their effort to prove the singer enticed underage girls for sex, produced child pornography and successfully rigged his 2008 state trial.\n\nA fifth accuser, who prosecutors had said would testify, never did. They didn't explain why.\n\nThe key witness of the prosecutors' case, a 37-year-old woman who used the pseudonym \"Jane,\" testified early that Kelly sexually abused her hundreds of times starting in 1998 when she was 14 and Kelly was around 30.\n\nR. Kelly previously sentenced in New York, still facing another trial\n\nThe decision comes after a federal judge in New York sentenced Kelly to 30 years in prison in June for racketeering and sex trafficking.\n\nAfter six weeks of graphic testimony from dozens of accusers and witnesses, a jury deliberated two days before finding Kelly guilty on all nine counts of sex trafficking and racketeering. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison on June 29, 2022.\n\nBefore beginning his New York sentence, he had to face this second trial, in the Northern District of Illinois in Chicago. He's been in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Chicago where he has spent most of his time since his arrest in 2019.\n\nThe legal challenges for Kelly are not yet over.

The complaint names the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) of Brooklyn and its leading officials as well as the United States government as defendants.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, attorneys for Kelly called the detention center following his sentencing to learn of his status and employees repeatedly hung up on them, “laughed and were highly unprofessional.” CNN has reached out to the US Bureau of Prisons and has attempted to reach the MDC Warden for comment.\n\nBonjean earlier said she was told by prosecutors who spoke with prison officials Kelly, 55, was placed on suicide watch because he is well-known.\n\n“It’s punishment for being high-profile. And it’s horrifying frankly,” she said. “To put someone under suicide watch under those conditions is cruel and unusual when they don’t need it.”\n\n“MDC-Brooklyn has a policy of punishing high profile inmates by placing them under the harsh conditions of suicide watch even though they are not suicidal,” the lawsuit alleges.\n\nBonjean is also seeking a temporary restraining order to remove Kelly from confinement.\n\nBonjean said she had asked Kelly to email her after he was taken back into the federal facility following his sentencing Wednesday but never got an email from him. She hasn’t gotten answers about his status from the detention center until prosecutors requested information from the facility, Bonjean added.\n\nA jury convicted Kelly last September on nine counts, including one charge of racketeering and eight counts of violations of the Mann Act, a sex trafficking law.

Sarah Palin, \"All you have to do is go down Union Street with me in Wilmington and go to Katie's Restaurant or walk into Home Depot ... and you ask anybody in there whether or not the economic and foreign policy of this administration has made them better off in the last eight years.\"\n\nMembers of the Spiezio family jumped out of their chairs and cheered when he mentioned Katie's, said Andrew Calvarese, a great-grandson of its founders.\n\nBut national media roasted Biden, calling the mention a gaffe after News Journal reporters blogged that Katie's had closed many years earlier and wasn't on Union Street.\n\nKatie's opened in the early 1930s and later was sold to the Fugolinos, who were almost family, said founders' grandson Anthony Spiezio.\n\nFugolino and his mother sold the restaurant in the 1980s.

But Wilmington will be at least the nominal home base of his reelection effort, with a split screen to the White House.\"\n\nOn Tuesday as Biden's reelection campaign was announced, the New York Times' Peter Baker, chief White House correspondent, also pointed to Wilmington as Biden homebase for 2024.\n\n\"Even as Mr. Biden put off a formal kickoff to his re-election bid, his team had been quietly making plans for the coming campaign.

Aubrey Plaza uses SNL monologue to remind Biden who rules Delaware\n\nHe gave an update about COVID-19 at Hotel du Pont, gave numerous press conferences at The Queen and took over Chase Center on the Riverfront (and its parking lot) to celebrate his victory with his family and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nBut this time around, Wilmington will be fully open, out from under the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMore seasoned staffers will probably find themselves at the aforementioned Bardea, La Fia and Quoin, along with other more refined standouts such as Hotel du Pont's Le Cavalier, Tonic Seafood & Steak and Eclipse Bistro.\n\nWe can envision them possibly even staying in town on weekends to take strolls along the Riverfront, catching a film at Penn Cinema Riverfront 14 + IMAX or trying out the Jack A. Markell Trail. Although, a 40-minute drive to Philadelphia or a two-hour train ride back home to their families in Washington, D.C., may lure them away.\n\nFor the younger crowd, the Riverfront's Constitution Yards Beer Garden with its large outdoor deck and view of the Christina River should be a draw. Downtown, The Queen and The Grand could bring in some music fans, as well as Orange Street's if-you-know-you-know jazz bar Nomad.\n\nAnd across town, the dense nightlife district in the city's Trolley Square area with 10 bars in three blocks is prime for staffers looking to let loose, leaving their business suits behind.\n\nWhat we should expect\n\nDuring the Biden campaign's time in Delaware last time around, the Wilmington area got a Biden bump and plenty of attention even with the city zipped up pretty tight.\n\nHarris dined at Montchanin's Krazy Kat's restaurant, Wilmington Brew Works got some free publicity on national television when Fox News' Peter Doocy hoisted a four-pack of Biden beer dubbed Rail Car One on air, and an array of restaurants, hotels and other businesses got a boost in business from the campaign.\n\nHarris and her family stayed at The Inn at Montchanin Village & Spa, located on the same property as Krazy Kat's with the campaign paying $67,670 for the stay, according to campaign finance reports.\n\nThe reports shed light on other spending, perhaps hinting at where more campaign spending could be headed over the next 1½ years.\n\nHotels such as The Westin Wilmington ($67,155), Homewood Suites ($50,180) and Wilmington Riverfront Hotel XXXIV LLC, an LLC registered to the Buccini/Pollin Group ($26,313), all got in on the feeding frenzy. So did Platinum Dining Group's Italian restaurant Capers & Lemons with a $2,501 tab and Janssen's Market, the Greenville gourmet grocer on Kennett Pike, which accounted for $1,367 in spending.\n\nThis time around hotels and restaurants surely will earn more of that campaign cash.

As of this point in his presidency, Biden has spent more than a quarter of his time working from his home state of Delaware, either at his house in Wilmington or his Rehoboth Beach property.\n\nSome 21 months into his term, Biden has made 55 visits to Delaware, totaling some or all of 174 days as of Sunday, according to a CNN analysis of presidential schedules and a tally kept by Mark Knoller, the longtime unofficial statistician of the White House press corps. In addition, Biden has made 19 visits, or all or part of 64 days, to the Camp David presidential retreat in rural Maryland.\n\nHe has now surpassed even the getaway time of former President Donald Trump, so often criticized by Democrats for his regular departures from the White House to stay at one of his personal homes. At this point in his tenure, Trump had spent about 135 days at either his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, or his home at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Trump also had spent 23 days at Camp David.\n\n“President Biden is deeply proud of his roots and his family and it has been a staple of his time in public life to never lose touch with either,” White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates said to CNN. “Presidents of the United States are constantly on the job, regardless of their location – whether they’re on a state visit overseas or just 100 miles from the White House for a short trip to Wilmington, DE. And as all Americans can agree, it’s important for leaders to avoid becoming ensconced in Washington, DC.”\n\nThe comforts of home can be a salve for the commander in chief while carrying out one of the world’s most demanding jobs. The American president is never truly “off,” and – in fact – Biden, like all presidents, has a whole remote White House apparatus that travels with him to facilitate that round-the-clock enterprise, with the most state-of-the-art capabilities, resources and technology traveling with him wherever he goes.\n\nSome argue that Biden can now lean into the normalcy of working from home, which millions of Americans had to rely on when Covid-19 forced isolation from offices and public spaces. “WFH” is not just a shorthand for being productive at the home office, it’s become a professional way of life for many.\n\n“It is 2022, not 1922. If the rest of the country can work from home, so can the president of the United States,” said Michael LaRosa, a director at a DC-based public affairs firm and former press secretary to first lady Dr. Jill Biden.\n\n“He spent (practically) every weekend in Delaware during his 36 years in the Senate, and his eight years as vice president,” LaRosa said. “This is nothing new. The Bidens have never lived in Washington, DC.” When he was a senator, Biden commuted back to Delaware almost every night by train – earning the nickname “Amtrak Joe” – and the train station in Wilmington is named for him.\n\nThe physical presence of a president is, however, meaningful for some, at least in ritual.\n\nThe statistics – 236 days away from the White House in Delaware and Maryland in less than two years on the job – are significant for the modern presidency. The job has been set in the nation’s capital near the Congress and the Supreme Court, in part for its symbolic power, for more than 220 years. Being in that power center brings a higher level of transparency thanks to the proximity to the national media, along with White House rules about press access and public records about who comes and goes.\n\nWhenever the president is actually in the Oval Office, for example, that presence is honored by the solemn watch of a stone-faced US Marine posted outside the West Wing.\n\n“A special challenge that Biden faces, because of his age, is that people will assume the worst if he’s not always visible. That is something that comes with being the oldest president in office,” said Tim Naftali, a CNN presidential historian, who notes presidents have had a “moveable Oval Office” for decades. “Perception is important in American politics.”\n\nThe optics of WFH or WFWH\n\nA president of the United States who doesn’t consider the White House his primary home does not go unnoticed by the media, or critics. But the executive mansion’s primary residents have generally found it stifling.\n\n“I always say I don’t know whether it’s the finest public housing in America or the crown jewel of the prison system,” former President Bill Clinton famously mused during a 1993 interview.\n\nKnoller, who during his 32-year career with CBS News covered the personal habits of six presidents, concurs.\n\n“It may look luxurious, but it can be suffocating to live and work there day in and out,” Knoller said.\n\nTrump’s trips to Mar-a-Lago and Bedminster were fodder for op-eds and lent themselves to critics painting a portrait of a president unwilling to give up the trappings of a luxe off-duty lifestyle. And though many days were spent on the golf course – 125 or so at this point in Trump’s presidency, compared to Biden’s 19 on the links – Trump was still the leader of the free world. Biden’s former boss, Barack Obama, traveled home much less frequently while in office but was frequently dinged – by Trump, among others – for the amount of golf he played.\n\n“(Ronald) Reagan and (George W.) Bush both spent lots of time at their private ranch homes,” said Knoller of two other former presidents who escaped the White House with regularity.\n\nKnoller tabulated time away for presidents, he says, because the numbers “added color to my reporting and gave insight to the president’s needs and activities.”\n\nAccording to Knoller’s count, George W. Bush spent all or part of 490 days – more than a year – at his Texas ranch during his eight years in office. Reagan spent nearly a year, all or part of 349 days, at his California ranch during his two terms. If Biden were reelected and kept up his current pace of trips to Delaware until the end of a second term in office, he would far surpass both Reagan and Bush in time away from the White House.\n\nHowever, post-pandemic culture has blurred the boundaries of what defines a workplace.\n\n“Our concept of being ‘on the job’ has shifted, and that may actually change the way we think about where our president needs to be,” Naftali said.\n\nSome of Biden’s biggest political wins came this summer, after all, when he was isolating in the residence of the White House after testing positive for Covid-19. Photos showed him tie-less, often working in the second-floor Treaty Room or reading papers with his feet up on the Truman balcony, Commander by his side.\n\nIt was a view into what Biden’s work from home life may be like when he’s in Wilmington or Rehoboth.\n\n“It’s a bit antiquated to think that because he is not physically in the White House on the weekends, that he is not working,” LaRosa said. “He never stops being President and he never stops working. Just ask the first lady.”\n\nA weekly ritual\n\nBiden has the advantage of a more normalized routine in his trips away from Washington.\n\nThe White House residence staff has by now perfected the choreography of managing, packing and planning the departure of the President and first lady most Fridays, the day, statistically, the Bidens normally split town.\n\nThe ushers know which bags are to be brought downstairs – it’s a light-pack, most of the couples’ needed belongings are already in their Delaware homes, a person familiar tells CNN. While Biden occasionally plays golf at a local course when in Wilmington, his other activities – seeing his grandchildren, taking casual social visits, going to church – don’t require multiple outfit changes.\n\nIn Rehoboth, he rides his bike and he and the first lady like to set up a big, blue umbrella on the sandy beach in front of their house and sunbathe or read in reclining chairs. Outside of swimsuits, joggers and polo shirts, it’s not a multiple-suitcase situation.\n\n“The biggest issue is usually the pets,” said the person familiar with the weekend planning for a presidential getaway to Delaware.\n\nCommander, now one year old and no longer a small puppy, and Willow, the barn cat adopted by Jill Biden, are “almost always” on the Delaware visits. While many American families leave their pets at home with caretakers for the weekend, or book them at pet-sitting facilities, the Bidens take theirs with them.\n\nThey like to be around their pets at all times – when Joe Biden was isolating at the White House with Covid-19 this summer, he was kept company by Commander; likewise, when Jill Biden had her bout with Covid, she spent the her rebound case isolation period in Rehoboth, with Willow.\n\nThe animals frequently travel to Delaware via van, with support staff, but occasionally they are in vehicles solely dedicated to their transportation, says the person. Willow, in particular, is not a fan of noisy, whirring helicopter blades, said another person familiar with the feline’s habits. In June, there was a rare sighting by White House press members of Willow in her crate, being carried by a residence staffer to Marine One for a weekend at Rehoboth Beach.\n\nThe Biden’s Delaware visits, of course, no matter how quick, have a significant footprint beyond those of the paws of their pets.\n\nSecret Service coordinates with law enforcement on all movements – several highway exits must close for the presidential motorcade, locals in both Wilmington and Rehoboth must at times wait on traffic patterns or be swept by agents with handheld magnetometers just to walk down the beach if one of the Bidens is there, as one neighbor of the Bidens in Rehoboth Beach told CNN.\n\nThe large presidential apparatus helps ensure that the President is able to perform his duties with the full input of his advisers, even if they’re not with him in person.\n\n“Unless we discover his being away from Washington results in him bobbling the ball as JFK did on the eve of the Bay of Pigs operation, there shouldn’t be an issue,” says Naftali, referring to Kennedy’s canceling of an air strike on a Sunday, without full consultation and full consideration, a move the former President later regretted.\n\n“But if Biden is in touch virtually and telephonically, in this era, leadership doesn’t have to involve always being physically present in Washington, D.C.”", "authors": ["Kate Bennett"], "publish_date": "2022/10/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2020/08/24/downtown-dining-wilmingtons-hotel-du-pont-resumes-sept-1/3373511001/", "title": "Downtown dining at Wilmington's Hotel du Pont resumes Sept. 1", "text": "Back in June, when the Caesar Rodney equestrian statue was removed from downtown Wilmington's Rodney Square with little warning, Tyler Akin says he briefly reconsidered the name of his new Delaware restaurant.\n\nThe Hotel du Pont's Le Cavalier at the Green Room on West 11th Street, which overlooks Rodney Square, is set to open Sept. 1.\n\nThe name Le Cavalier, French for the horseman, was a nod to the statue, a city landmark, that was hauled away and stored in an unknown location amid a nationwide reckoning over race and inequality.\n\nRodney, famous for his ride to Philadelphia in a thunderstorm to cast a vote for independence and sever political connections to Great Britain, was a slave owner. It's not known when or if the statue will return.\n\n\"That event, the removal [of the statue], we would be silly if it didn't make us pause and reconsider,\" Akin says. \"But at the end of the day, the grounding of that name was so much deeper than the statue.\"\n\nThe Le Cavalier name will remain because it also reflects the history of horsemanship in the du Pont family who built the hotel, he says. Perhaps the most famous example is Allaire du Pont, who owned Hall of Famer Kelso, widely considered one of the best racehorses in U.S. history.\n\nThe deliberation over Le Cavalier's name is just another part of a string of roadblocks Akin, a Philadelphia restaurateur who grew up in Wilmington, has faced since trying to open the French brasserie in the Hotel du Pont.\n\nAkin is more than ready for customers to witness the unveiling of the restaurant that has been in works since the ornate, lavish and very formal Green Room was closed for refurbishing in mid-January.\n\nMore:Hotel du Pont reopens, but lays off executive chef and other employees\n\nAkin owns two Stock restaurants and is a part owner of Res Ispa, all in Philadelphia. But for the past few months, he has been cooling his heels.\n\nIndoor dining in Philadelphia restaurants was halted in March, and it has had a devastating effect on the industry. Unlike Delaware, dining rooms in Philadelphia have not been allowed to welcome any customers. Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney recently announced that dining could resume, albeit with restrictions, on Sept. 8.\n\nAkin says he is glad he has been able to focus his downtime on Le Cavalier.\n\n\"It's the bright, shiny spot in my life right now,\" he says. \"I'm so fortunate to have it. It's been almost two years in making.\"\n\nLe Cav, as Akin calls it, originally was supposed to open in May, but the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing delays of some design components coming from Europe pushed the opening back.\n\nAnother recent curveball was the Democratic National Convention's sudden move from Milwaukee to Wilmington. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his vice presidential pick, Sen. Kamala Harris, also held some events at the Hotel du Pont in August, and security in the building was tight.\n\nWhen patrons do come to Le Cav for dinner, which will be served from 5 to 10 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday, they'll see big changes.\n\nThe heavy, velvet drapery and faded wall-to-wall carpet are gone from the room that last received a makeover in 2004 from the Washington, D.C.-based design firm Leo A. Daly, prime architect of the National World War II Memorial.\n\nMore:Drum roll, please: Here's the new name for the Hotel du Pont's Green Room\n\nWhen workers a few months ago pulled up the old carpet, they weren't sure what was underneath. Akin says they planned to put down tile, but that idea was scrapped when they uncovered a design treasure.\n\n\"Lo and behold, we found what looked like a priceless, hand-laid terrazzo floor,\" he says.\n\nThe mosaic floor, which hasn't seen the light of day in at least 50 years, \"was in a shabby state.\"\n\nAkin says the PM Hotel Group, operating the site for owners the Buccini/Pollin Group, \"didn't take the easy way out. They brought in some conservation experts.\"\n\nMany former Green Room elements are still in place. The fumed oak paneling, plaster ceiling and heavy, Spanish chandeliers remain, but there are now fitted with brighter, more modern lighting.\n\n\"The beauty of the design we created with Stokes Architecture + Design is it honors the lineage,\" Akin says.\n\nThe biggest change in the 118-seat dining room is the addition of a 13-seat bar with a marble top on the 11th Street side of the restaurant. Akin says it is the room's centerpiece.\n\nThere are now also a series of crushed, burnt orange velvet and leather banquettes on a west side wall along Market Street wall and more marble tabletops.\n\n\"We are done with the white linens,\" Akin says.\n\nThe artwork is mid-20th-century French-style paintings influenced by the Dada art movement, rather than the Brandywine School of Art from the Wyeth family that had once graced other parts of the Hotel du Pont.\n\nThe restaurant also will have seasonal outdoor patio seating. Not all seating will be used inside the dining room during the COVID-19 pandemic. Indoor capacity in Delaware remains at 60%.\n\nAkin, who is moving to Delaware soon, plans to be in the Le Cavalier kitchen almost every day cooking dishes that will have a Provençal slant with Middle Eastern and North African influences.\n\nThe menu includes steak tartare, scallop crudo and fin d’Été salad or grilled corn and peaches with heirloom tomatoes, lemon tahini and garlic breadcrumbs.\n\nEntrees will range from roasted half chicken to cheeseburgers to trout amandine. The menu no longer includes a crab cake but has gnocchi Parisienne made with jumbo lump crab meat, caviar and lemon beurre blanc.\n\nAkin, who had been a chef at Philadelphia's famed Zahav restaurant before owning his own establishments, plans dinner-only service for about a month.\n\n\"We are monitoring hotel occupancy,\" he says, which is looking stronger in the upcoming weeks.\n\nRoom service there will be branded as Le Cavalier, he says, but banquet service will remain a separate entity and will be handled by other hotel staffers.\n\nThe Hotel du Pont shut down for three months in March due to the coronavirus pandemic. When it reopened in late June, it laid off 11 employees, including its executive chef and managers in its food and banquet department.\n\nAkin says large gatherings at the hotel \"are facing their own uncertainty right now.\"\n\nHiring for a new restaurant is always a challenge, Akin says, but \"we're really excited to have back some of the old team. A lot of the old regulars are going to recognize some faces.\"\n\nBreakfast, lunch and weekend brunch will return in coming weeks, but buffets, on hold by state mandates due to the pandemic, will likely not be making a comeback.\n\n\"That wasn't a part of the plan,\" Akin says, even before COVID-19.\n\nContact Patricia Talorico at (302) 324-2861 or ptalorico@delawareonline.com and on Twitter @pattytalorico", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/08/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/10/22/fact-check-joe-biden-owns-2-homes-pictured-viral-meme/3720570001/", "title": "Fact check: Joe Biden owns 2 the 4 homes pictured in a viral meme", "text": "The claim: Biden owns four homes worth $3M million-$7.5M million\n\nWith the election just days away, Democratic nominee Joe Biden’s adversaries continue to push false narratives about his finances to try to raise doubt around \"Middle Class Joe's\" trustworthiness.\n\n“Bidens 4 3.7.5 million-dollar homes on a 200k a year salary,” reads a meme posted to Facebook Oct. 20.\n\nThe meme shows four of Biden’s current, temporary and previous homes, most of which cost less than $3 million.

He nicknamed the home “The Station” and used it as campaign headquarters during his 1988 election run.\n\nHe bought the 10,012-square-foot home in disrepair for $185,000. He spent two decades renovating and living in it before selling it for $1.2 million in February 1996.

News Journal\n\nBeau Biden was hospitalized Tuesday to undergo cancer testing\n\nBiden also made visits to hospitals in Chicago and Philadelphia after driving to Indiana for a family vacation\n\nRestaurant owner said Biden appeared %27fit as a fiddle%27 when he ate with a group Monday\n\nWILMINGTON, Del. -- Hours before Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden visited a renowned cancer hospital in Houston for tests on Tuesday, he shared a moment with his wife and others at an Italian restaurant after dinner in the city.\n\n\"Touched by all your well wishes – thank you. Nice evening in Houston w/ Hallie; will share update when we have it,\" Biden wrote in a tweet that he sent Tuesday morning, along with a photo of he and his wife, to thousands of supporters.\n\nBiden, 44, spent part of his day Tuesday at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, a source close to the attorney general said.\n\nThe second-term Democrat had suffered a mild stroke more than three years ago and last week became \"weak and disoriented\" after driving to Indiana for a family vacation, triggering visits to hospitals in Chicago, Philadelphia and now Texas, his spokesman said.\n\nBiden's father, Vice President Joe Biden, was in Houston on Tuesday with \"no public events scheduled,\" according to his office. Biden also was with his oldest son in Houston on Monday, the White House said in a statement.\n\nThe Anderson teaching hospital has been ranked by U.S. News & World Report as the nation's best hospital for cancer treatment the past seven years.\n\nJason P. Miller, Beau Biden's spokesman, said Tuesday he could not confirm that his boss was being treated at Anderson.\n\n\"We have no additional information to provide,'' Miller said. \"We have no update on his status or condition.''\n\nOn Monday night, though, Biden seemed \"fit as a fiddle\" when he ate dinner with his wife, father, stepmother and several other people, including Secret Service agents, at D'Amico's Italian Market Café in Houston, owner Nash D'Amico said Tuesday.\n\n\"He was friendly and healthy and hungry,\" D'Amico said. Beau snapped a picture of D'Amico and the vice president, and posed for one as well, he said.\n\nD'Amico said he asked Beau Biden why he was in town, and he replied that he was in Houston for \"some testing.\"\n\nD'Amico said he hopes Biden's condition isn't serious. \"All we can do is pray for him,\" the restaurateur said.\n\nPrevious stroke\n\nOn May 12, 2010, Beau Biden was rushed to Christiana Hospital after complaining of a headache, numbness and paralysis. He was transferred to Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia and kept for observation until May 18, 2010.\n\nHe soon returned to the Office of the Attorney General, a post to which he was elected in 2006. He was re-elected to a second four-year term in 2010. He has been raising money and is expected to seek re-election in 2014.\n\nEarlier this month, rescue crews were sent to Joe Biden's house in Greenville to respond to a report of a \"possible stroke,\" according to a dispatch on a police scanner that night. While reports related to the call did not identify Beau Biden as the source of the emergency, the dispatch was recorded at 9:25 p.m. on Aug. 1.\n\nCranston Heights sent a basic life support unit and New Castle County sent a paramedic unit and a supervisor to Joe Biden's house, but the call was soon canceled, a fire company official said that night, declining to be identified.\n\nBeau Biden's current medical problems were not made public until Monday night, when Miller issued a brief statement that said his boss had become \"weak and disoriented following a long drive to Indiana for a family vacation.\" The White House also issued a statement Monday night, saying that \"Beau is being evaluated to determine the cause of an episode of disorientation and weakness that he experienced.\"\n\nAfter falling ill Wednesday, Biden was admitted to the Northwestern University Hospital in Chicago, Miller's statement said. On Thursday morning, he was \"feeling better\" and consulted with his doctor at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia about his earlier symptoms, Miller said. Biden was discharged and spent the weekend at home.\n\nMiller also said Biden had spoken by phone to Chief Deputy Attorney General Ian McConnel over the weekend and had been in touch with his office Monday evening.\n\nOn Sunday, Biden tweeted a picture showing himself sitting by his father as they talked by phone with members of the Newark National Little League team about their trip to the Little League World Series.\n\nWith Biden still in Texas, one organizer of his $100-per-person fundraiser scheduled for tonight at the Lewes Yacht Club said he did not know whether the attorney general would attend.\n\nSpeaker of the House Pete Schwartzkopf, who is on the host committee for the event, said he has not been given any official word.\n\nBiden campaign staffer Molly Magarik would not comment.\n\nContributing: News Journal reporter Doug Denison", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/08/21"}]}

Better land use planning is needed, especially in flood-prone areas. When developing in areas that frequently flood, owners should always occupy the highest ground rather than a spot closest to the water. And dunes made out of natural material are preferable to hard rock walls for protection from rising tides.\n\n\"The report provides a framework for communities that will arm them for the reality of future extreme weather,\" said Jo-Ellen Darcy, the assistant secretary of the Army for Civil Works.\n\nFor Delaware, the report points to two high-risk areas: the shoreline of Delaware River and Bay and the resort areas on the Inland Bays.\n\nIt was the bay sides of Fenwick Island, South Bethany Beach, Bethany Beach and Dewey Beach that suffered the worst flood damage from Hurricane Sandy. Days after the storm, residents were still shoveling out mud, ripping out soggy drywall and discarding furniture and appliances that were ruined by flooding.\n\nEven undeveloped areas suffered. At Prime Hook National Wildlife Refuge, federal officials will spend an estimated $40 million to plug large areas where Delaware Bay surged into the adjacent marsh and cut new inlets. They will alter the marsh hydrology in an attempt to make the area more resilient in future storms.\n\nAnd even though the storm made landfall near Atlantic City and spared Delaware far worse damage, lower Delaware had heavy rainfall and more than 45,000 customers statewide were without power.\n\n\"Hurricane Sandy brought to light the reality that coastal storms are intensifying and that sea level change and climate change will only heighten the vulnerability of coastal communities,\" said Brig. Gen. Kent D. Savre, commanding general of the corps North Atlantic Division.\n\nThe Corps' assessment included a range of future extreme water level forecasts, based on different assumptions about climate change and sea-level rise. Even the moderate increase assumptions gave rise to an expectation that, in a century, storms will push water at Lewes more than 1 foot higher at least once a year than was seen during the height of Hurricane Sandy, the second-highest level on record at the Lewes Breakwater Harbor tide gauge.\n\nWorst-case sea level rise assumptions could annually push water along the Lewes shoreline more than five feet higher than was seen during Sandy, with storms seen about once a century driving water up 7.3 feet higher than Sandy's formidable mark.\n\nEven moderate Corps estimates of sea levels in the coming century show annual storm tides at Lewes more than a foot higher than Sandy, with a 1-in-10 chance every year for a storm with tides topping out at 1.8-feet higher than Sandy.\n\nThose same future high-water risks would occur all along Delaware Bay and Delaware River shorelines and well inland.\n\nJeffrey M. Bross, chairman of Delaware-based Duffield Associates, a regional engineering firm, said the Corps report was \"fairly draconian\" in its predictions. But the report is an important part of the public record that should drive meaningful discussion that leads toward solutions.\n\n\"I'm not sure I subscribe to the high sea level rise scenario, but in the work we do, we feel it's prudent to at least anticipate something in the low to moderate range,\" Bross said.\n\nBross said communities all along the coast already are struggling with the issue, including the City of New Castle, where discussions are under way on how far to go in dealing with gaps in dikes along the Delaware River.\n\n\"It's a subject for strong public debate. There are going to be opposing interests and there's got to be some reconciliation of those interests. This generation would be remiss if we did not begin planning for it, so we don't saddle the next generation with a bigger problem.\"\n\nMaya van Rossum, who directs the regional Delaware Riverkeeper conservation group, said that risks to areas along the Delaware River and Bay became clear decades ago.\n\n\"The parade of horribles as to who's going to get hit – to me, that's confirmation of everything we've been hearing along the way,\" van Rossum said.\n\n\"The question is: What are they suggesting we do about it? That and making sure that they're not suggesting sea walls and infrastructure that are simply doing things that are going to make it worse for other people.\"\n\nPreparations need to coincide with efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with rising global temperatures, climate change and sea level rise, van Rossum said.\n\n\"Part and parcel with that, we need to accept the reality that we have made some very poor choices about where and how we developed. It's time to pull back from the water's edge and move our families and communities up the hill, out of the flood plain, out of the flood zone so they can be permanently protected.\"\n\nThe Corps report acknowledged as much, saying that coastal communities \"face tough choices as they adapt local land use patterns while striving to preserve community values and economic vitality.\"\n\n\"In some cases, this may mean that, just as ecosystems migrate and change functions, human systems may have to relocate in a responsible manner to sustain their economic viability and social resilience,\" the report said in a preface.\n\nThe report recommends communities identify their acceptable level of risk and plan for the long term.\n\nDepending on the approach, costs are potentially huge.\n\nConstruction of storm surge barriers to protect flood-prone areas of the Christina River and Indian River Inlet, the Corps report estimated, would cost a combined $2.57 billion to construct, or an average annual cost of about $187 million. The barrier along the river would need to be about 1,250 feet long and 55 feet above the lowest water level, while the inlet height would have to be 800 feet long and more than 86 feet above the low water benchmark.\n\nAll along the cost, huge numbers of homes and public resources are at risk.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics recently released a report showing that more than 25,500 people work in more than 1,440 establishments inside Delaware's current flood zones – areas of hazard that reflect already outdated storm surge estimates.\n\nAbout $227.5 million in quarterly wages are at risk inside the areas statewide, with the largest share, more than 17,000 jobs and $132.8 million in quarterly wages, in Sussex County.\n\nHurricane Sandy proved both the risk and potential cost of coastal storms and extreme water levels along the Atlantic, the Corps pointed out, including to critical infrastructure like nuclear power plants.\n\nSalem Unit 1 at the Salem/Hope Creek nuclear complex was one of eight reactors on the East Coast affected by the storm, with Salem offline for seven days afterward. Salem Unit 2 was offline for refueling at the time, but four of six circulating water pumps in its companion Unit 1 were unavailable as a result of the storm, and debris and waves clogged the operation's critical water intake screens.\n\nA switching station at the plant, considered \"non-vital,\" was lost because of water intrusion, and several buildings lost power, with telephones, the plant's intranet and a weather station also knocked offline.\n\nThe adjacent Delaware River rose to 99.5 feet, more than 10 feet above normal. It was just below ground level at the plant, although the Salem units were designed for flooding 20 feet above the plant's ground level, with critical operating intakes 6 feet to 14 feet above that.\n\nIn a briefing for Nuclear Regulatory Commission officials in early January 2014, a Salem operations director said the company revised hurricane preparation and response plans based on Sandy disruptions. The changes included a requirement to assess threats to cooling water systems based on tides, wind-speed and hazards from grassy debris in the river. A shutdown is required if a hurricane passes within 50 miles of the site.\n\n\"We probably should have started discussing this in a more-serious vein 10 years ago,\" Bross said. \"Sandy has been a great catalyst because of all the devastation. It was a wake-up call, and we really need to begin moving forward with plans to deal with it.\"\n\nState environmental chief David Small said neither he nor his staff have reviewed the lengthy corps report, released Wednesday, but he believes it will be an important tool for providing a blueprint for future decisions, reducing future risk, and setting up a network where state, federal and local officials can better manage assets, such as funding across agencies to get better results.\n\nAnd, Small said, it will further the discussion that has already started in Delaware about the impacts both of climate change and sea-level rise.\n\n\"There's a lot to talk about,\" he said.\n\nState officials recognized that fact when they put together a sea-level rise assessment and began to look at costs and benefits of beach renourishment along the Delaware Bay shore, he said. In that discussion, the controversial topic of retreat – where homeowners are bought out now to avoid future risk and expensive infrastructure repair – was suggested though never acted upon.\n\n\"We know these are really tough questions\" but many of them get set aside in people's minds \"until the next big event,\" Small said.\n\nEven along the ocean coast, where beach renourishment is considered the key tool in sea-level rise and storm mitigation, the future isn't clear, he said.\n\nThere is a cost-share program in place with the state picking up the total local share, Small said. And right now there are available sand resources. But that might change in the future.\n\n\"We've got to look more forward,\" he said. \"Where do we need to be making these investments? Where do we need to stop making investments?\"\n\nThere is also the issue of the legacy pollution and chemical and petroleum complex along the Delaware River north of the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal.\n\nDuring Sandy, a 2,000 foot-long dike along the Delaware River was in danger of breaching, with the potential breakthrough of waves from the Delaware River threatening to wash across some of the state's most-toxic federal Superfund cleanup sites, spreading dangerous pollution. At one point, state workers resorted to emergency use of huge sandbags as storms broke across the area to prevent a disaster.\n\nState lawmakers quickly approved $7.5 million for repairs and improvements to the Red Lion barrier, as well as to other aging dikes, some dating back hundreds of years, in and near New Castle.\n\nDelaware's sea-level issues go beyond the coastal areas that the corps report addresses, Small said. There are also concerns about municipalities like Laurel and Seaford, where flooding has already been a significant problem during heavy, non-hurricane-related, rains.\n\nThe corps assessment takes a close look at some of the vulnerabilities along the Delaware River and Bay and Rehoboth, Indian River and Little Assawoman bays.\n\nBut Amy Guise, chief of the command center for the North Atlantic Coast Comprehensive Study, said while the report gives suggestions they are designed to be broad.\n\nGuise said every community has to deal with future flood risk based on the local issues and what they can afford to do.\n\nLess daunting in terms of cost for Delaware Bay communities: options like early flood warnings and natural storm protection such as widened beaches, more robust dunes and natural or living shorelines.\n\nAlready, Chris Bason, executive director of the Center for the Inland Bays, is thinking toward the future.\n\n\"It's on my to-do list to find a new location for the center,\" he said.\n\nThe center is near the Indian River Inlet Coast Guard Station and overlooks both the inlet and Indian River Bay.\n\nBason said when he's out driving around the inland bays, he's never far from the flood potential.\n\n\"I think about how many bridges we're going to need.\"\n\nHe points to the near-flooding last week during the \"no-storm\" and a minor nor'easter last fall that caused high water from Rehoboth Bay to flood the adjacent marsh and inundate Del. 1.\n\n\"What's that going to look like when we have another 6 inches of sea-level rise,\" he said. And, he said, people need to start talking and planning now because of \"the colossal magnitude of societal costs.\"\n\nAmong the things that would help, he said: state legislation to protect freshwater wetlands or getting Congress to set aside more money so the corps has a larger staff and resources to monitor and protect low-lying fresh wetland areas. These places are important both to reduce flooding on adjacent land and to protect the groundwater supplies, Bason said.\n\nSetbacks from flood plans would be another positive step, he said.\n\n\"The benefit of that is you keep people out of harm's way and you keep the infrastructure out of harm's way, he said. And, as sea level does rise, it provides a buffer so beaches and wetlands can migrate, he said.\n\nLast, he said, it is important to manage salt marshes. By some estimates, they are among the largest inland bay asset to suffer in sea-level rise scenarios. Of the 10,000 acres of salt marsh in the bay watersheds, as much as 90 percent could be inundated by the end of the century as sea level rises, Bason said.\n\nAlong the Delaware River and Bay, Jennifer Adkins, executive director for the Partnership for the Delaware Estuary, said pilot projects like a living shoreline that incorporates an oyster reef at Mispillion Harbor, is working to both stabilize an eroding shoreline and provide ecological benefits.\n\n\"It's one application that works under certain conditions,\" she said.\n\nIn storms they can buffer the impact from waves, and in really big storms, though they might be completely covered with water, they typically rebound, Adkins said.\n\nIn Philadelphia, municipal officials are working on green infrastructure projects to capture more of the rain before it goes into the wastewater treatment system, she said. Too much rain can send wastewater spilling into the Delaware River.\n\n\"Estuaries are on the front lines,\" Adkins said. \"It's not just about the water getting higher. It's the impact of higher water with storms on top of them.\"\n\nContact Jeff Montgomery at (302) 463-3344 or jmontgomery@delawareonline.com or Molly Murray at (302) 463-3334 or mmurray@delawareonline.com.

So whether you're trying to park or pay that water bill, use this guide to know where to look for this year's increases.\n\nOcean City\n\nVisitors to Ocean City may see a slight increase to their hotel bills in the near future.\n\nThe Ocean City Town Council is considering a small increase to the town’s hotel room tax, bumping it up from 4.5 percent to 5 percent.\n\nOfficials say this increase would help cover expenses in the town’s general fund, as well as advertising and marketing efforts. The general fund includes services, such as public safety, public works, solid waste, recreation, tourism and special events.\n\nStory continues after video\n\nWhile the beach town’s room tax has not yet been increased, the mayor and council will discuss the change at future meetings. It is unclear whether the tax increase would be put into effect at the start of the next fiscal year on July 1 or at the beginning of 2020.\n\nBackground:Staying in Ocean City hotels could soon become more expensive\n\nThe 0.5 percent tax increase is expected to yield about $1.37 million in revenue each fiscal year. If Ocean City officials were to implement the change in January, the extra revenue generated for the next fiscal year would only be about $500,000.\n\nIt's likely the room tax change will not occur until next year, since many hotel rooms for summer 2019 have already been booked, officials said.\n\n\"This is not a significant cost increase to vacationers,\" Ocean City Mayor Rick Meehan said. \"But it will help us to continue to provide a clean, safe environment by allowing us to cover the cost of providing police, lifeguards and other essential services.\"\n\nFenwick Island\n\nFee changes for Fenwick Island residents and visitors are still up in the air.\n\nOfficials of the small beach town are currently putting together the budget for next year, so final decisions regarding fee changes have not been made. At the end of January, Town Manager Terry Tieman said they were not certain if any rate increases were necessary.\n\n\"At the present time, we are not anticipating any rate increases,\" Tieman wrote in an email.\n\nWhile the town may not make any fee changes, surf fishers visiting Fenwick Island State Park will see an increase in the cost of vehicle permits.\n\nBackground:Delaware surf fishing fees to increase, permits capped at 17,000\n\nSurf fishing permits will go up by $10, totaling $90, and out-of-state users, who account for nearly one-fourth of permit holders, will pay $20 more at $180. The permits provide access to all Delaware state parks for the year.\n\nThe governor’s parks and recreation advisory council voted recently to raise prices and limit the number of permits that can be purchased annually.\n\nRehoboth Beach\n\nExpect to pay more when you visit Rehoboth this summer.\n\nThe seaside city is millions of dollars short to fund a slew of promised projects it wants rolled out for the next several years. To pay for it, officials are looking at cost increases for services across town. Some changes are still being fleshed out. Others are guaranteed.\n\nVisitors will pay some of those increased costs, including for parking. Weekly permit fees will rise from $80 to $90, on top of a two-week extension to the permit season. Parking meter rates will be a little higher, depending on where and when you park. But parking between 10 p.m. to midnight is now free, which officials hope will invite more late-night business.\n\nStory continues after video\n\nBackground: Rehoboth Beach parking: 5 changes for this summer and beyond\n\nYou may also pay more for hotel stays. Officials are considering taxing the room rate, tentatively at 3 percent. The tax can only happen with approval from the General Assembly.\n\nRehoboth Beach Mayor Paul Kuhns said he is working with House Speaker Pete Schwartzkopf, D-Rehoboth Beach, to change the town charter this session so that Rehoboth can begin taxing its hotels by July. The state currently collects an 8-percent hotel tax in Rehoboth Beach.\n\nHotels, motels and bed-and-breakfasts can also no longer purchase transferable parking passes for their guests at a significant discount. They used to be able to pay $30 as opposed to $250, but officials voted in January to eliminate the discount.\n\nResidents get their own package of increased costs this year. They’re safe to expect water and wastewater fees hikes to pay off debt to their city’s treated wastewater ocean outfall system. Seasonal and year-round residents can also expect higher trash pickup costs.\n\nBackground: Rehoboth budget woes could spark fee hikes, higher taxes\n\nThe city is also considering stormwater fees, rental tax increases and property tax increases. For the latter, Rehoboth is looking at targeting “second homeowners” with higher property taxes. Commissioner Pat Coluzzi told fellow officials this month that municipalities in other states, such as Florida, have similar mechanisms for “non-residents” who don’t live there year-round.\n\nOfficials have until mid-March to decide which costs it wants to increase, and by how much. After an early budget meeting in January, the mayor told Delmarva Now that “anything’s possible” for new revenue measures.\n\nBethany Beach\n\nIt's unclear whether non-residents can expect to pay more when visiting Bethany this summer.\n\nResidents can expect some increased costs. The town is considering a property tax increase starting in April. Bethany Beach Treasurer Jerry Morris said the town may also alter business and rental license fees.\n\nThe town is reviewing its water fees, but officials said they don't plan to increase them. Rental taxes will stay at 7 percent.\n\n“We’re not ready to discuss specific numbers yet,” said Janet Connery, the town finance director. “We have no other changes planned.”\n\nThe town is replacing its parking pay machines, but officials say they will charge the same amount. Visitors can expect to use credit cards and the mobile app they’re used to using. For beachgoers, the $2-per-hour parking and other parking permit rates will stay the same, officials say.\n\nDog-walkers will have to pay more, but only if they don’t clean up when their four-legged friends do their business. Unlawful pet owners used to have to pay up to $75 for not following the town policy. The new fine is $100 for the first offense and $200 for any offense after that.\n\nSouth Bethany\n\nLovers of this little beach town don’t have much to worry about.\n\n\"Everything (this summer) is going to remain the same as it was before,\" said town finance director Renee McDorman. \"To my knowledge, the fees are not going to change this year.\"\n\nThat includes parking permit fees and the property tax rate. Visitors will be more assured after Feb. 28, when the town council reviews its budget draft. Next fiscal year starts in May.\n\nBut the summer after this one could be a different story. The town is thinking about requiring parking permits townwide to park on side-streets in 2020. The current permit costs $20 per day for visitors.\n\nSouth Bethany is also considering increasing parking ticket fines. But McDorman said she doesn’t expect them to increase this summer.\n\nDewey Beach\n\nFolks who opt for one of Dewey Beach's hotels this summer might face a 1 percent tax hike. Delaware's accommodation tax stands at 8 percent and is broken up by 5 percent for the state and 1 percent each for beach replenishment, state tourism and county tourism.\n\nSince Dewey Beach doesn't benefit from the state-imposed tax, commissioners may vote on a new town lodging tax as early as February, bringing the total fee to 9 percent.\n\nLast year, Dewey Beach increased its metered parking to $2 an hour, falling in line with other resort town rates. Dewey Beach has no current plans to increase other town fees for this year, according to Commissioner Paul Bauer.\n\nLewes\n\nSurf fishers bound for Cape Henlopen State Park will face the recently approved vehicle permit hike and cap that goes into effect Feb. 1.\n\nLewes is still going over its budget, so city officials say they haven't discussed fee increases for this year — yet.\n\nThis story will be updated as towns continue to discuss budgets into the spring.\n\nReach reporter Taylor Goebel at tgoebel@delmarvanow.com or on Twitter @TaylorGoebel.

A service for Chris McNair will be held Friday at 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham. McNair’s daughter, Denise McNair, was among four black girls killed when Ku Klux Klansmen bombed the church Sept. 15, 1963. A surviving daughter, Lisa McNair, said Friday that her father planned his funeral and wanted it held at the church. She says he appreciated the historical significance of the church. Chris McNair became one of the first African-American members of Alabama’s Legislature since Reconstruction when he was elected in 1973. He died Wednesday at age 93.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The mysterious animal people say they see in Iliamna Lake is dark, longer than 15 feet, with a long head and tail and distinct fins. It isn’t a whale or a seal, and it often vanishes quickly. Fishermen have tried hooking it. The Anchorage Daily News once offered $100,000 for proof of its existence. But so far, nobody has photographed the creature some call the Iliamna Lake monster. Palmer resident Bruce Wright, a former marine ecologist with the National Marine Fisheries Service, hopes to solve the riddle once and for all this summer by sinking an underwater video camera to the bottom of the sprawling, sparsely lake, the largest and one of the deepest in the state. People call Iliamna Lake an inland sea. It’s 80 miles long, with a rare population of freshwater harbor seals that scientists believe moved in from the ocean long ago, and an old legend that something large lives in its 1,000-foot depths.\n\nArizona\n\nFlagstaff: The public is sending mixed messages to the U.S. Forest Service about the future of a popular but primitive recreation area in central Arizona. Some people are calling for more infrastructure improvements at Fossil Creek near Camp Verde, while others want more solitude. The Arizona Daily Sun reports Forest Service officials are analyzing the nearly 220 public comments submitted for the development of a long-term management plan. It’s expected to be complete early next year. Fossil Creek project manager Marcos Roybal says some people want more parking, restrooms and other infrastructure projects, while others are concerned about the possible negative effects of increasing visitor numbers. According to agency data, Fossil Creek averages nearly 8,000 visitors a month between May and October when permits are required.\n\nArkansas\n\nHot Springs: The state’s first dispensary has opened two and a half years after voters approved a measure legalizing medical marijuana for certain qualifying conditions. About 100 people lined up in the rain outside Doctor’s Orders RX in Hot Springs on its first official day of business Saturday, as wait times and confusion about the dispensary’s hours frustrated some people. Despite reports that the dispensary was scheduled to open at 8 a.m., employees said they didn’t plan on opening until 10 a.m. One employee also said he expected to process no more than six patients an hour through the state-required electronic tracking system. Some people said they’d been in line since before dawn. On Friday, the state approved another dispensary, Green Springs Medical, and owner Dragan Vicentic has said he plans to open Monday morning.\n\nCalifornia\n\nOjai: This artsy Southern California city is so safe that a single attempt by teens to steal beer accounted for the majority of its violent crimes last year. Sheriff’s Capt. James Fryhoff says that “a beer run that went bad” accounted for four of the six crimes. The teens allegedly went into a gas station mart to steal beer and used a skateboard to beat an employee who confronted them and hit a witness who called 911. That tallied up as two robberies and two assaults with a deadly weapon. Fryhoff serves as police chief of Ojai, a community of just under 7,700 residents in a scenic valley northwest of Los Angeles. It’s best known for galleries, boutiques and outdoor recreation that draw tourists.\n\nColorado\n\nAlamosa: Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve has been recognized for its unpolluted views of the night sky. KOAA-TV reports the International Dark-Sky Association announced Thursday that it has designated the southern Colorado park as an International Dark Sky Park. Park Superintendent Pamela Rice says the park is an ideal place to view the stars because of its dry air, high elevation and lack of light pollution. The park is planning to hold a celebration of the recognition this summer.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNewtown: A school violence prevention program started by parents whose children were killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre is receiving a $25,000 donation. The gift from the Wireless Zone Foundation will be presented to Sandy Hook Promise on Monday. The donation is earmarked to support the training of youth and adults in Sandy Hook Promise’s Know the Signs program, which is designed to help decrease violence, bullying and other forms of victimization, while strengthening school communities. More than 7.5 million people in more than 14,000 schools and youth organizations have gone through the training, learning techniques to reduce bullying and cyberbullying and help identify those as risk to commit violence, including school shootings.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes Beach: Residents of this beach community have the usual concerns about parking and littering as the summer tourism season begins. But the residents of Lewes Beach are also concerned that beach visitors will continue using the dunes as an outhouse. Lifelong resident JuneRose Futcher says residents are “very worried about the public toileting.” She says the city of Lewes needs to look after residents first. When residents confront people going to the bathroom in the dunes, Futcher says they don’t care. Town officials say there’s no room for more parking or public bathrooms. Resident Mark Schaeffer says a comprehensive land use plan would help Lewes Beach, which has homes ranging from quaint coastal cottages to waterfront villas that list for about $2 million.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A Jordanian American writer is facing a backlash after she posted a picture on Twitter of a public transit worker eating on a Washington Metro train and reported details about the employee to her bosses. Natasha Tynes apologized a day later on Twitter and deleted her post before making her account private. But people online were upset that someone who calls herself a “minority writer” would shame a black woman and possibly cause her to lose her job. The Washington Post reports the publishing house distributing her debut novel dropped her, and her publisher delayed the book’s planned release. Union officials say the woman was on the train to get to another assignment and had just 20 minutes to eat. Tynes told the Associated Press on Sunday that she didn’t want to talk.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has vetoed a bill that would have prevented local governments from banning plastic straws. DeSantis rejected the environmental regulation bill Friday, marking his first veto since taking office this year. The legislation originally addressed issues with contaminated recyclable materials but was amended to include a moratorium on local regulations of single-use plastic straws until 2024. A legislative analysis of the bill lists 10 Florida cities with straw bans, including Miami Beach, St. Petersburg and Fort Lauderdale. DeSantis wrote in the veto that the bans hadn’t frustrated any state policy or harmed state interests. He said the Florida Department of Environmental Protection is encouraging residents to reduce plastic straw use, and residents who oppose the bans should elect new city commissioners.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Executives from three production companies say they won’t film in the state because of its “heartbeat” abortion ban. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports they include David Simon of Blown Deadline, Christine Vachon of Killer Films and Mark Duplass of Duplass Brothers Productions. The boycotts aren’t likely to have an immediate effect because the companies don’t regularly work in Georgia. Killer Films and Duplass Brothers Productions specialize in independent films. Simon’s company has produced HBO series such as “The Wire.” The Georgia law will ban abortions once a fetal heartbeat can be detected, usually about six weeks into a pregnancy. Critics say it’s unconstitutional and have vowed to sue. The Motion Picture Association of America represents major studios and is taking a wait-and-see approach.\n\nHawaii\n\nKailua-Kona: Legislation meant to protect the state’s shark population was altered at the 11th hour to remove the apex predators from the bill amid concerns from the scientific community. West Hawaii Today reports the bill was intended to extend protections already in place for manta rays to include all rays and sharks. It would have made it illegal to “capture, take, possess, abuse, or entangle any shark, whether alive or dead, or kill any shark, within state marine waters,” the measure says. There were exceptions for academic research, but the scientific community found them inadequate. University of Hawaii shark researcher Kim Holland said that researchers would be forced to apply for state permits from personnel without scientific expertise and that the bill was too ambiguous in defining terms like “harassment.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: It’s the perfect time of year for morel mushrooms to start springing up in the state as soil temperatures warm, and already competition to find the tasty, coveted fungi is heating up. Members of online Idaho morel-hunting groups have been posting their finds for a few weeks, the Idaho Statesman reports. Excited commenters will ask at what elevation the honeycomb-capped mushrooms were found and perhaps what region of the state. But there’s one question you’d better not bother asking: Where’d you find them? “If you have to ask … you will never know,” one commenter wrote in a Facebook group for Idaho morel hunters. In the world of morels, much like in fishing, game hunting or even huckleberry picking, the whereabouts of fruitful caches are kept secret.\n\nIllinois\n\nEvanston: An escaped pet snake that apparently slithered into a suburban Chicago family’s washing machine ended up smelling like fabric softener after going through the wash. Sanela Kamencic tells WMAQ-TV she was “totally creeped out” when the snake turned up Wednesday in the washing machine in Evanston. Police Officer Pedro Carrasco and Animal Control Warden Jason Pound brought the reptile to the Chicago Exotics Animal Hospital. Carrasco says it was “peeking its head out of the washing machine” when it was found. Pound says it “smelled like Downy” after surviving the wash cycle. Veterinarian Melissa Giese tells radio station WBBM the snake was “in pretty good shape” and “really feisty.” The animal hospital says the corn snake, named Penelope, belonged to a 12-year-old boy who lives nearby. They were reunited afterward.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: An elephant at the Indianapolis Zoo has tested positive for a virus that killed two other elephants at the zoo in March. Kedar, a 13-year-old male African elephant, tested negative for elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus until May 6, the zoo said. Zoo staff had been testing elephants twice a week for the virus since the deaths of Kalina and Nyah. “Kedar is receiving aggressive treatment to help him fight the virus,” said Dr. Rob Shumaker, president of the zoo, which is now conducting daily blood tests on all the elephants in its herd. The virus causes fatal hemorrhagic disease in elephants, mainly Asian elephants. It is one of the most devastating viral diseases in elephants. There is no vaccine for it, and it is not preventable. It has an 85% mortality rate.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A new building in the East Village neighborhood is the first in the U.S. built using a unique type of mass timber – an eco-friendly material becoming more popular as developers look to reduce their carbon footprints. Mass timber is made by pressing smaller planks of wood together. It can be glued or nailed. In this case, the timber was pressed together using dowels. There are about 200 mass timber buildings across 36 states, but the Des Moines building was the first to use the dowel-laminated product. About 11% of global carbon emissions each year come from concrete and steel manufacturing, says Mark Wishnie, director of forestry and wood products for The Nature Conservancy, and “you also create a new carbon storage pool” with mass timber. During photosynthesis, trees absorb and store carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The carbon stays in the wood, even after the tree is cut down.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A government report forecasts a bountiful winter wheat harvest in the state. The National Agricultural Statistics Service reported Friday that this year’s wheat crop is expected to be up 17% from a year ago. It predicted Kansas growers would bring in 323 million bushels. The agency forecast the state’s average yield at 49 bushels per acre, up 11 bushels from last year. It also anticipated that grain would be harvested from 6.6 million acres in Kansas, down 700,000 acres from a year ago. The government’s estimate is a bit more optimistic than the one put out by participants in last week’s winter wheat tour who estimated the size of the Kansas crop at 306.5 million bushels.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A historic commission says a Confederate statue can be removed from a prominent location. The Louisville Metro Landmarks Commission voted 5-3 on Thursday to allow removal of John B. Castleman’s monument from a neighborhood traffic circle. Hours later, the statue was vandalized with paint for the fifth time since a 2017 deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. The commission’s decision is final unless it’s appealed to a Circuit Court within 30 days. Castleman was a Confederate soldier and later a U.S. general. He helped found Louisville’s park system. Mayor Greg Fischer’s administration has pushed to relocate the statue because of Castleman’s ties to the Confederacy and support of slavery. The city is working to move the statue to Cave Hill Cemetery, where Castleman is buried.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Hank Williams’ iconic “Jambalaya (On the Bayou)” won’t become one of the state’s official songs. Republican Sen. Norby Chabert, of Terrebonne Parish, told The Advocate he’s shelving the proposal for this legislative session. Louisiana already has two official state songs: “Give Me Louisiana” and “You Are My Sunshine.” Chabert’s proposal chafed some who objected to adding another song, particularly those who love “You Are My Sunshine.” It was sung by Jimmie Davis, a country singer from Jackson Parish who served two terms as governor. Williams released “Jambalaya” in 1952, and it was the best-selling record for 14 weeks. It’s often played at Louisiana functions, particularly in southern parishes, because of its celebration of the region’s culture.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state is turning 200, and officials want to make sure the Pine Tree State celebrates the big birthday with the best flag possible. Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap is asking the public for input on three proposed designs for the commemorative flag, which will be on display around the state in 2020. Maine became a state in 1820. Dunlap is charged with presenting a final decision about the flags to the Legislature and Maine Bicentennial Commission. The state says the result of the public vote will play a major role in Dunlap’s decision. Dunlap says the voting has begun, and it is scheduled to end at 5 p.m. Friday.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Ever since a townhome developer in the 1980s dug up a cemetery on the former grounds of the county’s first African-American church, two skeletons have been sitting in boxes archived in a museum. After searching for decades, historian Janice Hayes-Williams’ new mission is to get the remains back to their proper resting place in Annapolis and restore dignity for black families whose neighborhood was destroyed by gentrification. The plan for the return relies on extracting DNA and matching it with the living ancestors of those buried on the property that is now home to City Gate Lane townhouses. County Executive Steuart Pittman and Annapolis Mayor Gavin Buckley plan to ask Gov. Larry Hogan to put Maryland State Highway Administration Chief Archaeologist Julie Schablitsky on the case.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A performing arts group has found the child who was literally wowed by a recent classical music concert. The Handel & Haydn Society had just finished a rendition of Mozart’s “Masonic Funeral” at Symphony Hall when a youngster blurted out: “WOW!” The group was so charmed that it launched a search for the “Wow Child” with the help of audio of the moment captured by WCRB-FM. The child is 9-year-old Ronan Mattin, of New Hampshire, WGBH-FM reports. He attended the concert with his grandfather Stephen, who saw a report on TV about the society looking for the child. Stephen Mattin said Ronan is on the autism spectrum and expresses himself differently from how other people do. He said his grandson is a huge music fan. The society will invite Ronan and his family back to the venue in October, when the 2019-2020 season opens, for another Mozart performance.\n\nMichigan\n\nMuskegon: A museum housed on a World War II-era warship is bringing a massive anti-aircraft gun aboard. The USS LST 393 Veterans Museum in Muskegon is adding an 18,000-pound anti-aircraft cannon to its landing ship tank this summer. The Muskegon Chronicle reports that the Bofors twin-barreled anti-aircraft cannon is currently being restored. The museum aims to have the gun lifted onto the ship ahead of the celebration of the 75th anniversary of D-Day, which will be held June 1-2. Board member John Stephenson says the museum has searched for a Bofors cannon since 2005. The warship would’ve carried multiple Bofors when entering battle during World War II. It was part of the Allied Forces’ D-Day invasion in Normandy, France, that weakened the Nazi’s hold on Western Europe in 1944.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The top Republican in the state Senate, who helped defeat a proposed ban on so-called gay conversion therapy for minors, sent his daughter to a therapist opposed to gay relationships after suspecting she had a same-sex attraction when she was a teenager, the Star Tribune reports. Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, a conservative Christian from Nisswa, led his caucus in voting down a Democratic proposal May 1 against the practice of trying to turn gay people straight. Genna Gazelka, 30, who uses the pronoun “they” and now identifies as bi-gender, recalled being sent to a therapist who decried same-sex relations. The therapist was Marcus Bachmann, the husband of former U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, a fiery conservative Christian who ran for president in 2012. “This is harassment, and it is tantamount to what could be said of torture or sexual torture,” Genna Gazelka said of conversion therapy.\n\nMississippi\n\nTupelo: A total of 28 counties and cities in northeast Mississippi have criminalized the possession and sale of kratom, a legal but unregulated herbal product. The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reports the governments are being urged to action by the Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics and a Columbus-area anti-Kratom group. Bills to ban the substance statewide failed this year in the Legislature. Kratom is produced from the leaves of a tropical tree and consumed as a powder, a liquid or capsules. Supporters of kratom say it provides safe, non-addictive pain relief and can also combat anxiety disorders. Some kratom users also say it manages the withdrawal symptoms of potent opiate drugs. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said the substance may be addictive and prone to abuse.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: The city’s school district has found its public and charter schools are increasingly racially segregated, expensive to operate and losing high school students. KCUR-FM reports the district released a new analysis showing that 78% of schools in the Kansas City system were racially segregated by 2017, well over the 32% of schools in 1999. The report says it’s in part due to white families opting out of the system. Only 10% of the city’s public school students are white. The analysis also says Kansas City spends $80 million more on administration, transportation and overhead than the comparably sized Springfield district. The report attributes high costs to inefficiencies from operating 83 schools, compared to Springfield’s 53. Public schools have been losing nearly half of all students between kindergarten and 12th grade.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov. Steve Bullock signed a series of bills Friday that allow for spending nearly $400 million on buildings, bridges and water systems across the state – an effort aimed at creating jobs, boosting the state’s economy and clearing up a backlog of needed work. The bills include money to repair or replace 14 bridges and 51 water, wastewater and sewer projects. Overall, the 2019 Legislature passed $2.7 billion in infrastructure projects, including highway projects. Other projects include $25 million for long-sought renovations to Romney Hall at Montana State University; a dental hygiene lab at Great Falls College; and backlogged maintenance at state buildings, including $2 million for the state Capitol complex.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A new report says a nearly $200 million decline in the state’s agricultural exports in 2017 was driven by President Donald Trump’s threats to impose tariffs on U.S. trading partners. The Nebraska Farm Bureau report attributes the drop to decreases in soybean and corn exports, while beef and pork exports both increased in 2017. The bureau’s senior economist, Jay Rempe, says Trump’s talks of tariffs in January 2017 caused a decline in soybean and other commodity prices. Rempe points out that China’s retaliatory tariffs didn’t occur until May 2018. Rempe says Nebraska’s agricultural community will continue to face pressure unless the administration resolves its trade disputes with China, Mexico and other countries.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: The governor signed a law Friday opening the books on those awarded lucrative licenses to sell recreational marijuana, prompting the state tax department to reveal that just 16 applicants won all 61 new pot dispensary licenses awarded last year. Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak said the measure ushers in a “new era of transparency that will benefit the industry and the public alike.” The new law makes public the identity of marijuana license applicants and the method the state uses to score and rank bids. The licensing process has faced complaints from companies who say it is not clear what criteria officials used to award licenses. In lawsuits, the companies accuse the state of unconstitutionally picking winners and losers for the marijuana licenses. Sisolak declined Friday to comment on specifics of the pending litigation.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHampton: The Department of Environmental Services has closed the state’s ocean coastline and Hampton-Seabrook Harbor to shellfish harvesting because of a toxin that comes from what’s known as red tide. New Hampshire Public Radio reports the DES found high levels of the toxin, which causes paralytic shellfish poisoning. It was recently found in mussel samples. Chris Nash, shellfish program manager at the department, says it comes from toxic algae. The waters will be closed for the rest of May, which will affect soft shell clamming season. Some oyster harvesting areas remain open in Great Bay and Little Bay. The DES says paralytic shellfish poisoning is a life-threatening syndrome. It says the onset of symptoms is rapid, usually within two hours of consumption. Symptoms include tingling, burning, numbness, drowsiness, incoherent speech and respiratory paralysis.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A microorganism that played a role in treating tuberculosis is now officially recognized as the state microbe. Gov. Phil Murphy signed a bill Friday giving the distinction to Streptomyces griseus. The microbe was discovered in New Jersey soil in 1916. In 1943, researchers from Rutgers University used the microbe to create the antibiotic streptomycin. Tuberculosis death rates in the U.S. plummeted. They fell from about 194 deaths per 100,000 people in 1900 to about 9 deaths per 100,000 people in 1955. Rutgers researcher Selman Waksman was awarded the 1952 Nobel Prize for Medicine for discovering the microbe and creating the antibiotic.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nRio Grande del Norte National Monument: Rafting and angler guides are predicting a good season for Rio Grande tourism in the state thanks to strong runoff generated by a good snowmelt this year. A healthy snow patch this winter is feeding the Rio Grande with much-needed water after long dry spells stemming from drought, the Santa Fe New Mexican reports. This year, the National Weather Service in Albuquerque predicts runoff to be at least 148% of normal through June. Water levels were 50% of normal in 2018. Parts of rivers were bone dry or only inches high. Fish – such as trout in the Pecos River – died off, and long sandbars formed along once-wet areas. In addition to tourism, strong runoff is predicted to help the ecosystem around the river and its banks. University of New Mexico biology researcher Rebecca Bixby says the increased flow will help the endangered Rio Grande silvery minnow lay eggs and spawn.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The workers who spent their time helping with recovery efforts at ground zero are being commemorated on special-issue transit system MetroCards. The cards will be available starting Wednesday at 10 subway stations, mostly in the area of the World Trade Center site, the Daily News reports. The special MetroCards are connected to the upcoming opening of a glade at the national Sept. 11 memorial that pays tribute to the rescue and recovery workers. The 9/11 Memorial Glade is scheduled to formally open May 30, the anniversary of the day in 2002 when the recovery effort was officially ended. The MetroCards include images of four different people who worked at the site.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nNew Bern: Almost 2,000 students will receive scholarships to take a field trip to Tryon Palace, the state’s first permanent capitol. Tryon Palace officials say 1,775 students at 16 Title I schools will receive scholarships to visit the historic site. Title I schools meet certain guidelines for the number of students who are economically disadvantaged. The Tryon Palace Foundation raised the money for the field trips with donations from individuals. The foundation president says the field trips are important because experiencing history is different from merely reading about it. Most of the schools receiving the scholarships are in eastern North Carolina. Applications to attend a field trip next year will be accepted Aug. 15 through Sept. 30.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMinot: An imitation B-52 bomber and an oil derrick will be showcased in the proposed Magic City Discovery Center, according to recently unveiled concept plans. The Minot Daily News reports that the children’s museum’s board president, Mark Lyman, says the project has raised nearly two-thirds of the $7 million needed for the three-story, 22,000-square-foot facility. Lyman says groundbreaking will happen on a gill just south of the Minot airport once the project has raised 75% to 80% of the intended funding target. Paul Orselli, chief instigator with POW!, detailed a 35-foot climbing structure with a B-52 at the top that will be viewed through the multi-story, glassed-in atrium.\n\nOhio\n\nDayton: French and American teams are working together again on a D-Day project, this time to allow some virtual time travel back to that decisive moment in world history. Visitors to the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force in Dayton can use French-developed tablet technology when the museum begins its commemorations of D-Day on Monday. Events include paratroopers dropping from a vintage plane flying overhead and showings of movies about the June 6, 1944, assault that helped end World War II. Tablets called HistoPads let users contrast current views of historic sites with detailed re-creations of them, enhanced in this case with video footage, photos and maps from 1944. This will be the first U.S. site for HistoPads.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state Department of Corrections is asking federal lawmakers to authorize the use of cellphone signal jamming technology after being bombarded by an overflow of smuggled cellular devices they say gangs use to commit crimes inside and outside prison. The Oklahoman reports that since 2011, the Corrections Department has seized over 48,500 prohibited cellphones, including almost 1,800 since January. In 2016, correctional officers removed a record high of 9,766 cellphones. Corrections officials across the U.S. have cited cellphones as a reason for violent crimes behind bars and on the streets.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The state Supreme Court disagreed with more than 50 years of state case law by ruling that Oregonians retain a privacy interest in the garbage they leave on the curb for pickup. That means police can’t simply rummage through it even after a truck hauls it away. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports the court wrote Thursday that the state’s residents have a reasonable expectation that after they leave their trash in opaque bins covered with a lid, no one will inspect it without a warrant. The Supreme Court ruled in the case of Tracy Lynn Lien and Travis Allen Wilverding, who shared a home and were convicted of methamphetamine dealing after police from Lebanon asked the community’s garbage hauling company, Republic Services, to pick up and set aside the contents of the pair’s garbage on collection day in 2014.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nLatrobe: Residents of Fred Rogers’ home state will be encouraged to exhibit acts of kindness in honor of the beloved PBS children’s show host. Gov. Tom Wolf said Friday that the state’s website will share stories of good deeds and kind gestures May 23 for “1-4-3 Day,” named for Mister Rogers’ favorite number. Rogers used the number 143 to say “I love you,” as each digit reflects the number of letters in each word in the phrase. May 23 is the 143rd day of the year. The Fred Rogers Trail highlights locations in his hometown of Latrobe and in Pittsburgh, where “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood” was produced. The show aired from 1968 to 2001. Rogers, an ordained minister, is buried at Latrobe Presbyterian Church. He died in 2003 at age 74.\n\nRhode Island\n\nWarwick: The yogurt company Chobani plans to pay the school lunch debts of low-income families with students attending a district that made headlines by announcing children who owe money would get cold sunflower butter and jelly sandwiches instead of a hot meal, the mayor’s office confirmed Friday. Mayor Joseph Solomon’s office said it’s coordinating with Chobani to accept nearly $50,000, the amount owed by low-income families with children in Warwick Public Schools. Chobani founder and CEO Hamdi Ulukaya tweeted Thursday that as a parent, the news broke his heart. Access to nutritious food should be a right, not a privilege, he said. Chobani was but one of the businesses and organizations that offered to donate money to the district, officials said. After a public backlash, Warwick Public Schools reversed the cold-lunch decision last week.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The city’s police agency says it is using technology to combat and reduce gun violence. During a news conference Friday, the Columbia Police Department announced it’s using ShotSpotter, a gunshot detection technology that uses acoustics to detect, locate and alert law enforcement about gunfire in real time. Officials say data is transmitted wirelessly and verified, triangulated and reported to police within approximately 45 seconds. Police Chief Skip Holbrook says the city council approved the department’s acquisition of the technology in September 2018, and it has been implementing the system north of the capital city. He says it’s currently the only agency using the technology. Holbrook says police have received 131 alerts, detected 339 shots and seized 11 firearms since deploying the technology April 18.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: An animal rights group is asking Gov. Kristi Noem to reconsider her decision to shoot off fireworks at Mount Rushmore for the Fourth of July celebration in 2020. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals said Friday that its president sent a letter to Noem suggesting she consider replacing the fireworks with a drone show. The letter from Ingrid Newkirk said fireworks can scare animals and start wildfires, among other hazards. Newkirk said drone shows are safer and don’t cause pollution. Noem spokesman Joshua Shields called PETA’s suggestion “puzzling” and said forest animals might not react well to “hundreds of drones buzzing and blinking” around the monument at night.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state Supreme Court has ruled that city school districts don’t have to share money they receive from liquor taxes with county governments. News outlets report the opinion this week settles five lawsuits filed by Blount, Bradley, Sullivan, Washington and Coffee counties. State law calls for the Department of Revenue to keep half the proceeds from liquor-by-the-drink taxes for general education funds and return the other half to the originating city or county. The counties argued that the state law required cities to share the revenue with counties. The Supreme Court disagreed. Justice Holly Kirby wrote that since cities make the money, they are entitled to the proceeds. The ruling applies to all 95 counties and 43 cities that operate independent school districts.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: The Federal Aviation Administration has not passed a new safety regulation that legislators say would fortify supervision of the hot-air balloon industry and help avoid fatal crashes similar to a crash that killed 16 people in the state almost three years ago. The agency’s indecision triggered an irritated response from Texas U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, who sent a letter to the FAA’s acting administrator asking what was causing the extended delay, the Houston Chronicle reports. Doggett helped create bipartisan legislation that requires medical exams for commercial balloon pilots, who have been exempt from health screenings since the 1930s. An investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board found that the balloon’s pilot was as impaired by prescription medications as a drunk driver when he ignored weather warnings and flew the ride into a power line.\n\nUtah\n\nPromontory: Music, bells and cannon fire rang out Friday at a remote spot in the desert where the final spikes of the Transcontinental Railroad were hammered 150 years ago, uniting a nation long separated by vast expanses of desert, mountains and forests. An estimated 20,000 people swarmed to the celebration at Golden Spike National Historic Park northwest of Salt Lake City – the signature event of several days of festivities marking the railroad’s anniversary. Visitors came from as far as China, many decked out in old-fashioned dresses, top hats, bonnets and scarves. The event included a re-enactment of an iconic “champagne toast” photo of railroad workers perched atop facing stream locomotives giving cheers to the epic feat. The festivities also highlighted the vital contribution of the Chinese workers who put in long hours in brutal conditions and haven’t always received their proper due throughout history.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The Queen City doesn’t get a lot of sunlight but makes up for it in other ways. The city is nestled in Chittenden County, which gets some of the lowest average levels of sunlight per day, according to AccuWeather. However, Burlington manages to take advantage of as many sun rays as possible using solar panels. The city takes the fourth spot on a list by AccuWeather of solar energy per capita. Honolulu took the highest place. AccuWeather points out that the city managed to earn the title of “America’s First All-Renewable-Energy,” according to Politico.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The Hershey Company has picked the state for a major expansion of its manufacturing operation. Gov. Ralph Northam announced Thursday that the candy maker plans a $104 million expansion at its facility in Augusta County. The expanded facility will manufacture a type of fudge and peanut cream. The new project is expected to create 65 new jobs. Northam approved $1 million in state grants for the project. Hershey brands include Reese’s, Kit Kat and Jolly Rancher.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The state is set to become the first to enter the private health insurance market with a universally available public option. A set of tiered public plans will cover standard services and are anticipated to be up to 10% cheaper than comparable private insurance, thanks in part to savings from a cap on rates paid to providers. Unlike existing government-managed plans, the Washington plans are set to be available to all residents regardless of income by 2021. The Legislature approved the measure creating the plans last month, and Gov. Jay Inslee is scheduled to sign it into law Monday. The move also thrusts the state into the national debate over the role of government in health care, with a hybrid model that puts it to the left of market-only approaches but stops short of a completely public system.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: He’s a billionaire who owns mines, farms and a resort. But how Jim Justice spends his time as the state’s 36th governor has largely been a mystery. Since taking office in 2017, critics have said Justice is rarely at the Statehouse and called his business portfolio distracting. He’s pushed back on those claims. His schedule for the past seven months was recently released to the Associated Press through an open-records-law request. It shows he rarely meets with his Cabinet, rarely is at the Statehouse and was largely missing at one of the legislative session’s most critical points. His office said Justice wasn’t available for an interview but released a statement. Justice says his calendar doesn’t reflect the time and work he puts in as governor. His lawyer says Justice doesn’t log most of his office time.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The Medical College of Wisconsin is looking for ways to fight racial disparity in cancer deaths in the state. The National Cancer Institute reports that black residents in Wisconsin get cancer at a 22% higher rate than do white residents. Factors leading to cancer disparities for African Americans include stress, income, lifestyle and poor diet. Biological differences and medical access also contribute. Lauren Matthews has focused on the problem for three years as a community program coordinator at the college. Wisconsin Public Radio reports that the college has launched a program offering free prostate screenings for black men. The program also provides community education about cancer screening. The college also is studying breast cancer, colorectal cancer and smoking with funding help from the Greater Milwaukee Foundation.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: Volunteers are clearing dead trees and repairing fences along a former railroad right of way that’s been converted to a trail in southern Wyoming. The Laramie Boomerang reports the Friends of the Medicine Bow Rail Trail group is working with the Medicine Bow-Routt National Forest to maintain the route, which winds 21 miles from Lake Owen to the Colorado border. The lake is 40 miles southwest of Laramie. Friends of the Medicine Bow Rail Trail President Dave Nelson says he and other cyclists frequently encountered dead trees on the trail, many killed by beetles. Members have been volunteering on the trail for years, and last year they formed a nonprofit that can accept donations and apply for grants. Forest Service spokesman Aaron Voos says such groups do invaluable work for the agency.\n\nFrom staff and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2014/05/24/concerns-raised-sussex-countys-true-colors/9555135/", "title": "Concerns raised about Sussex's true colors", "text": "James Fisher\n\nThe News Journal\n\nResident%3A %27It%27s just a horrible stigma for the county%27\n\nWilson and Phillips have defended their decision\n\nSussex County has high-tech companies and highly-ranked schools. It boasts vibrant tourism and agricultural sectors, with towns retirees flock to and chickens its farmers grow exported around the world. Its population is on the rise, and its county government hasn't raised property taxes in 25 years.\n\nBut those pleasantries were not on people's minds last week when they thought about Sussex County; instead, it was bigotry. The County Council found itself ensnared in controversy after two council members, Sam Wilson and Vance Phillips, gave offense to the NAACP, describing it in a May 13 meeting as an organization fixated on race and prone to discriminate against anyone who isn't black. They also withheld $100 apiece in discretionary grants to the group's local chapter.\n\nGiven the opportunity to explain his stance one week later at the next meeting, Wilson instead stirred up more controversy by noting that \"three homosexuals\" had stepped forward to defend the NAACP.\n\nNAACP members and others delivered forceful rebuttals at the next meeting, noting that the episode had put a magnifying glass on Sussex County's reputation as the most resistant part of the state to embrace social changes that swept America in the civil rights era and beyond.\n\n\"Sussex County has long been considered one of the most prejudiced counties in the state of Delaware,\" Jane Hovington, president of the Lower Sussex Branch NAACP, said sternly to the County Council. \"What has always been mere conjecture has been given credence by your recent statements.\"\n\nIn interviews and public comments, Wilson and Phillips have defended their decision to express unease about the NAACP and adamantly rebuffed accusations that doing so signaled they hold bigoted beliefs. Holding to a common pattern of modern racial dust-ups, they accused their accusers of being the ones not seeing past the color of their skin.\n\n\"To make judgments of people when you don't know them is evil, really. Worst thing you can do,\" Wilson said Tuesday. \"I'm sure not a racist, and my parents were not racists.\"\n\nBut Wilson, in the same talk to reporters Tuesday, promptly gave his opponents another opening to paint him as out of touch with the modern era.\n\nIn the same week that Pennsylvania, Oregon and Washington, D.C. opened doors to gay marriage, Wilson was noting disdainfully that \"three homosexuals\" came to the Sussex County Council meeting to show support for the NAACP, and explaining why it was he'd once told a Delaware gay marriage advocate, Lisa Goodman of Equality Delaware, she was bound for hell.\n\n\"I said if she didn't change her lifestyle, she's probably going to wind up there,\" Wilson said. \"That's very plain in Romans. I mean, I don't make the rules.\"\n\nIt is difficult to imagine an elected official in Kent or New Castle counties saying that without instigating a voters' revolt.\n\nBut Sussex – split between the rural, agricultural western side and its more liberal beach towns like Lewes, Rehoboth Beach and Dewey Beach along the coast – is a different story.\n\nThat such comments are electorally acceptable here bothers Delawareans who wish Sussex County – especially the conservatives and Republicans whose electoral grip is strongest west of U.S. 113 – would have decisively shed its song-of-the-South reputation by now.\n\n\"I don't think incidents like what happened two weeks ago help the image of Sussex County any,\" said Joe Conaway, a former county administrator. \"It plays into the view of – and I hate this word – progressives who think the people of Sussex just climbed out from under rocks. And that's not the case.\"\n\nOn Saturday the county government, responding to a request for comment on the two-week-long controversy, gave a statement from County Council President Michael Vincent that said \"the recent events surrounding the Sussex County Council are unfortunate.\"\n\n\"They have taken the focus off the many important functions of county government and the hard work of our dedicated staff, and they have caused strife in our community. This is not what our county stands for, nor will it be its legacy,\" Vincent said. \"Like any other organization that comes before Council seeking support, the Lower Sussex NAACP Youth Council should have received the highest levels of respect during the May 13 meeting.\"\n\nNeil Dickerson Sr., who moved to Millsboro several years ago from Maryland, said \"it really gives Sussex County a horrible, horrible name.\"\n\nDickerson said \"it's gone viral\" now.\n\n\"It's just a horrible stigma for the county,\" he said. \"You talk about a good old boy issue, there it is.\"\n\nBut others watched what happened and decided Wilson and Phillips had simply tweaked a too-little-questioned consensus on race.\n\n\"He's saying these people are concentrated on race instead of letting things go,\" Marion Barton, 79, said of Wilson. \"Years ago, people didn't even think about that [race]. Now anything that anybody says, people are afraid to say anything back against them. I think this guy needs some support.\"\n\nPart of a pattern\n\nThe \"good old boy\" stigma goes beyond race and includes a division between the haves and have nots.\n\nDickerson, who volunteers helping elderly residents, said the NAACP comments aren't the only problem. He said an older woman in Rehoboth replaced an old shed with a new one of the same size on the same footprint but it took her years to resolve it with the county.\n\nMeanwhile, he said, people with real estate connections breeze through the system.\n\n\"We need change,\" he said.\n\nThe county government has found itself fending off accusations of hard-heartedness toward the poor and minorities before.\n\nIn 2012, the county agreed to have its liability insurer pay $750,000 to a developer who'd tried to build low-income housing near Laurel, but was stymied by rulings of the Planning & Zoning Commission and the County Council.\n\nIn 2010, during a public hearing on the development, a county resident stood up to say when his mother \"found out all these people was gonna be back there, she was scared to death. ... I have nothing against these people. But I know how it's going to be. I better not catch them hunting on my land.\"\n\nThose comments, the U.S. Department of Justice later said, \"were impliedly derogatory and based on stereotypes of African-American and Hispanic residents,\" and the DOJ maintained the county government needed to have done more to make clear its denials of the developer's proposal weren't rooted in the same biases. As part of a settlement agreement with the Department of Justice to halt the fair-housing lawsuit, the county must submit its decisions on like-minded issues to federal authorities for final approval.\n\nThe County Council has also spent years litigating its members' ability to begin meetings with prayers while still staying within the bounds of the Constitution's establishment clause. Four county residents sued them over the constant invocation of The Lord's Prayer, and in 2012, a settlement agreement allowed the council to substitute a different prayer, the 23rd Psalm, while the plaintiffs agreed to drop their lawsuit.\n\nThe fight brought years of litigation and attention to the question of whether Sussex County Council respected the beliefs of non-Christians. Phillips and Wilson, in recent weeks, have called attention to a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling that widened the scope of acceptable legislative prayer practices, saying the council should consider re-opening its Lord's Prayer litigation.\n\n\"It seems like we're the only body right now that's not permitted to do this. And it kind of irritates me a little bit,\" Wilson said on May 13. \"I think we'd be fine to go ahead and say The Lord's Prayer, or ask someone to go up and pray if they wanted to. I don't see any holdback.\"\n\nSince the 2012 settlement, the council members had not often heard a challenge to their prayer practice, but for the past two weeks an atheist from Seaford, Robert C. Harrison, has used public-comment periods at their meetings to protest their focus on prayer issues.\n\n\"Many Christians have exhibited prejudice against non-believers and discriminate against them socially,\" Harrison said. \"By holding Christian prayers here, you are helping them to identify those with differing beliefs. You are preventing some of those that fear identification from attending.\"\n\nOutside the council chambers, Wilson in particular has tangled repeatedly with gay rights advocates, bringing up his fervent belief that devout Christianity is incompatible with being gay. When the Cape Henlopen School District's school board deadlocked on a vote to add an elective class on Bible literacy, Wilson said to a talk-radio host that \"one of them is a lesbian,\" and \"they're not very strong on the Bible.\"\n\n\"Thank God for the western side of Sussex,\" he went on. \"We still believe in our Bible.\"\n\nFor some Republicans, including many outside of Sussex, the comments coming from council members this week about the NAACP and gay people brought feelings of chagrin and dismay.\n\n\"Any kind of divisive language that drives people away from the party is not helpful,\" said John Fluharty, executive director of the Delaware Republican Party. \"It's OK to have differences with folks, but we've got to build a coalition. This harsh language has just got to stop. ... I refuse to allow my party to be held hostage and bullied any longer by reactionary forces who try to hide their bigotry behind the mask of conservatism.\"\n\nFluharty said he's concerned employers considering whether to invest in Sussex County could take a dimmer view of the prospect because of the controversies.\n\n\"They've got business down there. They've got thriving tourism. At what point does this begin to impact all that?\" Fluharty said. \"At what point do potential employers look at the situation there and say, we don't want to relocate.\"\n\nVincent, in his statement Saturday, said he hoped potential residents and investors would \"view Sussex County from the broadest of perspectives. There is no doubt they will see a community that is inviting to anyone who wants to realize their part of the American dream.\"\n\nFormer Sussex resident Til Purnell, who now lives near Charlottesville, Virginia, said the latest controversy is really nothing new.\n\nPurnell recalled a different County Council years earlier where one of the members, the late William Stevenson, shut her down when she tried to speak at a meeting. Instead, the councilman suggested she should be at home canning.\n\nThat comment, too, brought a string of bad press.\n\n\"I think they were disrespectful to all women,\" she said.\n\nShe suspects council members still are because they are still part of that \"good old boy network.\"\n\n\"Poor old Joan Deaver. She puts up a gallant fight,\" Purnell said of the lone female on council.\n\nFor black citizens, it was even worse than for women, Purnell said.\n\nThey were essentially ignored ... \"treated like pet dogs. You don't harm them. You just put them out in the shed\" rather than pay attention to them, she said.\n\nRoom for all?\n\nIn Rehoboth Beach, where tourism is the economic driver, Carol Everhart, chief executive officer of the Rehoboth Beach-Dewey Beach Chamber of Commerce, said \"any negative statement or anything that's perceived as a negative statement tends to get a lot of attention.\"\n\nBut going into the busy Memorial Day holiday weekend, \"we are solidly booked,\" she said.\n\n\"Rehoboth is a biblical term and it means room for all,\" she said. \"That's the best kind of image you can have.\"\n\nAt the south end of the boardwalk Friday, dozens of gay visitors took in the sunshine on a picture perfect beach day.\n\nLouis Panos, of Baltimore, said he has always felt welcome in the city – perhaps more so than in Baltimore where people are often segregated into neighborhoods that are specifically black or gay.\n\n\"I feel extremely comfortable,\" he said.\n\nPanos said he's only driven through western Sussex County on his way to the beach, with his only stops used to get gas.\n\nMeanwhile, openly gay County Clerk of the Peace John Brady said he hopes he isn't remembered as the county's first openly gay elected official.\n\nInstead, he wants people to say: \"He did his job and he continues to do his job.\"\n\nBrady said he has known Sam Wilson for 12 years – back to the time when they were both Republican candidates. Brady has changed his party affiliation.\n\n\"Sam is a man of principle,\" Brady said. \"He's not a flip-flopper.\"\n\nBrady recalled sitting down at the Wilson family kitchen table with Sam, his wife and one of his sons – then a candidate for the Indian River School Board. Brady said he talked to them about how to get elected.\n\nIn fact, prior to his successful run for Sussex County Council in 2008, Wilson was a perennial Republican candidate.\n\n\"He and his wife are actually really nice folk,\" Brady said, adding that \"this county has a lot of colorful people.\"\n\nYet Brady acknowledges that not everyone in the county is inclusive.\n\nSometimes when people come into the Clerk of the Peace office, they say they'd prefer to have \"a Christian marry them,\" he said.\n\nBrady, who said he was raised Catholic, said he's interpreted that to mean: \"someone who's not gay.\"\n\nHis office has three people who perform marriage ceremonies so they are able to accommodate the request.\n\n\"I've gotten over that,\" he said.\n\nChanging county\n\nIf you wanted to identify the Sussex County Republican least like Sam Wilson, it might be Ernie Lopez.\n\nIn his first term as a state senator in the 6th District, representing Lewes, Milton and Rehoboth Beach, he beat a Democrat in a district where Democrats outnumber Republicans. He has cast votes in favor of repealing the death penalty and for limitations on firearms purchases, votes a good number of Sussex conservatives critiqued.\n\nHe did vote against legalizing gay marriage, surprising some who note he represents Rehoboth Beach, traditionally a popular place for gays and lesbians to vacation and own second homes. But as he campaigned in 2012, he opposed a state constitutional amendment that would have prevented the legislature from considering a gay marriage bill at all.\n\nIn an interview, Lopez quickly distanced himself from Wilson's and Phillips' NAACP words.\n\n\"I don't think the comments that were made were reflective of the majority of individuals in the county – Republicans, Democrats, anyone,\" he said. \"We all need to take a step back when we hear those comments.\"\n\nAt the same time, he said, he disputed the notion that Sussex is behind the times on racial issues.\n\n\"This county and this state have been so good to me and my family. I can say that as someone whose last name doesn't pop up in the phone book too often,\" Lopez said. \"As the first Hispanic in the Delaware State Senate coming from Sussex County, I know we've come a long way. But there's still a long way to go.\"\n\nTim Dukes, a Laurel pastor and first-term representative in the state legislature, represents Wilson-Phillips country, on the western side of Sussex. But Dukes said he couldn't get behind the two councilmen's position on the NAACP.\n\n\"It does nothing to promote what our county is about and what we stand for,\" Dukes said in an interview Friday. \"I hope that as a county we have matured enough, and we care enough about one another, that we look past race.\"\n\nRichard Smith, president of the Delaware NAACP, delivered some of the most fiery criticism of Wilson and Phillips last week.\n\n\"I'm trying to understand what came out of your mind to make you say the things you said,\" Smith said at Tuesday's council meeting. \"It's either racism or hate. Which is it?\"\n\nIn a radio interview on Delmarva Public Radio later in the week, Smith attributed the controversy the comments caused, in part, to the changing demographics of Sussex County, saying the county was increasingly led by its more urbanized, less rural eastern populace.\n\n\"What's happening is folks are coming in from D.C, Virginia, and they're coming from New York, and they're moving into Sussex County. So the county is changing,\" Smith said. \"And this little group of people who don't want the change is fighting everything. It's going to be a long fight.\"\n\nMany Sussex Countians, black and white, still have vivid memories of when their hometowns were rigidly segregated by race. J. Everett Moore Jr., an attorney who represents Sussex County's government and attends council meetings, published a book in 2012, \"Growin' up Country,\" that did not shy away from documenting segregation.\n\n\"When integration occurred, Georgetown was the last segregated high school because the blacks in Georgetown were allowed to continue their high school at Jason,\" an all-black high school, Moore wrote. \"Although blacks attended Georgetown High School when I was in high school, there were none in my grade until my senior year in 1968.\" He also recalled summer holidays at Trap Pond, in Laurel, when blacks and whites stayed on different shores of the pond.\n\nWhite people in Moore's world then, he wrote, perceived racial discord as a problem elsewhere, but not in Sussex.\n\n\"Everyone agreed that the 'colored' people around here were good people who didn't want to riot or create problems,\" he wrote of mainstream white sentiment in the mid-1960s. Moore credited a high school teacher of his, Bill Davis – a Nanticoke Indian – with opening his eyes to the damaging effects of segregation. \"Many of us were shocked by what he said,\" Moore wrote.\n\nMany blacks in Sussex County saw it differently from the start. Jea Street, a New Castle County Council member who went to Georgetown to admonish Wilson and Phillips, told them he remembered traveling through the county with his grandfather as a child.\n\n\"I have no memories of joy when he had to come over here, to go through this Circle, to transact his business because of the way he was treated,\" Street said. \"I've tried to forget that as a child we weren't allowed to go to Rehoboth Beach. We had to go to Lewes Beach. As much as I wanted to delude myself and think that things have changed, your statements make it crystal clear that nothing has.\"\n\nPhillips, in comments after the boisterous public comment period on Tuesday, said like Wilson, he believed he'd done the right thing in being skeptical of the NAACP chapter's worthiness for a county grant. He also acknowledged the episode had raised hackles.\n\n\"Maybe apologies, at some point, would be worthy all around,\" Phillips said. \"But in this heated environment, I don't think you're going to get it from anybody.\"\n\nConaway, the retired county administrator, said he didn't think this month's controversy would put a dent in the Sussex County way of life.\n\n\"I think everybody can grow from it,\" Conaway said. \"I haven't noticed the traffic heading south being any lighter. The attraction to come to Sussex is the natural resources God gave us. That's why they come.\"\n\nMolly Murray contributed to this story.\n\nContact James Fisher at 983-6772, on Twitter @JamesFisherTNJ or jfisher@delawareonline.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/05/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/04/15/alaska-volcano-field-dreams-seal-pup-visits-beach-news-around-states/50072729/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nFultondale: Marcel Walker was sworn in Tuesday as police chief of the Fultondale Police Department after serving as interim chief since early March. He replaced D.P. Smith, who retired in November after 35 years in law enforcement, six as chief. Walker began his law enforcement career in 1997 as a patrol officer with the Birmingham Police Department. He also worked as a narcotics and homicide investigator in the department’s North Precinct. In 2011, he was promoted to sergeant and supervised at the city’s South Precinct.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Hundreds of small earthquakes have been reported near a volcano in southeast Alaska believed to have been dormant for at least 800 years. The cause of the quakes under Mount Edgecumbe, a volcano near Sitka that resembles Mount Fuji in Japan, are not known. However, they might not be an indication of volcanic activity, said Dave Schneider, a research geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey at the Alaska Volcano Observatory in Anchorage. Mount Edgecumbe is a 3,200-foot stratovolcano located on Kruzof Island, about 15 miles west of Sitka. The volcano is part of a larger underwater volcanic field of lava domes and craters. The quakes are somewhat unusual because temblors in the area are usually tectonic, not volcanic, he said, adding there is no need for a huge amount of concern at this time. The last Mount Edgecumbe eruption preserved in the geologic record was about 4,500 years ago.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:Embry Health said it was forced to close 60 coronavirus tests sites in Arizona because of a lack of funding. The Health Resources and Services Administration provided funding for uninsured people to get free tests. On March 22, the HRSA ran out of money. Embry continued to fund testing for the uninsured until April 5. As 60 testing Embry sites in Arizona have closed, 37 other test sites in other states also have been closed because of the lack of funding. Embry started circulating a petition to keep providing free tests to people. It had more than 31,000 signatures as of Wednesday night. There are 79 Embry test sites still operating across Arizona.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: Attorneys for an Arkansas jail and doctor being sued by inmates who said they were unknowingly given ivermectin to treat COVID-19 said the lawsuit should be dismissed because the men are no longer being held in the county facility. In a motion filed Tuesday, attorneys for the Washington County jail and Dr. Robert Karas noted the four inmates who filed the lawsuit are now being held in state prisons. Sheriff Tim Helder in August revealed that Karas had prescribed ivermectin to treat some inmates with COVID-19. The Food and Drug Administration has approved ivermectin for use by people and animals for some parasitic worms, head lice and skin conditions. The FDA has not approved its use in treating or preventing COVID-19 in humans. The inmates said they were never told ivermectin was among the medications they had been given to treat COVID-19, and instead were told they were being given vitamins, antibiotics or steroids.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSantee: A stolen pickup truck with police SWAT gear and weapons inside was recovered and a suspect was arrested after a pursuit near San Diego, authorities said. The silver Ford F-150 was reported stolen – or possibly carjacked – about 9 p.m. Wednesday near a 7-Eleven store in Santee, said San Diego County sheriff’s Lt. Scott Roller. Among the items believed to be inside a lockbox in the truck were a bulletproof vest and “possible firearms,” Roller told the San Diego Union-Tribune. The property was believed to be the property of the El Cajon Police Department or an officer from that agency, he said. The truck was spotted in eastern San Diego County about three hours later and the driver led law enforcement on a high-speed pursuit before crashing into a fire hydrant, the Union-Tribune reported. The driver was arrested after a short foot chase.\n\nColorado\n\nLas Animas: Two wind-whipped grassland fires in rural southeastern Colorado destroyed two homes, briefly closed a state highway and forced temporary evacuations in the unincorporated community of Fort Lyon, fire officials said. The fires erupted Tuesday west and east of the town of Las Animas and had blackened nearly 8 square miles by Wednesday, according to the Bent County Office of Emergency Management. Crews had contained 25% of a fire that threatened Bent’s Old Fort National Historical Site in Otero County. The blaze fed on brush surrounding structures on the property – site of a 17th-century trading post along the Santa Fe trail – until La Junta firefighters beat it back, KKTV reported. A second fire east of Las Animas briefly forced evacuations near Fort Lyon. Crews from across the state were working the blazes. The cause of the fires is unknown.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Connecticut Attorney General William Tong has tested positive for the coronavirus, his office said. Tong, 48, is experiencing mild symptoms and will remain in isolation for five days, according to a news release from his office Wednesday. The announcement of Tong’s positive test came the same day that Gov. Ned Lamont left quarantine after testing positive for the virus last week. The Democratic attorney general is fully vaccinated and boosted, his office said.\n\nDelaware\n\nDewey Beach: A grey seal pup has found its way to the sand in Dewey Beach on Thursday morning. Dewey Beach police have been watching the seal as respondents from the Marine Education, Research & Rehabilitation Institute in Lewes work to monitor the pup and educate the public. Although MERR is waiting on more information to determine the health and status of the seal, Executive Director Suzanne Thurman said it’s common for pups to rest on Delaware beaches, especially after being weaned from their mothers. She said it’s possible that this pup could be a member of the seasonal seal colony off the coast of Lewes – a local colony that has been growing over the last decade – but it’s also common for pups to find respite in Delaware as they head south from northern destinations in New England. Seal pups often spend more time outside the water while they’re molting, a process similar to a snake shedding its skin or birds losing feather where the seal’s “baby fur” falls away as they mature.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said a bus full of undocumented migrants arrived in D.C. on Wednesday, WUSA-TV reported. Abbott first announced April 6 the state would send people who are undocumented and crossing the U.S. border from Mexico to the steps of the US Capitol. Abbott’s announcement came as he voiced opposition to President Joe Biden lifting Title 42, the public health policy the Trump administration started during the COVID-19 pandemic. It allows the government to quickly expel migrants and asylum seekers who come to the U.S. from countries where an infectious disease -- such as COVID-19 -- is present. Abbott said the bus that arrived in D.C. on Wednesday was filled with migrants from Colombia, Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua. More migrants were seen arriving at Union Station on Thursday morning. The governor did not specify how many migrants total are being bused to D.C.. It was not specified what, if any, resources the migrants would be provided.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: Emergency preparedness officials warned Floridians not to get complacent during the upcoming hurricane season, particularly in coastal areas that haven’t experienced strong storms recently. Deanne Criswell, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and Ken Graham, director of the National Hurricane Center, said they worried that many Floridians living in coastal communities have become complacent about making hurricane preparations because theey haven’t lived through major storms in recent years. Some of these coastal communities act like a cat “with nine lives” in that hurricanes seem to be heading their way but then change course at the last minute, lulling residents into believing their neighborhoods will never be hit, Criswell said at the National Hurricane Conference in Orlando. Forecasters at Colorado State University are predicting the upcoming Atlantic hurricane season will have 19 named storms and nine hurricanes, slightly higher than the yearly average for the past three decades. The season starts in June and ends in November.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock said his fundraising has set a record as Georgia’s Senate campaign shapes up to be one of this year’s most expensive races. Warnock reported Thursday he raised $13.6 million in the first three months of 2022, outpacing what was a hefty $9.8 million raised in the last three months of 2021. The senator’s campaign said it was the most money raised by a U.S. Senate candidate in the first quarter of an election year, giving Warnock $25.6 million in cash on-hand. Warnock is a heavy favorite to defeat Tamara Johnson-Shealey in the Democratic primary. Republican Herschel Walker is the front-runner among six GOP candidates in the May 24 primary. Libertarian Chase Oliver will also be on the general election ballot in November.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Mayor Rick Blangiardi, 75, tested positive Wednesday for the coronavirus, his office said. “He is currently isolating and resting at home and is in good spirits despite experiencing mild symptoms related to the infection,” his office said in a release. Blangiardi is fully vaccinated and boosted, his office said. He was scheduled to get his second booster shot later this week, said spokesperson Ian Scheuring. This is Blangiardi’s first time contracting COVID-19, Scheuring said. The office is notifying those who had close contact with the mayor in recent days. The mayor is working remotely as needed and is expected to remain out of the office until sometime next week, his office said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The Idaho Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected a request by the Roman Catholic Church in Idaho to intervene in a lawsuit over a new Idaho law banning nearly all abortions. The court did not explain why the church was excluded after the Diocese of Boise on Monday asked to be allowed to join the lawsuit in support of the ban. Idaho last month became the first state to enact legislation modeled after a Texas statute banning abortions after about six weeks. The Idaho law would allow the potential fathers, grandparents, siblings, aunts and uncles the aborted baby to sue abortion providers for at least $20,000 in damages within four years after the abortions. Rapists can’t file a lawsuit under the law, but rapists’ relatives have permission to do so. The Diocese of Boise on Wednesday didn’t immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment about the high court’s decision.\n\nIllinois\n\nPeoria: The Murray Baker Bridge will be lit in white, sparkling lights overnight on Friday for Good Friday and on Sunday for Easter. The bridge will be lit in “white sparkle dynamic” — a slow, random blinking, creating a sparkling effect, said city spokesperson Stacy Peterson. “Community members have really enjoyed the variety of color schemes that we’ve used in the past, but this weekend people will enjoy the slow sparkle of white lights across this landmark cantilever bridge,” she said. It will be the second annual special bridge lighting for both days. New multi-hued LED lights were added to the bridge when its deck was reconstructed in 2020.\n\nIndiana\n\nPeru: Homeowners in a lake-filled housing development in northern Indiana will no longer be on the hook for major repairs to six aging dams under a new state law. An amended law that takes effect July 1 removes the state Department of Natural Resources’ jurisdiction over the dams at the Hidden Hills housing addition near the city of Peru, the Kokomo Tribune reported. Larry West, who owns property on one of the dams, said the cost to make repairs under DNR regulations would have been up to $4 million. But now, the dams’ maintenance costs will be about $100,000. Dams previously fell under DNR jurisdiction if they met one of three criteria. But the amended statute now requires dams to meet two of those criteria to fall under DNR’s jurisdiction.\n\nIowa\n\nDyersville: The new owners of the “Field of Dreams” movie site plan to use $80million in private investment to make the popular tourist attraction a destination for youth baseball and softball tournaments. The Des Moines Register reported that Go the Distance said in a news release the money will be used to build baseball and softball fields, team dormitories and a hotel, among other improvements. Go the Distance’s CEO is longtime Chicago White Sox star and Hall of Famer Frank Thomas. The site in rural Dyersville, Iowa, has long been a popular destination since the 1989 Kevin Costner movie. Thomas’ group purchased controlling interest in the site last year for an undisclosed amount. The company said it expects the overhaul to be completed in phases by the end of 2023.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A judge dismissed a legal challenge by voting rights advocates to two provisions of a state election law enacted last year. Four voting rights groups, including the League of Women Voters of Kansas, argued in a lawsuit filed in June that the law will make it more difficult for several groups, including the disabled, senior citizens and minorities, to vote. Shawnee County District Judge Teresa Watson dismissed the groups’ challenges to a provision that restricts people from delivering ballots for other voters, and another provision that requires election officials to match the signature on an advanced ballot to the one on record. In her ruling, Watson said any restrictions on voting access were outweighed by the state’s interest in preventing voter fraud, The Topeka Capitol-Journal reported. The voting rights groups are currently appealing an earlier decision by Watson that allowed the state to enforce the law.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Abortion-rights groups went to court Thursday seeking to restore abortion services in Kentucky, a day after the two remaining abortion clinics signaled they couldn’t immediately comply with new restrictions imposed by the Legislature. Two lawsuits filed in federal court in Louisville asked a judge to intervene to block the law from taking effect while the case is litigated. The GOP-dominated Legislature overturned Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s veto of the sweeping abortion measure Wednesday. As lawmakers voted, abortion-rights activists standing vigil near the chambers chanted “bans off our bodies,” which echoed through the statehouse. The new law includes 72 pages of revisions to Kentucky’s abortion laws, with many new requirements that clinics must meet. Kentucky’s Republican attorney general, Daniel Cameron, said he is ready to defend the new law.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The state Legislature could end public health emergency declarations by future governors under legislation approved Wednesday by a House committee in Baton Rouge. A 6-5 vote by the House and Governmental Affairs Committee sent the bill by Republican state Rep. Lawrence Frieman of Abita Springs to the full House. The bill comes after two years of periodic conflicts between some lawmakers and Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards over now-expired emergencies declared during the COVID-19 pandemic. Frieman’s bill, as amended by the committee, would enable the Legislature to end an emergency declaration – or remove some provisions of one – by a petition signed by a majority of the House and of the Senate. It tweaks state law allowing either chamber by itself to end an emergency declaration, which was challenged and blocked in state court. The bill applies to declared states of disaster or emergency. In the case of public health emergencies, it requires lawmakers to consult with a public health specialist before petitioning to end or alter the emergency declaration.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The federal government has approved a proposal to increase at-sea monitoring of some commercial fishing trips to 100%. At-sea monitors are workers who collect data on board commercial fishing boats to help inform regulations and management of species. The government approved the new, higher percentage of trip cover Tuesday, said Michael Pentony, a regional administrator with the National Marine Fisheries Service. The rules apply to valuable species that are harvested in the Northeast such as cod, haddock and flounder. Pentony said the new rules will replace the process of calculating a target for the level of monitoring coverage every year. The coverage target will instead be 100% for four years as long as federal funding can support agency and industry costs, he wrote in a letter to fishery managers. At-sea monitoring is a controversial subject in commercial fisheries because many fishermen see it as an added cost that complicates fishing trips. The practice is depicted in the 2021 movie “Coda.”\n\nMaryland\n\nPomfret: State officials confirmed that a man found dead in his home earlier this year with more than 100 snakes died of a snake bite. A medical examiner’s office told local news outlets Wednesday the victim died of “snake envenomation” and the death was accidental. The 49-year-old man was found dead at his home in Charles County in January. Authorities said at the time that 124 snakes were inside, including venomous rattlesnakes, cobras and black mambas, according to WTOP, which reported it took hours to get them all out of the house.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Tuition across all University of Massachusetts campuses will increase this fall for the first time in three years, ending a pandemic-era freeze as the higher education system’s leaders grapple with dark financial clouds on the horizon. UMass overseers voted 12-2 on Wednesday to approve a package of tuition and fee hikes first proposed at a committee meeting last week. Two student trustees, Derek Houle of UMass Lowell and Narcisse Kunda of UMass Dartmouth, cast the only dissenting votes. Tens of thousands of in-state undergraduate UMass students face a 2.5% jump in tuition for the 2022-2023 academic year, representing between $346 and $395 more a year, as well as increases in room-and-board costs ranging from 1.9% to 3.9%. Out-of-state undergraduates face roughly similar tuition increases next year, as do all graduate students at the Amherst, Boston and Lowell campuses\n\nMichigan\n\nHowell: Drivers on a portion of East Grand River Avenue can expect detours and possibly delays throughout the summer as work takes place to replace water mains, officials said in a news release. On Monday, construction company Hubbell, Roth & Clark will begin replacing water mains and leads along East Grand River, from Barnard Street to Lucy Road. According to the release, traffic will continue during construction, but temporary lane closures and detours will occur. Mail service and trash collection will continue throughout the construction process. The project is expected to be completed by fall.\n\nMinnesota\n\nTaopi: Residents of a small farming community in southeastern Minnesota are working to recover from a tornado that destroyed half of the town’s homes, toppled tall trees and left piles of debris in its wake. An EF2 tornado with peak wind speeds of 130 mph struck Taopi near the Iowa border late Tuesday, tearing the roofs off houses, overturning vehicles and bringing down power lines. There were no reports of serious injuries. Volunteers from the area arrived Wednesday to help residents clean up the debris in the community of about 80 people. Family members sifted through rubble looking for keepsakes.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves is defending his decision to again name April as Confederate Heritage Month, nearly two years after he signed a law retiring the last state flag in the U.S. that featured a Confederate battle emblem. The Republican governor signed a proclamation without fanfare Friday. It does not mention slavery – the defense of which was Mississippi’s stated reason for trying to secede from the U.S. In response to a question at a news conference Wednesday, Reeves said he issued a Confederate Heritage Month proclamation “in the same manner and fashion that the five governors that came before me, Republicans and Democrats alike, for over 30 years have done.” Four governors before Reeves – not five – issued Confederate Heritage Month proclamations. By state law, Mississippi also has a Confederate Heritage Day in April, which is a holiday for state employees.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: The GOP-led state House voted to allow local elections over whether to ban transgender girls from competing on K-12 girls’ sports teams. House members voted 89-40 in favor of adding Republican Rep. Chuck Bayse’s proposal as an amendment to an elections bill in a late-session attempt to pass the legislation before lawmakers’ mid-May deadline. Under the amendment, Bayse said public school boards and administrators could call elections over whether to allow transgender girls to compete on all-girls sports teams. Bayse said the goal of the measure is “to protect women’s sports.” He said transgender girls have an unfair advantage against other girls and parents should have a chance to weigh in on the policy. Missouri’s current public high school sports rules prohibit transgender girls from competing on girls teams unless they’re undergoing hormone therapy.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls:Malmstrom Air Force Base announced an “all clear” and is resuming normal activity on base after earlier reports of a “suspicious package.” According to the update, the package was determined to be a “nonthreat.” The package was reportedly found at Building 400, which was evacuated along with Buildings 45202, 1710, 1712, 1205, 44200, 1531 and 407, according to a post from the base.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: State and federal agriculture officials have confirmed an outbreak of bird flu in a flock of 1.7 million laying hens in northeast Nebraska. The Nebraska and U.S. departments of agriculture said the outbreak in Dixon County is the largest of the highly contagious virus in the state, the Lincoln Journal Star reported. State Veterinarian Roger Dudley said the farm has been quarantined and the birds will be euthanized. Post Holdings said in a news release the farm is owned by its Michael Foods subsidiary, which has several egg farms in the area. The company said the 1.7 million birds represent about 4% of its total egg-laying supply. During a bird flu outbreak in 2015, nearly 5 million birds had to be destroyed in Dixon County.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The metro Las Vegas school district will provide electronic panic-button devices to teachers as it moves to boost security in the wake of incidents that include a violent after-school attack that left a teacher injured and unconscious in her classroom. In addition to providing teachers with panic devices equipped with Bluetooth connectivity, the Clark County School District will upgrade security cameras and ask police agencies to increase their presence at schools, officials said Tuesday. The panic devices will be issued first at El Dorado High School, the site of last week’s attack. A 16-year-old student faces sex assault and attempted murder charges in the incident.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Police are searching for a driver who led them on a pursuit on Interstate 93 in Concord before fleeing from a crash, and they found some suspected fentanyl left behind, authorities said Thursday. A trooper attempted to stop the northbound car in Bow at about 12:20 a.m., which reached a speed of 115 mph, police said in a news release. The driver lost control of the car while attempting to avoid stop sticks and one tire deflated, police said. The car went off the road into a median, and the driver fled. Police said they found 100 grams of suspected fentanyl at the scene. They said they have a person of interest in connection to what happened, but did not identify the person.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWest Long Branch: A new Monmouth University poll showed nearly two-thirds of residents oppose bringing back mask mandates and social distancing requirements as New Jersey sees an uptick in COVID-19 cases because of a new variant. It's a reversal from last fall, when 6-in-10 voters backed masking requirements. In this poll, released Thursday, just 1-in-3 supported masking and 64% opposed it. Support for bringing back COVID restrictions has declined among every partisan group, the poll showed, but the largest drop was among Democrats — from 89% who supported the measures in September to 50% who back them now. The poll also said concern about COVID illness is at a record low. The poll came amid a rise in cases from the BA.2 variant, a highly infectious strain of the coronavirus. Cases are expected to rise with the upcoming spring holidays, too, Gov. Phil Murphy said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nRuidoso: The remains of a New Mexico couple were found near their burned home as a wind-driven wildfire charred more than 200 residences on the edge of a mountain community in the southern part of the state. Fire crews on Thursday pointed to a break in what has been a steady stream of relentless gusts as their chance to make headway against the wildfire, which is believed to have killed the two people, Ruidoso spokesperson Kerry Gladden said. Police investigators and firefighters found the older couple’s remains Wednesday afternoon after family members notified Ruidoso police that the two had tried to evacuate but were unaccounted for. The remains were found near the home but not in it, and no additional information was immediately available, Gladden said. Authorities were working to confirm the identities of the two people. Authorities have told as many as 4,500 people to evacuate. Overnight, crews kept the flames from pushing further into the village, said Laura Rabon, a spokesperson for Lincoln National Forest. Elsewhere in New Mexico, wildfires were burning northwest of Ruidoso, along the Rio Grande south of Albuquerque, in mountains northwest of the community of Las Vegas and in grasslands along the Pecos River near the town of Roswell.\n\nNew York\n\nBuffalo: A decommissioned World War II-era destroyer docked near downtown Buffalo was taking on water and listing perilously on Thursday. Crews were working to keep the USS The Sullivans from sinking at its berth at the Buffalo and Erie County Naval & Military Park, where it had been open for tours. Park President Paul Marzello said they believe there was a breach on the right side of the hull Wednesday night. He said crews trying to stabilize the 79-year-old vessel are pumping out up to 13,000 gallons a minute. “I think we’ve seen the worst, but I don’t know,” he said. The USS The Sullivans, a National Historic Landmark, was named in honor of the five Sullivan brothers from Waterloo, Iowa. The brothers were killed in action when the USS Juneau was sunk by the Japanese in the South Pacific during World War II. More than $1 million was raised last year to repair the ship’s breached hull. Crews paused work over the winter and were to resume repairs Monday, Marzello said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: City officials have settled a federal discrimination lawsuit with a former female firefighter who said she endured a hostile work environment in which the fire chief and others inflicted emotional distress. John Hunter, the attorney representing former Asheville firefighter Joy Ponder, confirmed his client will get $155,000 in compensatory damages. She also voluntarily dismissed her claim in U.S. District Court, Hunter said. A trial had been scheduled for May 9. Ponder, who resigned from her post as Asheville Fire Department division chief in September 2020, said she faced years of harassment and gender discrimination from Fire Chief Scott Burnette after she led outside research on the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder among city firefighters.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nDevils Lake: The U.S. Department of Agriculture has confirmed multiple cases of the bird flue in North Dakota in wild birds, backyard poultry and commercial poultry flocks. There have been 31 confirmed cases in wild birds located in Burleigh, Stutsman, LaMoure, Renville and Foster counties. Avian influenza surveillance and testing in wild birds is being done by the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and the North Dakota Department of Game and Fish. People are asked to report wild sick and dead birds at gf.nd.gov/wildlife/diseases/mortality-report. Wild bird avian influenza questions can be directed at (701) 204-2161.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus:Gov. Mike DeWine might skip a rally with former President Donald Trump on April 23 to honor another ex-president: Ulysses S. Grant. DeWine said Thursday he made a commitment to attend the kickoff of Grant's 200th birthday, which is scheduled for 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. April 23 in New Richmond. Trump's event begins at 7 p.m. that day at the Delaware County Fairgrounds – about a 21/ 2 -hour drive away. \"So we'll have to kind of see if that works out,\" DeWine said. The campaign did not immediately respond to a question about whether Lt. Gov. Jon Husted would attend.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: More than 200 of the 422 convicts who got early release on Nov. 4, 2019, have been arrested again, according to a list kept by the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation. Gov. Kevin Stitt is now under fire over the mass commutation he described at the time as giving nonviolent, low-level offenders a second chance. This election year, dark money groups are spending millions of dollars on attack ads that accuse the Republican of being soft on crime. The accusations against the 208 who have been re-arrested ranged from trespassing to murder. Dozens were taken into custody multiple times, bringing the total of arrests to more than 460. One was arrested 15 times. Several were armed. Overall, Stitt signed commutations for more than 520 inmates in November 2019 after their drug and property convictions were no longer considered felonies in state law. The Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board recommended the commutations.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Climatologists said rare April snow along with rain sweeping across the Pacific Northwest this week could increase water supplies, slow snow melt and lengthen the irrigation season. Impacts, however, will vary by region, and experts predicted drought will persist, the Capital Press reported. Larry O’Neill, state climatologist and professor at Oregon State University, said the statewide average snow-water equivalent April 11 was at 69% of normal compared to 57% of normal last week. But farmers across Oregon face strikingly different outlooks. “If you’re reliant on irrigation or surface water in the southeastern two-thirds of Oregon, you should have a contingency plan in place and be prepared for water shortages,” said Scott Oviatt, snow survey supervisor for Natural Resources Conservation Service.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Students at Pennsylvania’s state-owned universities won’t see tuition increase next year under a unanimous vote Thursday by the the system’s board. The State System of Higher Education’s Board of Governors passed what will be the fourth year of flat tuition, as the struggling system hopes the Legislature will approve hundreds of millions in additional funding in the 2022-23 state budget. The board six months ago sought $550 million in state funding for next year, an increase of about 15%, along with $201 million in student aid and about $75 million in federal funds to help pay for system changes. The board could still increase tuition ahead of the coming school year if the state budget subsidy is not sufficient. Tuition is about $7,700 for in-state undergraduates. The typical graduate leaves with $39,000 in student debt.\n\nRhode Island\n\nBristol: Roger Williams University has changed the name of its School of Architecture after hundreds of students and alumni objected to adding “real estate” to its name, saying it would damage the department’s reputation. Last week, the university announced having received a gift of $20 million, the largest in its history, from the Cummings Foundation, whose founders are major real estate entrepreneurs in Massachusetts. In recognition, RWU also announced it was changing the school’s name from the School of Architecture, Art and Historic Preservation to the Cummings School of Architecture and Real Estate. The new name for the school will be Cummings School of Architecture, and housed within the school will be the Cummings Institute for Real Estate, honoring Bill and Joyce Cummings and the Cummings Foundation.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A judge ruled a lawsuit brought by four death row inmates challenging South Carolina’s execution methods can move forward as the state attempts to carry out its first execution in more than a decade. Circuit Judge Jocelyn Newman agreed to a request by the prisoners’ attorneys to closely examine officials’ claims that they can’t secure lethal injection drugs, leaving the electric chair and the firing squad as the only options for capital punishment. Attorneys for the inmates, who have largely exhausted their appeals, argued that dying by gunshot or electrocution would be a brutal process which violates a state ban on cruel, corporal and unusual punishments, and that prison officials have shown little proof they can’t get the drugs needed to carry out lethal injections instead. The decision came a week after the state Supreme Court scheduled the April 29 execution of Richard Bernard Moore, 57, who has spent more than two decades on death row after being convicted of the 1999 killing of convenience store clerk James Mahoney in Spartanburg.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: The leader of the state Senate on Wednesday named Pennington County prosecutor Mark Vargo as the lead prosecutor for the impeachment trial of state Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg and scheduled it for June 21-22. The announcement from Republican Sen. Lee Schoenbeck came a day after House lawmakers voted to impeach Ravnsborg for a car crash that killed a pedestrian. Ravnsborg, a Republican, is the first official to be impeached in South Dakota history and must take a leave until the Senate decides whether to remove him from office.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: State lawmakers are close to sending Republican Gov. Bill Lee a proposal that would threaten felony penalties against homeless people who camp on local public property – including in parks – and misdemeanors for camping around highways. The Senate voted 20-10 on Wednesday to advance the bill, with four Republicans joining Democrats in opposition. The House passed a version of the legislation last year. Both Republican-dominated chambers need to hash out differences in what they approved.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Gov. Greg Abbott has agreed to ease state inspection requirements for commercial vehicles at one Texas-Mexico border crossing, partially backtracking on his directive after nearly a week of intense backlash and substantial delays at the border. Abbott said Wednesday state troopers will no longer inspect every commercial vehicle entering the country through the Laredo-Colombia Solidarity International Bridge after coming to an agreement with Nuevo León Gov. Samuel Alejandro García Sepúlveda. The states share about 9 miles of border and one port of entry, which processed about 40,000 commercial vehicles during the first two months of the year. In exchange, García said Nuevo León would agree to enhance security enforcement measures at the border. But this agreement still leaves every other Texas-Mexico bridge subject to the inspection mandate, offering little relief to businesses and consumers on both sides of the border. So far, the additional inspections have been limited to bridges in El Paso and Laredo. Abbott said he wants to work with governors of the three other Mexican states bordering Texas – Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Chihuahua – to come to similar agreements, noting that those conversations are slated to start Thursday.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:Irrigation ditches created by homesteaders in the late 1800s are being dug up by nonprofit service provider American Conservation Experience Mountain West in the campgrounds of Zion National Park. Of the six historic ditches, four are National Historic Places, and most are underground, covered with years of dirt and debris. For the homesteaders, pioneers of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the ditches were a vital artery helping them survive in the arid desert and were something they learned from the Southern Paiute Tribe, who had ditches in the area, Rebecca Finnigan, environmental compliance archivist for the park with the Great Basin Institute, said. Unearthed ditches can be seen in the Watchman and South campgrounds, which are consistently full of visitors throughout the busy season. Last year, Zion saw a record 5 million visitors.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Green Mountain Power’s Sun Match Pilot Program will offer up to 500 eligible customers the opportunity to sign up for a new solar rate that should save an average of about $150 on their electricity bills over the course of a year. To qualify, customers must meet the eligibility requirements for seasonal fuel assistance and have a gross household income at or below 185% of the federal poverty level. The 2022 federal poverty level for a family of four is $27,750, according to HealthCare.gov. The pilot program encourages customers to use energy at times when solar is plentiful – basically daytime hours – to receive power at a discounted rate that will show up as a bill credit. Customers can opt out any time. The program is free to join. Customers can sign up here.\n\nVirginia\n\nWallops Island: Navy divers recovered an aircraft that crashed last month in the water off the Eastern Shore near the Virginia-Maryland line, killing one sailor. The E-2D Hawkeye was conducting routine flight operations in the vicinity of Wallops Island when it went down about 7:30 p.m. on March 30, a Navy spokesperson said. One of the three sailors on the plane died in the crash, and the other two were rescued by Maryland State Police, who found them injured and on top of the partly submerged wreck. The plane, an advanced tactical airborne early warning aircraft, is based out of Naval Station Norfolk and assigned to an East Coast Airborne Command and Control Squadron. The crash remains under investigation.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Officials with Washington State Ferries said the system is short on staff and in need of dozens of new recruits. A March report from the ferry system said staff shortages are unprecedented in the system’s 70-year history, KING-TV reported. Delays and cancellations have been typical during the pandemic. Washington State Ferry spokesman Ian Sterling said a staffing shortage had been expected even before the pandemic began. The Washington State Ferry system is competing with for-profit companies, particularly for engine room crews, but the system has hired “well over a hundred people in the last six months,” he said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Marshall University ceramics students are conducting an annual fundraiser next week to help feed needy families. The 19th annual Empty Bowls event will take place April 22 at Pullman Square in Huntington, the university said in a news release. Marshall students and volunteers are making ceramic bowls to be purchased at the 6-hour event. The bowls are $20 each. Bowls also will be sold online after the event by the Pottery Place. The fundraiser will benefit the Facing Hunger Foodbank. Each bowl sold will provide 180 meals for those in need. The Facing Hunger Foodbank serves 17 counties in West Virginia, eastern Kentucky and southern Ohio. The fundraiser is part of a community impact course in Marshall’s School of Art and Design.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The Wisconsin Department of Transportation docked the Merrimac ferry on Thursday because of high winds. The ferry, which connects Highway 113 between Okee in Columbia County and Merrimac in Sauk County, closed at about 9 a.m. as winds began picking up across southern Wisconsin. The ferry began running 24/7 at the end of March after it was idled for the winter. The National Weather Service issued a wind advisory until 7 p.m. Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee recorded a wind gust of 55 mph.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: State Rep. Sue Wilson, R-Cheyenne, who has represented District 7 since 2012, has announced her plan to retire, Wyoming.com reported. Since she was elected, Wilson has served as chair of the House Labor, Health and Social Services Committee for the past three years, in addition to four previous years as a committee member. Wilson also served on the Revenue and Appropriations committees.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/25/investing/elon-musk-brother-insider-stock-sale-investigation/index.html", "title": "Elon Musk and brother reportedly face insider trading probe | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk and his brother are under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission for possibly violating insider trading rules, according to media reports.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed people familiar with the probe, said the investor watchdog agency is looking into sales of Tesla (TSLA) shares by Kimbal Musk, a member of the Tesla (TSLA) board, just before his brother, Elon, announced on Twitter that he would sell 10% of his own Tesla (TSLA) holdings, a move that sent Tesla (TSLA) shares sharply lower in the days that followed.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment on the reports, and CNN Business hasn’t independently confirmed the investigation.\n\nThe Financial Times reported that Musk denied wrongdoing, telling the paper that the investigation is “simply more evidence of Stevie grinding his very tiny axe yet again.”\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk, left, and his brother Kimbal Musk, a Tesla director, reportedly face an insider trading investigation. Action Press/Shutterstock/Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic/Getty Images\n\nThe reference is apparently to Steven Buchholz, an SEC staffer in the agency’s San Francisco office, who is involved in SEC enforcement cases involving Musk and Tesla.\n\nMusk’s lawyers also filed a complaint Monday charging that there had been leaks by the SEC of its probe into Musk, without detailing what those leaks revealed. The Journal story that disclosed the the probe was published on Thursday.\n\nThe investigation reportedly centers on Kimbal Musk’s sale of 88,500 Tesla shares in November, for which he received nearly $109 million.\n\nThe shares represented about 15% of his stake in Tesla at the time. Unlike his brother Elon who has rarely sold stock, Kimbal Musk has regularly sold shares in the company.\n\nOn Saturday, November 6 — the day after Kimbal Musk sold his shares — Elon Musk posted a poll on Twitter asking whether he should sell 10% of his shares. Musk claimed in the tweet that the sale would answer criticism that he paid little or no federal income tax, despite being the richest person on the planet. However the major factor in the sale was not the Twitter poll but the fact that he had to exercise stock options that were due to expire this August, a move that would create significant taxable income.\n\nMusk gets no cash salary or bonus from Tesla and is compensated through lucrative stock options that become taxable only when he uses them to purchase shares.\n\nHis Twitter followers voted strongly in favor of the sale in a poll. Elon Musk began selling shares on Monday, November 8. Tesla’s stock fell 5% that day, both because Musk’s decision to sell was seen by some as a lack of faith, and because the large sale put downward pressure on its price. By itself Musk’s sales that day — 934,000 shares valued at $1.1 billion — amounted to about 3% of Tesla shares traded.\n\nIf Kimbal Musk had waited and sold his shares after his brother did, he would have received $5.8 million less. Company insiders, such as executives and members of the board of directors, are not allowed to trade when they have material information that is not yet public that could affect the value of the stock.\n\nIt is not clear whether Elon Musk’s decision to exercise the options and sell shares, or his plans to have a Twitter poll, would constitute company information and be subject to insider trading rules.\n\nIn his comments to the Financial Times, Elon Musk said “Kimbal had no idea I was going to do a Twitter poll.” He added: “The idea that I would care about whether my brother might sell shares for a few million dollars less when my Twitter poll caused my own share sale to be over a billion dollars less is utterly absurd.”\n\nBetween November 8 and the end of the year, Musk exercised options to acquire 22.9 million shares and sell a total of 15.7 million shares for $16.4 billion. Most of those sales were used to pay withholding taxes on the exercise of options. He also donated shares worth about $5.7 billion to an unidentified charity.\n\nMusk has long been battling and criticizing the SEC. Tesla, Musk and the agency reached an agreement in 2018 after Musk misled investors in a tweet that said he had “funding secured” to take Tesla private, when in fact he only had discussions and did not have the funding locked up.\n\nMusk eventually dropped plans to take the company private. Today, shares of Tesla are worth nearly 10 times the price at which Musk was proposing to pay to take it private.\n\nThe 2018 agreement, known as a consent decree, forced Musk to give up his title as Tesla chairman, though he retained the CEO title. He and Tesla were each forced to pay a $20 million fine, and Musk was ordered to have his tweets about material information related to the company reviewed before he posted them. In his comment to the Financial Times, he said company lawyers were aware he was going to conduct the Twitter poll about a sale of his shares.\n\n– Matt McFarland contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/02/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/08/31/tuskegee-monument-sugar-water-potato-problems-news-around-states/118486586/", "title": "Tuskegee monument, sugar water, potato problems: News from ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The Alabama Shakespeare Festival, which began in a high school auditorium in 1972, is undergoing a $1.6million renovation in advance of its 50th season. Located in east Montgomery, the theater is upgrading an entrance lobby and enclosing an outdoor area. It also is adding restrooms, constructing a new gift shop and making other additions. While the theater received $1.18 million in federal pandemic aid as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, spokeswoman Layne Holley said the renovations will not use that money, and officials have yet to decide how to use the funding. Indoor shows are scheduled to resume Nov. 27 with a production of “Cinderella.” Executive director Todd Schmidt said the theater has survived the pandemic and made plans for a return in part because of strong community backing. “We had to reduce our staff and our overhead,” Schmidt said. “It’s been a tough time, but luckily we’ve had great support.” Initially staged at Anniston High School, the company relocated to Montgomery and is housed in a theater constructed in 1985.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Alaska Federation of Natives has postponed its annual convention because of a rise in COVID-19 cases in the state, officials said in a statement. The convention has traditionally been the largest gathering of Alaska Natives in the state. It had been scheduled for Oct. 21-23 but is now delayed until mid-December in Anchorage, the organization said in a statement. Organizers said they will continue planning for an in-person convention at the Dena’ina Convention Center in downtown Anchorage with a virtual option. However, the statement said the board will make a decision by mid-October on whether to maintain the in-person part. Organizers encouraged Alaskans to get vaccinated and wear masks so the convention can be held. One notable celebration this year will be the observation of the 50th anniversary of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. The act was the largest land settlement in the nation’s history when President Richard Nixon signed it into law Dec. 18, 1971, and settled Indigenous land claims in Alaska. “Postponing until December provides us an opportunity to gather in person on the 50th anniversary of ANCSA, but it all hinges on everyone’s willingness and ability to get vaccinated,” said Sealaska chairman and Alaska Federation of Natives co-chair Joe Nelson.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A tribe that didn’t sign a revised gambling compact with the state earlier this year has filed a lawsuit alleging that a new law is unconstitutional and left some rural tribes in the cold by excluding them from negotiations hamming out the legislation. The suit filed by the Yavapai-Prescott Indian Tribe on Thursday asks the court to prevent the Department of Gaming from issuing sportsbook licenses and allowing sports betting. The lawsuit said the state presented the tribe with an amended compact “as a non-negotiable, ‘take-it-or-leave-it’ proposition.” The lawmaker who sponsored the gambling legislation defended it as fair and equitable. The legislation signed by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey last spring expands the types of gambling allowed at tribal casinos, lets tribes and pro sports teams take bets on sport evenings, and licenses six operators to sign up players for betting on fantasy virtual games. A judge scheduled an emergency hearing for next Friday on the suit.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A federal judge has scheduled the retrial of a former state senator on bribery and fraud charges for the first week of October. Court records, first reported by the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, show U.S. District Judge Judge Price Marshall on Friday scheduled the trial for Gilbert Baker, a Republican former senator and one-time state GOP chairman, to begin Oct. 4. A federal jury earlier this month acquitted Baker of conspiracy in the case in which he allegedly conspired to bribe an ex-judge who admitted to lowering a jury’s award in a negligence lawsuit in exchange for campaign contributions. The jury, however, deadlocked on charges of bribery and wire fraud against Baker, and prosecutors on Thursday filed notice of their intent to retry those counts. Baker was accused of conspiring with former state Judge Michael Maggio, who admitted to accepting campaign donations from a nursing home operator, then reducing a judgment against that company by $4.2 million. Michael Morton, the nursing home operator, has not been charged with any crimes and has denied wrongdoing. Maggio was sentenced in 2015 to 10 years in prison.\n\nCalifornia\n\nBlythe: California farmers near the Arizona border with the oldest rights to Colorado River water will reap $38million over three years to not plant some of their fields and leave extra water in the rapidly declining Lake Mead reservoir. Located roughly halfway between Los Angeles and Phoenix, growers near the city of Blythe in Riverside County have first priority to the river water. They hold rights that stretch back to 1877, superseding 40 million customers in eight states who also depend on it. But with continued drought and overuse, a first-ever shortage in the river system was declared in recent weeks by federal authorities, triggering cuts to Arizona, Nevada and Mexico’s supplies next year. In response, farmers who control the Palo Verde Irrigation District voted unanimously this month to agree to cancel planting some of their crops for three years. They will be paid about $925 per acre this year via federal drought response funds and water ratepayers in Arizona, Nevada and Southern California, with 2% increases each year after that. Bart Fisher, a PVID trustee whose family owns the 11,500-acre Fisher Ranch, said he and others were acting not because they want the money but because they want to help others and try to guarantee continued water supply for all.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Colorado’s secretary of state filed a lawsuit Monday to remove a rural county’s election clerk who is accused of allowing a security breach of the county’s voting equipment that is currently being investigated by the FBI. The lawsuit filed in Mesa County district court by Secretary of State Jena Griswold seeks to formally remove Mesa County Clerk and Recorder Tina Peters as the designated election official. The suit also calls for the appointment of former Secretary of State Wayne Williams to replace Peters and Sheila Reiner, former Mesa county clerk and recorder, to serve as the elections supervisor for the county’s upcoming November elections. The Board of County Commissioners praised the changes in a statement Monday, saying Mesa County will have “arguably the most secure and transparent election system in the United States.” Peters has claimed that the investigation led by Griswold – who is a Democrat – is an attempt to take over one of the few remaining conservative counties in Colorado. Griswold said initial investigation findings show images of election management software used by the county’s elections equipment were obtained by conspiracy theorists and posted on far-right blogs. Griswold’s office also said it believes one of the images was taken from a secure room.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Schools around the state looking to upgrade aging ventilation systems to improve air quality and help fight the airborne spread of the coronavirus may find themselves short on funds, even with federal pandemic aid. The Connecticut Mirror reports a state policy restricts aid for heating, air conditioning and air quality control projects. The policy could be reviewed again by legislators, but likely not before the 2022 General Assembly session in February. “There are some districts that haven’t touched their schools in 40 years,” said Kostantinos Diamantis, the state’s budget director who also has overseen the state’s school construction program for the past six years. “The local level needs to belly up to the bar. The cities have an obligation to maintain those buildings.” Connecticut reimburses communities for between 10% and 71% of new construction and large renovation projects designed to last 20 years or longer, the Mirror reports. But the cost of smaller projects such as replacing or upgrading a heating and ventilation system must be absorbed by the town. For the town of Coventry, which wants to replace ventilators in its middle and high schools and make roof repairs, that would mean a bill of more than $2 million even after unused federal pandemic aid is applied.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: Preliminary necropsy results show that a young fin whale that beached itself and died at Cape Henlopen State Park last week was riddled with parasites. “There was a lot going on,” said Marine Education, Research and Rehabilitation Institute Executive Director Suzanne Thurman. Measured by MERR to be 57 feet long, the whale first showed up in Lewes on Thursday, stuck on a sandbar in the Harbor of Refuge. It was able to free itself when the tide came in, but a short time later it beached itself again on the oceanside of The Point. Around noon Aug. 27, after many onlookers had come to catch a glimpse of its tail flapping in the surf, and just moments after Virginia Aquarium representatives had arrived to provide palliative care and possible euthanasia, the whale stopped breathing, according to a MERR Facebook post. The whale had to be cut into several pieces to move it out of the water for necropsy.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Dozens of people marched to the White House on Sunday calling for support of Afghan women. Organized by the nonprofit Vital Voices Global Partnership, the group is calling on President Joe Biden and other U.S. leaders to prioritize the evacuation of women out of Afghanistan and to help permanently protect women’s rights inside the country following the crisis inside the country and the Taliban takeover, WUSA-TV reports. Protesters wore shirts and held signs emblazoned with “I stand with Afghan women” as they marched from the Vital Voices headquarters on 16th Street through Black Lives Matter Plaza and to Lafayette Square, eventually gathering in front of the White House. The deadline to evacuate U.S. citizens from Afghanistan is Tuesday. Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said Sunday that for those U.S. citizens seeking immediately to leave Afghanistan by the looming deadline, “we have the capacity to have 300 Americans, which is roughly the number we think are remaining, come to the airport and get on planes in the time that is remaining.”\n\nFlorida\n\nWest Palm Beach: Sugar growers are suing the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers over proposed reservoir water levels they say will be far too low. The federal lawsuits filed last week by Florida Crystals’ Okeelanta Corp., U.S. Sugar and the Sugar Cane Growers Cooperative say the current Corps plan won’t supply enough water for their fields. “Farmers need a secure supply of water, and all farmers need certainty as we plan and manage our planting schedules and crop rotation,” said Jaime Vega, vice president of agriculture at Florida Crystals. Jacksonville Commander Col. Andrew Kelly defended the Corps’ work, saying the agency will balance water supply for both the environment and farmers. The project in question is the Everglades Agricultural Area reservoir intended to cleanse tainted water so more can flow south as crucially needed toward Everglades National Park and Florida Bay. In the lawsuits, Sugar Growers say the still-under-construction reservoir should be kept at higher water levels than what is currently envisioned in a Corps of Engineers plan. Everglades restoration advocates say the growers are simply putting their priorities ahead of others.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Atlanta Black Pride organizers say the annual celebration will happen Labor Day weekend as planned with some precautions to protect against the spread of COVID-19. The larger Atlanta Pride festival and parade planned for October were canceled Wednesday because of concerns about the pandemic. But leaders of Atlanta Black Pride, which celebrates the African American LGBTQ community, say they plan to go forward, with fewer indoor gatherings, while encouraging people to wear masks and maintain social distance. Amber Moore, COO and vice president of Atlanta Black Pride, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that COVID-19 vaccines and coronavirus testing will be offered. The celebration, marking its 25th anniversary this year, is to feature events around the city. In addition to parties, that includes a fashion show, a session on empowering women, an awards ceremony for the transgender community, a virtual film festival and a health expo. Vaughn Alvarez, who is helping to promote some of the events at Piedmont Park, told the newspaper that Atlanta rapper and radio host Da Brat and fiancee Jesseca “Judy” Dupart, CEO of Kaleidoscope Hair Products, will be honored for “bravery and courage with their love story.” The two star in “Brat loves Judy” on WE-TV.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: A county affordable housing committee has voted to recommend approval of a rental project on Lanai, where no new affordable homes have been built in 30 years. The Hokuao 201H Housing Project, proposed by billionaire Larry Ellison’s company Pulama Lanai, includes the development of 150 two-bedroom rental homes on former pineapple fields. About half of the units will be market-rate priced. The project will be developed under the state’s fast-track approval process for affordable housing. The Maui County Council’s Affordable Housing Committee voted 8-0 to recommend giving the project the green light after multiple meetings packed with public testimony and hours of discussion over concern about the project’s number of market-rate homes, The Maui News reports. Council Chairwoman Alice Lee said the project is “desperately needed.” Pulama Lanai had sought an exemption for sidewalks in the future subdivision, saying including them would cost about $2 million. Sharon Thom, senior vice president of development and construction for Pulama Lanai, said the sidewalks would change the “look and feel” of Lanai City. But Committee Chairman Gabe Johnson argued to include sidewalks, saying the county needs to advocate for pedestrian safety and accessibility.\n\nIdaho\n\nPocatello: The hot, dry, smoky growing season has left some potato farmers bracing for a poor crop. Randy Hardy, of Oakley, told the Idaho State Journal that his harvest will likely be the worst of his career. Statewide, spud farmers conducting test digs or early harvests are uprooting plants supporting no tubers. Where there are potatoes, there are fewer than normal, and most of the tubers are undersized and misshapen. “I’ve never had this happen before, and I’ve got an agronomist who works with me on potatoes, and he’s been doing it for over 20 years, and he said he’s never seen a worse crop than this,” said Hardy, who raises spuds for the fresh market and is chairman of the board of Sun Valley Potatoes. Hardy isn’t scheduled to harvest until Sept. 20, and he’s hoping the extra time will allow his tubers to add a bit more bulk. United Potato Growers of Idaho asked growers to submit results from Aug. 1 test digs and will gather follow-up data in person during harvest. Hardy said the average number of tubers in the test digs was down 30% from last year. Weight was also down substantially, he said. Many fields lacked deep soil moisture when the potatoes were planted. Then the state was hit with record-high heat in June, contributing to fewer potatoes growing beneath each plant, and smoke-filled air from Western wildfires.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: From a waterpark resort to a public school, seven finalists have been named in a design competition to repurpose a much-maligned state government building downtown. State officials are trying to sell the James R. Thompson Center, which was designed by famed architect Helmet Jahn. They say the 17-story curved-glass structure that opened in 1985 is inefficient and requires hundreds of millions of dollars worth of repairs and updates to keep it running. The building houses offices for the governor and employees of state agencies, who are scheduled to move next year to another building on the city’s Near West Side. Illinois officials are seeking bids for a developer and have not committed to any preservation ideas. Officials have said they want to sell the building by February 2022. Architecture buffs have pushed for preservation, an effort that’s been renewed in the wake of Jahn’s death in May. The finalists were named last week. A group of design and preservation experts picked the finalists from 59 entries. A winner will be chosen Sept. 14.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A coalition of voting rights groups is sponsoring a contest for Hoosiers to draw new maps for congressional and legislative election districts. The group All IN for Democracy said the contest is aimed at finding “fair” proposed election maps to present to legislators before they vote in late September on the once-a-decade redistricting based on population shifts from the U.S. census. Voting rights activists have complained that the GOP-dominated Legislature isn’t involving the public enough in the redistricting work and that partisan gerrymandering has helped Indiana Republicans gain outsized power in state government. The organization is providing an online site where residents can compile maps based on the 2020 census data. Proposals submitted by Sept. 13 will be judged, with the winning map for Indiana’s nine congressional districts getting $1,000, with $2,000 for the best districts for the 50 Indiana Senate seats and $3,000 for the fairest map of the 100 Indiana House districts. The group said its judging will be based on how well the maps keep communities of interest together, maintain whole cities and counties in the same district, and maximize the number of politically competitive districts.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Black applicants are 2.6 times more likely to be denied a conventional home loan than similarly qualified white applicants in the Des Moines/West Des Moines metro, according to an analysis of 2019 data by The Markup, a nonprofit newsroom. Des Moines has the fifth-greatest likelihood of denial for Black applicants out of 71 U.S. metro areas that The Markup found had statistically significant disparities in home loan approvals. The newsroom found that nationally, mortgage lenders are 80% more likely to reject Black applicants; 70% more likely to deny Native American applicants; 50% more likely to turn down Asian/Pacific Islander applicants; and 40% more likely to reject Latino applicants. For its analysis, The Markup examined more than 2 million conventional mortgage applications, accounting for 17 independent variables, including debt-to-income ratio and combined loan-to-value ratio. It did not take into account credit scores, which are not publicly available through Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data. John Sorensen, president and CEO of the Iowa Bankers Association, said in a statement that while the organization “firmly believes that discrimination has no place in the mortgage market,” the data used by The Markup doesn’t give a full picture as to why these disparities exist.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: One of the biggest gun dealers in south-central Kansas is the city of Wichita, but it actually received less than half the proceeds from the sales because it works with several online companies to auction off the firearms. Since a new state law allowing the gun sales was passed in 2015, Wichita has sold 2,082 guns that were seized during crimes for which the criminal cases were complete. The city generated $196,000 on the gun sales that went into a fund that pays for miscellaneous police equipment. But The Wichita Eagle learned the city received less than half of the $425,000 in total sales generated because the companies that handle the sales take a significant chunk of the proceeds. The city contracts with Propertyroom.com, which sells the guns through a partnership with a major gun retailer that operates an online auction site. The city finance director said officials last took proposals for the gun contract two years ago and got no better offer. Sedgwick County Commissioner Jim Howell, who wrote the law, said it’s no different from police departments selling off other seized property, and any gun purchases require background checks. Former Rep. Jim Ward, who also used to work as a city prosecutor, said he knows it’s impossible to keep all the guns off the street, but he never wanted the government in the gun business.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: An instructional assistant at an eastern Kentucky elementary school died from COVID-19 as the fast-spreading delta variant has sparked coronavirus outbreaks in several school districts. Heather Antle, an aide at Lee County Elementary, died Sunday. Antle was an involved member of the school community who “brought great joy to the students and staff that she worked with,” Lee County Superintendent Sarah Wasson said in a statement posted to social media. The Lee County district canceled in-person classes until Sept. 7 in response to coronavirus cases among students and teachers. Virus outbreaks have caused disruptions since the school year began. Several other districts have shut down classes for multiple days due to outbreaks. Gov. Andy Beshear, while expressing condolences to Antle’s family, urged Kentuckians to get vaccinated and wear masks to prevent the virus’s spread in schools. “There was a time when some argued COVID did not spread in schools,” the governor said on social media. “That time should be over. ... We must do everything in our power to prevent the spread of this virus in our schools, and vaccinations and masks are our greatest tools. Let’s do what’s right for our teachers.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A couple who met in a gross anatomy class as Tulane University undergraduates have given Tulane Medical School $5 million for an endowed professorship. Drs. Philip and Cheryl Leone, of Naples, Florida, are now retired pathologists and current members of the School of Medicine Board of Governors, a university news release said Wednesday. Their endowment will support a medical school professor who will also hold a joint appointment in another school or unit and will focus on areas such as public health, immunology, parasitology or anthropology, the university said. The Leones have worked in both academia and private practice. “Tulane University has played a major role in our lives and the lives of our family members,” Phil Leone said. “Our son graduated from Tulane, and Cheryl’s siblings earned undergraduate and graduate degrees from the university.” “Endowing a Presidential Chair with an emphasis on interdisciplinary academic study allows us to contribute to the university in these challenging times,” Cheryl Leone said. “We hope our gift will strengthen the medical school and help train future physicians who can significantly advance the field of medicine.”\n\nMaine\n\nBar Harbor: More than 125 boats participated in a weekend protest against plans for an aquaculture operation in waters near Acadia National Park. Commercial and recreational vessels comprised the “Save the Bay” flotilla that motored around Frenchman Bay on Sunday. Some people on land also participated by holding signs stating their opposition. American Aquafarms has proposed raising 66 million pounds of Atlantic salmon annually at a pair of 15-pen sites off the coast of Gouldsboro in Frenchman Bay. The company didn’t immediately return a telephone message. Ted O’Meara of Frenchman’s Bay United likened the scope of the project to ”some huge hog farm from the Midwest and plucking it right in the middle of one of the most beautiful parts of Maine.” He said that “our first goal is to stop this project, and our second goal is to look at changing some of the rules that allow people like this to think they can just come here and plug something like this down in our waters.”\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The first new Catholic school built in the city in roughly 60 years opened its doors Monday to hundreds of youngsters, who entered the gleaming new building with a mix of enthusiasm and first-day-back jitters. The state-of-the-art Mother Mary Lange Catholic School was built on the site where a notoriously rough public housing high-rise once stood. In a U.S. city steeped in Catholicism like few others, the new 65,000-square-foot building near downtown Baltimore is somewhat of an anomaly in the national education landscape as the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to the shuttering of many Catholic schools. It’s named after Mother Mary Elizabeth Lange, a Haitian American who started a Catholic school for Black children in 1828 – the first U.S. Catholic school for African American youth. She co-founded the Oblate Sisters of Providence in Baltimore in 1829. The Vatican is reviewing Lange for possible canonization. Archbishop of Baltimore William E. Lori said the new school, which goes from preschool to eighth grade, is not only a benefit to the students and their families but also an asset to the surrounding neighborhood. The school’s playing fields and gym will be accessible, as appropriate, to the city community. “They say a rising tide lifts all boats. And I think the opening of this school has put a spring in the step of all of our Catholic educators,” Lori said in a phone interview.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A public marker to remember the enslaved Africans forced to journey across the ocean to toil in the Americas was formally dedicated Sunday on the downtown waterfront. The Middle Passage Port Marker was installed last October at the end of Long Wharf looking out onto Boston Harbor. It is meant to acknowledge Boston’s history of slavery and honor the Africans who were forced into the the trans-Atlantic voyage known as the Middle Passage. The Sunday ceremony included remarks from Michael Creasey, superintendent of the National Parks of Boston, and officials from the downtown Museum of African American History. Names of enslaved members of Boston’s oldest churches were read aloud, and there was a traditional balafon performance by Balla Kouyate as well as a land acknowledgement statement delivered by Elizabeth Solomon, a member of the Massachusett Tribe at Ponkapoag. Millions of Africans were sold in the Caribbean and in American cities such as Boston and Newport, Rhode Island, from 1619 to 1865, according to event organizers. Native Americans from local tribes, including the Massachusett, Wampanoag and Nipmuc, were also enslaved after being taken as prisoners of war, the organizations said.\n\nMichigan\n\nPort Huron: A monument dedicated to Tuskegee Airmen who died in Michigan during World War II training was unveiled Saturday near the international Blue Water Bridge. Michigan served as an advanced training ground for many graduates of the Tuskegee University pilot training program in Alabama. Surviving Tuskegee airmen and their descendants attended the event in Port Huron, part of a three-day celebration that recognized the accomplishments of America’s first Black military pilots. Fifteen Tuskegee airmen were killed while training in Michigan, including five pilots lost in Lake Huron and one in the St. Clair River, according to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. Wreckages from two planes have been found in the river and the lake. In 2014, the remains of a P-39 aircraft were found in Lake Huron, 70 years after it crashed. The body of 2nd Lt. Frank Moody washed ashore a few months after the April 1944 crash. A dive team spent a week in Lake Huron in 2015 surveying the wreckage. The plane’s wing, landing gear, engine block, tail, propeller, cockpit door, instrument panel, .50-caliber machine guns and ammunition are being restored and will become an exhibit sponsored by the National Tuskegee Airmen Museum in Detroit.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A write-in campaign for a prehistoric giant beaver that weighed more than 200 pounds has secured it a spot on a list of possible candidates for state fossil. The write-in campaign has been so successful that the beaver, or Castoroides ohioensis, is now in the lead among possible state-fossil candidates proposed by the Science Museum of Minnesota. The fossil, found in St. Paul, dates back to the Pleistocene epoch and is estimated to be anywhere from 2.58 million years to 10,150 years old, the St. Paul Pioneer Press reports. Minnesota is one of just seven states without a state fossil, said Alex Hastings, the Phillip W. Fitzpatrick Chair of Paleontology at the Science Museum of Minnesota, who is leading an effort to designate one. Hastings put together a list of eight candidates – representing different creatures, different parts of the state and different geologic times – for consideration. As of last Tuesday, more than 2,100 people had voted, he said. The entry for Castoroides ohioensis notes that it had “buck teeth and aquatic lifestyle” and “was the size of a small bear,” according to officials with the St. Paul museum. It almost became Minnesota’s state fossil back in 1988, but the measure failed in the Legislature. Voting ends Oct. 1, after which legislators will get involved.\n\nMississippi\n\nYazoo City: A white father and son have each been sentenced to four years in prison for convictions related to chasing and shooting at two Black teenagers who were riding all-terrain vehicles on a country road. Some of the charges were prosecuted as hate crimes, which strengthened the punishment. Wade Oscar Twiner, 49, of Yazoo City, and his son, Lane Irvine Twiner, 23, of Jackson, were sentenced Friday in Yazoo County. Jurors on Wednesday convicted each man of two counts of simple assault and one count of malicious mischief. The district attorney’s office said the penalty for each simple assault conviction was increased because the men’s actions were deemed hate crimes under Mississippi law, which allows stronger penalties for crimes motivated by the victim’s actual or perceived race, color, ancestry, ethnicity, religion, national origin or gender. The men were arrested after the Sept. 27 chase in rural Yazoo County. The two teenagers were not injured, but they told investigators they were frightened for their lives. The teenagers were riding ATVs on a country road close to Wade Twiner’s home, said Chief Deputy Joseph Head of the Yazoo County Sheriff’s Office. The father and son got in a pickup and chased the teens, firing several shots and bumping into one of the ATVs with the truck.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Officials face a tall order to get all the state’s nursing home workers vaccinated because fewer than half of them have received the shots. By that metric, Missouri’s 48% ranks third-lowest in the nation, trailed only by Florida and Louisiana, both at 47%. Yet some 82% of Missouri’s nursing home residents have been vaccinated, which is just behind the national average of 83%. That worries residents like Michael Williams, who has diabetes and is on kidney dialysis at the Crestwood Health Care Center in St. Louis. “It’s fine if they (staff) don’t want to take it, but then don’t work around us. We all have underlying conditions here,” Williams told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. “They are out in the casino, and they are rolling the dice, but the sad thing about it is it’s other people’s lives they are playing with.” Some workers have already quit rather than face a mandate. Earlier this month, the Biden administration said it would require nursing home staff be vaccinated against COVID-19 as a condition for those facilities to continue receiving Medicare and Medicaid payments – revenue on which nearly all skilled nursing facilities depend. But details of that plan still haven’t been released. Data analyzed by the Post-Dispatch shows 20 facilities statewide had staff vaccination rates of 20% or less as of Aug. 15.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: Montana State University has announced a $101 million donation to its College of Nursing, believed to be the largest donation ever given to a college of nursing in the United States, school officials said. The donation, announced Monday, comes from Mark and Robyn Jones, founders of Goosehead Insurance, based in Westlake, Texas. “It is hard to put into words how moved and excited all of us are at Montana State University by the generosity of the Joneses, who are helping to address some of the most critical health care disparity issues in Montana, particularly in the state’s rural areas,” MSU President Waded Cruzado said in a statement. The money will be used to fund new facilities and state-of-the-art simulation labs at MSU College of Nursing campuses in Bozeman, Billings, Great Falls, Kalispell and Missoula. The donation will also create five faculty professorships, helping MSU attract top faculty talent as the nation faces a nursing faculty shortage. MSU’s College of Nursing will also create an endowed scholarship fund and a nurse midwifery program for doctoral-level nurses to provide maternal health in rural and remote communities.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The bones of the city’s next outdoor performance space have risen in the Gene Leahy Mall downtown. Metal arches that will one day form a performance pavilion have gone up in the mall in recent weeks, part of a $400 million public-private renovation of the mall, Heartland of America Park and Lewis & Clark Landing. When the pavilion is finished – likely sometime next spring – three white arches cascading in size will cover a stage. The Omaha World-Herald reports the space will be used for all manner of performances, from concerts, symphony performances and music festivals to movie nights and dance competitions. “It’s exciting seeing it start to come out of the ground,” said Katie Bassett, vice president of parks for the Metropolitan Entertainment & Convention Authority, which is managing the park renovations for the city. Stretching out from the pavilion to the west will be a 42,000-square-foot green lawn that will be able to host thousands of people for shows and offer a recreation space the rest of the time. Officials say the venue will be reminiscent of the iconic Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, which has a similar arch-shaped covering over the stage. At night, the pavilion will be lit from underneath to create a glow effect, which Bassett said will offer “an iconic” addition to Omaha’s downtown.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The nation’s fifth-largest school system has begun using ultraviolet light as a classroom germ-killer in a bid to stop the spread of COVID-19. “This doesn’t have any chemicals. It’s just light,” said Grant Morgan, chief executive and co-founder of Utah biosafety startup R-Zero, during a demonstration of the disinfection system at an elementary school in suburban Henderson. The blue-light-emitting tower can disinfect a 1,000-square-foot indoor space in seven minutes, destroying more than 99.99% of surface and airborne pathogens, Morgan told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. It is designed to be used while a space is unoccupied but has no lingering effects when people enter a room after treatment, he said. The Clark County School District bought one Arc unit for each of its 372 campuses using $7.4 million in federal coronavirus relief money to cover the $20,000 per-unit cost, the Review-Journal said. The district has more than 310,000 students. Classes began Aug. 9.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHanover: Dartmouth College is asking employees who have not yet returned to campus to keep working remotely until Oct. 4. The previous plan was for workers to return at the start of September, but the college is adjusting its plans as COVID-19 cases increase regionally and nationally, said Scott Bemis, chief human resources officer. Many of those who have already returned “can continue to work on-site,” Bemis said in an email to the community Friday. He said the date is being pushed back a month “to help slow the increase in the density of people on campus, with the goal of interrupting COVID-19 transmission wherever possible.” Bemis also said that weekly coronavirus surveillance testing will be conducted for vaccinated employees, instead of every 30 days. Unvaccinated employees who are coming to campus are still required to test twice a week.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: About half a million residents stand to lose a $300 federal unemployment benefit when it expires Saturday. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy said Monday during a COVID-19 news conference that it would cost the state more than $1 billion a month to pick up the unemployment insurance tab from the federal government. “The proper way to extend federal UI benefits is through federal action, not a patchwork of state ones,” he said. “The reality is that continuing the $300-per-week benefit through state resources would be cost-prohibitive.” The expiration will affect about 500,000 people, according to the New Jersey Department of Labor. Federal jobless aid was first approved in 2020 when COVID-19 outbreak hit, sending jobless to record highs amid pandemic-related shutdowns. The state has administered $33.7 billion directly to 1.6 million residents since the start of the pandemic, the governor said. The lion’s share – $25 billion – has come from the federal government. To those unemployed residents affected by the expiration of the federal benefit, Murphy pointed to the state’s minimum wage, which will rise to $13 an hour in the new year from $12. He also pointed to the state’s paid sick and family leave programs, along with other social safety net aids.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland married her longtime partner, Skip Sayre, on Saturday night in her home state. Haaland wore a dress designed and sewn by her sister, said Interior Department spokeswoman Melissa Schwartz. The ceremony incorporated elements honoring her Native American ancestry. The former New Mexico congresswoman is a member of the Laguna Pueblo. According to Schwartz, guests had to be vaccinated against COVID-19 to attend and wear masks per U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and New Mexico guidelines. But pictures on social media that show some people, including Haaland, not wearing masks indoors the whole time have drawn criticism. Her office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A “sequence of failures” in the city’s subway system following a brief power outage disrupted half of the system for several hours and stranded hundreds of passengers, Gov. Kathy Hochul said Monday. Hochul said in a statement that a Metropolitan Transportation Authority review of Sunday night’s subway breakdown “uncovered a sequence of failures that resulted in some backup systems not providing power as designed last night, including an additional failure to quickly diagnose the underlying cause.” The unprecedented breakdown affected more than 80 trains on the subway system’s numbered lines plus the L train from shortly after 9 p.m. Sunday to about 1:30 a.m. Monday, Hochul said at an earlier news conference. The restoration of service was delayed because passengers on two of the stuck trains walked out onto the tracks by themselves rather than waiting for rescuers from agencies including the police and fire departments to help them, Hochul said. “We never, ever want riders to do that,” she said. “It is dangerous, and it caused a delay in the restoration of power.” Speaking outside a lower Manhattan subway system, Hochul promised a thorough investigation. “Let me be very clear,” she said. “Last night was unacceptable.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nFayetteville: State environmental regulators say a plant that for years discharged so-called forever chemicals into the air and water is not currently in compliance with its air permit. In its letter to Chemours, the Department of Environmental Quality warned that it is preparing an enforcement action against the company’s Fayetteville Works plant in Bladen County, which has been exceeding its GenX air pollution limits for much of 2021. Officials said the company could be facing up to a $25,000 fine per day. In a statement, Chemours said the site experienced a temporary increase in air emissions this year from one of its carbon adsorption units. “The issue was quickly resolved when the carbon was replaced in this unit, and emissions returned to their usual low levels,” the statement said. “However, the data results from that one emissions sampling caused an exceedance of the site’s calculated 12-month rolling air emission allowance.” Chemours, a spinoff of DuPont Co., plans to take corrective action to fix the issue in the long term, according to its statement. GenX, a type of PFAS, has been found in drinking water wells near the plant and also the municipal utility serving the city of Wilmington, about 100 miles downstream.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A new quarterly report from North Dakota State University says the state’s economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic has slowed a bit. The outlook predicts declines in the gross state product, which is the measurement of the state’s output, labor force participation, and total wages and salaries. “The overall economic outlook for the state had been improving amidst the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, but the most recent data shows a state economy that is at risk of declining economic growth and a shrinking labor force,” said NDSU economics professor Jeremy Jackson, director of the Center for the Study of Public Choice and Private Enterprise. Total wages and salaries are expected to hold steady with a slight decline in the third quarter of this year, the Bismarck Tribune reports. The labor force is predicted to decline in the third quarter, with that trend continuing into next year. The unemployment rate is projected to have a slight increase in the third quarter and then return to its declining trend. North Dakota’s gross state product grew 1.8% in the first quarter of 2021, up from 1.3% in the previous quarter, but gross state product is forecast to decline heading into 2022. Despite the forecast decline, the model predicts relative stability in total tax collections.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Supporters of a proposal to legalize marijuana got the green light Monday to collect signatures to place the measure before state lawmakers. The Coalition to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol’s proposed statute was approved as a single issue by the Ohio Ballot Board, a panel of legislative appointees led by Secretary of State Frank LaRose. The group will soon begin collecting the 132,887 signatures of registered Ohio voters needed to submit the proposed law to the Legislature. If the Legislature doesn’t pass or passes an amended version of the bill, supporters can collect another 132,887 signatures to put the proposal before voters, likely in November 2022. The proposal would allow adults age 21 and older to buy, grow, possess and consume marijuana. Proceeds of a 10% tax on marijuana would go to education, addiction treatment and municipalities with marijuana businesses. Municipalities could limit or ban marijuana businesses within their borders. Ohio’s medical marijuana businesses, several of which are backing the plan, could automatically get licenses for the recreational side. The bill establishes 40 new cultivation licenses and 50 additional dispensary licenses for economically and socially disadvantaged “social equity” applicants. Additional licenses could be granted two years later.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Hospitals are again overwhelmed as the spread of COVID-19 is surging through the state, but this time, they’re facing the wave with even further strain on health care workers. The state has dealt with a nursing shortage for at least two decades, Oklahoma nursing leaders said. But the pandemic has worsened it, with the stresses driving some burned-out nurses out of the industry or to other states, amid greater demands on the health care system. “The pandemic has brought on some extra stresses that we had no way of predicting, and that has impacted our retention rates enormously,” said Shelly Wells, president of the Oklahoma Nurses Association. “For example, I don’t think that humans were meant to see as much death as our nurses have seen, personally, in the last 16 months.” A nurse working in a hospital in normal times might expect to care for a dying patient once a week, Wells said. “These patients are dying much more frequently,” she said. “There’s no family support, so the nurses are having to double as family and offer that support” on top of caring for the patients themselves. And it can be especially troubling to care for someone your age or younger “that you know is probably not going to live,” said Elain Richardson, regional chief nursing officer with SSM Health St. Anthony.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Record-low numbers of steelhead are returning to the Columbia River this year, prompting conservationists and anglers alike to call for a halt to recreational fishing for the sea-run fish. As of last week, just 29,000 steelhead passed the Bonneville Dam since July 1 – the fewest ever recorded, less than half the average of the past five years, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports. A coalition of conservation and fishing groups sent a letter to the Oregon, Washington and Idaho agencies that manage fish and wildlife requesting an immediate closure of recreational steelhead fisheries on the Columbia River, the Lower Snake River and their tributaries. “This is a really, really dire year for steelhead – especially wild steelhead – in the Columbia River Basin,” said Rob Kirschner, legal and policy director for The Conservation Angler, which advocates for protection and restoration of wild fish in the Pacific Northwest and Kamchatka, Russia. “We are trying to protect every eligible spawner,” he said. “Every one of these fish counts.” Steelhead on the Columbia and Snake rivers are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Their population has been devastated by habitat destruction, including construction of hydroelectric dams, as well as overfishing and climate change. High water temperatures have also been detrimental.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Hundreds of thousands of residents will lose federal pandemic unemployment benefits after this week, including an extra $300 per week, an extra 13 weeks of benefits and coverage for the self-employed. Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration said Monday that there are sources of help for people who need it once their jobless aid runs out, including federal rental assistance through counties, Medicaid, food stamps and temporary cash-assistance for low-income families. In the first week of August, roughly 640,000 people were receiving the extra $300, according to figures from the state Department of Labor and Industry. About 388,000 of them were in the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program for freelancers or the self-employed, and almost 175,000 were receiving an extra 13 weeks of assistance through the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation program. About 78,000 people were receiving benefits through the state’s regular 26-week unemployment compensation program, which will continue running, but without the extra $300 federal benefit on top. The American Rescue Plan Act, signed by President Joe Biden in March, extended those federal benefits and set them to expire after this week.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Dan McKee’s chief of staff, who is under scrutiny for whether he used his political clout to push through a development approval on some wetlands owned by his family, has stepped down, the governor’s office announced Monday. Anthony Silva maintains he did nothing wrong in the approval process, but the issue had become a distraction, the Democratic governor said in a statement. “Tony and I reached a mutual agreement that it is in the best interest of the administration for him to retire from state government effective immediately,” the statement said. “Right now, his situation is a distraction from the critical work we have ahead. I appreciate that Tony understands the need to remove the distraction to ensure we can continue serving Rhode Islanders effectively.” Silva once had an agreement to purchase the property in Cumberland – where McKee was once mayor and Silva was police chief. After the state Department of Environmental Management issued the necessary approvals, the property was purchased by Silva’s son, Ross. Town officials as well as neighbors oppose building on the land, saying developing it would exacerbate flooding problems in the area, and were concerned that Silva and his family got preferential treatment from the state environmental agency.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The rapid rise in COVID-19 cases in the state has the Department of Motor Vehicles changing how it gives road tests for driver’s licenses. The agency started requiring masks for both new drivers and examiners Wednesday. As of Monday, it is again requiring appointments for driving tests, and on Sept. 7 the department will go back to how it handled testing at the start of the pandemic, with the examiner outside the car, the DMV said in a statement. The modified skills test evaluates the same abilities as the regular test, with the examiner scoring the test from outside, the DMV said. The agency is encouraging but not requiring masks inside its branches. Officials also said many basic services, like driver’s license renewal, can be done online.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Lawmakers tasked with redrawing the state’s political boundaries set a framework Monday that will allow them to speed through the once-in-a-decade process on a tight schedule this year. The two committees responsible for drawing the new legislative districts began their work in earnest Monday after the U.S. Census Bureau released detailed data earlier this month. Lawmakers only have about 10 weeks to propose districts before a special session of the Legislature convenes Nov. 8. The Census Bureau’s data was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. “We’re in for a very compact and a very intense schedule over the next two months to get all this accomplished,” Republican Sen. Jim Bolin told the committees, which met jointly Monday. Republican lawmakers cited the shortened process in setting two parameters that will guide their work: keeping new legislative districts between a lower threshold of 24,066 residents and an upper threshold of 26,600 people, and restricting access to the Legislature’s map-drawing software to committee members only. Legislative research staff said they were worried their work would get bogged down if the general public were allowed to propose maps through its software and said people could create their own proposals with other open-source applications.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Cummins Falls State Park has been named state park of the year. The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation honored the Cookeville park for effectively managing an increase in visitors and overcrowding while enhancing safety measures, the department said in a news release Thursday. The 306-acre park in middle Tennessee used social media to inform people of river conditions, scheduled programs and activities. It also conducted more than 250 interpretation programs, held day camps for children and school programs, and hosted a weekly home-school group, officials said. Cummins Falls also has removed invasive plants, planted native species, built two greenhouses, and grown and processed sorghum, officials said. Cummins Falls is one of 56 state parks in Tennessee. It is one of several state parks honored with a 2021 Award of Excellence at a recent park management conference at Pickwick Landing State Park.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The Black arts community is pushing to create a cultural center at the music venue Kenny Dorham’s Backyard, amid broader work for equity in the city’s cultural arts programs and historic preservation in East Austin. “Everybody says the words equity, sustainability. But it turns out, if there’s no intention, no action behind it, it means nothing,” City Council Member Natasha Harper-Madison told a diverse crowd of arts supporters in July as they gathered to celebrate the return of Black contemporary dance company Ballet Afrique to East Austin. “We have so much work to do to make this a truly equitable and truly inclusive city that lives up to our progressive reputation.” In 2019, the city contracted with an outside consultant, MJR Partners, to conduct a review of city-allocated cultural arts and heritage funding. An interim report released in June outlines strategies to achieve greater equity, as well as some of the challenges the city will face. The report notes that “traditional and white-led institutions struggle to accept that historic inequities exist in the city.” “I think the city is really trying,” said Carl Settles, director of the nonprofit E4 Youth, which aims to build bridges between underprivileged area youths and Austin’s creative and tech industries.\n\nUtah\n\nMoab: Two recently married Utah women were found dead from gunshot wounds after reports of a “weirdo camping near them” and a four-day search in Moab, about an hour away from Arches National Park. On Wednesday, 38-year-old Crystal Turner and 24-year-old Kylen Schulte were found by a family friend in the South Mesa area of La Sal Loop Road, where they had been camping. Schulte and Turner went missing Aug. 14, four days before they were found dead from gunshot wounds, according to the Grand County Sheriff’s Office. Schulte’s father had posted on Facebook that they hadn’t been to work, hadn’t called, were not in the hospital and were not in jail. “Kylen and Crystal told close friends that there was a weirdo camping near them that was freaking them out !!! And that they should move campsites. Now they have been missing for over 4 days and nights!” Sean-Paul Schulte posted. The couple’s bodies were transported to the Medical Examiner’s Office, which determined the cause of death to be gunshot wounds, the Sheriff’s Office said.\n\nVermont\n\nVergennes: The city is planning to erect a monument to the state’s first known black sheriff and chief of police. The city of Vergennes is planning to unveil and dedicate the monument to former Sheriff Stephen Bates on Oct. 3. Bates was first elected sheriff and chief of police in Vergennes in 1879. Bates had been formerly enslaved in Virginia. He gained his freedom and served Union soldiers during the Civil War. He first came to Vergennes in 1866 with Vermont U.S. Rep. Frederick E. Woodbridge. Bates served as sheriff of Vergennes for 25 years. He raised a family in the city before his death in 1907, and some of his descendants will be attending the event. A local team of historians and others spent the past year researching Bates’ life and rediscovering his story in Vergennes.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Democrat Terry McAuliffe has asked a court to dismiss a lawsuit filed by Virginia Republicans that seeks to remove him from the ballot in this year’s closely watched race for governor over an alleged paperwork error. In a filing Friday evening, attorneys for the former governor now running for a second term against GOP nominee Glenn Youngkin said the suit was based on a “legal lie” and would effectively invalidate hundreds of thousands of votes cast in the Democratic primary. The complaint filed last week by the Republican Party of Virginia against state election officials argued that McAuliffe should be disqualified from running in the November general election because of the omission of his signature on an official form declaring his candidacy. McAuliffe argued in his filing that nothing in Virginia code requires a candidate to sign the declaration of candidacy. Further, the filing said: “Even if there were a technical defect with the declaration of candidacy – and there is not – it would provide no basis for removing McAuliffe’s name from the general election ballot and preventing Virginia’s voters from choosing him as their next Governor. The declaration of candidacy is a prerequisite for placement on the ballot in the primary election, not the general election, and the primary election has already concluded.”\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Hundreds of people gathered at the state Capitol on Saturday to protest Gov. Jay Inslee’s vaccine mandate. Announced in early August, Inslee’s order requires most state workers, health care workers and school employees to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by Oct. 18 or face losing their jobs. Inslee has said getting people vaccinated is essential for getting Washington past the pandemic. Organizers of the rally Saturday warned that a large segment of state workers, including many firefighters, sanitation workers and bus drivers, won’t get the vaccine – as much as 30% to 40% statewide, they said. It wasn’t clear what that estimate was based on. “If the Governor refuses to rescind his mandate, it will mean that multiple areas of the state will be severely reduced or shut down completely,” Tyler Miller, of the group Liberty, At All Hazards, said in a news release. “The Governor is unnecessarily threatening the genuine safety and well-being of the citizens of Washington if he forces his mandate to stand.” Inslee spokesman Mike Faulk defended the need for the mandate. “Employees are losing their lives to COVID. Hospitals are filling up. Communities are stressed by the pandemic’s impacts. The safest and most effective way to get beyond these tragic circumstances is vaccination,” Faulk said in a statement.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Residents who landscape for wildlife use can have their land designated a “wild yard.” The program already has 300 members around the state and is operated through the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources to create more natural habitat for wildlife around the state. “It’s such a wonderful program to get involved in,” Rebecca Linger, who owns a certified wild yard, said in a news release from the agency. “And you get the added benefit of creating an environment around your house where you can enjoy seeing wildlife coming and going. It really is delightful.” Jim Fregonara, a wildlife biologist with the division, said landowners who apply, provide a habitat plan and demonstrate that their property meets the needs of native wildlife will be added to a register of wild yards. They also receive a certificate for participating in the program and a sign post to display in the yard. “We want to encourage private citizens, whether they have a little bit of property or own a lot of land, to help wildlife thrive by providing them with food, water, shelter and space,” Fregonara said.

Tony Evers said Monday. Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, have criticized the vetting process and warned about terrorists being allowed into the country. After a tour of the Wisconsin base last week, Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson questioned whether the refugees at Fort McCoy had been fully vetted and called White House assurances about the process “lipstick on a pig.” Evers also toured the base last week and met with refugees. He said Republicans criticizing the vetting of those refugees are “vastly uninformed.” “Or they like to raise that specter of maybe some of those little kids I saw at Fort McCoy are terrorists, or maybe those adults that I saw at Fort McCoy who were working hand in hand with our soldiers and airmen in Afghanistan, somehow they are terrorists even though they’ve been vetted four or five or six times even before they left Afghanistan,” Evers said. “To me, it’s dog whistle crap, and we don’t need any of that.”\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Donations are pouring in for the widow and unborn child of a U.S. Marine killed in a bombing in Afghanistan. Rylee McCollum, 20, was among 13 service members killed by a suicide bomb attack Thursday at the Kabul airport. The troops were providing security as the airport was overwhelmed with people trying to leave the country amid the U.S. withdrawal and Taliban takeover. McCollum was from Bondurant and expecting his first child in three weeks, according to his family. Almost $687,000 had been raised through two online fundraising campaigns, one for the child’s future education costs and one for McCollum’s widow, as of Tuesday morning. McCollum was on his first deployment and manning a checkpoint at the airport when the attack happened, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. McCollum attended Jackson Hole High School and competed as a wrestler. He graduated in 2019 from Summit Innovations School in Jackson.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/07/31/nyc-taxis-fisher-cats-casinos-news-around-states/112618944/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Gov. Kay Ivey extended a state order requiring face coverings in public for another month and expanded it to include students in grade 2 and above in an attempt to slow the spread of COVID-19 as schools reopen. Ivey’s action, announced during a Capitol news conference Wednesday, added more than four weeks to an earlier order that had been set to expire Friday. The mask order will now last through Aug. 31. Hospital officials had pushed for an extension, saying the state’s intensive care units are nearly full. “Y’all, we just must remain vigilant if we are going to get our kids back in school and keep our economy open. Wearing a mask can’t hurt, but it sure can help,” Ivey said. The Republican governor, in a nod to the opposition some conservatives have to the mask orders, said her job is “to do the right thing, not necessarily the most popular thing.” State Health Officer Scott Harris said the extension was the right thing to do, particularly as students head back to school beginning next week.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Nonresident travelers to Alaska will need to show they tested negative for COVID-19 shortly before arriving as part of an effort aimed at minimizing cases and preserving testing supplies and protective gear, Gov. Mike Dunleavy said. “We’re not trying to make this difficult for folks to come here,” Dunleavy said during a Tuesday evening news conference. “We just want to make sure that we are taking care of Alaskans first.” The changes take effect Aug. 11 and will require nonresidents arrive with negative results from a test taken 72 hours before arrival. Dunleavy said enforcement details are being worked out. Currently, travelers have several testing options, including taking a test within three to five days of leaving for Alaska and being tested at an airport location when they arrive in Alaska. Those opting not to test can quarantine for 14 days. Under quarantine, one is to leave their location only for medical emergencies or necessary medical care. Dunleavy indicated quarantine would no longer be an option for nonresident travelers under the new protocols. “We feel it’s best to just go straight to a testing approach that requires folks coming in to have a negative,” he said. “So, if you come to Alaska, you should have a negative.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:Navajo Nation leaders on Thursday will continue discussions about proposed expenditure plans for the tribe's remaining federal COVID-19 aid, which could include allocating more than $20 million to its four casinos following mass layoffs. This week, the Navajo Nation Gaming Enterprise, which oversees the tribe's casinos, laid off about 900 of its more than 1,000 employees, according to the enterprise's Interim Chief Executive Officer Brian Parrish. He said another 140 employees could face layoffs early next week as the enterprise was running low on cash reserves because of casino closures during the pandemic. The 24th Navajo Nation Council during a special session on Tuesday discussed legislation that proposed expenditures from the tribe's remaining $652 million in federal COVID-19 aid. The Council voted in favor of including an amendment in the bill that would allocate $24.6 million to the enterprise. Tribes across the country have until the end of the year to spend all federal COVID-19 aid and complete whichever projects the funds were allocated toward, according to officials. U.S. Rep. Tom O'Halleran, D-Ariz., earlier this month introduced legislation to extend the deadline to tribal governments to Dec. 30, 2022.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Wednesday said he wants to hear “dissenting voices” after the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported the state’s interim health secretary in June voiced concerns about the consequences of further lifting restrictions that had been placed on businesses because of the coronavirus. “I am concerned that pushing on to Phase 2 for the entire state will lead (to) significant increases in COVID cases that will overwhelm our healthcare systems,” Dr. Jose Romero wrote in a June 9 email to Dr. Nate Smith, then the state’s health secretary that the newspaper obtained under a Freedom of Information Act request. “The public seems not to have taken seriously recommendations for social distancing and masks.” Hutchinson on June 10 announced the state would move into Phase 2 of reopening, a move that eased capacity limits on bars, restaurants and other businesses. Romero on Tuesday said he didn’t believe Hutchinson made a mistake by moving into Phase 2. He said his comments were based on the data at the time and noted Hutchinson has since signed a statewide order requiring mask s in public. Romero’s email was in response to a list of options for reopening strategies Smith sent to a medical advisory panel for the governor. Hutchinson, a Republican, said he wants to hear all voices from his advisory panel but said he went with the option that had the most consensus. “I want to know dissenting voices,” Hutchinson said. “I want to know broadly what the thinking of our medical advisory group is.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSanta Ana: Education officials in Orange County are planning to sue Gov. Gavin Newsom and state health officials over rules barring most schools from reopening classrooms when the academic year starts because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Orange County Register reported that the county’s Board of Education voted 4-0 on Tuesday to file the lawsuit. The board majority said in a statement the state hasn’t addressed how high-risk students will navigate distance learning and that the rules violate students’ constitutional rights. The board approves the budget for the county’s education department but doesn’t make decisions for local school districts. Previously, the board stoked controversy by recommending schools reopen without requiring social distancing measures or masks. Al Mijares, the county’s superintendent, said Wednesday he was disappointed by the decision to sue and that the board has diverted time and energy from students and programs to satisfy “ideological interests.” Newsom has said public and private schools in counties that are on a state monitoring list for rising coronavirus infections can’t hold in-person classes and the counties will need to meet strict criteria for schools to reopen. Orange County is one of more than 30 counties on that list following a rise in virus cases and hospitalizations. A conservative legal organization filed a federal lawsuit last week alleging the state doesn’t have the right to shutter schools.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A rodeo and concert ended without official intervention after the landowner learned of the event’s unexpectedly large size, a police official said. The event held in Weld County was criticized for its large crowds heeding little-to-no virus safety measures, The Denver Post reported. Some 2,000 people attended the gathering north of Lochbuie on Sunday night. Authorities were alerted around 5 p.m. to the new location by callers concerned about traffic, noise and a lack of masks and social distancing by attendees, Weld County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Joe Moylan said. The crowds were mostly gone around 9 p.m., Moylan said. The sheriff’s office previously stopped the event at another location. The landowner at the second location had not realized the scale of the event to be held on his property, Moylan said. “The organizers said it would be a small get together,” Moylan said. “And when he realized he had over 2,000 people on his property he went a little ballistic. He was like, ‘I didn’t approve of this, I didn’t sign off on this.’ And it kind of dispersed on its own.” The landowner could not immediately be reached for comment. The event organizer did not return requests for comment.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: Former Waterbury Mayor Philip A. Giordano, who is serving a 37-year sentence in a South Carolina prison for child sexual abuse, is asking to be released early because of the health risks he faces from the COVID-19 pandemic. Giordano, a former attorney and Republican U.S. Senate candidate, filed a handwritten petition in federal court asking for “compassionate release,” as well as the appointment of an attorney, the Hartford Courant reported on Tuesday. Giordano is not set to be released until 2033. Giordano, 57, wrote that he has “extraordinary and compelling” reasons to be released, citing the spread of COVID-19 in the federal prison system and at the medium security facility where he’s being confined in Bennettsville, S.C. Giordano said eight inmates in his unit have been infected and he claimed the prison ventilation system created a “petri dish effect” for his unit. On Wednesday, however, the Federal Bureau of Prisons website listed no current, positive COVID-19 cases among the 1,229 inmates at the facility. It reported that seven inmates have recovered and none has died. Among staff, seven are listed as having tested positive, five have recovered and none has died. Giordano, who also said he suffers from chronic spinal pain, was convicted in 2003 of sexually abusing the 9- and 11-year-old daughter and niece of a prostitute girlfriend, who was addicted to drugs, in his office at City Hall. He was charged after FBI agents overheard the assaults while conducting surveillance for a separate corruption investigation.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:Delaware’s beach towns are open to the public, but government and public health officials warn that everyone’s help is needed to curb the spread of COVID-19. Social distancing is encouraged in all public spaces, and people should maintain at least 6 feet of distance from those who are not members of their immediate household. As for face masks, they are required to be worn in public spaces where social distancing is difficult, and inside businesses that are open. Face masks are recommended, but not required, on most beaches, but social distancing is a must. Masks must be worn on the streets, sidewalks, boardwalk and inside businesses in Rehoboth Beach city limits. Lewes also requires masks to be worn outdoors in the city’s downtown area, public beach parking lots and while crossing the Savannah Road drawbridge between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. There are similar rules in Bethany Beach, where people in violation of mask rules can face up to a $100 fine. Swimming is permitted at all beaches unless dangerous weather conditions arise. Make sure to check in with the local lifeguards before you dive in to learn about any potential hazards in the water or on the sand. At beaches within the Delaware State Parks system, like Cape Henlopen State Park, Fenwick Island State Park and Delaware Seashore State Park near the Indian River Inlet, there are limits on how many people will be admitted. The number of vehicles allowed in will be capped at 60% of parking capacity, according to parks officials. Masks or face coverings are required in bathhouse and concession areas at all three parks and strongly encouraged on the beach as well.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:D.C. Public Schools will move to virtual and distancing learning for the start of the 2020-21 academic year from Aug. 31 to Nov. 6, Mayor Muriel Bowser said Thursday, WUSA-TV reported. The decision to move to a virtual learning scenario came after District leaders in conjunction with D.C. Health Department analyzed recent COVID-19 data that suggested that it was the best decision to keep students safe during the pandemic. The school system asked families and staff members to fill out a survey and received about 17,000 responses regarding the reopening of schools. Education officials said they designed virtual and online schedules depending on ages and grade levels. The majority of independent learning time will be on Wednesdays and virtual learning will be live lessons online during the week. Teachers will be conducting learning checks to monitor and understand gaps in learning. Attendance will also be tracked and taken during this learning scenario, officials said. Students will also have access to mental health support and social-emotional learning activities to get them through the virtual learning process, officials said. Officials said they will continue to monitor data and decide what the future of schools will be like for Term 2 on Nov. 9.\n\nFlorida\n\nWest Palm Beach:Child care assistance is available for children of first responders and other essential workers affected by the coronavirus pandemic – but time to apply is running out. The deadline to sign up for an Early Learning Coalition of Palm Beach County scholarship is Friday, the agency said. More than 2,000 children of first responders, health care employees and other workers considered “essential” – including grocery store, food, gas station and sanitation workers – have been helped by the program. It was launched earlier this year as the pandemic gripped the country, throwing families in need of child care into chaos as numerous facilities closed. “We are proud of that and want to serve more while we can,” Early Learning Coalition CEO Warren Eldridge said. Eligible families could receive financial help for 60 or 90 days, or more, the coalition reported. The program is for workers with children ages 6 weeks to 12 years. To apply, call 561-514-3300. In addition to helping these families pay for child care, the coalition said it also can help locate facilities that are open and accepting new students. Placement help is available for all Palm Beach County residents.

The email highlights things students should know about attending on-campus classes while maintaining social distancing, such as face-covering enforcement, the health center reopening and notice of no tuition changes. “If you are an undergraduate student and you change your class to an online class, your tuition also will not change as Georgia Southern has eliminated differential tuition for online classes at the undergraduate level,” the email read. “However, if you change a graduate-level class from an in-person class to one that is scheduled completely online, there may be a change in tuition charges as some graduate classes still have different costs if delivered online.” Another point in the email is the announcement that GS’ CARES Center has opened, which is a tool to help students report and track COVID-19 cases. The online resource provides answers for COVID related questions, self-reporting instructions and more on academic needs. Classes are scheduled to begin Aug. 17 on all campuses.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Hawaii was listed among 12 countries and regions the Japanese government considers safe international travel destinations for its citizens during the coronavirus pandemic. The announcement could provide a boost to Hawaii’s tourism industry, which is vital to the state economy and has been devastated since the virus put the brakes on global travel. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi announced the new Japan-Hawaii safe travel program, which will be tightly regulated to protect the health of travelers and prevent the additional spread of COVID-19. The program is expected to require negative coronavirus tests for tourists before they travel and include screening of travelers entering Japan. Hawaii, like Japan, has low numbers of coronavirus cases and is the only U.S. state under consideration for Japan’s program. Others destinations on the list include China, South Korea, Taiwan and nations in Europe. The program likely would benefit Oahu disproportionately as Hawaii is expected to limit the relaxed entry program to Oahu, which usually receives the majority of visitors to the state from Japan. Hawaii County Mayor Harry Kim said the announcement is good news for the Big Island and the state. Kim favors allowing travel to and from Japan without quarantines if testing protocols are established.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Lawmakers on Thursday voted for proposed legislation creating a liability shield for protection against lawsuits during declared emergencies such as the coronavirus pandemic, and are asking Republican Gov. Brad Little to call the Legislature back into session to pass it. A majority of House and Senate lawmakers on the Judiciary and Rules Working Group said such a law is needed to protect government entities and private businesses. Some lawmakers opposed to the legislation said a liability shield will remove incentives for businesses and government to take precautions. Little is the only one who can call the part-time Legislature back into session, which otherwise wouldn’t meet until early January. Lawmakers in favor of the legislation say current law leaves businesses and schools open to lawsuits during an emergency. As an example, one lawmaker noted that a family could sue if a child got the coronavirus at school, passed it on to a grandparent who died as a result. Businesses could also be sued if someone believes they became infected while at the business, lawmakers said.\n\nIllinois\n\nPeoria: A dozen Bradley University students, including some who attended a social gathering after leading freshmen orientation programs this month, have tested positive for COVID-19, the school said. After the Peoria school learned of the new cases on July 23, it determined after testing and contact tracing that the outbreak apparently stemmed from a small off-campus gathering in which attendees didn’t wear masks or practice social distancing, Bradley spokeswoman Renee Charles said. Officials said they don’t believe it was connected to the orientation sessions that preceded the party. “This event highlights the importance of remaining vigilant about engaging in behaviors proven to slow the spread of the virus,” Bradley President Stephen Standifird said in a message Monday. “Face masks, physical distancing and frequent hand washing matter. This case also highlights the importance of an aggressive testing and contact tracing routine.” Some of the students became infected after attending outdoor and indoor orientation activities on July 20 and July 21 at the 5,000-student campus. Attendees who were determined to have spent more than 15 minutes with one of the infected students were notified by a phone call or text message, but school officials said they don’t think the risk of transmission was high during the sessions because attendees had to wear masks and adhere to social distancing. The school said it plans to resume in-person classes in late August, but that it is monitoring a recent increase in the number of cases and emergency room visits for COVID-19 symptoms in the Peoria area.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Indiana will keep its coronavirus restrictions in place for at least most of August, with Gov. Eric Holcomb choosing to encourage compliance with safety measures amid continued concerns about recent growth in the state’s COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. Holcomb announced that statewide limits including crowd sizes for restaurants, bars and public events would remain in effect until Aug. 27. The Republican governor lifted the state’s stay-at-home order and began easing business restrictions in early May, but he has delayed the final lifting of crowd limits for the past month. Holcomb is leaving it up to city and county officials to take any more aggressive measures, such as closing bars, which have been linked to a rise in cases among young adults across the country. That’s despite fears among federal officials that Indiana and other Midwestern states could see a significant jump in COVID-19 infections. Although Indianapolis officials have ordered bars in the city to shut down, Holcomb emphasized that steps as wearing face masks as required under a new state mandate and proper distancing should be followed to slow the virus’ spread.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:A person who played in a league July 22 at the Greater Des Moines Softball Complex has tested positive for COVID-19, according to a news release. The infected person played in the 7:30 p.m. league, the release said. Upon learning of the case on Wednesday, the city notified other players, staff and umpires who were present, the announcement said. High-traffic areas at the adult softball complex, located at 4980 N.E. 46th St., are disinfected multiple times daily, according to the city. Officials advised people who believe they might have been exposed to monitor themselves for symptoms of COVID-19 and follow guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The city prohibits patrons who were exposed from returning to the facilities until they complete a home isolation period per CDC recommendations, the news release said.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: The Kansas State High School Activities Association is allowing all fall high school sport competitions in Kansas to move forward as scheduled despite the coronavirus pandemic. Its executive board narrowly defeated a motion that would have delayed the start of fall competitions, the Lawrence Journal-World reported. The decision means fall sports and activities programs can start practices on Aug. 17 and competitions can move forward as scheduled. However, local school boards will still be able to change sports schedules within their districts.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville:The Old Lou Brew Craft Beer Festival planned for Aug. 29 has been postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic. The event will next be held in 2021. “Old Lou Brew is becoming one of the city’s favorite beer festivals just because it’s so relaxed and fun in Old Louisville’s beautiful Central Park. We will be back better than ever, as soon as it’s safe, hopefully next summer,\" Old Louisville Neighborhood Council director Shawn Williams said. The event typically features Kentucky's finest independent brewers and a half-dozen food trucks and acts as a fundraiser for the Old Louisville Neighborhood Council.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Eleven Louisiana bar owners filed a lawsuit Wednesday against Gov. John Bel Edwards, arguing his coronavirus rules limiting bars to takeout and delivery unlawfully target one business sector and impose overly harsh restrictions. The lawsuit names the Democratic governor and Fire Marshal Butch Browning, the chief enforcement officer of the virus regulations for Edwards, as defendants. It was filed in Lafayette federal court by bars located across Acadiana, including in New Iberia, Morgan City, Youngsville and Lafayette. The bars argue Edwards cannot show a “real or substantial relation” between the closure of bars to onsite drinking and the public health crisis. They say only a small number of known COVID-19 cases have been traced to bars by the state, and they say none of those cases were tracked to their businesses. Attorney Jimmy Faircloth, representing the bar owners, said Edwards’ coronavirus restrictions “may have warranted the benefit of the doubt” in the early days of the outbreak of COVID-19. But he said more scientific data is available, and he argued that data undermines Edwards’ decision. The Louisiana Department of Health said it traced 464 confirmed coronavirus infections to 41 bars, among the largest number of cases tracked to a specific type of business. Edwards banned onsite consumption at bars earlier this month after previously allowing bars to reopen with restaurants and other businesses. But the governor and his health advisers said bars have shown to be specifically problematic because people tend to huddle closely together inside without masks while drinking and lapse in their virus precautions the more alcohol they consume.\n\nMaine\n\nEastport: A cruise ship that tied up in Eastport during the coronavirus pandemic is ready to set sail. The Oceania Riviera will depart this weekend for Europe. The 785-foot ship arrived in Eastport on June 14 with no passengers and has been waiting for the green light for cruise ships to resume operations. Oceania Cruises, which owns and operates Riviera, declined to comment on why the ship is moving. But a local official told the Bangor Daily News that the ship is sailing to Europe so it can switch out the crew members who live on the ship and maintain the vessel. Cruise lines stopped sailing in mid-March after several outbreaks of COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, in ships at sea. The Riviera was big enough to hold Eastport’s entire population of 1,300, and it dominated the community’s harbor.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan issued a travel advisory urging residents to avoid visiting some states with rapidly increasing cases of coronavirus and expanded mask-wearing requirements. Anyone older than age 5 will be required to wear a face covering starting at 5 p.m. Friday in all indoor public areas of businesses and buildings, including churches, offices and restaurants. Hogan’s order also expands the requirement to outdoor spaces when it is not possible to maintain social distance. “This expansion of the masking order is an action that is both fact-based, apolitical and solidly grounded in science,” Hogan said. “While it can be an inconvenience, especially in the heat, wearing a mask is the single best mitigation strategy that we have to fight the virus.” The travel advisory applies to states with positive test rates of or higher than 10%. As of Wednesday, that would include Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Nebraska, South Carolina and Texas. Hogan said if people must visit those states, they should immediately be tested upon returning to Maryland and quarantine themselves until learning the results.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nAndover: An executive at a Massachusetts facility helping create a potential vaccine for the coronavirus said Thursday that the company hopes to have the treatment ready by the end of the year. “We have the potential, subject to technical success and regulatory authorization, to manufacture up to 100 million vaccine doses by the end of this year and up to 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021,” said Meg Ruesch, research and development leader at Pfizer Inc.’s Andover facility. The vaccine candidate, a collaboration between Pfizer and BioNTech, “introduces into the body the genetic instructions for the cell to make a specific protein – in this case a SARS-CoV-2 protein – which is intended to stimulate an immune response,” she said. The data on the trials has been encouraging, she said at a news conference with Gov. Charlie Baker. She also put to rest concerns that the vaccine process is being rushed. “We don’t cut any quality corners,” she said. The Trump administration last week announced that it would pay Pfizer nearly $2 billion for December delivery of 100 million doses of their COVID-19 vaccine under development. Pfizer earlier this week announced it had started a study of its vaccine candidate in the U.S. and elsewhere. That study aimed to recruit 30,000 people.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing:Gov. Gretchen Whitmer tightened pandemic restrictions in northern Michigan while letting Detroit’s three casinos reopen at limited capacity after four-plus months of being closed to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The new limits covering 32 northern counties match ones already in place in the rest of the state. Indoor gatherings in the Traverse City and Upper Peninsula regions – where the rate of new COVID-19 cases is lower – will be capped at 10 starting at 12:01 a.m. Friday, down from 50. Bars must close for indoor service if more than 70% of their gross receipts are from alcohol sales. The three casinos in Detroit can open Aug. 5. They will have to ban smoking and limit capacity to 15%. Tribal casinos, which are not regulated by the state, have reopened and have been operating safely, Whitmer said. Indoor theaters, gyms, bowling alleys and places like outdoor concert venues can remain open in the Upper Peninsula and much of the northern Lower Peninsula, subject to capacity caps and distancing requirements.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis:Mayor Jacob Frey ordered that indoor bar areas be closed in the state’s largest city as coronavirus cases have surged among young adults. At least nine bars have been tied to virus outbreaks, with at least seven customers testing positive. The city said more than half of its new cases are in people younger than 35 who report increased exposure in bars and at gatherings of family and friends. “A night out at the bar is too often leading to nights in the hospital for family, for friends and for neighbors,” Frey said. “By focusing on bar areas, which are proven to be hotbeds for congregation and community spread, we can help keep both Minneapolis and Minnesotans safe and can help keep trends stable.” The regulation, which goes into effect on Saturday, includes bars, nightclubs, distilleries, tap rooms and bar areas inside restaurants. Patrons can still go to these establishments but must be seated and served from socially distanced tables. City Health Commissioner Gretchen Musicant said cases have steadily increased citywide since June 21, roughly two weeks after Gov. Tim Walz issued reopening guidelines. The city is reporting a rate of 18 new cases per 100,000 people per day, significantly higher than the state’s roughly 11 per day.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: School districts have just days to submit plans for this academic year to the state, but as the deadline nears and new cases of the coronavirus continue to rise, those plans keep changing. Jackson Public Schools came out with a detailed plan in mid-July for how it was going to return students to in-person classroom instruction at the start of the school year. Children were to undergo temperature checks before getting on the bus or entering school buildings in the morning. Hand-washing and sanitization breaks were built into the school day. All students would wear masks on campus. Families had the option of keeping children at home and doing online learning with district-issued laptops, something educators said would allow for more social distancing in the classroom. The program was created after dozens of surveys, constituent feedback and hours of strategic planning among staff. But last Friday, just over a week after releasing its plan, Superintendent Errick L. Greene announced Jackson schools officials made the difficult decision to change course and educate students entirely online, at least for the fall. He said he was proud of the work that went into creating a plan to enable kids to return to the classroom but rising cases of coronavirus in the state were a undeniable concern. School districts are due to submit their plans to the Mississippi Department of Education by Friday, but there’s still uncertainty about what schooling during the pandemic will look like, just weeks from the start of the academic year. Districts have been reframing plans almost weekly as they receive updates from the state department of health.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: With coronavirus cases surging, several St. Louis-area school districts have decided to start the school year with online-only learning, while the state’s largest school district is limiting the number of days each student will attend in-person. Springfield Public Schools plan to reopen with each student attending classes for two days, and learning virtually otherwise. Republican Gov. Mike Parson was in Springfield on Wednesday and said he supported the plan, the Springfield News-Leader reported. Parson said after meeting with local educators that he understood the frustration of many parents who want their kids back in the classroom full-time. “But when you look at a Springfield school district, I would look at how big that is, and ask ‘How do you do that?’ and ‘How do you do that safely?’ ” Parson said. Meanwhile, a growing list of St. Louis-area districts will start the year with virtual instruction only. The Clayton, Parkway, Pattonville and Webster Groves districts were among those to announce their plans Wednesday. St. Louis County has no authority to mandate what schools do, but County Executive Sam Page has urged parents to opt for virtual learning.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The Montana Department of Commerce’s Office of Tourism and Business Development has launched a campaign to promote coronavirus-related safety precautions among travelers in the state. Officials announced the $5 million “Montana Aware” campaign aims to use fliers, posters and social media messages to inform the public about steps to reduce the spread of COVID-19, including wearing a mask and maintaining social distancing. The state’s mask mandate is in effect for 25 counties.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Nebraska’s meatpacking plants won’t have to worry about any new safety restrictions this year, despite outbreaks of the coronavirus among their workers, after a state lawmaker on Wednesday could not secure enough support for the idea. Sen. Tony Vargas of Omaha fell two votes short of the 30 he needed to introduce a bill in the waning days of the 2020 session. The Legislature’s rules only allow new bills to be introduced during the first 10 days of each session, unless a super majority of lawmakers agrees to suspend the rule. Wednesday was the 51st day of this year’s 60-day session. Lawmakers voted 28-10 to allow the new proposal. Many of Nebraska’s meatpacking plants were forced to temporarily shutter their operations earlier this year after they became among the nation’s largest coronavirus hot spots. In May, state officials acknowledged that nearly one in six coronavirus cases in Nebraska had been linked to a meatpacking plant. Conservative lawmakers argued that a new bill wasn’t necessary because Nebraska’s plants have since taken steps to protect their workers, seeking guidance from infectious disease experts at the University of Nebraska Medical Center on how to safely operate. The companies said they have introduced measures such as social-distancing and plastic barriers that separate employees who work close together.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: State casino regulators are seeking fines against two casinos and a bowling alley in rural Nevada, alleging that employees and patrons failed to comply with requirements including a mandate for people to wear face coverings to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Nevada Gaming Control Board spokesman Michael Lawton said Wednesday that confidentiality rules prevent the agency from making public details of 156 open investigations or names of entities unless formal complaints are filed with the state Gaming Commission. Records showed that complaints were filed since last Friday against C.O.D. Casino in Minden and the Hotel Nevada & Gambling Hall in Ely. Representatives of each property declined telephone requests Wednesday for comment. The complaints in each case allege that during repeat visits held several days apart, state inspectors saw employees and patrons without face coverings or wearing them improperly. At the Hotel Nevada, a regulator noted that casino employees approached customers while an agent was taking photos and appeared to tell them to don face coverings. A third complaint filed Tuesday named Bowl Incline on the Lake Tahoe shoreline, where owner Curt Wegener said he was unaware until a gaming control agent visited his bowling alley bar on July 11 that Gov. Steve Sisolak had rolled back permission for bar areas to be open, effective midnight July 10.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: Faced with an empty minor-league baseball stadium for the summer, the New Hampshire Fisher Cats are seeking $1 million to pay their bills during the coronavirus pandemic.The team is facing a $5.5 million loss in revenue, officials told lawmakers advising the Governor’s Office for Emergency Relief and Recovery. It leases the stadium from the city of Manchester, which would face its own budget difficulties if payments aren’t made, said Mayor Joyce Craig. “They’ve been a very significant player in the city of Manchester’s economic viability,” said state Sen. Lou D’Allesandro, D-Manchester. The team did receive $350,000 in federal funding – the maximum amount available – from the state’s Main Street relief fund. It also has applied for funding from a General Assistance and Preservation Fund for businesses and nonprofits that haven’t been able to otherwise get support. The deadline for those applications is Aug. 4. So far, the state has allocated $1 billion of the $1.25 billion in received in federal coronavirus relief aid.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: New Jersey’s Labor Department said unemployment claims jumped nearly 9% last week from the previous week. New Jersey’s job market, like the country’s, continues to feel effects from the COVID-19 outbreak with more than 28,000 people seeking jobless benefits last week, up from nearly 26,000. Labor officials said there have been more than 1.4 million claims in the state since the virus first broke out here in March. So far, state officials said they have paid out $12.4 billion in state and federal benefits over 19 weeks. Last week also marked the end of the federal weekly $600 supplemental payment. About 840,000 people claimed the benefit last week, the department said. The state labor figures came out the same day a federal report indicated the nation’s economy shrank by 32.9% in the last quarter. New Jersey has among the highest unemployment rates in the country at 16.6%, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces:TriCore Reference Laboratories is establishing a branch lab on New Mexico State University’s campus to boost clinical laboratory testing capacity for the novel coronavirus in southern New Mexico. The New Mexico Department of Health will provide the university with funding to support the lab, according to a news release from the university Tuesday. The lab will begin functioning later this month. NMDOH Secretary Kathy Kunkel said in a statement the lab will increase the state’s overall testing capacity. Testing in this case does not refer to the process by which a sample is collected from somebody for a possible coronavirus diagnosis, such as a nasal swab. Testing refers to the processing of those samples to see if someone is positive or negative for the virus. Samples have often needed to be sent north to be tested. When the lab begins operating, the university release said it hopes to \"provide much-needed testing capability in the Paso del Norte region.\"\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Demand for rides from taxis and app-based services plummeted in New York City during the height of the pandemic, and only slowly started to climb back as the city re-opened, according to a report released Wednesday. New York City’s Taxi and Limousine Commission said trips started declining in mid-March and continued into April, falling as much as 84% from the previrus days at their lowest point. Since then, there was a gradual increase through the period until the end of June. The city data showed yellow taxis had just over 18,000 daily trips at the end of June, compared with more than 200,000 before the shutdown. The high-volume for-hire services, which includes apps like Uber and Lyft, were at more than 251,000 daily trips, down from almost 750,000 in February. The pandemic also took drivers off the road. In February, there were just under 115,000 drivers making trips, but by April, that had fallen to fewer than 29,000. At the end of June, the number of drivers had risen slightly, to 30,675.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Vice President Mike Pence traveled to Raleigh on Wednesday in a push to encourage more K-12 schools to reopen with entirely in-person instruction. Air Force Two landed around noon Wednesday at Raleigh-Durham International Airport ahead of planned stops at a private school and a company working on coronavirus vaccine trials. Pence disembarked the plane wearing a dark face mask. He was greeted by a small group and waved at onlookers before getting in a black SUV. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper announced in July that public schools can offer a mix of online and in-person instruction, though districts can choose to offer fully remote learning.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The pronounced rise of confirmed coronavirus infections around North Dakota’s capital city likely stems from multiple Fourth of July gatherings and citizens’ failure to take precautions to minimize the risk of spreading the disease, a local health official said Wednesday. Bismarck-Burleigh Public Health Director Renae Moch said there appears to be a lax attitude toward the virus and a belief that precautions such as wearing a mask don’t help. “Masks in other part of the nation are the norm, but if you’re doing it out here, you’re the minority,” Moch said. Cases in Burleigh County and neighboring Morton County have tripled this month and account for about a third of the 1,038 confirmed active cases reported Wednesday. The two counties added 36 new positive cases on Wednesday, the Department of Health reported. Burleigh and Morton counties continue to post the highest percentage of positive tests in the state at an average positive rate of 4.2% for the last 14 days, significantly higher than the statewide rate of 2.79% and Cass County’s 2.72 %, the Health Department reported. Cass County, which contains the Fargo metropolitan area, reported 10 of the 89 new positive cases Wednesday. Burleigh and Cass counties each reported one new death linked to the virus, raising the statewide death toll to 102.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The Ohio pharmacy board reversed course Thursday and tossed a rule that would have prohibited use of a malaria drug for patients with COVID-19. The decision followed public feedback and a request by Gov. Mike DeWine to ditch the rule. At issue was the prescribing of the drug hydroxychloroquine, whose effectiveness for the coronavirus has been widely questioned. On Wednesday, the pharmacy board banned its use as a coronavirus treatment, noting that the Food and Drug Administration previously revoked the emergency use of the drug. The FDA “made this determination based on recent results from a large, randomized clinical trial in hospitalized patients that found these medicines showed no benefit for decreasing the likelihood of death or speeding recovery,” the state pharmacy board said. But on Thursday, FDA Commissioner Dr. Steven Hahn said on NBC’s “Today” show that the drug’s use should be between doctor and patient. DeWine said he agreed with that assessment. “The Board of Pharmacy and the State Medical Board of Ohio should revisit the issue, listen to the best medical science, and open the process up for comment and testimony from experts,” DeWine said. The board said it decided to roll back the rule as “a result of the feedback received by the medical and patient community and at the request of Governor DeWine.” It plans to reexamine the issue along with the state medical board.\n\nOklahoma\n\nMacomb:To ensure Macomb Public Schools provide the best instruction and safety measures against COVID-19, the district has decided to push the first day of school to Aug. 19. According to Superintendent Matt Riggs, students were originally scheduled to return to school Aug. 5. “As we get closer to the start date, I just don’t feel we will be ready to provide the type of instruction we want to provide by Aug. 5,” Riggs said. Like other districts, Riggs said Macomb will offer students the opportunity to continue distance learning and in-person instruction. Riggs said although distance learning will be offered to all, details will vary for each grade. In addition to distance learning, Riggs said the district has developed policies and procedures to keep staff and students safe during in-person instruction. “We are keeping students and staff in one room and delivering meals to the classrooms to decrease the opportunities for large group gatherings,” Riggs said. “Teachers will be spacing students in their classrooms to the best of their ability.” The administrator said one of the biggest challenges the district will face is physical distancing as buildings on campus have limited space.\n\nOregon\n\nSilverton:The annual summertime festivals in Silverton might have been canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but not the Davenport International Cartoon Contest. The contest for political or editorial cartoons on any topic – as long as they’re not libelous, slanderous, racist, sexist or salacious – has been staged since 1984 in honor of Homer Davenport, Silverton’s famous political cartoonist. Entries must be original and unpublished, and the entry fee is $25 per cartoon. The deadline to enter is 5 p.m Friday. Cash prizes are $750 for grand prize, $500 for first, $300 for second and $200 for third. The work will be judged on artistic skill, clearly implied message and the cartoon’s overall appeal. Judging the contest will be state Sen. Lew Frederick, D-Portland; Dr. David Lewis, cultural anthropologist from Salem; and Oregon State Rep. Rick Lewis, R-Silverton. For rules and entry forms, visit HomerDavenport.com/tooncon.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Pennsylvania bar and restaurant owners said they have been unfairly blamed for rising virus case numbers, challenging the administration of Gov. Tom Wolf to provide evidence and criticizing the Democratic governor over pandemic restrictions they said will drive many of them out of business. Wolf cited rising infection rates in some hot spots when he imposed a new round of restrictions on bars and restaurants two weeks ago. Occupancy was reduced from 50% to 25% capacity, and alcohol can only be served with meals. Riki Tanaka, who owns three restaurants in lightly impacted McKean County, in the rural northwest, told a state House panel it makes no sense and “flat out isn’t fair” to lump eateries in his region with those in virus hot spots like Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. He said no restaurant can survive under the limitations imposed by Wolf, noting he had to furlough dozens of workers. “Give us a fighting chance,” he said. “Let me operate my business.” Tanaka and other restaurant owners and industry officials testified at a hearing arranged by House Republicans.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Lt. Gov. Dan McKee is urging owners of small businesses struggling because of the coronavirus pandemic to apply for a grant to help them recover. Applications for the Restore RI program will be available starting Monday, McKee said in a statement Thursday. The $50 million program will provide grants of up to $15,000 based on whether the business is in a severely impacted industry, the number of full-time employees, and the degree of revenue loss. Businesses will need to demonstrate at least 30% revenue loss if they are in a severely impacted industry or at least 50% revenue loss for other eligible industries. Businesses with between one and 20 employees are eligible to apply, with the exception of restaurants and caterers, which are not subject to an employee cap. Sole proprietors are eligible for the program as long as they have at least one employee in addition to the owner. Applicants must have a physical presence in Rhode Island and must be open or plan to be open within 60 days.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville:State health officials said that a child under the age of 5 died of COVID-19 in Greenville County earlier this month, marking the state's second pediatric coronavirus death reported during July. The child's death happened on July 8 and was disclosed Tuesday by the state Department of Health and Environmental Control. Citing privacy concerns, a spokesperson for the agency did not provide the child's age or gender. The spokesperson also would not provide details about when the child tested positive for COVID-19, whether the child had underlying health issues or where the child was hospitalized. Asked why almost three weeks passed before the child's death was reported, the spokesperson responded in an email, \"A delay in the reporting of an individual’s death during this pandemic is most often the result of ensuring the death is accurately classified. DHEC crosschecks the initial information reported to us when a COVID-19 death occurs with the information listed on the official death certificate when that document is submitted to the agency.\" On July 11, DHEC reported that a child under the age of 5 from Chester County died of COVID-19. DHEC said at the time that it was the first COVID-19 death of a child in South Carolina.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Top South Dakota Republican lawmakers said they would rather wait until the legislative session in January to decide how to use most of the federal coronavirus aid the state has received. Following a conference call with Gov. Kristi Noem on Tuesday night, Republican legislative leaders said they were following the current negotiations in Congress over the new coronavirus aid package and hoping that Congress would extend the deadline beyond the end of the year to allocate most of the $1.25 billion the state has received. If that happens, there might not be a special session this fall, said House Majority Leader Lee Qualm, a Platte Republican. Qualm cautioned that it might be a couple of weeks before Congress completes the rules for spending the aid, saying, “There’s still some things up in the air.” The state has spent about $75 million of the aid, with most of that going toward unemployment benefits. As leaders figure out what to do with roughly a billion dollars of what’s left, the governor told lawmakers that if Congress extends the deadline, there would likely be no need for a special session, according to state Sen. Lee Schoenbeck, a Watertown Republican. Republicans said the Legislature needs time to make sure the money has the most impact. It would allow legislative committees to vet the allocations, rather than deciding in a rushed special session. Senate Majority Leader Kris Langer, a Republican from Dell Rapids, said she is hoping Congress also allows state governments to put some of the federal funding towards covering losses in revenue. But Democrats, who hold a minority in the Legislature, argued that waiting to spend the money until next year would be too late for people and businesses struggling from the pandemic. Senate Minority Leader Troy Heinert, a Democrat from Mission, called for legislators to convene as early as September, creating a task force of convening committees.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state Supreme Court heard oral arguments Thursday over whether to keep absentee voting open to all eligible voters for the November election becauser of the coronavirus pandemic. The hearing came on the last day to request absentee ballots for the Aug. 6 primary election. Last month, a state court judge ordered the absentee expansion during the pandemic, and the Supreme Court decided against blocking it for the primary. The first day to request absentee ballots for the general election is Aug. 5, likely requiring the court to rule quickly. Tennessee election officials have opposed the expansion of absentee eligibility, arguing it is unfeasible for the 2020 elections and citing some issues experienced in other states. The groups that sued, including the American Civil Liberties Union, have argued that without the expansion, Tennessee would make many voters choose between risking their health at the polls or forgoing their constitutional right to vote.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin:U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Tyler, said he will take hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19, a day after testing positive for the virus at the White House. “My doctor and I are all in,” he told Sean Hannity on Wednesday night on Fox News, adding that he will start the regimen in the “next day or two.” Hydroxychloroquine, a drug typically used to prevent and treat malaria and certain autoimmune conditions, has been touted by President Donald Trump as a possible cure for COVID-19, despite research that has shown that the drug is not effective in treating the virus. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration withdrew its emergency-use authorization for the drug, warning against the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for COVID-19 outside of the hospital setting or a clinical trial because of the risk of heart rhythm problems. The agency also has listed other safety issues associated with the drugs, including blood and lymph system disorders, kidney injuries and liver problems and failure. Gohmert was scheduled to fly to Texas on Wednesday morning with President Donald Trump, but tested positive at the White House and did not go on the trip. He said he does not have any COVID-19 symptoms but will self-quarantine for 10 days.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:The Washington County School Board voted unanimously to enact the official plan for students to return to school, just as Utah's largest union of teachers announced opposition to reopening on the regular schedule this fall. Board Superintendent Larry Bergeson said students will be required to wear masks, but that the situation is fluid and might be subject to change. Schools are set to reopen Aug. 13 for in-person school on a traditional schedule from Monday through Friday. Friday will be an early release day for all K-12 students for deep cleaning and staff training. On Fridays, intermediate schools will dismiss at 11:45 a.m., middle and high school will dismiss at 12:30 p.m. and elementary schools will dismiss at 1:15 p.m. Face coverings are required for all staff and students, with the exception of those that have qualifying health conditions. Parents and students will have options for in-person or virtual at-home learning and there is a \"blended in-person/virtual combination\" option where students can do both depending on qualifying health conditions. On buses to and from school, students and all bus drivers must be wearing face coverings. In the classrooms, teachers are also required to wear face coverings and sanitize or wash their hands frequently.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The state reported its first new death from the coronavirus in 43 days on Thursday, bringing the state’s total number of deaths since the pandemic began to 57. “We have been uniquely fortunate to have been spared such a loss for many weeks,” said Vermont Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine in a written statement. The state also reported one new case of COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. The state is maintaining a relatively low rate of new positive cases because of “the cooperation and sacrifices Vermonters,” he said. “However, while we are hopeful that together, our efforts will keep us from experiencing more illness and deaths in the future, we must be prepared for the fact that the virus is not going away anytime soon,” Levine said. “I ask everyone in Vermont to join me in honoring this latest loss by recommitting to doing everything we can to keep each other safe and prevent further spread of this virus.”\n\nVirginia\n\nWilliamsburg: Busch Gardens Williamsburg said it plans to reopen in early August. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported Wednesday that the park’s parent company did not provide details on when the reopening would be. The park is owned by SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. “The company expects its Busch Gardens theme park in Virginia to commence a phased reopening in early August 2020,” the company said in a news release. The announcement did not say whether the Water Country USA park would reopen, as well. Busch Gardens Williamsburg and Water County USA have been closed since March. Busch Gardens Williamsburg is one of the state’s biggest tourist attractions and economic boosters. Another popular park, Kings Dominion in Hanover County, remains closed.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: As a $600 weekly bonus to those seeking unemployment benefits in Washington expired, the state saw a slight dip in new weekly claims, which remained at high levels as the coronavirus pandemic continues to affect the state’s economic recovery. More than 1.2 million people have filed claims for unemployment since early March when the pandemic job losses began, and more than 966,000 people who filed initial claims have been paid. To date, the state has paid more than $8.7 billion in benefits, two-thirds of which is federal money that is providing the unemployed with an additional $600 a week on top of the state’s weekly maximum benefit of up to $790 per week. That $600 weekly bonus is technically set to expire Friday, but the cutoff was effectively June 25, owing to how states process payments. Congress has not been able to reach agreement on an extension. The number of new claims for unemployment benefits in Washington last week – 28,840 – was down 1.7% from the previous week.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Marshall University will move more fall semester courses to a remote format than originally planned because of the coronavirus pandemic. “This transition will allow us to continue to monitor the status of the pandemic in our community, further reduce density inside our classroom facilities, and preserve, as much as possible, the important on-campus experience for our freshmen,” Marshall President Jerome Gilbert said in a statement. Gilbert said most sophomores, juniors and seniors will attend classes online that are broadcast live and recorded. He said freshmen, some graduate students and most professional students can expect a combination of online and face-to-face instruction. Marshall’s fall semester is set to begin on Aug. 24. Students can move into residence halls starting Aug. 15. In Morgantown, West Virginia University has pushed back the start of its semester by one week to Aug. 26 and also is switching some courses to online instruction.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Rural counties in northern Wisconsin that had largely been immune from the coronavirus pandemic are now seeing a surge in cases, with Iron County now having the state’s highest rate of active confirmed COVID-19 infections. The number of confirmed infections in Iron County was in the single digits for four months before spiking in July, with 75 total cases. Of those, 68 are of residents and seven are of nonresidents. The cases are spread throughout the county. Thirty-eight people have recovered, three have been hospitalized and one has died, Wisconsin Public Radio reported Thursday. Zona Wick, the former county health officer who has been rehired as a public health nurse during the crisis, said the spike is a result of “quarantine fatigue.” That led to people casting aside social distancing for graduation parties, Fourth of July gatherings and other social events where the disease spread, Wick said. The low numbers “lulled people into complacency, into saying, ‘Hey, things are safe here. It’s just our family. It’s just our friends. It’s just people we know.’ … And the virus doesn’t care,” Wick said. Only four of Wisconsin’s 72 counties showed more active cases than recovered ones, according to the state Department of Health Services. Those were Iron, Juneau, Langlade and Menominee counties. Two others, Taylor and Washburn counties, had the same number of active and recovered cases. All six are rural counties. On Wednesday, Trempealeau County public health nurse Kaila Baer said in a statement that the western Wisconsin county was “on the edge of moving to severe risk.” It had the seventh-highest case rate in Wisconsin per 100,000 people, Baer said.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The coronavirus pandemic has prompted cancellation of a charity antelope hunt that has drawn teams of famous, powerful men to central Wyoming for more than 75 years and now faces growing criticism that ceremonies tied to the event crudely and inaccurately appropriate Native American culture. The Lander One Shot Antelope Hunt has been held every year since 1944. Participants have included Roy Rogers, Peter Fonda, Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, Vice President Dick Cheney, 16 astronauts and the governors of 30 states. Wyoming’s governors have participated in all but two hunts since 1954. This year, Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon was planning to invite Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts, a fellow Republican, to be on his team, according to Gordon’s office. The mid-September hunt has raised millions of dollars for conservation-oriented causes but lately has faced criticism for associated ceremonies in which politicians, including former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat now running for U.S. Senate, have worn indigenous women’s headscarves designating them as “losers” of the event. Hickenlooper in 2018 wore a native headdress designating him a “winner” of the hunt, Wyoming Public Radio reported recently. Although the hunt takes place on the high plains – prime territory for social distancing – and rural Wyoming has escaped the worst of the virus outbreaks, banquets associated with the event draw hundreds of people. Meanwhile, several of this year's eight, three-man teams dropped out amid concern about traveling during the pandemic, said Vickie Hutchinson, a hunt organizer and executive director of the Water for Wildlife Foundation. The hunt is the latest major outdoor event in Wyoming to fall victim to COVID-19. Cheyenne Frontier Days, a two-week rodeo and Western culture festival that would have wrapped up last weekend, also was called off at a cost of millions of dollars to the state capital economy.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/07/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/07/12/weeding-robots-goat-lottery-liquor-shortage-news-around-states/117484386/", "title": "Weeding robots, goat lottery: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A state agency said Friday that it will work with private organizations to encourage more elderly and disabled people to get vaccines for COVID-19, which is on the rise as the state’s inoculation rate trails the nation. With Alabama ahead of only Mississippi in vaccinations and just 30% of the state’s population fully inoculated against the illness caused by the coronavirus, the Alabama Department of Senior Services said a new marketing campaign was aimed at overcoming vaccine hesitancy. The agency will work with local agencies for the aging and disability organizations to encourage more people to get shots. A telephone hotline will allow people to reach local services and make vaccination appointments, which has been difficult for some disabled people. Vaccination rates have dropped statewide to the lowest point since early this year, when doses were scarce, and only certain people were eligible to receive shots. While less than a third of the state’s population is fully vaccinated, precautions like face masks and social distancing are increasingly rare in the state. Meanwhile, hospitalizations are rising in a trend that is troubling to health experts. State statistics showed 252 people were being treated for COVID-19 in hospitals Thursday compared to a low of 166 late last month.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A state court judge is scheduled to hear arguments Monday in a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a voter-approved initiative that would end party primaries in Alaska and institute ranked-choice voting in general elections. Scott Kohlhaas, who unsuccessfully ran for a state House seat last year as a Libertarian; Bob Bird, chairman of the Alaskan Independence Party; Bird’s party; and Anchorage attorney Kenneth P. Jacobus sued in December, shortly after the initiative was approved. In court documents, they say people “exercise their right of free political association by forming political parties for the purpose of electing candidates” and advancing issues and principles. They call the new voter-approved system a “political experiment” and say it was designed in a way to harm political parties. They cite concerns that candidates for minor parties, like the Alaskan Independence Party, could get “lost in the shuffle” in a primary where all candidates are listed on one ballot and the top four vote-getters advance to the general election. Attorneys for the state Department of Law in court documents say the plaintiffs’ opposition includes a mix of policy arguments and speculation. They say the claims raised by the plaintiffs “rest on a misunderstanding” of what the initiative does, according to court filings.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Gov. Doug Ducey on Friday signed legislation banning state or local governments from requiring training in “critical race theory” and a bill creating a new small-business income tax category that will allow small-business owners to avoid paying any of the 3.5% income tax surcharge voters approved in November. The new small-business tax is expected to cut $292 million from the original $836 million schools would have received under Proposition 208, according to the Legislature’s budget analysts. Backers of the initiative have vowed to block the new law by referring it to the ballot. Ducey also signed a measure that tightens the state’s sex education law and requires parents to give permission for instruction that includes sexual issues in non-sex ed classes. The broad requirement would block discussions of historic events that have a sexual component, like the 1969 Stonewall riots in New York, considered the genesis of the modern gay rights movement, or even the U.S. Supreme Court ruling legalizing gay marriage, without parental preapproval. “Parents should have the right to know what their children are learning in school,” Ducey said in a statement. “This is a no-brainer piece of legislation that protects our children from learning materials that aren’t suited for them.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Arkansas State Police on Friday handed over to prosecutors the results of the agency’s investigation into a deputy’s fatal shooting of a white teenager that has drawn the attention of civil rights activists nationwide. Lonoke County Prosecutor Chuck Graham said his office received the case file on the shooting of 17-year-old Hunter Brittain by Lonoke County sheriff’s deputy Sgt. Michael Davis during a June 23 traffic stop. Graham said the file has been taken to the state prosecutor coordinator since he’s requested a special prosecutor to handle the case. Authorities have released few details about the shooting, and State Police earlier Friday referred questions about the case file to Graham’s office. Brittain’s family has said the teenager was unarmed and holding a jug of antifreeze at the time of the shooting. Prosecutor Coordinator Bob McMahan said a special prosecutor should be named early this week. Davis was fired by Lonoke County Sheriff John Staley last week for not turning on his body camera until after the shooting occurred. Staley said there’s no footage from the shooting, only the aftermath. The Rev. Al Sharpton and two attorneys who represented George Floyd said the teen’s death highlighted the need for interracial support for efforts to reform police practices.\n\nCalifornia\n\nBurbank: Batman’s secret cave, Harry Potter’s cupboard under the stairs and the apartment from “Friends” are major centerpieces to the huge Warner Bros. studio lot expansion. Warner Bros. Studio Tour Hollywood recently reopened more than a year after doors were shuttered because of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, attendees will have a chance to explore the studio’s nearly 100 years of television and filmmaking history, highlighting the DC Universe and “Harry Potter.” A firsthand look took place a couple of days before the tour opened in late June at the Southern California studio, which now welcomes families with children ages 5 and older. Warner Bros. officials said the expansion – which includes a new building – took five years to develop in Burbank. Officials say the studio tour will follow all city, state and federal COVID-19 safety protocols. “One of the most incredible things about Warner Brothers is the incredible history of epic films that are legendary,” said “Wonder Woman” director Patty Jenkins, who helped reopen the tour.\n\nColorado\n\nDurango: A 10-year-old died of plague in La Plata County, San Juan Basin Public Health said Friday. Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and health officials said they are investigating the case and will provide more information as it becomes available, 9News reports. No other information on the child was immediately released. “We are so sad for the loss of this young Coloradan, and our deepest condolences go to the family,” said Dr. Jennifer House of the health department. “Public Health is doing an epidemiological investigation and wants Coloradans to know that while this disease is very rare, it does occur sometimes and to seek medical care if you have symptoms.” Officials say plague is caused by bacteria that can be transmitted to humans by the bites of infected fleas or by direct contact with infected animals. The risk of contracting certain animal-borne diseases, while present year-round, increases during the summer when humans and animals are frequently in close contact. Most human plague cases are acquired directly from fleas. Officials say it’s important to wear repellent when outdoors and keep up to date on pet vaccinations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says symptoms of the plague include fever, headache, chills, weakness, and one or more swollen, tender and painful lymph nodes.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: State employee union leaders are suing to stop Gov. Ned Lamont’s order to have workers return to the office now that much of the state has emerged from the pandemic, accusing him of violating prior telework agreements reached with the unions and ignoring the benefits of having people work from home. The State Employees Bargaining Agent Coalition, which filed the request for an injunction in Hartford Superior Court on Tuesday, said in a statement that state workers proved throughout the COVID-19 crisis that a flexible teleworking agreement could be beneficial to the state of Connecticut. “From increased productivity and quality performance to the positive environmental impacts like reduced emissions, improved air quality and public health, the benefits of telework are clear and something that the Administration should be taking a proud step in leading,” SEBAC said in a statement posted on its website. In May, Lamont sent an email to state employees announcing that they would be returning to their offices as of July 1 and that any telework would be limited to no more than 50% of their time, with manager approval.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: More than 111 years after it sank off the Delmarva coast and 43 years after divers found and looted it, researchers can finally – and officially – say where the USS Nina is located and why the U.S. Navy steamer built in the 1860s likely sank. The University of Delaware is a big reason why. A two-day mission out of Lewes led by UD oceanographer Dr. Arthur Trembanis in mid-June used the school’s new autonomous underwater vehicle to help identify the sunken ship. The university has been partnering with the Navy for nearly a decade, and Trembanis’ group has been mapping the seafloor for years. The drone used during the mission has a shape similar to a small torpedo. Trembanis needed to test the new equipment and said the “stars aligned” nicely for this mission since Dr. Jim Delgado, senior vice president of SEARCH Inc., a cultural resource management firm, had been talking about a mission to officially identify the Nina. Using UD’s technology, the mission did in hours what divers and researchers may have needed days or weeks to do. “We’re really privileged at UD to have one of the most largest and advanced fleets of autonomous systems in the country,” Trembanis said. A violent February storm appears the likely culprit for the ship’s loss.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: With more homicides so far in 2021 than by this same time in 2020 and carjacking incidents skyrocketing, the police department is trying to get a handle on the crimes by getting back to the basics of community policing. D.C. police officers in the 4th District have been hitting the streets, knocking on doors and starting conversations with people in the community, WUSA-TV reports. “This is an opportunity for folks to really give us some feedback – let us know what we’re doing right, what we’re doing wrong,” Inspector James Madison Boteler said. The work officers are doing is part of an initiative called “100 blocks in 100 days.” “It’s really just a get-back-to-the-basics kind of police work,” he said. Boteler, who is in a newly appointed position with the 4th Police District, is teaming up with officers covering parts of Northwest and Northeast to build better relationships with neighbors. “The amount of folks that live in the city versus the amount of crime that we respond to on a daily basis is ever-increasing,” Boteler said. To help fight that crime and the growing number of homicides year after year in the district, Chief Robert Contee selected a handful of inspectors to serve as second-in-command for larger police districts.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: Red tide could cause people along certain parts of the Gulf Coast to experience respiratory irritation, health officials said. The Florida Department of Health in Pinellas County on Sunday recommended that anyone with chronic respiratory problems consider staying away from areas experiencing red tide, the Tampa Bay Times reports. Officials also advised people not to swim around dead fish and to keep pets away from water, sea foam and dead marine life. The National Weather Service in Tampa issued a beach hazards statement Saturday evening cautioning that red tide can cause coughing, sneezing and tears in the eyes and that symptoms can be worse for people with asthma, emphysema or other chronic lung diseases. Red tide is an algae bloom producing toxins that kill fish. The toxins may also make the surrounding air difficult to breathe and often turn the water red. Those with allergies also can be affected, National Weather Service meteorologist Paul Close told the newspaper. “And just the smell, dead fish smell,” he said. St. Petersburg crews cleaned up 9 tons of dead fish in 24 hours last week, the paper reports. During a news conference Friday, St. Petersburg Emergency Manager Amber Boulding said red tide blooms killed the fish, and Tropical Storm Elsa pushed them ashore.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The Biden administration’s decision to reevaluate Georgia’s plan to overhaul how residents buy health insurance under the Affordable Care Act came as a “surprise” and suggests it wants to revisit the plan’s approval, which is not allowed, Gov. Brian Kemp’s office said. The “Georgia Access” plan would improve the experience of shopping for insurance and encourage the private sector to enroll uninsured residents, the director of Kemp’s Office of Health Strategy and Coordination said in a letter to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “Despite unsubstantiated claims to the contrary, Georgia Access will put more affordable, quality insurance coverage within reach of consumers in our state than a one-size-fits-all federal solution,” said the letter by Grant Thomas. Under the Republican governor’s plan, residents would bypass healthcare.gov and shop for federally subsidized health insurance through private agents. Critics worry the move will make it harder to shop for insurance and drive healthy people to cheaper plans that provide limited coverage, increasing premiums for older and sicker people who need the comprehensive benefits required by the ACA because the move to private websites would make it easier for consumers to simultaneously see plans that don’t provide all the benefits required by the federal health care law.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: To protect historic lands from invasive goats, officials will distribute the live animals to the public via a lottery. Hawaii officials will hold the lottery as a way to remove at least 700 goats from Puuhonua o Honaunau National Historic Park, which is an important cultural and historical site on the west side of the Big Island, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Those interested in the goats may apply for permits, which will be issued through a random lottery July 28. The state Department of Land and Natural Resources will distribute 20 to 50 goats per permit. Applicants must indicate how many goats they want and can’t choose individual animals. Lottery winners must have a 16-foot enclosed horse trailer or equivalent to pick up the goats so that they don’t escape. A permit can be refused if a trailer isn’t secured.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little on Friday mobilized the Idaho National Guard to help fight wildfires amid an ongoing drought and extreme heat. The Republican governor issued an emergency declaration allowing soldiers to help fight fires on the 9,700 square miles in mostly northern Idaho where the state provides fire protection. “Wildfire is presenting an imminent threat to life, property, and the environment, and we need all hands on deck,” Little said in a statement. “I appreciate our firefighters and fire managers for working so hard under such challenging conditions, and I am grateful that our guardsmen are able to step in once again to support Idaho communities.” It’s the first time the Idaho Department of Lands has requested the governor issue such an emergency declaration. The agency said the soldiers will help with fire suppression and logistics support. State officials didn’t say how many soldiers might be deployed to help with wildfires. Officials also said National Guard Blackhawk helicopters could be used to drop water or other suppressants on fires as well as transport firefighters and supplies. Besides tapping the National Guard, the Lands Department has also requested workers in the agency with fire line qualifications to make themselves available for fire assignments.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Visitors to this year’s Illinois State Fair will be able to visit one of the nation’s more historic highways with the creation of the Route 66 Experience. The multiyear project will turn the Springfield fairgrounds’ Gate 2 into a year-round destination for visiting a microform of the Mother Road in Illinois, from Chicago to the Chain of Rocks Bridge over the Mississippi River in Madison. It will highlight communities and attractions along the way. The project sponsor, the Illinois Route 66 Scenic Byway, will have the first phase completed by the state fair’s opening Aug. 12, executive director Casey Wichmann said. “Being able to provide visitors a central location to experience what our historic road has to offer is an amazing opportunity prior to the 100th anniversary of Route 66,” Wichmann said. The 2,448-mile highway, one of the nation’s first interstate “hard roads,” was begun 95 years ago. Dubbed the “Mother Road” by John Steinbeck in his novel “The Grapes of Wrath,” it runs from Chicago’s Loop business district to Santa Monica, California. Its path through Illinois is similar to that of current-day Interstate 55. Once running, the exhibit will feature Quick Response codes and story boards detailing historic attractions and businesses. Those communities lining Route 66 will be invited to participate.\n\nIndiana\n\nBunker Hill: Six inmates are alleging in lawsuits that they were kept in near-total darkness for weeks at a time and suffered electric shocks from exposed wires at a state prison. The lawsuits filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana claim the conditions at the maximum-security Miami Correctional Facility near Peru amounted to cruel and unusual punishment. The lawsuits claim that the six men were held in isolation cells that had no lights and that some of them suffered cuts from broken window glass and were shocked by dangling wires from a broken light fixture while trying to make their way around in the dark. ACLU of Indiana attorney Ken Falk called the prison’s action “torture.” Inmate Jeremy Blanchard’s lawsuit filed in March said he was kept in nearly total darkness for about a month last year, and the conditions led to hallucinations and severe anxiety. Attorneys for the state have denied the allegations and asked a federal judge to dismiss the lawsuit. The other five lawsuits were filed this month. A Department of Correction spokeswoman declined to comment on those cases.\n\nIowa\n\nVentura: The road running between a marsh wildlife area and Clear Lake in this small northern Iowa city is dangerous for turtles, even with a turtle crossing sign. So five boys have spent some time this summer helping the turtles cross it. On one recent summer day, they spent several hours assisting turtles, saving 20 to 30 from being flattened by motorists, and they reckon they’ve saved close to 200 overall, the Mason City Globe Gazette reports. “One time, I saw a pile of flattened turtles and two baby turtles – their parents must’ve died – so that motivated me to save other turtles,” said 10-year-old Zacaious Moe. Four friends have joined Zacaious in the turtle rescuing: Keygan Hoover, 9; Blake Meyer, 8; Cole Meyer, 10; and Casen Wenzel, 8. “That’s such a neat thing for them to spend their day doing that,” said Ventura City Administrator Else Taylor. Taylor said the turtle crossing sign and a geese crossing sign have been up for several years. “We have had issues with geese and turtles getting run over in large amounts,” she said. “I walk my dog by some of these places, and there are turtle pancakes.”\n\nKansas\n\nCheney: A central Kansas farmer has invented robots that can whack weeds and reduce the use of pesticides on crops. For years, Clint Brauer has struggled with keeping weeds out of his row crops. Along with keeping living roots in the ground, organic practices and no-till methods, he tried crimping, but the pigweeds just grew taller. Three years ago, Brauer, an ex-California-based executive who farms in Haven and Cheney, decided to implement a wild plan, using robots to behead weeds. “I realized there was no great way to get the weeds out at scale without chemicals,” Brauer said. “I needed to invent one.” So he started Greenfield Robotics. Before chemicals replaced them, workers pulled weeds from the farm. Greenfield Robotics puts the “workers” back in the field with a new kind of worker – a mechanized one. “We want to control weeds with labor and make it robot labor,” Brauer said. “Robotics is our way of putting (mechanized) labor back into the farm.” The challenge was that he felt regenerative farming did not work for large fields without the heavy use of agrichemicals. “I came up with the idea for it and tested it manually,” he said. “No one knew if it would work. It has to fit between rows.” Brauer uses the weeding bots on other farmers’ soybean crops in the area and hopes to work with sorghum, cotton and possibly canola farmers.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state Capitol is open again for visitors, but some fresh security regulations are in place. The new rules include measures detailing the types of masks allowed in the Capitol and prohibiting visitors from congregating in office entrances but still allow people to carry any gun of their choosing, with certain restrictions on ammunition and how they are secured. Gov. Andy Beshear said the emergency Capitol security measures were needed following the deadly Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, where supporters of former President Donald Trump stormed the building and forced the evacuation of members from both chambers. He also cited “a rise in domestic terror around the country.” Armed protesters have been a common sight outside the Capitol since the onset of the pandemic and even after the Jan. 6 insurrection, with the president of the Kentucky Three Percenters notably hanging the governor in effigy at one protest. About a dozen masked men wearing camouflage and carrying rifles posed for photos in the Capitol Rotunda in early 2020 – the same day as a large protest against a proposed “red flag” gun law – near the governor’s office, while the House and Senate were in session. Visitors won’t be allowed to wear their own face mask in the Capitol but will be given one by security as they enter.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLake Charles: The state’s newest food trail has the quirky name No Man’s Land: Gas Station Eats. No Man’s Land was one of the names for a buffer zone between U.S. and Spanish territories for about 13 years after the Louisiana Purchase. The Gas Station Eats food trail is starting with three stops in each of seven southwest Louisiana parishes, The American Press reports. The 450-mile route runs through Calcasieu, Allen, Beauregard, Sabine, Natchitoches, Vernon and DeSoto parishes. Stops range from the South Beau Dairy Barn in the Beauregard Parish community of Longville to French Market Express, which offers meat pies, plate lunches, yam cakes, cookies and pies in Natchitoches. There’s also an Exxon station in Natchitoches, Big Thicket BBQ in DeRidder, a Shop-A-Lott in Mansfield and another in Many, Anacoco Mercantile, and a Grab N Geaux in Lake Charles. Several stops offer fried boudin balls and whole sausages such as boudin and andouille. Others have fried fish, burgers, sandwiches – and, in Zwolle, tamales. All are in the seven-parish area known as No Man’s Land and the Neutral Strip from about 1806 until a treaty in 1819 established the Sabine River as the boundary between the United States and what later became the state of Texas.\n\nMaine\n\nBangor: The state is nearly tripling the number of acoustic shark detectors in coastal waters a year after its first fatal shark attack. The Maine Department of Marine Resources deployed eight acoustic receivers in coastal waters a year ago between Wells and Popham Beach, raising the number of sensors to 11. This summer, the state has deployed 32 acoustic receivers between York and Boothbay Harbor, said agency spokesperson Jeff Nichols. The sensors don’t provide real-time data. They must be brought to shore for the data to be downloaded to determine if they detected sharks that were previously tagged with transmitters by researchers, the Bangor Daily News reports. The extra sensors come a year a fatal attack in Harpswell. Julie Dimperio Holowach, 63, of New York City, was killed by a great white shark while swimming. It was Maine’s first fatal shark attack and the third fatal shark attack in New England. An increasing presence of large sharks in New England waters is tied to a growing number of seals.\n\nMaryland\n\nTowson: Mobile crisis teams in Baltimore County respond to fewer than half of calls to help people having mental health crises. But The Baltimore Sun reports that a pilot program funded by a $1.6 million federal grant aims to add more behavioral health professionals and set up a system to redirect some 911 calls from police to behavioral health resources. Of 4,319 calls for service since September, crisis teams have responded to 1,844, according to police data. When teams aren’t available – about 57% of the time – requests for aid are rerouted to officers, according to Police Chief Melissa Hyatt. “We have a significant capacity limitation,” Hyatt told lawmakers during a state Commission to Study Mental and Behavioral Health briefing earlier this year. There are 20 part-time and full-time clinicians and 12 officers with 40 hours of crisis intervention training in the county of nearly 830,000 residents. Next month, officials begin planning the program’s rollout, police spokeswoman Joy Stewart said. The program was announced just weeks before a May rampage in which a man set his Woodlawn home on fire and killed three neighbors before police killed him. Police said crisis teams had previous interactions with him but didn’t disclose more details.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nPlymouth: Archaeologists combing a hill near Plymouth Rock where a park will be built in tribute to the Pilgrims and their Native American predecessors have made a poignant discovery: It’s not the first time the site has been used as a memorial. David Landon of the University of Massachusetts-Boston’s Fiske Center for Archaeological Research said his team unearthed a cache of personal items he thinks were buried there in the late 1800s, most likely by a brokenhearted settler who had outlived all three of her children. Landon said the objects – eyeglasses, clothing, sewing implements, a pocket watch and a book – gave him chills because they turned up during final excavations of Cole’s Hill, a National Historic Landmark site in Plymouth where Remembrance Park is set to be constructed. “Someone clearly used that space in that fashion in the past to memorialize members of their family,” said Landon, whose team spent the past month scouring the waterfront site where the Pilgrims are said to have come ashore in 1620. Remembrance Park originally was conceived to mark 2020’s 400th anniversary of the Pilgrim’s 1620 arrival, the founding of Plymouth Colony and the settlers’ historic interactions with the indigenous Wampanoag people. But then the coronavirus pandemic hit, idling events as well as construction.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Massive amounts of green are being spent to find green ways to prevent basements, yards, streets and freeways in the city from flooding during heavy storms like one last month. Of $100 million pumped each year into infrastructure upgrades for the city’s aging water and sewer systems, $10 million goes toward installing detention ponds, bioswales, rain gardens and permeable pavement. Called green stormwater infrastructure, the features hold and slowly release rainfall into sewers, lessening flooding that has plagued Detroit and other older cities for decades. “It’s not the end-all-be-all, but it is a type of intervention that reduces wet weather flows into the system or delays them,” said Palencia Mobley, deputy director and chief engineer for Detroit’s Water and Sewerage Department. City officials say 6 inches of rain that poured down in the area June 25-26 was the most at one time in 80 years. As with a funnel beneath a swiftly flowing faucet, the volume of water moved faster than it could be pumped out or pushed through sewers to water treatment plants. Water pooled in streets and yards as debris clogged sewer grates. Untreated water pushed up through basement drains. Motorists were stranded on freeways. New vehicles in one auto plant lot were nearly submerged.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state is planning to close all but one of its COVID-19 mass vaccination sites by Aug. 7. A statement from Gov. Tim Walz late Friday said the state will focus on the several hundred smaller vaccination sites around the state, at pharmacies and health care providers. Minnesota Public Radio reports the state’s COVID-19 vaccination rate has been stagnant in recent weeks, at about two-thirds of residents 16 and older with at least one vaccine dose. Health officials have been turning to small-scale, targeted efforts to get the shots to more people. As of Friday the state reported administering more than 618,000 vaccine doses at the mass vaccination sites since January. The Mall of America location will be the only state-run mass vaccination site to stay open past the first week of August. As of Sunday, the state-run sites in St. Paul, Oakdale, Lino Lakes, Duluth, Rochester, Mankato and St. Cloud are only offering second doses of the COVID-19 vaccine in their final weeks of operation. The state-run site at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport will offer the one-dose Johnson and Johnson vaccine until it closes in early August.\n\nMississippi\n\nGreenwood: The Justice Department is continuing its investigation into the killing of Emmett Till, the Black teenager whose slaying 65 years ago in the Mississippi Delta community of Money sparked outrage and illustrated the brutality of racism in the segregated South. The department’s latest report on civil rights cold cases, released late last month, lists three investigations dating back decades that were closed because witnesses or suspects have died, leads went nowhere, or cases were too old to prosecute, but the Till case wasn’t among them. Relatives of Till said they didn’t know of anyone in the family who’d received official notification that the review had ended, a key step in the department’s process. “That’s all we know, that it’s still open,” family member Marvel Parker said Friday. Her husband, Wheeler Parker, was with Till the night he was taken from a family home at gunpoint. The youth’s brutalized body was later pulled from a river, where it had been weighted down with a cotton gin fan. Some news outlets reported last year that the investigation had ended. Initially closed in 2007, the case was reopened after a 2017 book quoted a key figure in the case, Carolyn Bryant Donham, as saying she lied when she claimed that the 14-year-old Till grabbed her, whistled and made sexual advances.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Three of the state’s top health officials said Friday that trusted local leaders and community representatives must be the primary influencers in the state’s efforts to reduce a surge in COVID-19 cases. During a virtual news conference, Robert Knodell, acting director of the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, said the state continues to have a strong relationship with federal health experts, but they all believe local health department workers and community representatives are the best avenue for persuading residents to be vaccinated. Knodell said federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials agree that people from out of state cannot “parachute” into Missouri to persuade residents to get vaccinated. “We’re on the same page as it relates to that,” Knodell said. The comments came after Republican Gov. Mike Parson said last week that he does not support a suggestion from President Joe Biden’s administration that government employees go door-to-door to urge people to get vaccinated. Jeffrey Zeints, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, responded that the program would rely on local doctors, faith leaders and others, and suggesting otherwise was “misinformation.”\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov. Greg Gianforte has discontinued Montana’s membership in a coalition of two dozen states dedicated to fighting climate change. The U.S. Climate Alliance is a nonpartisan group committed to achieving the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement and avoiding the worst impacts of climate change. Democratic former Gov. Steve Bullock joined the alliance in 2019. The alliance is made up of nearby Western states, including Colorado, Washington and Oregon. Evan Westrup, of the U.S. Climate Alliance, said Gianforte did not respond to the organization’s invitation to continue the state’s membership, Montana Public Radio reports. Gianforte spokesperson Brooke Stroyke said in a statement that the governor believes the solution to climate change is unleashing American innovation, not overbearing government mandates. She said the Paris Agreement punishes the U.S., while letting countries like China off the hook. Stroyke didn’t respond to requests to clarify Gianforte’s climate goals, or what sort of innovation is necessary in Montana. Amy Cilimburg, executive director of Climate Smart Missoula, said the state needs more than innovation. “The U.S. Climate Alliance was not some kind of a radical group; it was governors realizing that we’re stronger together,” Cilimburg said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Roughly 200 people were possibly exposed to a rabid bat while staying overnight at Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium, the zoo said. The zoo and Nebraska health officials recommended that roughly 186 campers who stayed overnight at the aquarium in recent weeks, as well as some staffers, get rabies shots. A camper on July 4 woke up to a wild bat flying around her head. A zoo emergency medical technician didn’t find any bites or scratches on her. The zoo found seven wild bats in the aquarium and euthanized them. One tested positive for rabies. The zoo in a news release Friday said it has recommended that people exposed to wild bats while they were sleeping get rabies shots. The zoo gave campers refunds and is paying for their shots. Animal Health Director Dr. Sarah Woodhouse said in a statement that guests who visited the aquarium during the day shouldn’t be concerned because bats only come out at night. “The bats we identified were little brown bats, a common bat species in Nebraska that anyone could find in their backyard or attic,” Woodhouse said. “It is not unusual for a wild bat to be infected with rabies, which is why you should never directly touch a wild bat.” Zoo staff didn’t find any signs of long-term bat roosting at the aquarium.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The U.S. Department of Energy has agreed to pay the state $65,000 after the government mislabeled and mischaracterized low-level radioactive waste that was shipped to a disposal site north of Las Vegas for more than five years. The settlement agreement announced Thursday certifies that multiple changes have been made to prevent unapproved waste from being shipped and disposed of at the Nevada National Security Site in the future, state and federal officials said. It also establishes an additional groundwater monitoring well at the site. The Energy Department has said none of the materials shipped to Nevada posed any health or safety threats to workers or the public. They were mischaracterized as the wrong category of low-level waste and should have been classified as low-level mixed waste, the state’s review determined. Low-level waste can include equipment or worker’s clothing contaminated by exposure to radiation, while mixed low-level waste can include toxic metals. Former Energy Secretary Rick Perry notified Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak in July 2019 that 33 packages of unapproved waste were sent in 10 shipments between 2013 and 2018 to the site from the Energy Department’s Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A council tasked with addressing broad issues around housing affordability and stability in the state seeks to increase housing availability by 13,500 units by 2024, according to its plan released Friday. The plan includes a three-year framework to specifically address homelessness across the state, with emphasis on the need for an increase in inventory of affordable housing. Recommendations include promoting new housing development, reducing barriers to affordable housing, and using a data-driven approach to understand regional needs. “The plan serves as a blueprint for our collective efforts – statewide, regionally, and locally – with a focus on alignment, coordination, innovation, and accountability,” Gov. Chris Sununu, who created the council last year, said in a statement. Sununu created the Council on Housing Stability after state police cleared a homeless encampment outside a courthouse in Manchester. It represents a revamping of the existing Interagency Council on Homelessness.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nSeaside Heights: Gov. Phil Murphy signed a package of bills Friday aimed at moving the state closer to its goal of generating 100% of its power from clean sources by 2050. The measures make it easier to develop some solar energy projects and to locate and build electric vehicle charging stations. But still waiting for action by the Democratic governor is another bill that would remove most local control from where and how offshore wind energy projects come ashore. Murphy did not mention that bill at a signing ceremony in Seaside Heights in a municipal parking lot across the street from a popular water park. “From wind turbine component manufacturing to solar to electric vehicles, we are well on our way to putting New Jersey back to its rightful place as a national leader” in clean energy, Murphy said. One measure makes it easier to locate electric vehicle charging stations throughout the state, eliminating the need to go before planning or zoning boards to get them approved. A similar bill signed by the governor encourages development of zero-emission vehicle fueling and charging infrastructure in redevelopment projects. Murphy also signed two measures dealing with solar power projects. One allows so-called dual use solar projects located on unpreserved farm land that is still also used for agricultural purposes.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Republican lawmakers are asking the state attorney general to weigh in on a spending dispute over $1.75 billion in federal pandemic relief aid. GOP leadership in a letter sent Thursday asked New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas, a Democrat, to issue a legal opinion declaring the funds must be allocated by the Legislature to protect the body’s fiscal authority. Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has said her administration must distribute the money because of the way Congress passed the pandemic relief bill. The Legislature allocated money earlier this year, but Lujan Grisham used her veto power to effectively bring the money under discretionary control by her office. Republican lawmakers took issue. They, along with one vocal Democratic senator, signed a petition that called for an extraordinary legislative session to be convened to override the governor’s veto and bring the funds back under the Legislature’s control. Democratic majorities in the House and Senate did not sign on. “Standing on principle isn’t always popular,” Sen. Jacob Candelaria, D-Albuquerque, said on Twitter in response to a news article. “Was easy for my Dem colleagues to challenge (the) power of (former Republican Gov. Susana) Martinez. Such a fair weather commitment to the law.”\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state is seeing an uptick in COVID-19 cases as vaccination rates slowly rise, according to data released Saturday. About 525 people each day tested positive for the coronavirus in New York for the seven days through Friday. That’s up from 369 people – a 42% increase – for the prior week. It’s unclear why more people in New York are testing positive, at a time when fewer people are getting tested. The state Department of Health said a higher percentage of cases are linked to more contagious variants and urged more people to get vaccinated. New York City is driving much of the increase in positives, though cases are also rising on parts of Long Island. Meanwhile, hospitalizations are flattening: Hospitals reported 342 COVID-19 patients as of Friday, similar to 340 patients from last Friday. About 55% of 20 million New Yorkers are fully vaccinated. That’s up from nearly 48% as of June 6. Vaccination rates are lowest in parts of western and central New York; about one-third of residents in Allegany County are fully vaccinated. Rates are also lower in parts of New York City: 43% of Bronx residents and 45.5% of Brooklyn residents are fully inoculated.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nFayetteville: Fayetteville State University has used pandemic relief funds to clear $1.6 million in tuition debt for nearly 1,500 students. The Fayetteville Observer reports the historically Black school utilized money from the federal legislation that’s known as the American Rescue Plan. Signed into law in March, it provided nearly $40 billion to higher education institutions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. FSU cleared tuition that was not covered by federal student grants or loans. The school also plans to use $4.7 million in federal funds to provide free summer classes to 1,400 undergraduates through the summer of 2023. “The university is focused on students’ success by clearing past due balances and erasing debt,” FSU spokeswoman Joy Cook said. “When the burden of financial stress is taken away, student success increases.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A Midwestern network and technology services provider says it plans to invest $200 million to upgrade and expand its fiber network in North Dakota. Midco said it’s part of a larger $500 million investment to its network in the upper Midwest that will benefit telehealth, education, government operations and remote working. Upgrading to 10-gigabit speed by 2030 is a goal toward which the cable provider has been working for the past couple years. “Now we think we can do it sooner,” said Midco President and CEO Pat McAdaragh. The phased upgrade begins in earnest in 2022, doubling Midco’s fiber network to 22,000 miles, McAdaragh said. Work in North Dakota will begin with a $100 million first phase in Bismarck, Dickinson and Fargo, lasting about three years. “Then immediately we’ll begin spending the other $100 million and getting to areas we haven’t gotten to done yet, so we’re looking at more of a six-year process than 10,” McAdaragh said. More than 25 communities, many of them rural, stand to benefit from the upgrade in North Dakota, the Bismarck Tribune reports. Midco expects remote work to continue to be an employment trend, sparked by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nOhio\n\nRootstown: An Ohio State Highway Patrol trooper successfully performed the Heimlich maneuver after a man allegedly attempted to swallow a bag of cannabis when he was pulled over for speeding. Ohio State Police Sgt. Ray Santiago said the traffic stop occurred July 3 in Portage County. Trooper Charles Hoskin stopped a vehicle that was allegedly traveling at 94 mph in a 70 mph zone, WEWS-TV reports. Dash camera video posted to the Ohio State Police Twitter account shows Hoskin asking if the driver could breathe before helping him out of the car and performing the Heimlich. The man expelled a bag of marijuana and apologized to the officer. After the man recovered, Hoskins asked: “Do you want to die over a minor misdemeanor?” The man received citations for speeding and failing to wear a seat belt, according to Santiago. The man also received a summons for marijuana and was released at the scene.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Health officials on Friday urged more residents to get vaccinated amid an alarming spike in new cases and hospitalizations for COVID-19, particularly in the northeastern part of the state. Oklahoma is seeing an uptick in cases with the emergence of the new delta variant of the coronavirus, particularly in rural areas where there are lower rates of vaccinations, said Oklahoma Health Commissioner Dr. Lance Frye. He said those numbers will likely continue to increase following the Fourth of July holiday. “Vaccination numbers for 12 to 34 years old are particularly low, meaning this demographic is especially at risk,” Frye said. “We want people to get out and enjoy their lives and their freedoms. Vaccination is the way to get there.” Oklahoma has the 11th lowest percentage of its population fully inoculated at 38.9%, compared to a national average of 47.8%, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Oklahoma has risen over the past two weeks from 190.29 new cases per day June 23 to 278.71 new cases per day Thursday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Meanwhile, the CDC on Friday said it identified 47 cases, all with the delta variant, in April and May associated with a central Oklahoma gymnastics facility.\n\nOregon\n\nPendleton: Dozens of baby hawks, desperate to escape a blast of early summer heat in recent weeks, bailed from their nests and plummeted to the ground. Calls poured into Blue Mountain Wildlife day after day as temperatures pushed beyond 110 degrees across Eastern Oregon. Lynn Tompkins told the East Oregonian that she hadn’t seen anything like it in her 30 years as director of the wildlife rehabilitation center outside Pendleton. “They had no choice,” said Tompkins, 68. “It was just too bloody hot to survive.” In all, the center took in nearly 50 nestling Swainson’s and Cooper’s hawks after they leaped from their nests in the extreme heat wave that baked the Pacific Northwest. Thirteen of the raptors suffered injuries severe enough that they had to be euthanized. “We knew the temperature was going to spike beforehand, and we assumed we might get a few more calls,” said Trisha Marquez, a volunteer who fielded the calls and who is Tompkins’ niece. “But we did not expect this at all.” The influx was more than the small staff could handle. They hardly had the space to put them all and, eventually, asked people to turn on their sprinklers and hoses and set out pans of water for less-injured birds to cool themselves down.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: A museum has returned to public view a 19th-century diorama that shows lions attacking a camel and its human rider, about a year after covering it up in response to complaints about how the courier was depicted. The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review reports a curtain around “Lion Attacking a Dromedary” at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History was removed a week ago, and information was posted to address the controversy. X-rays have confirmed that the figure contains a human skull and jaw, presenting an ethical problem for the museum, which does not know where those remains originated. The courier’s costume has been determined to be derived from at least five separate North African cultures. A new sign tells museum patrons that the exhibit, which vividly depicts two lions attacking a camel and its knife-wielding rider, is popular but reinforces stereotypes. “For the present, the museum is keeping the diorama on display,” the sign says. “We want to engage with visitors, staff, and community members to listen and learn from you as we consider the future of this diorama.” Museum director Gretchen Baker told the paper the curtains “were more harmful than not having them up at all,” and in hindsight covering the exhibit may not have been the right approach. The French-built diorama has been at the Carnegie since 1899.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Dan McKee has vetoed legislation that would make property owners register with the state before listing short-term rentals through online lodging websites, to the chagrin of some concerned about the unregulated nature of the industry. “I cannot support this bill because it will create additional burden for property owners,” the Democratic governor wrote Thursday in a veto message. “Short-term rental concerns, like other property/land use and small business matters, are most effectively addressed at the municipal level.” Some municipal leaders and residents are worried about properties rented on vacation rental websites like Airbnb and VRBO becoming de facto hotels. Calls for a registry increased in the spring after a 22-year-old University of Rhode Island student was fatally stabbed during a party at a rental property in Newport. The proposal was overwhelmingly approved by the heavily Democratic Legislature, which can override McKee’s veto. Senate President Dominick Ruggerio and House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, both Democrats, wrote in a joint statement that they were “disappointed” by the veto.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Conservationists have pulled a historic canoe from a river and plan to put it on display. Volunteers with the Chattooga Conservancy hauled the weathered wooden canoe out of the South Carolina side of the Chattooga River on Tuesday after a group of canoeists headed downstream discovered the craft last fall, The State newspaper reports. Archaeologists at the University of South Carolina say the boat could be 200 to 250 years old, a discovery that could shed light on life in the late 1700s. Canoes of that age are rarely found along the Chattooga, a free-flowing mountain river that runs along the Georgia-South Carolina border. Most of South Carolina’s historic canoes have been found in the state’s Lowcountry region, said underwater archaeologist James Spirek. “Up in the mountains on the rivers, they’re a little rare,” Spirek told the newspaper. “It’s interesting to find people were using canoes on some of these wild rivers.” The experts said the canoe was hollowed out using an iron hatchet or ax, suggesting it was made after Europeans settled in the Southeast. A nail was also found at one end of the canoe. Volunteers are expected this week to pull the boat up a mountain slope and down a bank to then float it down a calmer river stretch to move it out of the river corridor for storage or display.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Two Native Americans announced Thursday that they were joining a lawsuit against South Dakota alleging that state agencies failed to offer voter registration services. The two tribal members, along with the Lakota People’s Law Project, said they were asking a federal district judge to allow them to join a lawsuit that alleges state agencies are breaking federal law by not providing ample opportunities to register to vote or update voter registration information at places like motor vehicle and public assistance offices near Native American reservations. Federal law requires the agencies to help people register to vote at those kinds of offices, including ones that provide public assistance or serve people with disabilities. The Oglala Sioux Tribe and the Rosebud Sioux Tribe initiated the legal challenge last year. The state has denied those allegations in court documents and asked that the lawsuit be dismissed. The tribes have argued that state practices already make it difficult for Native American people to register to vote. They alleged that they have documented instances in which people tried to register their votes at state agency offices but were turned away.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A federal judge on Friday halted enforcement of a new state law requiring businesses to post special signs if they allow transgender people to use the bathroom of their choice. The first-of-its-kind law went into effect July 1 and would require such businesses to post signs on multiperson bathrooms that say: “This facility maintains a policy of allowing the use of restrooms by either biological sex, regardless of the designation on the restroom.” Businesses in Nashville and Chattanooga sued over the law, claiming that being forced to post those signs would violate their First Amendment rights by compelling them to communicate language they find offensive. The state of Tennessee argued in court that the signs are merely factual. In her Friday decision, U.S. District Judge Aleta Trauger handed a victory to the businesses that sued, granting a preliminary injunction that effectively prevents the state from enforcing the law while the case works through the courts. She noted that the U.S. Supreme Court has found that compelling individuals to “mouth support for views they find objectionable” violates a cardinal constitutional command unless justified by “the strongest of rationales.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A Houston man who received widespread attention after standing six hours in line to cast a ballot in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary was in jail Friday on charges that it was illegal for him to vote at all because he was on parole. Hervis Rogers became an overnight face of Texas’ battle over voting access when he emerged from a polling center at a historically Black college around 1:30 a.m. He was among Houston voters on Super Tuesday who waited more than an hour – some for several hours – in mostly minority, Democratic neighborhoods. Lines in mostly white, Republican neighborhoods were shorter. “The way it was set up, it was like it was set up for me to walk away,” Rogers told reporters. He was arrested this week on two counts of illegal voting, a second-degree felony that carries a possible sentence of two to 20 years in prison. His bail was set at $100,000. Rogers, 62, voted last March while still on parole from a felony burglary conviction, making him ineligible to cast a ballot under Texas law. Andre Segura, an attorney for the ACLU of Texas who is representing Rogers, said his client did not know he was ineligible to vote. “We shouldn’t be prosecuting people for innocent mistakes,” Segura said. The rare arrest on illegal voting allegations comes as Texas Republicans begin a second attempt at passing many of the same restrictive voting measures blocked by Democrats during a dramatic late-night walkout in May.\n\nUtah\n\nMilford: Just outside this town of about 1,400 people in southwest Utah, researchers behind a major energy project are hoping to tap into a limitless supply of clean, reliable power. The energy exists thousands of feet below the surface, where the natural heat from the Earth’s core can be used to create electricity. Researchers at the Utah-based FORGE lab are working on technology to create geothermal reservoirs almost anywhere in the world, KUER reports. Geothermal power already exists but currently makes up just 0.4% of energy production in the U.S. So far it’s largely been limited to select areas around naturally occurring hot springs, such as the Roosevelt Hot Springs in Beaver County. FORGE lab researchers have recently completed one of two major wells they’ll use to develop the tools to build “enhanced geothermal systems” – human-made versions of natural geothermal reservoirs that pump water through cracks underground, heat it, and use the steam to power turbines or to heat buildings. If successful, the project and others like it could lead to “a 40-fold increase over present geothermal power generating capacity,” according to the U.S. Department of Energy. “The world is looking at Milford,” said Joseph Moore, a geologist and lead researcher at FORGE.\n\nVermont\n\nWinooski: The state is undergoing a pandemic-related liquor shortage, regulators say, leading to empty shelves in some stores and warehouses, WCAX-TV reports. “It is a global issue. A lot of it has been exacerbated by the pandemic. It’s not going to be a quick fix,” said Wendy Knight, deputy commissioner of the Vermont Department of Liquor and Lottery. It’s a global supply chain issue “from production gearing back up from the pandemic, worker shortages, shipping issues, and a glass shortage. That comes on top of demand from restaurants and bars reopening,” she said. The Burlington bar The Archives planned to open a second location in Winooski last year, but the pandemic kept it closed until Thursday. Now the arcade bar is facing another obstacle. “The liquor shortage has been a challenge,” the bar’s co-owner Matthew Walters said. Bars and restaurants are not the only ones feeling the tight supply. “There’s enough to at least have your second choice, if not your first,” George Bergin of the Beverage Warehouse in Winooski told the news station. “With all the bars and restaurants opening up everywhere, everyone is trying to restock their shelves, and it’s just taking a little bit of time to get caught up with the sudden demand.” Vermont saw a 13% increase in liquor sales amid the pandemic, Knight said.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: Cheers erupted Saturday as a Confederate statue that towered for nearly a century over downtown was carted away by truck from the city where it had become a flashpoint for racist protests and deadly violence. It was a day of palpable joy and immense relief for scores of residents and visitors who lined neighboring streets to watch the larger-than-life figure of Gen. Robert E. Lee as it was hoisted from its pedestal and taken – at least for now – to storage. The statue’s removal came more than five years after racial justice activists had renewed a push to take down the monument, an initiative that drew the attention of white supremacists and other racist groups, culminating in the violent “Unite the Right” rally in 2017. “I’m ecstatic that we’re here now. It’s sad that it’s taken so much to get us to this point. But this is an incredible day,” said Don Gathers, a local Black activist who long advocated for the statue’s removal. Work to remove Lee’s statue, as well as one of Confederate Gen. Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson shortly after, proceeded peacefully and without interruption. Also removed Saturday was a statue depicting Sacagawea and explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark that has been criticized for a depiction of the Native American guide and interpreter that some view as subservient and weak.\n\nWashington\n\nTacoma: A federal jury has convicted a timber thief who authorities said started a large forest fire in a case that prosecutors said marked the first time tree DNA had been introduced in a federal trial. The jury deliberated for about seven hours before convicting Justin Andrew Wilke, 39, on Thursday of conspiracy, theft of public property, depredation of public property, and trafficking and attempted trafficking in unlawfully harvested timber, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for Western Washington said in a news release. The wood he sold to a mill in the city of Tumwater had been harvested from private property with a valid permit, Wilke said. But a research geneticist for the U.S. Forest Service, Richard Cronn, testified that the wood he sold genetically matched the remains of three poached trees. Wilke used gasoline to destroy a wasp’s nest in the base of a maple tree he was stealing, prosecutors said, though jurors did not convict him of charges related to the fire. Some witnesses testified that, although Wilke was standing next to the nest when the fire began, they did not actually see his actions in the dark. Wilke and others conducted an illegal logging operation in the Elk Lake area of the Olympic National Forest, near Hood Canal, between April and August 2018, according to records filed in the case.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice called on Saturday for the resignation of a state lawmaker who posted a sexually explicit TikTok video to his public account. State Del. Joe Jeffries was stripped of a committee assignment Friday after word spread of the social media posting, according to a statement from House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, who called his fellow Republican an “embarrassment.” On Saturday, the GOP governor issued a statement calling Jeffries’ behavior “sad” and “childish.” “Not only did he yell graphic comments about me to a group of senators during the recent Legislative Session, but now we find that his not-so-secret TikTok is full of disgustingly vulgar videos, which are especially insulting to women,” Justice’s statement said. “This is the behavior of an immature child, not a 39-year-old father and elected official.” The governor said he had expected to hear an apology from Jeffries by Saturday morning, “but all he has done is hide from the media and the criticism.” Jeffries, whose district includes a group of counties near Charleston, posted the video Thursday. His account was set to private Friday. Belinda Biafore, chair of the West Virginia Democratic Party, said Jeffries “has a slew of inappropriate and vulgar videos with his own sexually explicit commentary on a social media app aimed at youth.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A bishop has taken the unusual step of removing a priest from the ministry after he made a series of divisive remarks about politics and the pandemic. The Diocese of La Crosse said in a statement Friday that Bishop William Patrick Callahan has issued a decree immediately removing the Rev. James Altman as pastor of St. James the Less, a parish in the city of La Crosse. The decree will remain in effect for an undetermined length of time, the statement said. “(The bishop) and his diocesan representatives have spent over a year, prayerfully and fraternally, working toward a resolution related to ongoing public and ecclesial concerns of the ministry of Fr. James Altman,” the statement said. “The obligation of a Bishop is to ensure that all who serve the faithful are able to do so while unifying and building the Body of Christ.” Diocese officials didn’t release the decree and didn’t immediately respond to a request for a copy. Altman told conservative news outlet LifeSiteNews.com that he’s not surprised the Catholic hierarchy is trying to silence him. “Unfortunately for the corrupt hierarchy, I will not be silenced by any arbitrary Decree, nor will I be cowed by any action against my priestly faculties,” he said.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: A rancher who was pinned by an all-terrain vehicle survived on beer and bottled water for two days. Frank Reynolds, 53, was trying to round up a cow and calf on a neighbor’s pasture outside Gillette when the vehicle tipped over on him July 4, Reynolds told the Gillette News Record. “It was scary as hell is what it was,” Reynolds said Wednesday from a hospital room. Family thought Reynolds had gone camping or was with friends, said Quentin Reynolds, the Campbell County undersheriff and Frank’s brother. Later Monday, they began to worry. Eventually, they learned Frank Reynolds had planned to do some work on the property, where he was laying with a dislocated shoulder and broken ribs. A search began. Reynolds, meanwhile, honked the ATV’s horn so much he wore down the battery – to no avail. He was able to ration a couple of bottles of water and Keystone Light beers from a cooler, Sheriff Scott Matheny said. Searching on horseback, neighbor Don Hamm found Reynolds about 8 a.m. Tuesday. By that point, Reynolds recalled he was “pretty much out of it.” “Everything on the left side pretty much hurt, from the top of my head to my toes,” he said. He was expected to remain in the hospital a few more days and eventually recover.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/09/02/drag-delivery-creative-hand-sanitizing-boating-dangers-news-around-states/113651842/", "title": "Drag delivery, creative hand sanitizing: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuscaloosa: City leaders in the home of the University of Alabama are considering $400,000 in aid to help bars that were forced to shut down because of the pandemic. Bar owners in Tuscaloosa say they are being hurt by a city order that forced them to close for two weeks after students returned to town and hundreds of new coronavirus infections were confirmed. The mandate came after large crowds gathered outside some nightspots waiting to get in. So officials are considering a package that would provide as much as $400,000 in small-business relief. WIAT-TV reports the city’s finance committee approved the plan Tuesday, and the City Council could vote on the measure Sept. 15. Mayor Walt Maddox proposed spending money from the city’s pandemic relief fund to help Tuscaloosa’s approximately 30 bars.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The largest school district in the state to open for in-person classes has shifted to online learning only for three schools after five new cases of COVID-19 were confirmed. The new infections emerged among three schools in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough School District, Alaska Public Media reports. Colony middle and high schools plan distance learning until next Tuesday, while the district said an update is pending on how long Pioneer Peak Elementary will be closed to in-person classes. The schools will be cleaned, and public health officials will notify any families with children who are considered close contacts of those who tested positive for COVID-19. Another school, Wasilla’s Machetanz Elementary, has resumed in-person learning after a student tested positive. District spokeswoman Jillian Morrissey said 36 people, including staff and students, were identified as close contacts in that case and are under quarantine.\n\nArizona\n\nFlagstaff: Northern Arizona University reopened for in-person classes Monday, welcoming students for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic closed the Flagstaff campus in March. The announcement came three weeks after the university began its academic year online, the Arizona Daily Sun reports. As of Monday, 29,594 students were enrolled in classes across all the NAU campuses, with more than 6,000 students living in university-owned residence halls. Some faculty members have continued to raise concerns about the return to campus as Coconino County health officials reported an additional 55 cases last week, increasing the total to 3,205 confirmed COVID-19 cases. The union that represents faculty, staff and graduate student employees released its own statement Sunday calling for university administrators to stop reopening plans and, instead, provide accurate COVID-19 case numbers.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state on Wednesday reported its largest single-day increase in deaths from the illness caused by the coronavirus, and the state’s top health official urged college students to avoid large parties while campus cases continue to rise. The Department of Health reported 27 new deaths from COVID-19. But the department said 13 of the deaths were late reports, one dating back to May. The state reported 615 new confirmed cases of the coronavirus and said an additional 156 people tested positive through antigen testing. Dr. Jose Romero said the state is continuing to see a rise in cases on its college campuses and urged students to follow social distancing guidelines to help prevent the virus’s spread. The University of Arkansas has reported 222 active cases at its Fayetteville campus. The number of people hospitalized due to COVID-19 rose by 12 to 435.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: These divas deliver. Drag queens don their colorful wigs, elaborate makeup and knee-high stiletto boots, but instead of stepping on a stage, they’re putting on a face covering, grabbing a takeout bag and bringing their musical numbers to fans’ doorsteps. The Oasis nightclub is offering “Meals on Heels,” dispatching drag queens to bring food, cocktails and socially distant lip-synching performances to people during the pandemic. On a recent evening, Kochina Rude delivered dinner to Kelsie Costa and her family in the city’s Marina District and then lip-synched the drag show classic “Finally” by CeCe Peniston. “There’s not a lot to do these days with shelter in place and COVID and all that,” Costa said. “So gotta spice it up somehow. It’s really fun.” Oasis owner D’Arcy Drollinger said it’s a way to reconnect with fans and bring a little joy to those who haven’t had much to smile about recently.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: Colorado College said Tuesday that it is moving to online classes for the rest of the fall semester after hundreds of students went into quarantine because at least 10 had tested positive for the coronavirus. All students at the private liberal arts college are being urged to leave the Colorado Springs campus by Sept. 20, The Gazette reports, citing an announcement by Mike Edmonds and Robert G. Moore, the school’s acting co-presidents. Students in some hybrid classes, international students and students in “dire need” can stay with school permission, Edmonds and Moore said. At the urging of El Paso County health authorities, Colorado College had placed more than 500 students in three dormitories under quarantine. County health officials have said about 800 students were living on campus as of Aug. 25. About half of enrolled students started the school year remotely.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Opposed to the idea of automatically extending Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont’s pandemic emergency powers for another five months, the top Republican legislative leaders on Tuesday urged him to at least grant a special committee of lawmakers the ability to appeal or reject any executive order within 72 hours after it has been issued. The powers are set to expire Sept. 9. Senate Minority Leader Len Fasano and House Minority Leader Themis Klarides said in a letter to Democratic legislative leaders, who control the General Assembly, that if Lamont is going to extend the public health emergency declaration, “we also need to give the power back to the people and create a better process that brings the voices of the public into a process that they have been completely shut out of.”\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The state will allow some beach bars to reopen for the Labor Day weekend, but they will be under strict social distancing guidelines. Seats must be socially distanced, and reservations will required. Food also must be ordered. Gov. John Carney had shut down bars in Delaware beach towns in early July after the state saw a spike in COVID-19 cases. The order had affected taprooms and bar service in Lewes, Rehoboth Beach, Dewey Beach, Long Neck, Bethany Beach, South Bethany, Fenwick Island, West Fenwick Island, Ocean View and Millville. Carney said the most important guideline that people can follow is wearing a mask. “This is going to be a big test,” Carney said. “If we can get over the Labor Day weekend successfully without a lot of COVID-19 spread, then we’re really going to be set up well as we try to get more children, more students back in schools for in-person learning.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Georgetown University reported four new COVID-19 cases within the school community Tuesday, according to WUSA-TV. The university said the new cases come as more people are getting tested. They said the cases are people who are on or near the campus. The university announced July 29 that only students who have already been approved through the school’s Housing Stability Application process and “who have been invited to return to campus because of academic requirements” are allowed to return to resident halls for housing, as well as those who are F-1 visa holders. A limited number of students who are resident assistants have been allowed in the halls to help watch over the group. Select other activities, like biomedical research, are still taking place on campus. First-year students are not on campus “based on current pandemic conditions,” school officials said in a statement.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: A cyberattack and a software glitch plagued the state’s largest school district during the first two days of its virtual start to the school year, officials said Tuesday. Miami-Dade County Public Schools Superintendent Alberto Carvalho said during a news conference that the district suffered a distributed denial of service attack Monday morning as a software glitch blocked access to the district’s servers, the Miami Herald reports. The glitch and DDoS attack rendered multiple online school district features useless and teaching nearly impossible. The FBI and Secret Service have been called in and have subpoenaed the school district’s internet provider, Carvalho said, but the glitch has been completely resolved and optimized. Whoever conducted the cyberattack did not hack in or penetrate district servers, officials said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Gov. Brian Kemp on Tuesday named a Department of Public Safety officer as the next director of the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency. In an announcement at the agency’s headquarters, Kemp tapped Capt. Chris Stallings to replace the retiring Homer Bryson, who has led the agency since 2016. Stallings, who became a state trooper in 2008, is currently the Department of Public Safety’s director of dignitary protection, which means he oversees the protection of Kemp, among others. He’s a native of McCaysville. Stallings takes over while the agency is responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and in the middle of hurricane season. Kemp said Mike Smith, currently deputy director of the Georgia Emergency Communications Authority, an agency attached to GEMA, will be Stallings’ chief of staff. Smith is a former police officer in Covington and Newton County.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Health care officials have issued an urgent call for nurses to assist the state’s response to the coronavirus pandemic as hospitals experience an influx of patients. Officials in the private, public and nonprofit health care sectors are collaborating to bring more nurses to Hawaii to address the increasing caseload resulting from the virus outbreak, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Hospitals trying to deal with the spread of the virus are already short-staffed, said Daniel Ross, president of the Hawaii Nurses Association OPEIU Local 50, which represents about 4,000 members. Hawaii’s daily new coronavirus case counts have remained in the triple digits for nearly a month. “It’s only going to get worse as time goes on,” Ross said. Democratic Gov. David Ige issued an emergency proclamation waiving licensing requirements to enable recent graduates to provide support assistance such as screening and administrative work.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state will start making $300-a-week unemployment payments this week under President Donald Trump’s supplemental plan, Gov. Brad Little said Tuesday. The retroactive payments will cover five weeks beginning in late July and ending Aug. 29. That means those eligible could receive several weeks of payments at once. The Republican governor said he’s also looking to tap $15 million in federal coronavirus relief money to make sure the supplemental program applies to those currently receiving less than $100 per week in state unemployment benefits who would otherwise be left out of the $300 federal supplement. The state’s minimum weekly unemployment benefit amount is $72, and the maximum benefit amount is $448. The governor’s Coronavirus Financial Advisory Committee is meeting Thursday to consider approving $15 million to make sure the $300 federal supplement goes out to more people.\n\nIllinois\n\nEast St. Louis: Additional COVID-19 mitigation efforts will be implemented in the Metro East area of Illinois as the area shows a seven-day positivity rate of 9.6% as a result of coronavirus testing, Gov. J.B. Pritzker and the Illinois Department of Public Health announced Tuesday. The action comes as officials reported 1,492 new confirmed cases of coronavirus in Illinois, with 39 additional confirmed deaths. It is the highest number of single-day deaths related to COVID-19 since June 26. Officials report 8,064 deaths since the start of the pandemic. Health Department officials say beginning Wednesday, bars in the area east of St. Louis can no longer offer indoor service, no indoor dining or bar service can be offered by restaurants, and meetings, social events and other gatherings are limited to lesser of 25 guests or 25% of overall room capacity. Indoor visitation in long-term care settings and off-site outings continue to be prohibited.\n\nIndiana\n\nBunker Hill: National Guard units are helping operate a prison faced with staffing shortages after several workers were stricken with COVID-19. Soldiers from the Indiana Army National Guard began working at the Miami Correctional Facility the second week of August, said prison spokesman James Frye. The Guard members are working in control pods inside the prison and do not have contact with any inmates, he said. The prison has had five staff members test positive for COVID-19, with three having recovered, according to data provided by the state. Frye said it’s unknown how long National Guard units will be stationed at the prison in Bunker Hill, about 60 miles southwest of Fort Wayne. The state agency said units from Indiana’s Army and Air national guards have been deployed to state prisons since May because of the coronavirus outbreak, the Kokomo Tribune reports. They’re also at the Pendleton prison and the Westville prison.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A longtime special education teacher with Des Moines Public Schools has died of complications from the coronavirus, the district confirmed late Tuesday. District spokesman Phil Roeder said the teacher at the Ruby Van Meter School for intellectually disabled students fell ill after an out-of-state trip and died this week. He did not release the teacher’s name or other details for privacy reasons. The death is believed to be among the first of an Iowa educator during the pandemic. A 73-year-old gym teacher at Iowa City Regina High School died in April. Des Moines schools shut down in March and are planning to begin the school year next week with virtual learning. Gov. Kim Reynolds is pushing for the district to open schools for 50% in-person instruction. District leaders say that cannot be safely done given the spread of the virus and have filed a lawsuit challenging the governor’s mandate. A hearing is scheduled for Friday.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: University of Kansas athletes must play without fans, Kansas State University is battling four new coronavirus outbreaks, and a Topeka-area school district has halted in-person classes just days into the fall semester. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment has reported 19 coronavirus clusters tied to colleges and five related to K-12 schools since the start of the academic year. The University of Kansas’ Monday announcement that athletes must play without fans at least through the end of September came after compulsory testing of students arriving on campus uncovered 474 positive cases. Infections were particularly prevalent among sorority and fraternity members, with a 10% positivity rate. The four newest outbreaks in the Manhattan area included a cluster of 10 positive cases among the Kansas State football team, health officials said Monday.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state has again extended its contract with an outside company hired to help work through a backlog of unemployment claims amid the coronavirus outbreak, Gov. Andy Beshear said Tuesday. The contract with Ernst & Young will be prolonged through the end of 2020, the governor announced. The company has helped the state process more than 141,000 claims since the partnership began nine weeks ago, he said. The governor also announced more than 800 new confirmed coronavirus cases statewide and 15 more virus-related deaths. Kentucky is coming off its highest number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases in a single week, with more than 4,500 reported last week. The latest extension of the contract with Ernst & Young will cost about $4.9 million, said Amy Cubbage, the state’s deputy labor secretary. The original contract and first extension cost nearly $12 million combined, she said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state is looking for people to work polling locations for the fall elections. Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin’s office announced the launch of a recruitment campaign for election workers to help set up the polling locations, welcome voters and verify voter registrations. The state pays up to $200 for Election Day workers and $100 per day for early voting poll commissioners, according to Ardoin’s office. Louisiana has had concerns about poll worker shortages for years. But those concerns have heightened with the coronavirus outbreak, as many election commissioners are older and at greater risk to the COVID-19 illness caused by the virus. The state hasn’t settled on a plan for operating its Nov. 3 and Dec. 5 elections in the pandemic because Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards and the majority-GOP Legislature disagree on how much to loosen the rules for absentee-by-mail balloting.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A letter from state officials to the Maine Principals’ Association is dimming hopes for a quick resolution to fall high school sports. Health and Human Services Commissioner Jeanne Lambrew and Education Commissioner Pender Makin urged the organization to delay the season until safety guidelines can be reviewed further. In the letter, first reported by the Morning Sentinel, they said their concerns go beyond the students participating in sports to the communities. “If the schools had the resources like professional and some collegiate sports leagues to conduct frequent team testing and house teams separately to protect other students, school staff, and their families, it might be possible to return to interscholastic competition safely. Without that, such a return poses a risk of spreading COVID-19 across the state, within schools, and to vulnerable people within communities,” the letter stated.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: All businesses in the state will be able to open later this week as Maryland enters the third phase of its coronavirus recovery plan, Gov. Larry Hogan announced Tuesday. Movie theaters and performing arts centers will be able to open at 50% capacity beginning at 5 p.m. Friday. Up to 100 people will be allowed at indoor venues, or 250 people at outdoor venues. All retail stores as well as churches and houses of worship will be able to increase capacity from 50% to 75%. Local jurisdictions will still be able to decide not to open as much as the state plan allows. “I want to remind the people of Maryland that moving into Stage 3 does not mean that this crisis is behind us and remind them that we must remain vigilant so that we can keep Maryland open for business,” Hogan said at a news conference. He said the state has continued to see declining numbers in key metrics. The statewide positivity rate is down to 3.39%, Hogan said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A statewide coalition of teachers, school nurses, parents and other school employees has released a list of issues it says need to be addressed before schools can safely reopen during the coronavirus pandemic. The recently formed Coalition to Safely Reopen Schools in a statement this week called for a phased approach to reopening, with no in-person learning unless and until those issues are resolved. Some of the measures the group seeks include appropriate social distancing guidelines, effective ventilation and air circulation in all schools, safe cleaning practices, accessible and rapid COVID-19 testing, and clear guidelines for contact tracing. “Ours is a frontline perspective from those who will be ultimately responsible for the health, safety and the quality of education students will receive as a result of these decisions,” the coalition said in its statement.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state should modify a system in which nursing home residents infected with the coronavirus can be treated and isolated in those facilities and take steps to improve life for all long-term care residents amid the pandemic, a task force urged Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in a report released Tuesday. The 20-member group was created by the governor to prepare for a potential second surge of COVID-19 after deaths and cases spiked in the spring. Nursing home residents account for 2,088, or 31%, of the state’s 6,767 confirmed or probable deaths related to the virus. Of the 28 recommendations, nearly half involve ways to better the quality of life inside 442 homes that have had to stop communal dining and restrict visits and other activities. To reduce the effects of isolation, the panel urged allowing outdoor and window visits, limited communal dining and optional “pod”-like arrangements in which residents could spend time together in small groups.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A Ramsey County judge has dismissed a lawsuit challenging Gov. Tim Walz’s executive orders during the coronavirus pandemic. Thirteen Republican legislators and a group of businesses contended the Democratic governor abused his power and interfered with the legislative process when he closed schools, issued a mask mandate and limited businesses’ operations. District Court Judge Thomas Gilligan upheld the governor’s actions Tuesday, the Star Tribune reports. “The Governor has acted pursuant to the authority delegated to him by the Legislature,” Gilligan wrote. “The COVID-19 pandemic constitutes an act of nature that provides the Governor with the basis to declare a peacetime state of emergency in Minnesota.” A group called Free Minnesota Small Business Coalition had argued that the governor is usurping the powers of the Legislature and that COVID-19 is not an “act of nature” meriting a peacetime emergency.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Federal monitors, in their most recent report about the Hinds County Detention Center, said both the information about the extent of COVID-19 infection at the facility and efforts to control its spread are inadequate. The report, released last month, was based on discussions from June with jail officials. Although Hinds County Sheriff Lee Vance had indicated there were mask mandates for all inmates and staff, monitors said in the report that there were times when inmates reportedly were not wearing masks. The report said medical and mental health staff reported some inmates showed up for a medication pass without a mask, and there were inmates escorted to medical or mental health visits without a mask. Sheriff Department Attorney Claire Barker said Tuesday that the monitors’ report has no merit and said the office asked that it be removed because it doesn’t have anything to do with the consent decree dealing with the jail.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: The state has paid a consulting firm more than $500,000 in emergency federal funding for pandemic-related costs, despite Gov. Mike Parson saying in early May that an independent foundation was paying the firm. State payroll records show the McChrystal Group has received $522,000 in federal CARES Act funding from the state, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. The Virginia-based company was founded by retired four-star Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal. In early May, Parson said the Missouri Foundation for Health would pay up to $600,000 to the firm. He did not mention that the state would take over the payments May 31, using the emergency federal aid. Under a no-bid contract with the state, the McChrystal Group will be eligible to continue being paid nearly $250,000 a month for its work, Parson spokeswoman Kelli Jones said.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: The state’s most populous county has seen a sharp increase in violent crime since the pandemic began, driven by more domestic abuse and drug-related crimes, authorities say. Yellowstone County saw a 20% spike in violent crimes from March through July, U.S. Attorney Kurt Alme said, and that appears to be a statewide trend. Before the pandemic hit, authorities had been hopeful of turning the tide on a years­long surge in crimes as meth became more widely available. Some offenses finally were beginning to plateau before the coronavirus triggered an economic and social lockdown. Prices for meth have doubled since COVID-19 arrived, with supply chains disrupted by tighter controls along the U.S. border with Mexico and fewer chemicals coming in from China, Alme said. And demand has risen, with Montana seeing a 34% higher rate of positive drug tests for methamphetamine compared to before the pandemic, according to a recent study from Millennium Health.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The city’s residents will have to continue wearing masks in public at least into October because of the coronavirus pandemic. Omaha’s City Council voted Tuesday to extend its mask requirement that was set to expire later this month through Oct. 20. Everyone in the state’s largest city is required to wear face coverings in most indoor public spaces where they are not able to maintain 6 feet of social distance. Douglas County Health Director Adi Pour said wearing masks is important now that most businesses and restaurants in the city have reopened. “Either we close down businesses again, or we wear masks,” Pour said. Councilman Pete Festersen, who sponsored the extension, said requiring masks is a practical way to control the spread of the virus. Several local school officials sent the council letters supporting the mask requirement.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Tens of thousands of working or furloughed employees at the two largest Las Vegas casino companies will keep family health benefits until March 1 under an agreement involving unions representing bartenders and culinary workers, officials said. The pact, announced Monday, affects about 36,000 union workers at 22 Las Vegas Strip properties, the unions said. It came the same day casino giant MGM Resorts International laid off about 18,000 employees at locations around the U.S. and followed months of negotiations over worker safety and job protections begun when casinos were closed in mid-March because of the coronavirus pandemic. Culinary Union executive Geoconda Argüello-Kline said the agreements with MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment Inc. mean workers can keep health benefits until next year even if they are currently idled and will retain seniority benefits when they return to their jobs.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: President Donald Trump’s reelection campaign and the Republican National Committee want to intervene in a lawsuit by the American Federation of Teachers challenging New Hampshire’s voting procedures during the coronavirus pandemic. New Hampshire Public Radio reports the union sued to force the state to extend its deadline for accepting absentee ballots by mail; to cover absentee ballot postage costs; to allow wider use of absentee ballot drop boxes; and to permit third-party groups to return absentee ballots on voters’ behalf. Similar lawsuits have been filed in other states. The lawsuit is focused on the November election. The AFT says the changes are necessary to ensure as many people as possible can safely participate. State officials say changing the rules now would only create more problems.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nBrick: Tape measures will join tapas as social distancing becomes essential to the ambiance at New Jersey restaurants preparing for the limited resumption of indoor dining. Gov. Phil Murphy gave the go-ahead Monday for indoor dining not to exceed 25% of capacity. It has touched off a mad scramble to dig wine bottles of out storage, try to hire new servers in a week when many young people have already gone back to school, measure 6 feet between tables, and figure out how many tables can be used without running afoul of state guidelines. It also poses a more fundamental dilemma: trying to guess how much food and staffing will be needed when no one knows for sure what demand will be. The state is beating its big-city neighbors to reopening indoor dining. Philadelphia is planning a return to indoor dining Sept. 8, also with restrictions like New Jersey. New York City hasn’t reopened indoor dining yet.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The Santa Fe area emerged as a major beneficiary of federal relief funds for local government, as the state assigned nearly $100 million to communities to offset spending on the pandemic response. The city was awarded $17.6 million in possible reimbursements, and Santa Fe County can receive up to $10.5 million – accounting together for 28% of direct grant awards announced Tuesday. McKinley County, which has the state’s highest tally of COVID-19 infections per capita, received an outsized direct grant award of $16.1 million. “Every applicant received funding. No one gets left behind,” New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said in a news release that listed 83 recipients. New Mexico’s largest city and county – Albuquerque and surrounding Bernalillo County – previously received direct relief funds from the federal government and were not included.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Gyms in the city were permitted to start reopening Wednesday with a slew of virus-related restrictions, the latest step New York City is taking in a phased reopening after being the U.S. epicenter of the pandemic earlier this year. Gym members will need to wear a mask at all times and stay 6 feet apart, and gyms can only operate at one-third capacity. Group fitness classes are still not permitted. Gyms in other parts of the state were allowed to open at restricted capacity starting Aug. 24, but New York City officials delayed the reopening until Sept. 2 so that the health department could conduct safety inspections by video. Gov. Andrew Cuomo closed gyms statewide in March. City parks have been full of outdoor exercisers during the lockdown, and some gym owners have brought weight machines and exercise bikes out onto sidewalks for al fresco workouts.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: At least 3,000 college students in the state have tested positive for the coronavirus since campuses reopened last month for in-person classes, with an overwhelming number of cases coming from just three campuses, an Associated Press analysis shows. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill has seen 895 students test positive for the virus since classes began Aug. 10, while North Carolina State University has reported 788 cases among students over the same time period. East Carolina University, which started classes Aug. 10, has had 756 students test positive since Aug. 9. The 13 remaining public colleges within the University of North Carolina System and the group of 36 independent universities in the state have reported about 550 cases, combined.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state’s longest-serving Supreme Court justice is back in the hospital after he was released to another facility for rehabilitation following treatment for the coronavirus. Justice Gerald VandeWalle, 87, who was released from Sanford Health Bismarck’s COVID-19 unit over a week ago, was readmitted this week following a chest X-ray, the Bismarck Tribune reports. “There was a little clot in my lung, and I think that was troublesome to them, and I’m short of breath, and that’s it, but that’s a lot,” VandeWalle said by phone Friday from his room. VandeWalle said earlier that he isn’t sure how he contracted COVID-19. He had been working from the state Capitol amid the pandemic and has worn a mask and gloves while shopping. VandeWalle, who has been on the court for 42 years, served as chief justice from 1993 through 2019.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The 2020 Cincinnati Pride parade and festival has been canceled. The annual festivities had been rescheduled for Oct. 3 amid growing concerns surrounding COVID-19. Cincinnati Pride announced Wednesday that, “given the constant threat of COVID-19, it is not in the best interest of the community in which we serve to have such a large event that places tens of thousands of attendees at such high risk for spreading this potentially deadly virus.” The event usually takes place in June during Pride Month. Plans for the 2021 Cincinnati Pride Festival will begin in a few months, and the celebration is scheduled for June 26, 2021. “Pride is more than just a festival or a parade,” the group said in a statement. “It is more than just one day per year. Pride is a constant state of mind, one that we should all be able to embrace every day.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A mask mandate in the city is being extended by six weeks in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The City Council on Tuesday extended the requirement that those 11 years old and up wear masks while indoors in public places from Sept. 8 until Oct. 20. Among the exempt are those who work in offices with no face-to-face interactions, diners while eating and drinking, those engaged in sports or cardio exercise, and those who are deaf or hard-of-hearing. Oklahoma City had a reported 11,222 total virus cases as of Tuesday, the highest among cities in the state, according to the Oklahoma State Department of Health. A mask ordinance in Tulsa, which had the second-most reported cases at 9,124, is to expire Nov. 30. Gov. Kevin Stitt said Tuesday that he will not issue a statewide mask mandate.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state has recorded 22 deaths involving boats this year, the most since 1993 and nearing the record of 25. August was a particularly bad month, with eight fatal accidents; the most recent came last weekend when a man charged with boating under the influence slammed into a 13-year-old swimmer at Henry Hagg Lake. The numbers include both motorized and non-motorized boats, such as kayaks, but don’t include fatal accidents using inner tubes or swimming, though both are also higher than normal this summer, said Randy Henry, boating safety program manager for the Oregon State Marine Board. The spike is another result of the record number of people outdoors in a summer when COVID-19 has limited most other options. It has also meant more first-time boaters, Henry said, and a lot of inexperience on the water. “It’s partly the law of large numbers,” Henry said. “Lots of participation this year, which also means lots of novices.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf announced Tuesday that he has renewed a 90-day disaster declaration, now for a second time, after he originally signed it in early March following the confirmation of the first positive cases of the coronavirus in Pennsylvania. The original declaration was set to expire Tuesday, and the new declaration will last through late November, unless Wolf decides to end it. Under state law, an emergency disaster declaration gives governors the authority to issue or rescind executive orders and regulations, access stockpiles of emergency supplies and equipment, and suspend laws or regulations that govern state agencies. Executive orders have the force of law, under emergency disaster law. As part of it, the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency has been able to assign missions to the National Guard, and it could in the future allow PEMA to rapidly deploy a vaccine, Wolf’s office said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state is setting up a rigorous coronavirus testing system for schools to quickly identify and stamp out possible outbreaks, Gov. Gina Raimondo said Tuesday. The dedicated testing system is for teachers, staff and students at both public and private schools, the Democratic governor said at a news conference, a day after announcing that most public school districts in the state had been cleared for in-person learning starting Sept. 14. The school testing system will be able to run 5,000 tests per day, on top of the state’s existing testing capacity. If a student or school staffer feels sick with coronavirus symptoms – either at home or in school – they can schedule a test through a hotline that has not yet been set up. People who fall ill while in school will be required to go to a dedicated isolation area that every school is required to have until they get taken home, Raimondo said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: After nearly six months of isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic, people can visit relatives and friends in nursing homes and residential care facilities, but there will be no hugs and kisses, and they will have to meet outside. Gov. Henry McMaster announced new guidelines for visitation Tuesday that require guests to give full contact information and pass a temperature check. The rules also require no COVID-19 cases in staff or residents in the past two weeks. “As expected, the months of separation and isolation have caused loneliness, depression, stress, anxiety among the residents. I worry about them, like you do, every day,” said McMaster, adding he has read dozens of letters and had hundreds of conversations with heartbroken families. Visitation was halted almost immediately after the first COVID-19 cases showed up in the state in mid-March.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A Minnesota man who attended the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in South Dakota last month has died from COVID-19, health officials reported Wednesday. The death is the first reported from the biker rally that drew hundreds of thousands of people. Infections linked to the event have been reported from coast to coast. The rally went forward despite fears it could become a superspreader event, with Gov. Kristi Noem welcoming bikers and the tourist dollars they spend. Rallygoers crowded into bars and rock shows, mostly ignoring social distancing recommendations. Few wore masks. For 10 days in August, the rally created a travel hub comparable to a major U.S. city, according to an analysis of anonymous cellphone data from Camber Systems, a firm that aggregates cellphone activity for health researchers. South Dakota has seen the bulk of cases tied to the rally, with the Department of Health reporting 105 tied to the event.\n\nTennessee\n\nChattanooga: Hamilton County is suing a business that it says isn’t complying with a mask mandate put into place due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Hamilton County Health Department filed suit against Ed’s Supply Company in Chattanooga alleging that employees and customers were not wearing masks or social distancing despite multiple warnings, the Chattanooga Times Free Press reports. The complaint asks a judge to order the business to close if it doesn’t comply with the mandate. The company’s lawyer, Sam Sanders, declined to comment to the newspaper. The lawsuit was filed Aug. 28 and says workers at the business voiced a belief that masks were ineffective and cited “their installation and use of UV ultraviolet light systems within their facility’s air conditioning system to assist with disinfection” against COVID-19.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: At least 4,116 newly confirmed coronavirus cases were reported Tuesday, an increase of 1,742 from the day prior, the Texas Department of State Health Services said. The state reported 59 fewer COVID-19 hospitalizations, however, with 4,144 for Tuesday. The new cases brought the total for the six-month outbreak to at least 617,333, with an estimated 89,791 cases now active. The 145 deaths reported Tuesday brought the Texas death toll for the outbreak to 12,681. Meanwhile, the rolling seven-day average rate of positive test results for the virus that that causes COVID-19 fell dramatically to 10.13% as of Monday, the most recent day available. The Sunday average was 11.96%, a sharp drop from 24.5% reported Aug. 11. The seven-day average of tests administered was 46,600 as of Monday, an increase from 40,300 as of Sunday but still down sharply from 63,900 as of Aug. 18, the Department of State Health Services reported.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Two schools have halted in-person classes and shifted to online learning because of coronavirus outbreaks during the first weeks of the school year. The American Preparatory Academy charter school closed its elementary campus in Draper on Tuesday after 15 students and staffers tested positive for COVID-19, executive director Carolyn Sharette told The Salt Lake Tribune. “We’re just pivoting,” Sharette said. “I assume this will happen at all schools eventually.” That followed Alpine School District’s announcement Monday that it was closing Pleasant Grove High School near Orem for two days. District spokeswoman Kimberly Bird declined to say how many infections occurred at that high school, the Tribune reports. She said that across the district, the largest in the state, 67 cases had been detected throughout its 91 schools, including 41 students and 26 faculty members.\n\nVermont\n\nBrattleboro: Hand-sanitizing stations with art and music are welcoming patrons into some local businesses and reminding people to take public health precautions during the pandemic. The Handy Stations are part of Open Artful Streets, an initiative of the Human Connection Project and Brattleboro Housing Opportunities. The Brattleboro Reformer reports the Downtown Brattleboro Alliance is also participating in the pilot project, which received seed money from the Arts Council of Windham County. The hope is that other communities will begin using them as well. The first prototype, made of plywood, went in front of The Void on Main Street in June. It featured a button on a skateboard that triggered a jingle lasting 20 seconds, or as long as someone should allow hand sanitizer to dry. Erin Maile O’Keefe, of the Brattleboro Rotary Club, said the hand sanitizer comes from Saxtons River Distillery of Brattleboro.\n\nVirginia\n\nHarrisonburg: James Madison University, in the Shenandoah Valley, will transition at least temporarily to primarily online instruction after experiencing a “rapid increase” in cases of COVID-19 among students, the school’s president announced Tuesday night. A letter from JMU President Jonathan Alger said in-person classes will shift online no later than Monday, by which time residential students will be asked to return home unless they seek an exemption to stay. University officials will notify the campus community by Sept. 25 about whether in-person instruction will resume on or after Oct. 5, according to the letter. JMU, a public university, has about 20,000 undergraduate students and has reported 513 active cases of COVID-19 on an online dashboard. “Decisions about refunds have not yet been made, but we will communicate with students and families as soon as possible on that topic,” Alger wrote in his letter.\n\nWashington\n\nPullman: The number of people testing positive for the coronavirus continues to grow rapidly in Whitman County, and various government agencies are working to slow the spread. A team from the Washington National Guard was headed to Pullman on Wednesday to set up a COVID-19 testing operation, county Director of Public Health Troy Henderson said. Meanwhile, police in Pullman continue to issue tickets to people gathering in violation of laws intended to curb spread of the virus. Henderson said a 25-member team from the National Guard was most recently helping with testing in Yakima. Washington State University spokesman Phil Weiler said the National Guard was hoping to set up its testing site in an area known as “apartment land,” where many WSU students live near campus. Adjusted for population size, Pullman has one of the nation’s fastest-growing outbreaks, according to a New York Times data dashboard.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Education leaders in two counties rejected an offer Monday by Gov. Jim Justice to resume fall sports competitions if athletic teams test negative for the coronavirus. Justice had suggested the compromise to Fayette, Logan and Kanawha counties, whose schools were allowed to hold team practices but cannot play games due to their status on a color-coded county map. Under the governor’s one-time plan, if a team’s athletes and coaches all test negative, they would be cleared to compete. It also applied to high school bands and cheerleading squads in the three counties. Justice made the announcement shortly after he arrived at the state Capitol as a group of parents and students protested outside, repeatedly shouting “let us play!” Justice, a longtime high school girls basketball coach, said he understands the desire and the commitment of teams to get back onto the field but has “to protect the public health across this state.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The city’s health commissioner has resigned as the city and county continue to battle the coronavirus pandemic. Jeanette Kowalik will join national policy, research and advocacy group Trust for America’s Health as director of policy development. “As much as I love my hometown, I believe that I am limited due to factors that are out of my control,” Kowalik said in a city Health Department news release, mentioning “access to testing, promotion of masks/face coverings, gathering limits, orders, messaging and outreach for communities of color, and various threats to Health Officers.” Under her leadership, Milwaukee declared racism a public health crisis in 2019, and the city and county were among the first in the nation to publicly report data on the race and ethnicity of COVID-19 patients. “We discovered that racism was playing out through the pandemic, which led to a shift in our strategy,” Kowalik said in the release.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Coronavirus infections from off-campus gatherings at the University of Wyoming have led the school to quarantine dozens of students. Seven students have confirmed cases of the coronavirus as a result of those gatherings, while 47 are being quarantined, officials said. If five or more students and employees test positive for the virus in a single day, the university will pause its phased return to in-person instruction, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Three positive tests were reported Tuesday, while four were reported Monday. The university began classes Aug. 24 exclusively online. Some on-campus learning started Monday. The school hopes to have full in-person instruction by Sept. 28. The students involved could face punishment from the university. Those who hosted or attended will be put on interim suspension. All involved students will be referred to the Dean of Students Office for investigation.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/09/02"}]}

It takes one hour for the outer shell of the nymph to split down the back and the winged adult to emerge. The adults live for up to six weeks, during which time they mate and lay eggs on the trees' twigs. After another six weeks, the newly hatched nymphs burrow below ground.\n\nTHE SOUND: The adult males sing to attract female mates, from about 10 a.m. to midafternoon. The buzz comes from the vibrating of shell-like drums on the sides of their abdomens, while their wings amplify the sound like a megaphone.\n\nNUMBERS: A tree can hold as many as 40,000 cicadas, and there can be as many as 1.5 million per acre.\n\nSource: Iowa State University Department of Entomology\n\nRobin Opsahl covers trending news for the Register.

Locusts are a type of grasshopper, while cicadas are a distinct insect type.\n\nLocusts swarm in large groups much like cicadas emerge all at once. But locusts are much more damaging than cicadas, eating substantial amounts of vegetation and causing significant damage for local farmers. Cicadas, on the other hand, won't destroy crops and only feed on juices from trees.\n\nMore:Brood X: Why 'trillions' of cicadas set to emerge after 17 years have an ominous sounding name\n\nMyth: Cicadas will harm you or your pets\n\nAlthough it may look a little \"Night of the Living Dead\" when the ground starts bubbling up with emerging cicadas, there's no reason to panic. Cicada emergences are a natural phenomenon that has taken place for tens of thousands of years. Cicadas have been around since the age of the dinosaurs.\n\nAnd they can't hurt you, said Elizabeth Barnes, exotic forest pest educator at Purdue University.\n\nPeople tend to worry that cicadas will bite, but they don't have the mouthparts to do that, she said. Instead, they have a long, straw-like tube that they use to suck fluids from trees.\n\n\"They can't bite you, even if they want to,\" she said.\n\nThey also won't hurt your pets if they eat them, she said. In fact, many wildlife species will get nice and plump this year from all the extra protein. Sometimes, Barnes said, turkeys are even larger in the falls after a cicada emergence.\n\nIf your dog or cat is throwing up or acting sick, it's probably because they ate too many of them. That said, it's always a good idea to take your pet to the vet if you're concerned, she said.\n\nMyth: Eating cicadas is gross\n\nAlthough the idea of eating an insect may make some squirm, cicadas are a great source of protein and perfectly tasty, said Marten Edwards, a biology professor at Muhlenberg College in Pennsylvania.\n\nFor a cicada snack at peak deliciousness, Edwards suggests cooking a fresh one right after it emerges from the ground. At this point, the cicada will be pure white and soft before it hardens its shell, and there's less chance it's been affected by insecticide or other toxins.\n\nMore:Bugged by cicadas? Try walking around in your own personalized mesh pod\n\nThat said, if you're allergic to shellfish, you might want to steer clear. Purdue University entomologist Cliff Sadof explained that because insects are arthropods like shrimp or lobsters, there's a chance eating cicadas won't be good for you.\n\nMyth: Cicada killer wasps are murder hornets\n\nA type of wasp called a cicada killer or a cicada hawk feasts on cicada emergences, so if you live near an area of high cicada concentration, there's a chance you'll see these buzzing around as well.\n\nWith their striking black and yellow stripes, people will confuse them with infamous \"murder hornets\" that were sighted in Washington last year, Sadof said.\n\nThey're not the same, and they're probably going to leave you alone, Barnes said.\n\n\"We're trying to make sure that people know the difference between the two and not worry too much about them,\" she said. \"It does hurt a lot if they sting you, but they're not aggressive ... these particular wasps, unless you directly threaten their nest, they should leave you alone.\"\n\nMyth: Insecticides will keep cicadas away\n\nSadof said a major goal for the cicada team at Purdue this spring is preventing people from panicking at the sight of cicadas and then spraying insecticide all over the place.\n\nMore:Brood X is on the way: Here's how to keep cicadas out of your home and yard\n\nThere are too many cicadas to make an impact with insecticide, he said. During large emergences, there may be as many as 1.5 million cicadas per acre. Even if you kill a few cicadas, more will just take their place.\n\nAnd remember, they'll only be around for a couple of weeks. Cicadas don't bite or sting, hurt your plants or your pets, so there's really no reason to try and kill them, Sadof points out.\n\nMyth: Cicadas will keep you up at night\n\nCicadas can be loud — really loud. Some songs can reach 90 decibels, roughly the same level as a lawnmower.\n\nBecause of this, people tend to assume they'll keep them up all night, Barnes said, but that's not the case. Cicadas tend to mainly sing in the afternoon. If you hear the sounds of cicadas at night, it's probably just because a cicada was startled by something or it's the sound of something else entirely, she said.\n\nMyth: Cicadas will hurt your plants\n\nPossibly related to locusts' reputation for crop destruction, there's a common fear that cicadas will eat flowers, landscaping or vegetables.\n\nThey won't hurt your plants, Barnes said. In fact, they might help them. When cicadas die, their decomposing bodies have a lot of nitrogen in them, which makes for excellent fertilizer.\n\nThat said, if you have a small tree in your yard you might want to wrap it with mesh before the cicadas arrive. When they lay their eggs, female cicadas use a tool on their abdomen to saw a groove into the small twigs or branches. The result may cause those twigs to die. Large trees won't be too affected, she said, but small trees might need a little protection.\n\nContact IndyStar reporter London Gibson at 317-419-1912 or lbgibson@gannett.com.

But they're killing each other.\n\nWhere will the Brood X cicadas emerge?\n\nEssentially, there are three major patches where you're likely to see the largest swarms of these cicadas, Kritsky said:\n\nThe southeast corner of Pennsylvania, almost all of Maryland, parts of Delaware and New Jersey, and a few areas in New York.\n\nOhio, almost the entire state of Indiana, a few areas in eastern Illinois, and northwest and eastern parts of Kentucky.\n\nWestern North Carolina, east Tennessee and a scattering around west Tennessee and the northern part of Georgia.\n\nOverall, this large emergence will affect the District of Columbia and at least parts of these 15 states: Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia.\n\nWhen are the cicadas coming?\n\nWhen soil temperatures hit 64 degrees a few inches below ground, the cicadas will start to emerge. That usually comes on the first or second day when temperatures reach the low 80s, Kritsky said.\n\n\"It's hard to make predictions other than just (looking at) long-term climate trends,\" Kritsky said. But generally, those temperature markers come earlier for Southern states. So northern Georgia could see the right conditions for Brood X emergence around the first part of May, while Cincinnati could reach that point near the middle of May.\n\nBut Kritsky said Brood X areas that see an unseasonably warm April could see the cicadas earlier than past years.\n\nBrood X is on the way:Here's how to keep cicadas out of your stuff\n\nCicadas + lawn maintenance:Here's how to keep up your yard care during the Brood X emergence\n\nHow loud can a swarm of cicadas get?\n\nWhile doing quadrant studies under a large oak tree, Kritsky estimated thousands of cicadas in the surrounding area. Standing a few feet away, he measured the insects' sounds at 96 decibels, slightly higher than a low-flying airplane, which can hit about 80 decibels.\n\n\"These individuals will crawl out every 17 years and they know they have only one purpose, and that is to mate and reproduce,\" said Jerome Grant, a University of Tennessee entomologist. \"So they're going to make a lot of noise to attract females to mate.\"\n\nCompetitive males are all about flexing their muscles. That's how they make their trademark catcalls, Grant told the Knoxville News Sentinel, part of the USA TODAY Network. Male cicadas have a special ribbed organ called a tymbal. When they flex their muscles, the ribs rub together and produce sound.\n\nDo people really eat cicadas?\n\nYes. There's evidence dating back to the 18th century showing people would eat the swarming insects, said Kritsky, who has tried them himself once. \"I don't make it a habit of eating them.\"\n\n\"They taste kind of like cold, canned asparagus to me,\" said Grant, adding that they're best when harvested right after they've molted. \"Then they're still soft. You can freeze them or cook with them. They make a good stir fry, and they're good in dumplings and in stews.\"\n\nIn 2004, the last time Brood X was swarming parts of the country, a group called the Cicadamaniacs at the University of Maryland released a cookbook filled with recipes for the bugs, including dishes like Soft-Shelled Cicadas, Cicada Dumplings and Cicada Stir-Fry.\n\nSave room for dessert: The cicada cookbook, \"Cicada-Licious,\" also includes recipes for chocolate chip cookies and rhubarb pie — each containing the special ingredient.\n\nCicada clean-up:5 tips for cleaning up the aftermath of Brood X\n\nContributing: Brittany Crocker, Knoxville News Sentinel", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/03/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2021/05/19/cicada-brood-x-coming-2021-what-that-means-for-louisville/5161757001/", "title": "Cicada Brood X are emerging in Louisville. Here's where to see them", "text": "The rise of the Brood X periodical cicadas — those loud, large, kind-of-scary-looking insects that come out every 17 years — has begun in Louisville.\n\nThe early birds have been spotted in the area. But as temperatures rise at the end of this week – raising the ground temperature – the insects will come out in force. Within a few days, there should be an almost deafening buzz.\n\n\"Usually what you get is a week or 10 days of buildup, and then a few weeks of, sort of, peak activity, maybe three weeks, four at the most, and then it starts to dwindle,\" said Paul Cappiello, the executive director of the Yew Dell Botanical Gardens in Crestwood.\n\nThe cicadas will begin migrating above ground when soil temperatures reach 64 or 65 degrees, he said. That happens with atmospheric temperatures reach the 80s or 90s, which is expected this week.\n\nThe ground temperature in Bardstown on Tuesday was 72 degrees, with a low of 68 at around 4 inches deep, according to Kyle Wilkins, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. He added that that temperature won't differ that much across the state, especially in Louisville.\n\nThe temperature at 20 inches deep is about 61, he said.\n\nBut having an air temperature increase and dry period over the next few days will definitely boost the soil temperatures, Wilkins said.\n\nHere's what else you should know:\n\nRelated:Will trillions of cicadas ruin my spring? Maybe. How to prepare for the Brood X invasion\n\nWhere can I find Brood X?\n\nYou can see reported sightings in the area on the Cicada Safari app, developed by Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati.\n\nAccording to the app, there have been heavy sightings of the bugs at Cherokee and Seneca Parks, the Strathmoor Manor neighborhood and near Brownsboro Road.\n\nThe U.S. Forest Service also has a map of cicada emergences.\n\nBrood X will emerge this spring in 15 states, as well as Washington, D.C.\n\nDelaware\n\nGeorgia\n\nIllinois\n\nIndiana\n\nKentucky\n\nMaryland\n\nMichigan\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNew York\n\nOhio\n\nPennsylvania\n\nTennessee\n\nVirginia\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nWhy are the cicadas emerging now?\n\nWe don't exactly know why the cicadas pick 17 years for their emergence cycle.\n\nFrom underground, periodical cicadas have some method of counting the number of times deciduous trees – the kind that lose their leaves in the winter – regrow their leaves, said John Cooley, an entomologist at the University of Connecticut.\n\n“The cicadas come out after the ‘right’ number,” he said. “Whatever the specific change is, the cicadas can detect that.”\n\nThe bugs will even, in unison, postpone their emergence for a day or two if the weather is rainy or otherwise uncooperative, he said.\n\nWhy are there so many?\n\nCicadas emerge in large numbers as a defense mechanism, Cappiello said.\n\nTheir predators include birds, snakes and other small mammals.\n\n\"Every animal has its evolutionary adaptation,\" Cappiello said. \"The cicadas — it's just sheer numbers. There just aren't enough birds or raccoons or snakes to eat a couple billion cicadas in six weeks.\"\n\nCan my dog eat cicadas?\n\nThe short answer is yes, but not too many.\n\nCicadas don't bite or sting, so the biggest issue for pets is overconsumption.\n\nGene Kritsky, a leading cicada expert and dean of Behavioral & Natural Sciences at Mount St. Joseph University, said it all depends on the pet.\n\n\"If the dog can't stop eating them, it could lead to bowel obstruction,\" Kristy said.\n\nThe exoskeleton of the cicada is undigestible, he said. Some pets might eat one or two and should be fine, but others may eat too many, which would lead to issues.\n\n\"In most cases, your dog will be fine after eating a few cicadas,\" American Kennel Club chief veterinary officer Dr. Jerry Klein said in an article for the organization. \"However, dogs that gorge on the large, crunchy insects will find the exoskeleton difficult to digest and can suffer serious consequences.\"\n\nHow long do cicadas last?\n\nThey'll likely be active through June, bumping into your windows and terrorizing anyone outside.\n\nExpect this brood to be noisy. That buzzing is a mating call.\n\n\"Adults climb the trees beneath which they developed or fly to new trees where males serenade females with cacophonous songs only appreciated by another cicada,\" Joe Boggs of Buckeye Yard and Garden Online said.\n\nFor subscribers:Do you have a right to work from home? Here's what legal experts say\n\nPeriodical cicadas can also damage trees and woody ornamental bushes.\n\nFemales slit twigs to insert batches of eggs after mating. Those twigs break at these weak spots and are left to dangle, turn brown and die, according to University of Kentucky officials.\n\nThis “pruning” can adversely affect the developing structure of small trees but is typically OK for large trees. Cappiello recommends covering smaller trees with bird netting to prevent the cicadas from accessing the branches.\n\nWhen will the cicadas die?\n\nIf the weather is consistently warm and dry, the cicadas will finish their mating activities sooner than later, which would mean a shorter season.\n\nTheir lifespan is four to six weeks, and they will start to die off in late June into July.\n\nThe nymphs, however, will be hibernating and maturing for the next 17 years. We'll see Brood X again in 2038.\n\nHowever, other broods in Kentucky will emerge before Brood X returns. We should expect to see the insects in different parts of the state in 2024, 2025, 2029, 2031 and 2033.\n\nMore:Caesars Southern Indiana casino’s next owner expects to retain 700 employees\n\nThe Cincinnati Enquirer and the Detroit Free Press contributed to this article.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/05/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/05/18/cicadas-showing-up-your-yard-if-so-heres-what-do/5143899001/", "title": "Cicadas arriving: What are they? Can they bite or sting? What to know.", "text": "After hanging out underground for 17 years, a new brood of periodical cicadas has officially popped up in people's backyards.\n\nThis year, a group of cicadas known as Brood X is expected to appear in the District of Columbia and at least parts of these 15 states: Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia.\n\nGene Kritsky, a periodical cicada expert and dean of Behavioral and Natural Sciences at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati, told USA TODAY cicadas would emerge when soil temperatures reached 64 degrees. Kritsky predicted they'd arrive in late-April or early May, which seems to be the case for some Americans.\n\nAlready people are posting photos and videos of cicada sightings in their backyards and homes. Dr. Beverly Howard photographed her twin granddaughters taking a closer look at a group of cicadas near her home in Burke, Virginia.\n\nAs this year's batch of cicadas start swarming parts of the country, USA TODAY is breaking down the latest updates and tips you need to know.\n\nWhat are they?\n\nThis group of periodical cicadas, called Brood X, have been feeding on sap from roots of plants underground for the last 17 years. After emerging, they will spend two to four weeks \"courting, mating, flying, driving people crazy, being eaten by everything\" said Michael Raupp, emeritus professor of entomology at the University of Maryland.\n\nThe cicadas will lay their eggs which will hatch 4 to 6 weeks later. Then their offspring will repeat the cycle and head back underground until 2038.\n\nWhile above ground for the next weeks, cicadas will be loud. Raupp said they can emit sounds between 80 and 100 decibels, equivalent to a low flying airplane or a lawnmower.\n\nWhat do we know about them?\n\nKritsky said when cicadas emerge from underground, they will appear white. Once they shed out of their old skin and develop an exoskeleton, their yellow and black color will appear.\n\nAs for the loud noises they make, males are the only ones who can create the noise. They do so when they're calling for other females to mate. The intensity of the noises should decrease within two weeks, Kritsky said.\n\nOnce the mating process is over and eggs are hatched, the cicadas die and their offspring will repeat the cycle. Female cicadas can hatch up to 500 eggs, Kritsky said.\n\nAlthough they don't swarm in packs like bees, Kritsky said cicadas do congregate in the hundreds around trees.\n\nWill you spot a cicada?:Cicada swarms are coming to a state near you. Here's what to know\n\nHow can we track them?\n\nFunded through Mount St. Joseph University, Kritsky created a crowdsourced app, Cicadas Safari, where people can send in photos of the cicadas they find. The app is free, and Kritsky said once someone downloads a photo, the app tracks the location to verify the latest cicada sightings.\n\nAre they dangerous?\n\nKritsky said cicadas don't sting or bite. If an animal or dog eats a few dozen cicadas, Kritsky said it will be okay. However, if they eat hundreds of cicadas in one sitting, the animal may experience bowel obstructions.\n\n\"They're just going to drink sap and mate. They won't eat your plants or carry away small children,\" Kritsky said.\n\nWhat should I do if they're in my yard?\n\n\"If you see a group of cicadas, you've got to just let cicadas be cicadas,\" Kritsky said.\n\nThe bugs don't have pads to pick up pesticides like cockroaches do, so bug sprays won't work, Kritsky said. He also mentioned cicadas won't affect anyone's gardens or plants because they don't chew on things.\n\nThey do drink sap from trees or stems. If you'd like to protect a small tree, Kritsky recommends wrapping it in a protective layer. If you're still looking to protect your garden and plants, you can create a physical barrier around them. If your plants or bushes are damaged, you can revive them with extra water and mulch.\n\nHow to protect your garden:4 easy ways to protect your garden from the cicada masses\n\nFollow Gabriela Miranda on Twitter: @itsgabbymiranda", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/05/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/05/26/brood-x-cicadas-here-2021-questions-answered-fun-facts/7437796002/", "title": "Brood X cicada expert Gene Kritsky takes questions, gives fun facts", "text": "Countless cicadas have begun to emerge from underground for the first time in 17 years, and they may pop up in a backyard near you.\n\nBrood X cicadas have been spotted in many parts of the country and are expected in at least 15 states: Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia, as well as the District of Columbia.\n\nSince these type of cicadas have not been seen since 2004, some might know little about them or have questions about their presence.\n\nGene Kritsky might be able to help with that.\n\nUSA TODAY hosted Kritsky, also known as \"the Indiana Jones of cicadas,\" for an \"Ask Me Anything\" (AMA) session on Reddit about Brood X.

Their damage costs the state $290 million in agricultural losses annually, according to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.\n\nThousands of non-native species have been brought to the state over the years either intentionally or by accident.\n\n\"Many of these species are benign while others, such as agricultural crops, are highly beneficial,\" the DEP stated on its website. \"However, a small percentage have caused severe damage to our environment and to our health.\"\n\nStory continues below gallery\n\nHere are five invasive species that have caused the most damage to the Garden State over the years:\n\nSpotted lanternfly\n\nThe spotted lanternfly, a colorful, Asian plant hopper, made its way to New Jersey in 2018 from Pennsylvania. It is known to feed on the bark, leaves and sap of more than 70 plant and tree species, including willows, maples, poplars, tulip poplars, birch and ash. Eight counties are currently under quarantine due to the lanternfly: Warren, Hunterdon, Mercer, Somerset, Burlington, Camden, Gloucester, and Salem.\n\n\"We currently have 13 crews of two who are out searching for and scraping egg masses and will be treating areas when the spotted lanternflies begin hatching in early May,\" a New Jersey Department of Agriculture spokesperson said in a statement sent to NorthJersey.com. \"We are enlisting the help of the state’s citizens to helps us eliminate this insect as much as possible, now through egg mass scrapings and later through treatments on their properties.\"\n\nThe lanternfly's feeding stresses plants and hurts their ability to heal and can kill the trees.\n\nThe bug was first discovered in the U.S. in 2014. It has since spread to New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, New York, Connecticut and Ohio. The NJDA is researching natural predators for the lanternfly to control its population.\n\nEmerald ash borer\n\nThis beetle has destroyed tens of millions of ash trees throughout the U.S. and Canada. It was first seen in New Jersey in Somerset County in May 2014. It has made its way to Bergen, Burlington, Camden, Essex, Gloucester, Hudson, Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Passaic, Somerset, Sussex and Warren counties since then.\n\nThe ash borer once caused Morris County to chop down 10,000 ash trees as a safety precaution. It's believed to have first come to New Jersey on wooden packing materials from China.\n\nNine percent of New Jersey's forested areas, mostly in the northwestern part of the state, were threatened by the emerald ash borer.\n\n\"The department has been releasing egg and larval biocontrol parasitoids against this insect in ash stands throughout the state since 2016 to help curb the spread of the emerald ash borer,\" the NJDA stated.\n\nEnvironment:NJ's unequal rules put some at greater risk of drinking lead. These families pay the price\n\nKhapra beetle\n\nThese beetles are native to India. They stow away in grain and seed.\n\n\"Previous U.S. detections of this tiny beetle have required massive, long-term and costly control and eradication efforts,\" the U.S. Department of Agriculture stated.\n\nThey do better in hot weather but are survivors, resistant to many pesticides and able to go a long time without food.\n\nThe khapra spoils much of stored grain and seed products where its found from its feeding, per the USDA.\n\nLonghorned tick\n\nThe first longhorned tick was found in New Jersey in 2017 but could have been in the state longer.\n\nNative to China, Korea and Japan, longhorned ticks are tiny and can infest a wide range of animals, from dogs and cats to livestock and wildlife. It is unknown how much of a threat it is to humans. One was found on a Bergen County girl in 2018.\n\nThe tick has been confirmed to be in Bergen, Camden, Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Passaic, Salem, Somerset, and Union counties in New Jersey. This tick is unique because it is asexual and does not need a mate to reproduce.\n\nGypsy moth\n\nThe gypsy moth is one of the oldest invaders, released into the United States in Massachusetts in 1868. It made its way to New Jersey a half-century later and has been feeding on tree leaves since. More than a million acres of trees have been damaged by gypsy moths since 2007, prompting the state to spray insecticides from planes on wide swaths of forest.\n\nNew Jersey started a suppression program for the moth in the 1970s. The NJDA recommended 170 acres in the state for gypsy moth treatment in 2021, down from 4,500 acres in 2018 and more than 100,000 in 2008.\n\nGypsy moths threaten oak, maple, birch, beech, willow, and hickory trees. The larger caterpillars also have been known to feed on pine, spruce, hemlock, and many common ornamentals, per the NJDA.\n\nJoshua Jongsma is a breaking news editor for NorthJersey.com.

However, school security was reduced from 10 cents to eight cents, and textbooks, technology and student organizations were combined into one category, tentatively called \"student services and support,\" and would receive eight cents.\n\nIf passed, it would raise $7.35 million for one of the fastest growing school districts in the state. Indian River's student population has grown by 22.4 percent over the last 10 years.\n\nIndian River Chief Financial Officer Jan Steele explained school safety was reduced and student services and support were increased due to the State of Delaware looking to cut $15 million in public education, which would in turn cause the Indian River School District to lose $900,000.\n\n\"One of the suggestions is to cut education sustainment funds from each district, which we use to pay local salaries,\" Steele said. \"We would then need to come up with local salary funds based on the state cuts.\"\n\nDespite the most recent Indian River School District referendum's failure to pass, referendums in Delaware have had recent success.\n\nBACKGROUND: Indian River board approves second referendum\n\nAfter failing to pass the first time, a referendum in the Brandywine School District passed on May 16 to raise funds for the operating budget as well as money for a capital funds project. The referendum was approved by voters 5,780 to 3,720.\n\nThe Appoquinimink School District recently passed two referendum measures to build a new school and to raise money for teacher recruitment and retention, technology and other expenses. The capital project referendum passed by a margin of 5,506 to 2,102 while the referendum for operational funding passed 5,152 to 2,496.\n\nEven with the recent success of referendums in Delaware, not all residents are happy to see another one on the table.\n\n\"I have a bad feeling about it,\" said Mark Warrington of Selbyville. \"I'm all for the kids but this would adversely affect those of us on a fixed income.\"\n\nBunting added she and the district will make more of an outreach to inform wary citizens.\n\nFor example, senior citizens can qualify for a tax break and not see any difference in taxes, she said.\n\n\"We have talked about going to senior citizen centers and having conversations there,\" Bunting said. \"If we can go and talk to people and answer their questions we can ensure they are not operating on misconceptions and we can get them to understand the situation and get them to be more empathetic.\"\n\nBunting said concerns have also been raised due to the audit report released by the Delaware Office of Auditor of Accounts just five days before the previous Indian River School District Referendum. The report detailed financial misdoings by the district and former Chief Financial Officer Patrick Miller.\n\nThe district has been working with the auditor's office, and Bunting hopes the office will give the district a letter of support.\n\n\"We are working with them to verify we are making changes,\" she said. \"And we want to be able to document those changes.\"\n\nThe district will cut costs even if the referendum does pass, Bunting said.\n\n\"I often liken our situation to your home situation,\" she said. \"If your budget gets tight or an unexpected expense arises, you start to look around and see what you can do without or wait another year to purchase. We are going to start to do that now.\"\n\nThe district will also be utilizing social media more than ever to help get the message out, Bunting added.\n\nFor Bunting, the referendum is ensuring students are properly served in the school district and there is no change in the operations of the district.\n\n\"I hope the public will see the need that our kids have,\" she said. \"We are up about 300 children from Sept. 30. We continue to grow and we need more of everything.\"\n\nrghughes@dmg.gannett.com\n\nOn Twitter @hughesg19", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/12/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2016/03/07/three-districts-put-up-referenda-month/81441210/", "title": "Christina School District takes third try at referendum", "text": "Saranac Hale Spencer\n\nThe News Journal\n\nChristina School District is trying for a third time to convince voters to allow it to raise taxes.\n\nTwo other districts, Brandywine and Cape Henlopen, are seeking increases through referendums this month.\n\nBut Christina is doing so after its last two tries were rejected by voters.\n\nIn the March 23 referendum, the district is asking for an increase of 30 cents per $100 of assessed value – about 20 percent less than what it asked for last spring. The district expects that, if voters approve, it will bring in over $16 million.\n\nThat money, school officials say, is sorely needed after the district slashed its budget by $9 million when the last referendum failed, said Brian Stephan, co-chair of the district's referendum steering committee.\n\n\"We're already running at bare-bones level,\" he said.\n\nChristina is hoping to replace some of the 78 teachers and 14 aides that were laid off in the budget cuts. Those layoffs led to larger class sizes, and the district is aiming to get back to its pre-2015 class sizes, said Wendy Lapham, spokeswoman for the district.\n\nIf voters reject the referendum for a third time, there's nothing left in the heftiest part of the budget to cut, Stephan said. The salaries and benefits of school workers take up 85 percent of revenues, and that section has already been shaved down. The district would have to cut after-school activities, after-school transportation and extracurricular activities, he said. The \"nuclear option\" would be closing down some school buildings.\n\nFollowing the defeat of the last referendum, Stephan said, the district took the temperature of voters to see what their hesitations were. In response, it lowered the proposed tax increase this time around, which it estimates to be about $192 per year for the average homeowner.\n\nChristina School District gears up for second tax vote\n\nIf it passes, Christina is planning to set aside $1 million to improve the general school environment – how exactly that will be done is still open for debate, and the district is having a public meeting on March 15 to discuss approaches. It will start at 7 p.m. at the Gauger-Cobbs Middle School on Gender Road in Ogletown.\n\nBrandywine hasn't pitched a referendum since 2012, and it is asking voters later this month to approve a 28-cent increase to school tax bills in order to finance the general operational needs of the district. Along with that, in a single vote, it is asking for voters to fund a capital project and a special project that would resurface several school athletic fields with synthetic turf.\n\nThe turf project would take three years to fund at 5 cents per $100 of assessed value, and the whole project, which would cover athletic fields at three schools, would cost about $5 million, said Superintendent Mark Holodick.\n\nThe capital project would cover work on three school buildings and the demolition of a school that has been empty since 2010. It would cost local property owners just over $19 million, but it wouldn't actually increase the taxes they've been paying because it would pick up where a large capital project, passed in 2005, left off. That was a $63 million project that renovated two schools, built three new ones, demolished one, relocated the district office and purchased a transportation facility, Holodick said.\n\nCape Henlopen is putting up a capital request to build two new elementary schools and renovate two old elementary schools, which is the last phase in a 20-year, long-term plan that the district committed itself to in 1999.\n\nIt asked for a 17-cent tax increase for the district's operating budget in 2014, said Superintendent Robert Fulton.\n\nCape Henlopen needs the new schools to accommodate growth, he said – it has gotten more than 1,000 new students since 2001.\n\nThe state is paying $72 million toward the project if local taxpayers will shoulder about $48.5 million.\n\nWith the growth that district has had, if it doesn't get new buildings, it would have to add modular classrooms, Fulton said.\n\nThat growth is \"a good problem to have,\" he said. \"We're just trying to plan ahead.\"\n\nContact Saranac Hale Spencer at (302) 324-2909, sspencer@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @SSpencerTNJ.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/03/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2023/12/05/state-approves-funding-requests-for-schools-red-clay-eyes-referendum/71754086007/", "title": "State approves funding requests for schools, Red Clay eyes ...", "text": "More holidays are on the way for many, but it's still business as usual in education throughout the state.\n\nMake Us Visible Delaware hopes to spur more support for Asian American history to infuse in K-12 education.

The department green-lit 50 certificate of necessity requests last month, while 44 involved state funding.\n\nSchool districts submit such requests every year, hoping for capital project or deferred maintenance assistance from the state. The state decides whether to approve, kicking in state funds that must come alongside a certain amount of local monies.\n\nFrom new Appoquinimink elementary, middle and high schools, to a new Charles W. Bush Early Education Center in Brandywine or renovations to over 20 Red Clay schools — which project funding districts hoped to secure can be explored online. Some expected totals are below, in state funds, concentrated in six districts:\n\nAppoquinimink: $223,177,971\n\nRed Clay Consolidated: $192,309,981\n\nColonial: $73,449,859\n\nBrandywine: $60,400,000\n\nChristina: $5,503,609\n\nPolytech: $2,953,097\n\nRed Clay must hold a referendum to meet local funding requirements, to pave the way to some $289 million in funding for its projects. If passed, Red Clay district residents would see a net increase of $0.50 per $100 of assessed value, over three years.\n\nIf it fails, Red Clay can try again a few months later. If the referendum fails again, state funds will be withdrawn. Community information meetings are expected, as the last ask like this was back in 2015.\n\nThe referendum is set for Feb. 28, 2024.\n\nKeeping pace:Appoquinimink, Brandywine ask for tax increases in coming referendum votes\n\nDelaware's HBCU continues to grow\n\nDelaware State University just released its fall enrollment figures by late November — continuing to break records at 132 years old.\n\nThe Dover institution now has 6,451 students, an increase of 3.5% over last year and 23% since 2020. That makes it one of the fastest-growing Historically Black Colleges and Universities in the country.\n\nAccording to Delaware State's press release, President Tony Allen is \"cautiously optimistic\" toward the growth.\n\n\"As we have seen impressive growth in our enrollment since 2017, we have also seen the national trend going in the other direction,\" he said in a statement. \"We continue to monitor the falling rates of college attendance nationwide and the steady declines in high school graduates due to lower birth rates in the U.S.\"\n\nDSU also saw growth in its graduate profile, up 7% to nearly 900 students; a 5% increase in new transfer students, up to just over 300 students; and a boost in online scholars at nearly 800 students. Nearly 80% of this fall's first-year in-state students are Inspire Scholarship holders.\n\n\"The race for talent is on,\" Allen writes. \"And we have to be prepared to meet our studentswhere they are.\"\n\nICYMI:Archmere lands $3 million donation, DSU Aviation signs new United deal: Education Roundup\n\nGot a story?

And it follows what might have been the death of the orchestra when a tax referendum failed before a second attempt passed.\n\nAbout 30 of the orchestra’s 70 members, from Brandywine, Concord and Mt. Pleasant high schools, have committed, but the cost of nearly $1,000 per student is a stumbling block for others.\n\nPisano said students have held fundraisers and “sold as much as we can.” They’re crowdfunding via CheddarUp.com and Concord Friends of Music. A send-off concert is planned March 28 at the Grand.\n\nFundraising chair James R. Hanby Sr. hopes “these students have an opportunity I never had.” He played the violin in elementary school and 30 years ago helped try to start a district strings program.\n\nIt’s not just the joy of performance. He told the story of Edna Turner Bradfield, who as leader of the Wilmington Orchestra House in decades past, said “music can help a pupil in algebra.”\n\nDonors so far, Pisano said, include the principals of all three high schools, the Brandywine Education Foundation, Richard Donner, Joseph and Judith Setting, New Castle County councilman Bob Weiner and state Sen. Cathy Cloutier.\n\nBesides the prestige of being selected for Carnegie Hall’s Symphonic Series, the students are also seeing the Statue of Liberty and “Aladdin,” with a bonus backstage tour.\n\n“The whole trip is about playing on that stage and being better at what we do,” Pisano said. “By performing together, we grow closer as a family. I’ve had some (students) since sixth grade and seen them grow.”\n\nAt first, students were pulled out of other classes for lessons, but that evolved into classes in each high school.\n\n“It’s been incredible to watch and share their personal experiences,” she said.\n\nWhen the strings program – violin, viola, bass and cello – was scheduled for fiscal elimination last year, Pisano planned a thematic program that included Dvorak’s “New World Symphony” and Haydn’s “Farewell Symphony.”\n\n“It was a very moving concert,” she said. “A nice way to say goodbye.”\n\nA second tax referendum passed, and the orchestral program survived, so the Carnegie Hall and Grand concerts include this symbolic trio: Chesnokov’s “Salvation Is Created,” “Jupiter, the Bringer of Jollity” from Holst’s “Planets” and highlights from “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.”\n\nFor the last piece, district STEM coordinator Judson Wagner led makerspace students into creating bows that resemble light sabers, via wiring, coding, 3D printing and laser cutting.\n\n“This is where music and technology converge,” the Brandywine Bow Project tweeted.\n\nTo make it all happen, Pisano said she did a lot of research about the companies that book performances at Carnegie Hall.

All three of those proposals – for a tax increase to support the regular operating budget, for funding to cover the cost of the building project and for money to install synthetic turf fields – were bundled together in a single vote that was rejected by a very slim margin in March. The district decided last month to present the same plan again, without the synthetic turf project.\n\nDistricts can go out for a referendum twice in a one-year span, according to Anthony Albence, director of the New Castle County Office of the Board of Elections. Last year, the Christina School District was in a situation similar to the one Brandywine is in now – its first bid for an increase in taxes to support its operating budget failed, so it went out for a second one. That one failed, too. But, this past March, Christina got its 21-percent tax increase passed.\n\nBrandywine has a $174 million budget for the next school year, but will have to slash $8 million if the referendum doesn't pass, according to Superintendent Mark Holodic\n\nRead more here.\n\nDel. sues massage parlors owner in prostitution sting\n\nDelaware prosecutors are suing the owner of four massage parlors who was caught in an undercover police investigation into prostitution in 2014.\n\nThe lawsuit filed Friday seeks $700,000 in civil penalties from Smyrna resident Da Zhong Wang, 52, for violating state racketeering laws.

John Carney and vow a fight in the General Assembly to stop them.\n\n\"At some point in time, we have to look at our future and stop robbing Peter to pay Paul,\" said Jeff Day, who is running for a spot on the Christina school board and has children in the Appoquinimink district.\n\nCarney has said he would rather not be making any cuts but said \"shared sacrifice\" is necessary in the face of the state's nearly $400 million budget deficit.\n\n\"These are extremely modest cuts in the scheme of things, and other cabinet agencies are being cut a lot more,\" Carney said. \"All we're asking is that our school boards do a little more to run a little more efficiently.\"\n\nSTORY: Standoff ends in Middletown; suspect in Delaware trooper death killed\n\nSTORY: Fear spreads through Middletown-area neighborhood\n\nThe cuts are only 1.5 percent of the state's $1.37 billion public school budget, the governor noted.\n\nAbout $15 million of the cuts will come straight from school districts' operational funds, money that generally isn't used to pay teachers but covers training, technology and other administrative costs.\n\nAn additional $22 million will come from something called the \"education sustainment fund,\" which is used for a much wider range of services like math and reading specialists, after-school programming and paying staff salaries over the summer, before tax receipts come in.\n\nCarney's plan would allow districts to make up the $22 million cut by giving school districts a one-time shot at raising property taxes – without asking their voters in a referendum. It would need the approval of the General Assembly.\n\nThat would leave only a $15 million cut spread over the entire system, the governor reasons.\n\nBut school board members say the decision to raise that so-called \"match tax\" would put them in the painful position of losing money or outraging taxpayers at a time when many school boards already are struggling to pass referendums.\n\nSchool board members also say the property tax increases would unfairly burden taxpayers in property-poor districts.\n\n“It’s foolish, I think, and a fool’s errand when the state is facing a big deficit like it is, to argue the state shouldn't cut education,\" Appoquinimink school board President Richard Forsten said. “Times are tough and everyone needs to tighten their belts … but if we’re going to do it, it needs to be fair.”\n\nA tight timeline\n\nThe General Assembly has until June 30 to debate the state budget, and school districts have only until July 13 to get tax warrants to their local counties, giving them little time to ponder a final decision on the match tax.\n\nThe dilemma for superintendents and principals is that state law mandates any teacher laid off must be notified no later than May 15.\n\nSTORY: Carney proposes tax hikes, spending cuts in state budget\n\nSTORY: Delaware's budget hole deepens by $35.6 million\n\nDistricts will need to plan for cuts they aren't even sure are coming. That means they might be sending pink slips to employees they might not need to fire.\n\nConversely, the cuts may deepen and they may have dip into their reserves or get rid of school programs.\n\nRep. Melanie George Smith, D-Bear and chair of the budget-writing Joint Finance Committee, acknowledges the timing is tough for districts. But she said it's too early in the General Assembly to give a final ruling.\n\nLawmakers still have to settle the thorny question of how much to cut and how much to raise revenue. Carney has proposed an equal balance of tax increases and spending cuts, but lawmakers don't have to follow that rule.\n\nWhile there's little appetite among lawmakers to balance the budget with nearly $400 million in tax increases — thus avoiding cuts entirely — they could lean a little heavier on taxes than Carney did. They could expand Carney's proposed increases to the income tax, corporate franchise tax and tobacco tax. Or they could impose other hikes, like expanding the lodging tax or adding to the alcohol tax.\n\nThat could mean the proposed cuts to education would vanish or diminish.\n\nThis revenue issue is perhaps the biggest question looming over the current General Assembly. And Smith said her committee won't know how to handle education cuts until that question is answered.\n\n\"We on JFC can't say what we're going to do until our 62 colleagues decide what kind of revenue we have to work with,\" Smith said.\n\nShe said it's also possible her committee will find other, less painful places to cut education spending.\n\n\"The question isn't how much we're cutting; the question is what we're cutting,\" she said. \"We can find places to cut spending that don't affect direct instruction.\"\n\nBut \"there really are no easy answers here,\" George cautioned.\n\nIf state government were to avoid education cuts, it would have to make deeply painful cuts elsewhere. Education makes up about one-third of the budget.\n\nThe only other part of government that is anywhere near that size is health and social services, on which the state spends about $1.1 billion.\n\nStory continues below graph.\n\nSchools have been taking up a greater share of the state budget each year because state officials are required by law to increase funding as the number of students in public schools grows. As a result, the number of education employees in Delaware has grown significantly even as the number of other government workers has declined.\n\nSTORY: Gov. John Carney: Fix budget, update Coastal Zone Act\n\nIn 2009, there were 16,877 school district employees — as of this February, that number had grown to 19,422. During the same period, the number of other state government employees shrank from 14,103 to 13,338.\n\nWhile Carney has insisted he does not intend for schools to cut staff, salaries are the biggest part of every district's budget. Which has several of them looking at layoffs.\n\nTo tax or not to tax?\n\nThe cuts are worse if school boards don't impose the referendum-less \"match tax.\"\n\nFor instance, Christina School District is estimating total losses of about $5.86 million — $3.9 million of which it could potentially recover via the match tax.\n\nThat means raising taxes 7.3 cents per $100 of assessed property value. For example, a home in Windy Hills, Newark, recently sold for $224,000 has an assessed property value of $63,700 and would face a potential annual property tax increase of $46.50, according to district records.\n\nIn comparison, Christina’s last referendum, held in 2016, raised taxes by 30 cents, an increase of about $191 per year on a similarly valued home.\n\nEven if the district ultimately decides to raise taxes without voter approval, it still would have to make about $2 million in cuts, according to Christina Financial Manager Bob Silber. Due to timing considerations, it's also making plans for the full $5.9 million.\n\nCausalities could include the district's Montessori Program, which has an enrollment of about 60 students and was recently re-committed to by the school board. Another option is to discontinue elementary instrumental music and elementary and secondary string music classes.\n\nThe cuts seem large, but for some school districts, reductions are compounded by the fact they already planned on making large ones next year.\n\nTake Indian River, which days before Carney released his budget had outlined $1.72 million in reductions.\n\nThough it recently passed a $7.35 million referendum, the district has been struggling financially and planned on reducing the amount of paid coaching staff for athletics and some salary reductions, including eliminating non-athletic extra pay for extra responsibilities.\n\nThe plan was to streamline programs, not eliminate them. But now, with Indian River facing a total of about $3.4 million in cuts, the scope of that original budget reduction plan could change. Passing the “match tax” would raise taxes about 12.5 cents per $100 of assessed property value, Superintendent Mark Steele told residents during a recent \"town hall\" held on Facebook Live.\n\nSTORY: Colonial takes another shot at referendum, warns of cuts\n\nSTORY: Indian River School District faces $3.4M in cuts\n\nFor Colonial, which is holding a referendum June 6, there's even more on the line.\n\nThe district's last referendum, in February, was voted down, which means the district was already considering cuts.\n\nShould the June referendum also be defeated, Colonial is preparing to implement over $4 million in reductions for the 2017-2018 school year, including 120 layoffs. The budget cuts add roughly another 50 layoffs, bring the total to 170.\n\nThose estimates are based on the total cuts the district could see in the budget — about $3 million — and does not include the match tax.\n\n\"The idea of the referendum is really to make us whole,\" Colonial Superintendent Dusty Blakey said. \"To keep us at our operating level currently.\"\n\nShared sacrifice\n\nOther school districts, like Appoquinimink, are approaching the education cuts a little differently. The district is considering reducing transportation costs, reducing its budget for substitute custodians and eliminating up to 17 teachers, among other things.\n\nForsten, the school board's president, seems to realize cuts, if not inevitable, are likely. He's trying to prepare for them.\n\nHe and the district's financial director, Charles Longfellow, are working to ensure that even if the district has to raise taxes, it's doing so in a way that's fair to local residents.\n\nBecause the way Carney has proposed doing it, that's not fair, Forsten said.\n\nHe said because the cuts aren't based on districts' property tax bases, some Delaware homeowners will have to pay only a little bit more in taxes each year, while homeowners in districts like Appoquinimink would shell out a pretty significant chunk of change.\n\nForsten used Brandywine, which like Appoquinimink is facing about $3 million in total cuts, as a comparison.\n\nIf Brandywine and Appoquinimink both had to cover the total $3 million, he said, the taxes in Appoquinimink would be higher.\n\nIn Brandywine, a home valued at $63,700 would face annual property tax increase of about $56. In Appoquinimink, where rates needed to be raised more because there's less taxable property, taxes will go up by about $95.\n\nForsten thinks the formula for calculating the cuts needs to be changed, so residents all pay roughly the same.\n\nAt a board workshop Wednesday night, not all agreed.\n\nChristina's Day says instead of suggesting changes to how the cuts are made, school boards throughout the state should be rallying against any cuts at all.\n\n\"Don't roll over, acquiesce and say, 'Yes, Dover, if you give us the authority to match tax, we'll use it,'\" Day said. \"Otherwise, they'll just keep doing this.\"\n\nHe also thinks resources given to school districts should be the same across the state, and that Appoquinimink should be fighting to eliminate the cuts altogether instead of looking out for its \"best interests\" and making sure it doesn't have to pay significantly more in taxes than Brandywine or Christina.\n\n\"I think we should be fighting so that all kids in the state are not hurt by this budget,\" Day said.\n\nContact Jessica Bies at (302) 324-2881 or jbies@delawareonline.com.

Contact him at malbright@delawareonline.com, (302) 324-2428 or on Twitter @TNJ_malbright.\n\nIn an utterly unsurprising turn of events, a task force that studied the possible consolidation of school districts is — drumroll please — not recommending a plan to consolidate school districts.\n\nThat's going to annoy many Delawareans.\n\nThe News Journal is constantly getting calls, letters and comments saying \"why don't we just consolidate school districts? How about they stop wasting my money before they ask me for more?\"\n\nI'm all for taxpayers viewing government spending skeptically. And it does seem a little out of whack for a state that's shorter than 100 miles long and has fewer than a million people to have 19 different districts.\n\nBut the cost savings from consolidating school districts would be much smaller than most people think. They certainly would not be worth the political slugfest it would take to make consolidation happen.\n\nThe main problem has to do with teacher salaries, which are by far the largest part of the education budget. Teacher pay varies between districts — for example, a Colonial School District teacher with four years or less earns an average of $41,235; the average Brandywine School District teacher with that experience earns $45,923.\n\nIf you merged those two districts into one, you'd have to equalize the pay. No superintendent or lawmaker's going to cut teacher salaries, so you'd have to raise pay for hundreds of teachers.\n\nWe're talking millions of dollars in raises.\n\nYou might ask: \"But what about all the excess administrators you'd get rid of?\" The fact is, there simply aren't that many administrators running around in Delaware school districts.\n\nThere are more than 9,506 teachers in Delaware, but there are barely 1,000 administrators. And that includes principals and assistant principals, who are a vital part of schools.\n\nAdministrators make up less than seven percent of education salaries.\n\nCould school officials streamline some administrative positions and save some money on the margins? Maybe, and they should always be looking for ways to do that. But you simply can't cut enough administration to defer a referendum or put a ton of new money into some other program.\n\nEliminating districts would also be messy and controversial.\n\nYou might have to change feeder patterns for schools. You'd have to change staffing, move some schools to new curricula, work out bus routes and rework facilities to meet district standards. You might have to close some schools.\n\nAll of this would be an enormous disruption to students, families, teachers and everybody else in the merged systems. There would inevitably be a big fight, whether it's in school boards or the General Assembly.\n\nIf we're going to have a big fight over education, let's have it over something with more concrete benefits — like weighted funding for high-needs schools, or improved teacher training and development, or, as the task force suggested, re-assessing property taxes to eliminate arbitrary tax inequities. But redistricting as a means to save money isn't worth the political capital.\n\nI happen to think there are non-fiscal reasons to redistrict in some cases. Most notably, it's unconscionable that Wilmington is torn into four different districts, all of which also have significant suburban populations. There's no district dedicated to tackling the unique problems that come with high-poverty, inner-city schools.\n\nBut, as the Wilmington Education Improvement Commission proved when its redistricting plan failed in the Senate two years ago, suburban residents don't want to take on the challenges that would come with adding those high-poverty schools to their districts. It's near impossible to pass such a plan through the General Assembly.\n\nDelaware should definitely explore ways to make its school districts work more efficiently, and the consolidation task force explored some interesting ideas. Even if they don't consolidate districts, lawmakers and superintendents could consolidate some back-office functions, like finance, transportation management, and human resources.\n\nCost-effectiveness should always be part of Delaware's school conversation. But we should stop tying ourselves up in knots talking about consolidation.\n\nWhen it comes to schools, Delaware has much bigger fish to fry.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/04/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/30/heres-some-delaware-races-watch-nov-3-ballot/3754748001/", "title": "Here's some Delaware races to watch on the Nov. 3 ballot", "text": "Delaware voters will have plenty to choose from beyond President Donald Trump and Joe Biden this Election Day.\n\nWhile the races for governor, U.S. Senate, U.S. House, insurance commissioner and lieutenant governor will be on the ballot for voters across the state, some local races are also worth paying attention to.\n\nSome races will likely make national history, while others already have.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2017/04/04/delawares-top-seniors-recognized-bunting/100018492/", "title": "Delaware's top seniors recognized by Bunting", "text": "Jessica Bies\n\nThe Daily Times\n\nSecretary of Education Susan Bunting will recognize top public school students from the Class of 2017 at the annual Secretary of Education Scholars banquet at 6 p.m. April 25 at Dover Downs Hotel & Casino in Dover.\n\nGovernor John Carney and other state leaders will be joined by the students’ families, district superintendents, heads of charter schools and principals to celebrate the students’ accomplishments.

{"question_id": "20240216_27", "search_time": "2024/02/17/00:16", "search_result": [{"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2015/02/20/dupont-chemours-risks-deepen-concern-economy-jobs/23755543/", "title": "DuPont, Chemours risks deepen concern about economy, jobs", "text": "Jeff Montgomery\n\nThe News Journal\n\nIt was late December when DuPont Co. announced the unthinkable: As part of its split into two companies, it would move about 800 DuPont employees out of its Wilmington headquarters into the suburbs this summer, while moving an equal number of white collar staff for its Chemours spinoff into its historic building downtown.\n\nChemours will take on DuPont's worldwide Performance Chemicals division. Its formation also will create a watershed moment for Delaware, which owes its original manufacturing and science-based identity to the company – and where the company as recently as 1979 directly employed more than 1 out of every 10 working residents statewide.\n\nStakes are high for Delaware's already strained economy and the tax base of its largest, and deeply troubled, city.\n\nThere's already worry that Chemours could be gobbled up by DuPont competitor Tronox Inc. soon after the split, which would likely take any headquarters choices out of the new company's hands, and weaken Delaware's ability to shape the decision.\n\n\"The deal that TROX clearly wants to do is the (highly strategic) acquisition of Chemours once DuPont spins off that business to shareholders mid-year,\" said Ian Corydon, an analyst and co-director of research for investment bank B. Riley & Co.\n\nTronox, the formerly bankrupt spinoff of Kerr-McGee Corp., is the world's largest fully integrated producer of titanium ore and titanium dioxide. DuPont is the global leader in total output of the same valuable pigment, but will spin off that business to Chemours, including its Edge Moor plant, the oldest in the company's worldwide fleet of \"TiO2\" production centers.\n\nWilmington Councilman Charles M. \"Bud\" Freel, who chairs the city budget committee, said he's already hearing that Chemours could be a short-term tenant in downtown Wilmington, and that some DuPont workers might already be moving out.\n\n\"From everything I've heard or even read, there's no guarantee that the Chemours people are going to be there for any length of time,\" Freel said. \"I understand they're talking to other cities about a new location.\"\n\nWilmington has a 1.25 percent earned income tax that plays a huge role in its annual operating budget. If it loses the white-collar jobs in a block-long building downtown, the loss would open a giant hole in the city's budget.\n\n\"Even if they do move some of the Chemours people in,\" Freel said, \"I don't think you're looking at the same salaries that the DuPont folks who are moving (out) are being paid.\"\n\nDuPont spokesman Dan Turner said Friday that company moves already are \"under way and will be complete by July 1.\" DuPont's portion of the original enterprise will be headquartered at its Chestnut Run complex at Lancaster Pike and Centre Road, while Chemours will take ownership of the DuPont Building at 10th and Market streets.\n\n\"We are working to move employees to and from each location to ensure a smooth transition,\" Turner said.\n\nAsked about Tronox and a potential early takeover bid for Chemours late Friday, Turner said only: \"We do not comment on rumors or speculation.\"\n\nLosing those jobs would be another blow to Delaware's once-leading status as a place for high-income, high-tech research jobs. While Delaware is making progress in replacing those jobs, some fear the state is losing ground.\n\nWilliam R. Latham III, a University of Delaware associate professor of economics, said the First State is entering a new economic era that will demand adaptability.\n\n\"I don't think you can take a perspective and say, 'What are we doing wrong? We're witnessing the evolution of the economy and a particular industry,\" Latham said. \"Because Delaware is so small, we're more aware of the effects of particular industries and particular companies.\"\n\nThe shifting landscape has resulted in growth among smaller tech firms. Hundreds now work in different high-tech sectors at what was once DuPont's former diagnostics technologies site in Glasgow, south of Newark. Big employers include bioscience leader Siemens Health Care Diagnostics and Holologic, Inc., a major global producer of crucial devices for mammograms.\n\nANP Technologies Inc., a Newark biotech company launched in 2002, now has 30 workers and Department of Defense approval to create a handheld device for sensing bio threats. But ANP founder Ray Yin says more needs to be done to keep the local tech sector thriving.\n\n\"My personal wish list, as someone with a high-tech company, is to have the state paying more attention to helping companies market their products, or provide some marketing resources,\" Yin said. \"Once we have marketing and sales down, that means we have to produce more and hire more people.\"\n\nState officials said they're listening. Gov. Jack Markell said they're exploring options like direct aid, employer recruitment and developing new and expanded education and training for entry-level workers in fast-changing, technology-intense workplaces. He also pointed to employment gains that have steadily bested the region and national average over the past several quarters.\n\n\"We need to keep the foot on the pedal,\" he said.\n\nDelaware also will do all it can to keep Chemours in Wilmington, said state Economic Development Office director Alan Levin.\n\nWhen the DuPont split is complete, Chemours worldwide will have 9,100 employees. \"One thousand of them, or close to a thousand, will stay here in Delaware,\" Levin said. \"Our intention is to make sure they stay permanently. I don't think it's panic button\" time.\n\nEven success in holding on to Chemours would be a far cry from 1990, when DuPont employed 27,000 across Delaware, from its \"Nylon Capital\" plant in Seaford to its research center along Brandywine Creek.\n\nBy 2001, the number had plunged to 12,400, and fell about 50 percent more, to estimates of around 8,300, by late 2013.\n\nChemical manufacturing by all companies, meanwhile, dropped by two-thirds between 2002 and mid-2014, from 7,000 jobs statewide to about 2,632. Those manufacturing losses were part of a broader trend that included the recent shutdown of Chrysler and General Motors plants in New Castle County, sites that employed about 10,000 in 1980 and 5,000 at the start of the last decade.\n\nCompounding the workforce pressures has been a more-than 70 percent drop in \"management of companies\" jobs lost as Delaware-based corporations streamlined and industries consolidated – a roughly 15,000-position drop between 2001 and 2014. By way of comparison, that reduction is only slightly smaller than the state's entire construction workforce, but with a higher average weekly wage.\n\n\"People who were in middle management and making $120,000 a year now can find only jobs making $60,000 or $70,000 a year,\" said A. Richard Heffron, president of the Delaware State Chamber of Commerce. \"There is a (national) recovery. Things are getting a little bit better. But it's not quick enough.\"\n\nEdward Ratledge, who directs the University of Delaware's Center for Applied Demography and Survey Research, said much of the change has been profound and, likely, permanent.\n\n\"It's hard. When you look around, what it looks like is small business is where the action is. Big businesses are getting smaller all the time because they're the ones able to replace labor with capital,\" Ratledge said.\n\n\"With the hollowing out of the middle-skill jobs, what happens is that some people with a little more education can climb in to higher tech groups. But the rest are left fighting for the lower up to the middle skill jobs, and that drives wage rates down.\"\n\nIn 2012, Delaware's per capita personal income dipped below the national average for the first time since at least 1929, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics reports. That indicator, used as one measure of economic well being, remained at the second-lowest all-time level relative to the national average in 2013, although the state average has increased in each of the last three quarters.\n\nAnd while individual industries have varied widely, the state's average hourly wage declined from $22.67 in June 2010 to $21.81 in June 2014.\n\nIn July, the Chemours headquarters team will occupy aging office space vacated as the original company moves to its new Chestnut Run complex on State Route 141.\n\nOf 37 sites worldwide, the new Chemours firm would have only two production locations in Delaware, along with its initial headquarters and two research and development activities to be leased in the DuPont Experimental Station northwest of Wilmington.\n\nChemours also would take on the Chambers Works fluoroproducts plant in Deepwater, N.J., at the foot of the Delaware Memorial Bridge, and operations in Elkton, Md.\n\nThere are other possible headwinds. \"They're coming downtown and people forget: That's an older building,\" Heffron said. \"I've talked with people over there and there are some problems with the fact that it is an older building.\"\n\nDuPont, in fact, only recently built two new, ultra-modern buildings at its headquarters destination at Chestnut Run, part of a Wilmington-area office modernization that the company dubbed \"Project Renaissance\" – years before the split was announced.\n\nChemours, Heffron said, \"could be anywhere.\" While Chemours in Wilmington is a goal, keeping them in Delaware is paramount.\n\n\"The other thing is, as companies become smaller, they become more attractive to other companies for a takeover or merger, and we've seen what that does,\" Heffron said. \"You lose control.\"\n\nFrederick C. Sears II, chairman of the Wilmington Economic and Financial Advisory Council, which produces city revenue estimates, said that the new company's payroll and permanence are concerns.\n\nYet Sears also noted that other big buildings in the city once filled with DuPont workers have since been taken on for new activities and jobs, many in the financial services industry.\n\n\"All those buildings have since been filled with other folks,\" Sears said.\n\nLevin also believes it wise to take the broad view.\n\n\"I think what you need is a diverse workforce in a lot of ways. Good-paying jobs are important, but you need a diverse workforce that can weather storms,\" he said. \"If we have all our apples in the financial services basket and financial services takes a hit, then we take a bigger hit. So we need to spread things out in some ways.\"\n\nNew and advanced technology and information technology fields are a high priority. Markell and state officials last week announced a new \"Pathways to Prosperity\" workforce training effort, focused on computer science, engineering, bioscience, culinary arts, hospitality management and manufacturing logistics.\n\nAdministration officials also point to solid gains in some technology areas, ranging from market victories by companies already here to new arrivals.\n\nExamples include a decision by growing biopharmaceutical company, Incyte, to locate its corporate headquarters in the renovated John Wanamaker department store north of Wilmington, and ILC Dover's relocation of Grayling Industries from Mexico to Seaford, where a new containment products plant is expected to employ 115.\n\nAlthough direct manufacturing employment remains in decline amid a continuing workforce shift toward service industries, the number of people employed in scientific research and development has turned up since its 2010 low, reaching about 6,850 people in 2013. But those jobs are more spread out, in smaller firms, with the number of research and development job sites increasing to 98 statewide in 2013 compared with 66 sites a dozen years earlier.\n\nMuch of that growth is a testament to the ambitious and growing Delaware Technology Park in Newark, where about 800 people now work in dozens of research and start-up enterprises supported by an array of private business partnerships, government programs and higher education institutions.\n\nIn June, the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, an eight-year-old think tank based in Washington, D.C., ranked Delaware second among all states for its moves toward the \"New Economy.\" The group singled out the state as the \"most globalized,\" and for gains in research and development investment and high wage jobs in production of goods distributed outside the region or globally.\n\n\"Over the course of the last 10 years, we've seen about 80 companies come up from scratch to some substantial levels\" said J. Michael Bowman, president of Delaware Technology Park, a cluster of laboratories, cutting edge research and advanced technology business incubators just north of Newark Shopping Center. \"The more we do that, we become somewhat of a magnet for bringing others in from other areas.\"\n\nBowman is also associate director of the University of Delaware's Office of Economic Innovation and Partnerships.\n\nThe park houses the University of Delaware's Biotechnology Institute's Bioimaging Center, a maze of modern research tools. In one of the center's rooms, University of Delaware biology graduate student Katie Minker peered at images of corn leaf cells infected with a fungus, using a kind of microscope that eliminates unfocused, less useful light and improves details when researchers are using materials to make tissue details fluorescent.\n\nThe system was one of an array of exotic imaging systems, some individually costing more than $1 million, that the University operates at the Bioimaging Center at DTC, making them available to dozens of users on a cost-recovery basis. Resources include a super-computer and 3-D imaging theater.\n\n\"Science is really shifting. Gone are the days when an investigator had every tool they wanted in their own lab,\" said Jeffrey L. Caplan, the center's director. \"We now have to share.\"\n\nBowman said the center is itself a research and economic development magnet, making the area more attractive to both scientists and scientific entrepreneurs.\n\nNear Glasgow, global giant Air Liquide has been building a major research and technology center since 2007 that employs about 100 in high-tech gas, membrane and semi-conductor sciences and industry work. A neighboring company, Hologic, produces 55 percent of all the digital detectors used in three-dimensional mammography machines.\n\n\"Detectors made in Delaware show up in Russia, in Thailand and all over the U.S.,\" said Jim Culley, director of strategic projects for Hologic Inc. \"We have about 150 people in Delaware – six or seven Ph.Ds and most of the rest are engineers.\"\n\nHopes are high, too, for UD's Science, Technology and Advanced Research (STAR) campus, which has emerged as a leading symbol of Delaware's reach for post-recession, new economy growth.\n\nThe 272-acre former Chrysler assembly plant site was acquired for a range of academic, research, industry and incubator uses, and already hosts fuel cell-maker Bloom Energy's factory and a new UD Health and Science Complex.\n\nSevOne, a 400-employee, growing Newark-based, global network management company, recently signed a 13-year lease for space at the campus as well, supported by a $1 million grant that also will help add to its Delaware workforce.\n\nDelaware Technology Park and Delle Donne Associations – a commercial developer of 18 of STAR's acres – recently announced an agreement for a new, 10,000 square foot portion of a new building for specialized laboratories for use by startup companies.\n\nSeveral miles away, along the Delaware River in Newport, an Air Liquide subsidiary called Medal employs about the same number of people making specialized membrane devices to separate gases and liquids at nano-scale levels.\n\nThe company's systems are in use to produce nitrogen from air bled off the engine of airborne Boeing 737, the F-22 Raptor and other aircraft that is then used in fuel tanks, to reduce the risk of explosions.\n\n\"We'll make the little hollow fibers the size of a human hair with holes in them by the gazillion miles, then assemble them into membrane elements. Then we can go further into complete systems,\" said Charlie Anderson, director of biogas technology and advanced separations solutions for Air Liquide. \"We sell a lot of stuff into China. It's very difficult to make, what we do.\"\n\nIt is far from replacing all the jobs once generated by DuPont. But the company's split – and potential departure of Chemours – is a point Delaware was bound to reach, Levin said.\n\n\"It's a global corporation now. They're still an integral part of Delaware, but by the same token, they've had to spread their production workforce all over the globe,\" Levin said. \"This was bound to happen eventually. It's not that DuPont has gotten smaller. DuPont has just taken a different turn, if you will, to be a global company and not a Delaware company per se.\n\n\"They're still here. We're very proud of that and we're going to do everything we can to help them grow.\"\n\nThe University of Delaware's Latham also saw Delaware arriving at this crossroads.\n\n\"If you look at the fact that employment in Delaware is not doing badly, that's a positive,\" Latham said. \"We've managed to hold on to a lot of employment\" despite losses of business that once dominated the economy.\"\n\n\"The startups that we're looking at now are frequently a handful of people, but if you can have a thousand of them and the total employment is what you have from one large manufacturer, that can make a difference,\" he said. \"I think we need to have the flexibility in our arrangements that make Delaware an attractive place for new kinds of industry.\"\n\nContact Jeff Montgomery at (302) 678-4277 or jmontgomery@delawareonline.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/02/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/11/18/trump-country-delmarvas-trump-voters-send-message/93955072/", "title": "Trump country: Delmarva's Trump voters send message", "text": "Matthew Albright and Jeremy Cox\n\nUSA Today Network\n\nHillary Clinton won Delaware, Maryland and Virginia, but the Delmarva Peninsula is Donald Trump country.\n\nNorthern New Castle County and Rehoboth Beach in Delaware and Northampton County in Virginia are packed with voters who favored Clinton. But, geographically, the peninsula still sports a sea of \"Trump-Pence\" signs, and many rural residents proudly wear hats that say \"Make America Great Again.\"\n\nOnly a few miles separate metropolitan residents from their small-town neighbors, but the 2016 election that will place Trump in the White House made it seem like urban and rural residents live on different planets.\n\n\"It has really made me question what kind of country I live in,\" said Andrea Wallace, a Newark resident and proud Clinton supporter. \"I just thought there was no way somebody like [Trump] could win an election.\"\n\nClinton garnered 2,112 more votes than Trump on the Delmarva Peninsula, but voting fell mostly along urban-rural lines.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nRELATED: After Trump win, where do we go from here?\n\nRELATED: Two rallies for peace on UD's campus\n\nTrump voters say liberals are seeing their candidate through a funhouse mirror, distorted by their own prejudices and biased media coverage.\n\nMany Delmarva residents believe Clinton, rather than Trump, is the serial liar. Trump's business acumen is irrefutable, no matter how often liberals point to his half-dozen bankruptcies and the more than 4,000 lawsuits involving him and his businesses, conservatives contend.\n\nTrump's income tax proposal saves its biggest cuts for the nation’s richest families, reducing the top federal income rate from 39.5 percent to 32.2 percent. But supporters see Trump as a savior to the working class.\n\n“When you take away people’s ability to make a decent living in this country, you’re going to have an uprising,” said Rosanna Nicoletos, 60, a real estate appraiser from the retiree community of Ocean Pines in Worcester County, Maryland. “The only thing that matters is people want to make their own way in this world. And we get labeled the tea party or that party. These are just people who want to make a better way for their family.”\n\nTrump's fans believe he will “bust up” endemic corruption inside the Beltway, no matter how much the New York Times writes about him proudly avoiding paying taxes for nearly two decades.\n\nThey think he is the one to heal divisions between Democrats and Republicans, no matter how much Democrats decry him smearing his rivals as “crooked” and “lyin’.”\n\nTrump’s charged comments about blacks and Latinos shattered political norms, prompting Clinton to call him a racist to his face. But in the largely white, rural quarters of the Delmarva Peninsula, that's just Democrats and their friends in the media conflating political correctness with the moral high ground.\n\n\"People got angry with the media because they were so overwhelmingly supportive of Hillary and her campaign and so negative to the point that people just turned their TVs off and wouldn't even listen,\" said Michael J. Harrington Sr., a real estate agent who lent an open storefront in downtown Dover to the Trump campaign. \"We just want somebody who will tell the truth.\"\n\nA darker economic reality\n\nThe rural-urban divide is intensifying nationwide. Experts like University of Delaware professor Ted Davis argue those two worlds are facing very different realities, particularly when it comes to economic development.\n\nRural hospitals in critical condition\n\n\"You go to rural areas, the economy is still very depressed,\" Davis said. \"You can almost feel it in the air.\"\n\nDuring the Great Recession, rural economies fell apart earlier than their urban counterparts and were slower to rebound.\n\nRural employment began to fall after the first three months of 2007, a full year before urban employment began to sink, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s economic research office. Both showed signs of recovery through the first half of 2011. Afterward, urban areas continued to improve while places outside major cities stagnated.\n\nThe researchers attribute the employment gap to lower population growth in rural areas and an older, less-educated workforce.\n\nAs of September, New Castle County’s unemployment rate stood at 4.3 percent. In rural Wicomico County on Maryland’s lower Eastern Shore, 5.1 percent were looking for work.\n\nIn Dorchester County, home to Maryland's third-highest unemployment rate, Trump romped to a 55-41 percent victory over Clinton. In one precinct Trump's lead was 78 percent to 19 percent.\n\nBernadette Sahm, who splits time between Lewes and Baltimore County, worries about the world her three grown children are inheriting.\n\n“I don’t feel the American dream is as attainable for them with housing prices being up and wages being down,\" said Sahm, 57, the former head of the Smyrna Opera House who now runs a consulting business for nonprofits. \"The jobs aren’t as good, and it’s sad.\"\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW MAP\n\nTo use the map, click on a county to see the total votes for each candidate.\n\nView a larger version of the map below.\n\nIt wasn’t easy being a Trump fan in a blue state, Sahm said, because Trumps speaks his mind.\n\n“I get that he can be abrasive to some people,\" Sahm said. \"But he’s from New York. I’m Italian. In my family, you just tell it like it is.”\n\nDavis argues the Republican's supporters were willing to overlook some of his controversial remarks and flaws as a politician because Trump was more clearly articulating a grim reality they were experiencing. While Clinton did talk a lot about creating jobs, she stuck to President Barack Obama's playbook and painted a picture of growth rosier than that experienced by people in rural areas.\n\n\"The thinking is, we're having economic hard times, and the Democrats didn't seem to address this,\" Davis said.\n\nIn the days before the election, Democratic pundits were gleefully wondering whether Trump had destroyed the Republican Party. On Nov. 9, they had to face a reality that the GOP will control the White House, both houses of Congress and soon the Supreme Court.\n\nRepublicans also expanded their dominance at the local level, seizing full control of 33 state legislatures and 33 governorships.\n\nThis harsh reality has led to many Democrats questioning their leadership — on Thursday, Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan announced he would be challenging California Rep. Nancy Pelosi's position as minority leader. Many Trump voters say the Democrats had it coming.\n\n“I think most people in the country were just sick of Washington,\" said Darin Mister, a 21-year-old Salisbury University student and Somerset County native. \"They wanted change. Hillary’s been the ultimate Washington insider forever. We need something different.\"\n\nMister said Trump represented something new while Clinton appeared to be from a world long since past its expiration date.\n\nDallas Collins, an 80-year-old retiree in Laurel, believes Democrats have spent too much money on welfare programs, arguing that liberal politicians are simply handing tax dollars to urban residents.\n\nHe may live less than two hours away from Wilmington, but Collins admits the city's ways and thinking are foreign to him.\n\n“It’s just a difference in the area,” Collins said. “You have more farmers, a lot more working people. You have people up there who are on welfare and need help and all. Once people get on free stuff, it gets to be a habit; you stay on it.”\n\nRacial and social change\n\nOne of the things that terrifies Democratic voters the most about Trump is how he has talked about race, ethnicity and religion.\n\nTrump's decision to name as his top adviser Steve Bannon, the former publisher of the incendiary right-wing website Breitbart, drew swift condemnation from many Democrats.\n\n\"Mr. Bannon personally has made despicable comments about women, the LGBT community, people of faith, and those with mental illness,\" U.S. Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., said in a statement posted on Facebook. \"At Breitbart, Mr. Bannon created an outlet built upon stoking racism, sexism, homophobia, and anti-Semitism.\"\n\nAs a candidate, Trump called for a ban on Muslims entering the U.S., and some of his aides have recently discussed the possibility of a \"Muslim registry.\" A crackdown on illegal immigration was the centerpiece of his campaign, and many Latino advocates said the way he talked about immigrants was racist.\n\nTrump said during one debate that African-Americans were \"living in hell,\" a statement many black leaders decried.\n\n\"I knew there were still racists out there, but I thought we were past the point where we would elect somebody like this,\" said Mike Gregory, a Bear resident who is black. \"It scares me. A lot.\"\n\nTrump supporters say liberals and the media twisted Trump's words and misrepresented his policies to make him sound like a racist. They argue a call for tougher enforcement of illegal immigration does not equal a hatred of immigrants.\n\n\"He's not going to stop Mexicans coming into the country, he's just going to do a better job screening them, which is what we should be doing,\" said Harrington, the Dover real estate agent. \"And when people talk about these refugees, he's just saying we need to be totally sure we're not letting bad people in who are going to harm our country. Hillary just wanted to let them all come in, and I think she just did that to get votes.\"\n\nDavis, the University of Delaware professor, says many rural voters are troubled by the rising share of minorities in the U.S. population, and by the change in social norms to things like marriage and gun rights. That's partially because most migration and rapid social changes have historically happened mostly in cities, so urban voters are more accustomed to the changes.\n\n\"I'm not saying that [urban residents] are over it, but they've had to deal with multiculturalism for more than a century in the big cities,\" Davis said.\n\nMister, the university student, shakes his head at exit polls showing how his generation, the millennials, voted in large numbers for Clinton. As millennials age, they will join his camp, Mister predicted. And they shouldn’t be labeled as racists or xenophobes for doing so, he said.\n\n“That’s all from the media, social media in particular,\" he said. \"That’s where most people get their news these days. The large majority of the things you find on social media are very left.\"\n\nThe culture wars are not limited to issues of race. Many Trump voters, like 57-year-old Dorcester County resident Mark Marshall, were afraid Clinton would take away their guns.\n\nHe watches enough MSNBC to know what the liberals are thinking: Why does he need a gun in the first place?\n\nHe has a collection of guns, lifting his sweater for good measure to show that he has one tucked into his waistband.\n\n“Why do I need a pickup?\" Marshall asked. \"It’s my life.

They also question whether the investments pay dividends in the long run.\n\nBut they all agree it’s a game Delaware – and other states – must play if they want to attract corporate jobs because no state can afford to back out now.\n\n“Look, everybody does it so we have to do it, too,” said Jim Butkiewicz, who heads the University of Delaware’s economics department. “It may not be the easiest fact of life to accept, but it’s a reality of economic development today.”\n\nHow Delaware outhustled other states to win DuPont ag unit\n\nSo why does Delaware and practically every other state in the country award money to corporations that rake in billions of dollars a year?\n\n“It’s not because the companies need [state help],” said Timothy Bartik, a senior economist at the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Kalamazoo, Michigan.\n\n“But in the highly competitive world of economic development, [corporations] are perceived as having location options and, therefore, leverage,” he said. “As a result, governors and mayors throughout the country are afraid of the political and economic consequences of not providing those incentives.”\n\nIn DuPont's case, for instance, those state payouts played a significant role in retaining a corporation that has been synonymous with Delaware for two centuries.\n\nLosing the company would have meant more than additional job losses. DuPont has been synonymous with Delaware for more than two centuries, providing not just tens of thousands of jobs, but building roads, supporting charities and providing for its extended family. Few people in Delaware are not touched in some way by the company.\n\nTo lose it would have been a psychological blow.\n\n\"DuPont was clear to us that this was a business decision and that company leadership had a duty to do what was in the best interest of shareholders,\" said Bernice Whaley, director of the Delaware Economic Development Office. \"So if they were to choose Delaware, they would need us to put forth a package that then allowed them to justify their decision to shareholders.\"\n\nBig money for big companies\n\nSome of the nation’s largest corporations have received some of the biggest payouts from Delaware's Strategic Fund, a pot of money set aside to provide incentives for job creation and capital development.\n\nSix Fortune 500 companies are among the 10 biggest recipients of those funds since 2009, according to an analysis by The News Journal.\n\nDelaware has committed about $92 million to those six businesses since Gov. Jack Markell took office – that is 37 percent of the roughly $250 million in Strategic Fund grants and loans awarded by his administration.\n\nIn November, for instance, JPMorgan Chase secured $10.5 million in state grants to support an expansion that promises to bring 1,800 new jobs to Delaware.\n\nThe deal brought the state’s total commitment to JPMorgan over the past three years to more than $22 million, making the nation’s largest bank the second-largest recipient of Strategic Fund dollars under Markell.\n\nThose payouts helped encourage JPMorgan to grow its local workforce from about 6,600 in 2012 to roughly 8,700 today – making the bank Delaware's second-largest private employer behind Christiana Care.\n\n\"Our firm is extremely appreciative of the supportive business climate in Delaware, and that’s a big reason why we have chosen to expand and invest here,\" spokesman Paul Hartwick said. \"We have grown significantly in Delaware over the last five years, and we believe the broader community has benefitted from our growth and investments.\"\n\nLast year, JPMorgan hit record profits of $24.4 billion. Delaware’s operating budget, by comparison, is $3.9 billion.\n\nCiting those massive profits, the Delaware Coalition for Open Government asked the bank to withdraw its most recent application for state support.\n\n“We don’t have a problem with the Strategic Fund in general,” spokesman John Flaherty said. “Our issue is that it’s used to subsidize financial institutions that obviously don’t need these grants.”\n\nAmazon in 2011 received nearly $3.5 million in state incentives, along with a 10-year municipal tax break, to support its 1.2-million-square-foot distribution center in Middletown. The deal was tied to the creation of 850 jobs. Amazon, which recorded $596 million in 2015 profits, does not release specific hiring numbers, but is believed to have roughly 2,500 workers at its Middletown plant today.\n\nJPMorgan Chase adding 1,800 jobs\n\nDuPont and the Dow Chemical Co. are now poised to collect $21 million in state and county grants over the next five years as an enticement for keeping their post-merger agriculture unit in Delaware.\n\nDuPont earned nearly $2 billion in profits in 2015, while Dow raked in nearly $11 billion.\n\nWhaley said closing those incentives off to major corporations would mean closing the state off to the jobs they bring.\n\nDEDO's active portfolio – deals in which benchmarks are still being monitored – has disbursed $92.1 million, with $39.5 million left to be distributed.\n\nTo date, those payouts to 500 businesses have led to the creation and retention of nearly 32,300 jobs – about 6,500 more than were promised, the agency says. That's a working population similar in size to the entire population of Newark at an average cost to taxpayers of about $2,850 per job.\n\n“[Markell] has discussed with other governors their mutual dislike of employment incentives,” Whaley said. “But as long as there are states that give these kinds of incentives, then Delaware must do so.”\n\nSome might call that corporate welfare.\n\nJohn Stapleford, who heads the libertarian-minded Caesar Rodney Institute, likens it more to bribes and ransom.\n\nBut even he concedes state incentives are so widespread that they now amount to the cost of doing business.\n\n“States are caught between a rock and a hard place,” he said.\n\n“It’s chump change to these companies, but if you don’t throw something on the table, it looks like you don’t care and that could kill a deal.”\n\nThe state of economic development\n\nEconomic development incentives are nothing new and their use extends well beyond Delaware.\n\n“Some use more and some use less, but I can’t think of any states that don’t use them at all,” said Bartik, who has authored several research papers on the topic. “It’s not even a liberal or conservative issue at this point.”\n\nBlue states like New York and New Jersey offer some of the biggest incentives, along with red states like Texas and Louisiana.\n\nEven states that once avoided using incentives have been lured in by the promise of jobs.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democrat, created its first grant program tied to job creation in 2013. The program, capped at $2 million per award, committed to more than $13 million in grants the first year as part of an effort to create nearly 1,400 jobs at 26 businesses, according to media reports.\n\nSince Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval took office in 2011, Nevada has twice broken its record for incentives, packages that rely on targeted tax breaks instead of grants. More recently, Nevada approved a 20-year, $1.2 billion package in 2014 to land a Tesla battery factory, plus a $43 million deal to buy an existing road through a private industrial center.\n\nAt least 10 states have approved economic development packages of $1 billion or more, according to Good Jobs First, a labor-backed nonprofit that analyzes tax incentives.\n\nInside Nevada's $1.25 billion Tesla tax deal\n\n“Most of these things got started back when the South was attempting to attract industry after World War II,” Bartik said. “It then intensified with each economic downturn through the '70s, '80s and '90s.”\n\nDelaware’s Strategic Fund dates back to the mid-1990s under then-Gov. Tom Carper.\n\nAt the time, Playtex Products was being courted to relocate its Dover tampon manufacturing plant to Richmond, Virginia, by a promise of $6 million in incentives.\n\nDelaware’s economic development director recommended the state counter with a $3 million cash payment to the company.\n\nNow known as Edgewell Personal Care, the plant is still operating in Dover, where the company employs about 500 workers.\n\nAnother 250 new jobs are expected to be added at the site by 2017 thanks to its consolidation with a Montreal plant – a move facilitated by a $3 million Strategic Fund grant approved last year.\n\nA risky game\n\nLike most states, Delaware’s track record with high-dollar grants and loans for major corporations has been spotty, at best.\n\nThe First State’s most notorious bust came in the form of a $12.5 million loan and a $9 million grant to Fisker Automotive, marking the third-largest Strategic Fund outlay under Markell.\n\nAt the time, the California-based electric car maker was planning to build its Atlantic automobile line at General Motors’ shuttered Boxwood Road plant near Newport, a project that promised to bring more than 2,000 jobs.\n\nLevin: Fisker could return to Delaware\n\nFisker never built a car in Delaware.\n\nMonths of missteps cost the company access to a federal loan, leading the car maker to file for bankruptcy protection in 2013.\n\nOnly a small amount of the state’s money was returned.\n\nMore recently, Bloom Energy has come under fire for missing hiring benchmarks the company agreed to in 2012 when it received a $16.5 million grant tied to the creation of 900 jobs at its Newark manufacturing plant.\n\nBloom Energy, which relies on revenue from Delmarva Power surcharges, has blamed its slow growth on regulatory hurdles.\n\nDEDO has given Bloom until 2017 to make up any hiring shortfalls before being required to repay the state grant.\n\nDEDO also extended the deadline for specialty chemical maker Ashland to reach employment benchmarks set in 2012 when the state committed $10 million in grants tied to the creation and retention of 800 jobs.\n\nSince then, Ashland has sold its Delaware-based water technologies unit and paid back the roughly $334,800 received from the state.\n\nDEDO, meanwhile, extended $1.1 million in grants last year to Solenis, the new name of the Ashland spinout.\n\n“The truth is those examples are all pretty typical,” said Jonathan Justice, a public policy professor at UD. “Everyone has similar success or failure rates when it comes to these incentives and I don’t see anything that would suggest Delaware’s record is any worse than other states.”\n\nA questionable practice\n\nA mounting body of evidence indicates few, if any, of the incentives offered by states are achieving their goals.\n\n“The latest studies suggest the probability of these packages being the decisive factor in where a company locates is about 5 to 10 percent,” Bartik said.\n\nA state’s business climate, tax codes, regulatory structure, labor force and education systems are given considerably more weight by companies looking to move or grow their business operations, he said.\n\n“There are much bigger reasons why a company chooses where to locate and it ain’t $10 million to $20 million in one-time money,” Singleton said. “It would be a real embarrassment if these executives had to explain to their shareholders why they stayed or moved to a state and the answer was because they bribed you.”\n\nSingleton, who served as chief of staff to Wilmington’s mayor William T. McLaughlin from the late 1970s to the early 1980s, recently penned a column in The News Journal lamenting his role in helping to create what he says has become an incentive “monster.”\n\nThe city’s incentive program pre-dates the state's, beginning in 1977 with a loan to the developers of a Doubletree Hotel, followed years later with a deal to keep Hercules Inc. in downtown Wilmington.\n\n“Back then, incentives were a difference-maker because they weren’t available everywhere,” he said. “Now it’s an arms race with every state and most cities offering bigger and bigger deals because no one wants to call these corporations on their bluff.”\n\nA 2013 report by Good Jobs First found both the number of so-called “megadeals” – packages valued at more than $75 million – doubled nationwide in six years.\n\nCarper, for instance, used a $40.7 million package of grants and tax credits, along with $70 million in road improvements to convince the newly formed AstraZeneca to establish its North American headquarters in Fairfax in 1999. In exchange, AstraZeneca pledged to increase its workforce at the site from 2,400 to 4,000 by 2004.\n\nThe pharmaceutical company's employment hit a peak of 5,000 workers in 2005, only to have patent losses and a global recession lead to a major restructuring. Today, AstraZeneca has about 2,400 workers in Delaware.\n\nBut the sheer size of those \"megadeal\" incentives makes it increasingly unlikely states will recoup their investments through future property and payroll tax revenue.\n\n“The problem is states tend to overbid on these projects,” Bartik said. “It’s easier to explain why they paid so much to win a company than to explain why they didn’t after losing out to another state.”\n\nAn incentive for reform\n\nConcerns over whether ballooning incentive payouts are justified – and actually creating the jobs they promise – have led many states, including Delaware, to re-examine their programs.\n\nSome have started cutting back on incentives, imposing stricter accountability measures and responding to calls for increased transparency.\n\n“Some places don’t have any guidelines for achieving a return on investment,” Bartik said. “If there aren’t any rules, how can you have any limits?”\n\nA 2014 report by Good Jobs First ranked Delaware and three other states among the worst in terms of providing taxpayers with details about their economic development incentives.\n\nFor Delaware, $200M in corporate giveaways, little transparency\n\nDelaware offers virtually no reports of actual job creation numbers online and no independent evaluations are conducted to determine the state’s return on investment.\n\nThose issues helped lead the General Assembly’s Joint Sunset committee to review DEDO’s performance over objections from the Markell administration.\n\nThat 2015 review resulted in passage of a bill, later signed by the governor, that made small changes to DEDO’s reporting requirements.\n\nThe legislation required new annual reports on the incentives provided and jobs promised, but not actual jobs created. The first of those reports was released in December.\n\nThe measure also requires DEDO to develop a five-year comprehensive plan that details actual job creation and return on investment, along with the office’s strategies and objectives related to specific business sectors.\n\nThe first of those plans is due in 2019 – two years after Markell leaves office.\n\nDelaware jobs grants get more transparency\n\nThe governor, in recent years, also has cut funding for the Strategic Fund.\n\nMarkell in 2015 set aside $10 million to cover incentives for the fiscal year that began July 1, a 48 percent cut from the previous year. And his budget proposal for the coming fiscal year would hold the funding at the same amount.\n\nDespite questions of their true effectiveness, Whaley said Delaware’s use of incentives has been successful because it pursues the biggest bang for the buck.\n\n“We are competing against 49 other states, many of which have more resources than we do and are willing to spend more per capita than we do,” she said. “In order to maximize our chances of success, we have to be willing to compete for jobs from big and small companies.”\n\nNo end in sight\n\nWhile the use of incentives may be a factor in that job creation, it’s also possible investing those funds in other areas would pay larger dividends, Bartik said.\n\nA portion of the incentive package offered to DuPont and Dow, for example, includes $3.6 million in grants to support the creation of 400 jobs.\n\n“You could achieve the same magnitude by offering 200 small businesses $1,800 a year for the next five years to each add two new jobs,” he said. “The state investment would be the same but that kind of money would certainly be more impactful to those companies.”\n\nLeaders in the state’s bioscience industry called for exactly those kind of investments last year.\n\n“If your focus is on high-paying jobs that tend to more broadly support the locally economy, there are also other investments you could be making,” he said. “Customized job training, business incubators or simply investing in education, in the long run, would make a state more attract to employers.”\n\nThe problem, he said, is that no state wants to take the risk of giving up its economic incentive programs.\n\n“Once you’ve started down that road, how do you turn back,” he asked. “In the [European Union], these kinds of incentives are illegal, but it would take federal legislation to put a stop to it here, and I don’t see that happening any time soon.”\n\nStates now have little choice other than to keep playing a game everyone knows is flawed, Butkiewicz said.\n\n“If everyone stopped, it wouldn’t have any impact on the overall economy because companies would still move,” he said. “But if Delaware stopped on its own, I imagine it would lose out on every one of those deals.”\n\nContact business reporter Scott Goss at (302) 324-2281, sgoss@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ScottGossDel.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/03/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/04/20/queen-prairie-sports-bubble-bursts-reactor-overhaul-news-around-states/50112783/", "title": "'Queen of the Prairie,' sports bubble bursts: News from around our ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Plaintiffs in lawsuits challenging the state’s law criminalizing medical treatment for transgender youth plan to file a new suit after withdrawing two actions Friday. Melody Eagan, an attorney with Birmingham-based Lightfoot, Franklin and White, which represented two families and two physicians in a lawsuit titled Ladinsky v. Ivey, wrote in an email Monday that they planned to “file a new case in the immediate future” against SB 184. Gov. Kay Ivey signed the law April 8; it will take effect in early May. “We promptly filed a lawsuit on behalf of two families and two doctors on the day Governor Ivey signed the bill,” Eagan wrote. “After filing that case, we are hearing from numerous Alabama families, including patients facing loss of critical medical care and parents facing potential criminal penalties. We also are hearing from numerous medical providers and others who care for transgender youth.” The law subjects doctors who prescribe puberty blockers and hormones to transgender youth to a Class C felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison. It also forbids public and private school personnel from withholding information about a student’s confusion over their gender identity and bans genital surgeries (except circumcisions) on minors. Health professionals have said surgeons don’t perform those procedures on youth in Alabama.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Officials have purchased a gondola in Austria for a city-owned ski area in Alaska’s capital city, but questions remain about the installation and long-term plans for the gondola. City officials have expressed interest in working with an Alaska Native corporation on the project. Eaglecrest Ski Area’s general manager and a city project manager recently visited a ski area in Austria to examine the lift and sign a sale agreement for $1.33 million, the Juneau Empire reports. Deputy City Manager Robert Barr said the city is seeking bids from transport companies to bring the gondola to Juneau. Eaglecrest has said its leaders have been looking for ways to expand summer operations and create opportunities for a more sustainable year-round model. The ski area, on its website, said it would work with planners, engineers and contractors on the best placement for the new infrastructure. Eaglecrest is on Douglas Island. City leaders last week authorized City Manager Rorie Watt to negotiate an agreement with Goldbelt Inc., an Alaska Native corporation that operates a tram near downtown Juneau and owns land near Eaglecrest. Watt, in a memo to the city’s Assembly, said Goldbelt has expressed interest in providing funding for up to $10 million for the installation of the gondola and “other related improvements.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Metro-area eviction filings are climbing back to pre-pandemic levels despite hundreds of millions of dollars in rental aid going to landlords. Moratoriums helped keep many Valley renters in their homes, but those are over. Now tenants, some still trying to pay back rent after struggling during COVID-19, are also facing skyrocketing rents and wages that aren’t keeping up. And Maricopa County renters who had evictions filed against them during the pandemic are facing record judgments despite all that relief money funneled to landlords. Housing researchers and tenant advocates say the rent-income gap, the lightning speed of Arizona’s eviction process and a lack of legal support for renters led to an eviction crisis in the Phoenix area that started even before the pandemic. An Arizona Republic analysis found eviction filings in Maricopa County hit a five-year high in 2019, the year before the COVID-19 pandemic. In January, February and March of this year, Valley evictions reached about 91% of filings from the first three months of 2019. About 65,000 Arizona renters believe they will likely be evicted in the next two months, according to the latest Census Pulse Survey. State law allows a landlord to initiate an eviction as soon as five days after a tenant misses rent, and the tenant is typically locked out within three weeks of filing.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders continues to far outpace her rivals in fundraising and spending for her bid for governor, the latest campaign finance reports show. Sanders, the daughter of former Gov. Mike Huckabee, reported raising more than $680,000 last month in her bid for Arkansas governor by Friday’s deadline for monthly campaign finance reports. She faces former talk radio host and podcaster Doc Washburn in next month’s Republican primary. Sanders spent more than $834,000 during the month and reported having nearly $7.4 million on hand. Sanders has raised more than $14 million since announcing her candidacy last year, a record for a governor’s race in the state. Sanders’ closest rival among the Democrats, Chris Jones, raised more than $120,000 in March and spent more than $213,000. Jones’ campaign reported having nearly $94,000 on hand. Jones faces Anthony Bland, Jay Martin, James “Rus” Russell and Supha Xayprasith-Mays in next month’s Democratic primary. Term limits bar Republican incumbent Asa Hutchinson from seeking reelection.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A $1.8 billion facility intended to connect Metro light-rail lines under downtown Los Angeles is 90% complete, and test runs of trains are underway, officials said Monday. The Regional Connector Project was designed to save commuters’ time by eliminating transfers between trains, allowing one-seat rides across Los Angeles County. “The trackwork, the rail guideways, the platform areas are now complete,” Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti told a press conference. “We’ve been waiting for like 10 years.” County Supervisor Hilda L. Solis, board chair of the Los Angeles County Transportation Authority, said the connector will open later this year. The overall project is a 1.9-mile underground light-rail extension connecting the A, E and L lines and three new stations, including the Grand Av Arts/Bunker Hill Station about 100 feet beneath ground level.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: The state is expecting the birth of another litter of wolf pups any day now, creating both excitement and concern over the natural rebirth of a predator with a long, human-induced absence from the state. The breeding pair of wolves that naturally migrated into the state last year formed the pack north of Walden in Jackson County with the birth of six pups. Colorado Parks and Wildlife officials had watched the pups for some time before announcing their birth in early June as the first litter of wolf pups born in the state in several decades. And soon that pack could grow, as wolves typically have pups from mid-April through mid-May. State wildlife officials said staff have not seen evidence of denning behavior or any sign of a new litter from the pack this year. “How could it get any better that soon we will see more pups,” said Dale Baker, a wolf advocate from Fort Collins who volunteered to watch North Park rancher Don Gittleson’s cattle herd after Gittleson lost three cows to the wolfpack. “The folks in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming had a big outcry when they brought wolves there, but now that this is naturally happening here, it seems like there should be less of an outcry.” Gittleson said the pack’s adult female was observed in heat, ready to mate in a pasture on his property in February.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNorwich: The city’s aging housing is creating public health concerns on top of squeezing a tight market. Shiela Hayes, president of the NAACP Norwich Branch, said the pandemic laid bare the importance of having the city address housing quality. “We can no longer act like that neighborhood, or that section, or that backstreet (can) continue to be underperforming housing stock; we don’t have that kind of luxury,” Hayes said. The majority of resident-owned homes in the state are 60 years or older, said Sam Giffin, a policy and data analyst for the Hartford-based Open Communities Alliance, as housing production has fallen since the baby boom – more so in Connecticut than in other parts of New England. Some of the risks that come from older houses include paint and other sources of lead. “There’s concern across the state that our old housing stock is a concern to both health and safety,” Giffin said. Hayes said Norwich has a lot of older housing, especially in Greenville, Taftville and downtown, where there are cheaper, privately held, multi-rental units converted from single-family homes. “They’re old, and they take a lot of maintenance,” Hayes said. Maintenance is usually not a matter of upgrading a single unit but multiple units at the same time, which means more money must be spent to get them up to code.\n\nDelaware\n\nNewark: President Joe Biden will return to his alma mater to give the commencement speech at the University of Delaware graduation in May, the university announced Tuesday. It’s the first time a sitting president will speak at a UD graduation ceremony. Biden is no stranger to visiting UD or giving graduation speeches there. May’s ceremony will be his fifth time speaking at commencement at the school – last in 2014, while serving as vice president. “(Biden’s) commitment to a lifetime of public service is an inspiring example for our graduates, as well as all our students and alumni, of what they can accomplish with a UD education, whatever path they may choose in life,” University President Dennis Assanis said in a statement. Students and their guests should expect heightened security at the graduation ceremony, UD spokeswoman Andrea Boyle Tippett said. Secret Service members will also likely visit campus to prepare with UD Police Department officers prior to the president’s arrival. The ceremony to honor this year’s 4,000-student graduating class is slated to start at 9:30 a.m. at Delaware Stadium on May 28. The event will also be livestreamed.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The National Museum of American History is opening a permanent entertainment exhibit in December, WUSA-TV reports. “Through the National Museum of American History’s extraordinary collection of theater, music, sports, movie and television objects, the exhibition Entertainment Nation will feature a powerful, ever-changing selection of objects and interactive experiences,” the museum said in a press release. “Through the objects and their stories, the exhibition will explore how, for over 150 years, entertainment has provided a forum for important national conversations about who we are, and who we want to be.” Some of the items set to go on display can be previewed online, including pop culture relics like Prince’s yellow “cloud” guitar, Muhammad Ali’s boxing robe, and Tejana singer Selena’s leather jacket and pants. The goal is to highlight how entertainment has shaped the nation’s society and shine a light on entertainers who have broken barriers. The permanent bilingual exhibit is set to open Dec. 9.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The state Department of Education rejected more than 50 mathematics textbooks – about 40% of those submitted – for failing to meet Florida’s new learning standards or because they “contained prohibited topics” that included references to critical race theory. Now, the only publisher approved by Gov. Ron DeSantis and the department for K-5 mathematics is Houston, Texas-based Accelerate Learning. “In the subject area as large as mathematics for grades K through five, it is unusual for there only to be one publisher to choose from,” said Billy Epting, assistant superintendent for academic services for Leon County Schools. DOE said more than half the textbooks being disallowed incorporated “prohibited topics or unsolicited strategies, including CRT,” which is an academic framework that is rarely seen outside of higher education. The term has become a highly charged catch-all buzzword for discussion of diversity of inclusion. Other books were not allowed because publishers “rebranded” Common Core Standards. DeSantis has taken a lead role nationally in Republican efforts to aggressively push back against liberal cultural values and what he calls “woke indoctrination.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Students at Druid Hills High School put together a short documentary video, shot on iPhones, to show the troubling conditions inside their learning environment. The video opens with a student explaining how human waste flows up from the ground and floods an area where he and his friends eat lunch. The high schoolers’ footage shows the classrooms, hallways and bathrooms crumbling around them. Plaster falls off walls, and water drips around electrical outlets. So much water has leaked into the weight room that it oozes up from the floor when a student steps on it. Another student demonstrates how one of the holes in a ceiling is so large that he can put his entire hand through it. “You can tell someone about the conditions, but when you visually see it, it’s a lot more impactful,” sophomore Harley Martz, one of the video’s producers, told the Associated Press in an interview. “Some of the things we pointed out in the video are very undeniable.” In the video, Druid Hills junior Montrice Berry describes the assault on the senses: “As you walk through the school now, you can smell the mold, and it’s kind of really nasty. So I tend to walk outside just so I can avoid the smell.” The video, which has garnered more than 40,000 views since it was posted on YouTube this month, has prompted outrage among some parents in the suburban area just east of Atlanta who want repairs made. It was produced after the DeKalb County School Board in February removed Druid Hills from a list of schools in need of priority renovations.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Federal authorities have begun monitoring the state’s wastewater for COVID-19, while Hawaii expects its own monitoring program to be fully operational this summer, officials said. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been testing in the islands as part of its National Wastewater Surveillance System, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The agency posts wastewater data on its COVID Data Tracker website, denoted by dots on a U.S. map. Data from Hawaii hasn’t been included yet due to “a technical glitch being resolved with how the points are displayed on the map,” said CDC spokesperson Nick Spinelli. The agency said it would also display data from the Hawaii Department of Health once the state is able to submit its own figures. More than 30 states have been funded to participate in the CDC program, but some are still getting their collection efforts up and running. Several issues delayed Hawaii’s early plans to set up its own statewide monitoring program. The state faced a six-month wait for shipment of sample-collection machines, which were back-ordered due to high demand. Federal funds paid for the the monitoring equipment at a cost of about $100,000. The equipment is now in place, as are protocols.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Scientists at the Idaho National Laboratory have completed a rare overhaul of one of the world’s most powerful nuclear test reactors, and normal operations are expected to resume later this spring, officials said Monday. The 11-month outage at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Test Reactor in eastern Idaho allowed a core overhaul that’s done, on average, about every 10 years. The change-out was the sixth since the reactor started operating in 1967 and the first in 17 years. “Overall, I’m very pleased with the ATR workforce and teamwork they demonstrated during the longest and most complex outage in our history,” said Sean O’Kelly, associate lab director for the Idaho National Laboratory’s Advanced Test Reactor Complex. He said the coronavirus pandemic and supply chain issues caused some delays beyond the best-case scenario of completing the work in nine months. Experiments at the reactor help the U.S. Navy’s nuclear-powered war fleet stay at sea longer, bolster NASA’s space exploration, and advance lifesaving medical treatments. The reactor also plays a key role in the effort to keep commercial nuclear power plants running longer and creating new and safer reactors to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The reactor is now going through readiness assessments, instrument calibrations and low-power system checks.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Federal authorities on Monday said they will not criminally charge Jason Van Dyke, the Chicago police officer convicted of murder in the 2014 shooting death of Black teenager Laquan McDonald. The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Chicago said in a news release that the decision was made after consulting with the McDonald family and that the “family was in agreement not to pursue a second prosecution.” According to the release, prosecuting Van Dyke on federal charges would have been much more difficult than it was to prosecute him in state court because the burden of proof is far higher. Federal prosecutors “would have to prove not only that Mr. Van Dyke acted with the deliberate and specific intent to do something the law forbids, but also that his actions were not the result of mistake, fear, negligence, or bad judgment,” the office said in the release. “It requires federal prosecutors to prove beyond a reasonable doubt what Mr. Van Dyke was thinking when he used deadly force, and that he knew such force was excessive.” Van Dyke, who was captured on video shooting the teenager 16 times, was convicted in Chicago in 2018 of second-degree murder and aggravated battery and sentenced to 81 months in state prison. The former officer served less than half that sentence before he was released from prison in February.\n\nIndiana\n\nCarmel: A priest who was “suspended from public ministry” last month is suing a man who came forward with allegations about the priest’s behavior. James De Oreo, who was an associate pastor at Our Lady of Mount Carmel Catholic Church, was suspended March 11 after allegations of “inappropriate conduct with a minor.” The priest filed a lawsuit April 4 against the man who wrote two letters in 2021 to the Diocese of Lafayette-in-Indiana about De Oreo’s behavior toward him when he was a teen attending St. Alphonsus Liguori Catholic Church in Zionsville. The man said he was considering becoming a priest, and De Oreo used his position of power to emotionally abuse, sexually harass and groom him for sexual abuse. This led to an eating disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder as well as “extreme emotional distress” from acts that his lawyer said were intentional and preventable. In the lawsuit, De Oreo disputed the man’s claims and said there was no “intentional infliction of emotional distress.” He said the man’s allegations could lead to “irreparable harm” that would prevent him from participating in parish ministry and doing his job. Diocese spokesperson Gabby Hlavek confirmed the diocese was aware of the De Oreo’s lawsuit but didn’t comment further.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A ride at an amusement park where an 11-year-old boy died last summer will not reopen this year, the park’s new owners said. Bill Lentz, general manager of Adventureland in Altoona, said officials have not determined if the Raging River ride will ever reopen. Michael Jaramillo died and his brother and father were injured July 3, 2021, after their raft overturned and trapped them in the water. Park owner Palace Entertainment has hired the ride’s original maker, Intamin Amusement Rides, to determine what would be needed to make the ride safe, Lentz said. That project could take several months, he said. Palace Entertainment, the U.S. subsidiary of Madrid-based Parques Reunidos, bought the almost 48-year-old theme park in December. Ryan Best, the attorney representing the Jaramillo family, of Marion, Iowa, said recently that his clients believe the ride should never be reopened. The Iowa Division of Labor, which licenses amusement park rides, required Adventureland to make several changes and receive approval from the ride’s manufacturer or a certified engineer to reopen the ride.\n\nKansas\n\nHutchinson: Under legislation signed Monday by Gov. Laura Kelly, fairgoers will be able to more widely consume adult beverages at the Kansas State Fair. The proposal, Senate Bill 2, will allow beer and wine to be consumed outside designated areas. The fairground’s current liquor policy confines drinking to the grandstands and certain beer gardens throughout the property. It will also pave the way for the sale of hard liquor. Fair officials have not yet determined if the policies will be in place for the 2022 edition of the fair, scheduled to take place Sept. 9-18, or if they will instead roll out next year. The policy was intended to help the fair recoup revenue lost after the 2020 event was canceled due to COVID-19. Legislative proponents of the bill also argued it was in line with what consumers were demanding from the event. “People wanted to have more wine and more outlets at the state fairground. They also wanted spirits,” Rep. Louis Ruiz, D-Kansas City, said on the floor of the Kansas House. “They wanted to walk around to look at animals ...with a daiquiri.” But the move was not without its critics, some of whom argued making liquor more readily accessible would harm the fair’s family-friendly nature. Some Wichita-area lawmakers pointed to the city’s vaunted Riverfest festival, which opted to expand liquor sales, dividing residents.\n\nKentucky\n\nBowling Green: The National Corvette Museum says it’s adding an education gallery that will feature artifacts and interactive technology to share the brand’s story. Construction of the 2,000-square-foot gallery is set to begin in late May, museum officials said. The gallery is scheduled to open late this year or in early 2023 at the Bowling Green-based museum. “This new gallery will educate, engage and entertain our guests,” said Sharon Brawner, the museum’s president and CEO. The gallery will provide a state-of-the-art educational experience geared toward the next generation of Corvette enthusiasts, the museum said. “The new education gallery will be designed for both children and adults to enjoy, featuring artifacts and interactive technology celebrating the unique story of Corvette,” said museum educator Deb Howard. The project was made possible through the generosity of donors Tim and Melanie McMichael of Gypsum, Colorado, the museum said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A proposal to let New Orleans adopt a set of gun control measures than are stronger than the state currently allows was overwhelmingly rejected Tuesday by a state House panel. The Criminal Justice Committee voted 9-1 against the measure by state Rep. Mandie Landry, D-New Orleans, despite calls for passage from a City Council member, a deputy chief of the police department and District Attorney Jason Williams. Among the specified laws the city would have been allowed to pass were the bill to become law: a requirement that loss or theft of firearms be reported to police, prohibition against openly carrying firearms at public events requiring government permits, and prohibition on carrying firearms where alcohol is being served. Backers of the bill said it would help fight increasing violent crime by helping prevent gun trafficking or the use of guns at large events where alcohol is consumed, in a city known for festivals and Bourbon Street nightlife. “At the end of the day, we’re asking this committee and the Legislature to allow New Orleans to carve out legislation that affects the unique problems that we have,” said City Council member Eugene Green. Gun control advocates said the laws the city sought to pass would be ineffective and slammed the bill as an attack on Second Amendment rights.\n\nMaine\n\nBar Harbor: The arrival of the first large cruise ship in two and a half years in Maine is another signal tourism is getting closer to pre-pandemic normalcy. Last year, more than 15.6 million visitors came to the state – a third more than made the trip the year before, at the start of the pandemic, officials said. But there were no large cruise ships until the arrival of the Norwegian Pearl in the waters off Bar Harbor. The ship dropped anchor in Frenchman Bay, and visitors were ferried to shore on tenders. “It’s exciting to see these ships and their passengers coming back to Maine,” said Sarah Flink, executive director of CruiseMaine. Cruise ships could restore some visitation. The number of visitors last year remained about a million below 2019, before the pandemic. Cruise ships made 409 port calls and brought 450,000 passengers in 2019. One positive sign from the 2021 tourism numbers is that spending soared. Spending grew 63.7% from 2020 and 20.3% from 2019.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A former small-city mayor who admitted to posting nude photos of his ex-girlfriend on Reddit will not have to spend time behind bars under a plea deal announced by the state prosecutor’s office on Monday. Former Cambridge Mayor Andrew Bradshaw pleaded guilty to five counts of distributing revenge porn online and was sentenced to a year and a day for each of the five counts, with all the incarceration time suspended. He also was sentenced to three years of supervised probation and fined $1,000 for each count. Bradshaw was ordered to pay $750 in restitution to the victim and to perform 100 hours of community service. The ex-mayor had faced a maximum penalty of two years’ incarceration and a $5,000 fine for each count. Bradshaw pleaded guilty to posting nude photos of a woman with whom he was once in a relationship after the relationship had ended. The woman contacted authorities in May after learning the photos were posted on Reddit. She told authorities she had sent the photos only to Bradshaw while they were in an intimate relationship, and she didn’t give him permission to redistribute them. Investigators discovered Bradshaw had made numerous separate public posts that contained at least 10 unique visual representations of the victim, many with language related to humiliation and degradation, the state prosecutor’s office said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A shooting at an MBTA station in the city left one person injured Monday, according to transit police. Officers were called to the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority’s Ruggles Station shortly after 6 p.m. on reports of shots fired. At an area where buses stop for passengers, officers found a man suffering from multiple gunshot wounds. The man was taken to a hospital with injuries that were considered serious but not life-threatening, police said. No arrests had been made in the shooting. Police said they were investigating and would continue to look for suspects. Suffolk County District Attorney Kevin Hayden denounced the shooting and said gun violence “is something that we’ve really got to lay a hold of and take care of.” “Every time there’s a shooting, there are multiple victims,” Hayden said, according to WCVB-TV. “There’s obviously the victim that’s shot, but there’s also the community at large.”\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state has reached a 19.3% recycling rate, an increase of 35.4% from prior to 2019, according to an analysis the state of Michigan released Monday ahead of Earth Day on Friday. Before 2019, the state estimated Michigan’s recycling rate, the rate at which recyclable materials are recycled from waste, was 14.25%. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy estimates the state now has a 35.4% recycling rate. Increasing access to recycling services has helped the state to increase recycling, EGLE Director Liesl Clark said at a news conference Monday. More than 75% of the state’s households have access to either curbside recycling bins or drop-off sites in their communities. The increase in recycling equals out to Michigan recycling 500,000 more tons of recyclable materials a year, according to EGLE. Since 2019, more than $460 million has been invested into technology for recycling and maintaining existing recycling infrastructure, Clark said, all in an effort to help Michigan reach its goals to fight climate change and reach a 45% recycling rate by 2030. This Thursday, the state will release a plan outlining a 30-year strategy to make Michigan a carbon neutral state by 2050. A rough draft of the plan was released earlier this year.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The Roseville School District has settled two federal lawsuits accusing a former second grade teacher of discriminating against Black students. The St. Paul Pioneer Press reports the district settled the cases privately, and terms were not disclosed. One case was settled last week and the other in January, according to court records. The lawsuits accused Geraldine Cook of making the Black students in her class sit apart from their peers in 2019. She allegedly grabbed a girl’s arm, tearing her shirt, and choked a boy after he gargled water and made him walk to the principal’s office with his hands behind his back. The mothers of the girl whose shirt was torn and the boy who was choked filed the lawsuits. Cook taught at Harambee Elementary, a year-round racial integration school. She resigned in December 2019.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: An assistant chief says the city’s police department is short-staffed, and recruitment and retention are big challenges. Joseph Wade of Jackson Police Department discussed staffing levels Monday during the City Council’s Public Safety Committee meeting, WLBT-TV reports. He said JPD is budgeted for 356 sworn officers but has 258. On the civilian side, JPD is budgeted for 199 employees and has 132. “I went to a leadership class in Ohio, and guess what? They’re having (retention issues),” he said. “It’s not a popular job right now.” JPD loses officers to smaller departments, where officers can earn comparable salaries but answer fewer calls, Wade said. He said the city needs to enforce a state law that would require departments to reimburse JPD for training costs of any officer it hires who has been with Jackson less than three years. Wade said JPD leaders appreciate the premium pay that the City Council approved for police department employees earlier this year. The assistant chief also suggested a signing bonus and a tuition reimbursement program for new officers. Capitol police officers, who work for the state Department of Public Safety, also patrol in parts of Jackson where state government buildings are located.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: Regal fritillary butterflies, which subsist on violets and stick to prairie habitats, are disappearing. “They’ve almost been entirely lost from the eastern U.S.,” Chris Barnhart, distinguished professor of biology at Missouri State University, said of the vulnerable insect species. One-third of Missouri used to be covered in tallgrass prairie. Where there’s a decent patch of prairie, regal fritillary butterflies can be seen in good numbers, Barnhart said. However, without extra help, Missouri may lose the “Queen of the Prairie” altogether. MSU and the Missouri Department of Conservation are two years deep into a project to examine the reproduction and survival of the butterflies, developing methods to raise them in captivity and reintroducing them to suitable sites. Missouri has some of the highest numbers of these butterflies, Barnhart said during a tour of MSU’s Temple Hall greenhouse. Fifteen million acres of tallgrass prairie once covered Missouri, said Francis Skalicky, MDC spokesman. “Today, 99% of Missouri’s tallgrass prairie habitat has disappeared, and a number of species that depend on plants found in this habitat have been negatively impacted by the state’s dwindling prairie acreage,” Skalicky said. The regal fritillary butterflies are considered “a species of concern” and at a S3 level of endangerment, Skalicky said.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: The board of trustees of the state’s largest school district has voted to allow students additional time to graduate after a public campaign by the family of a student with Down syndrome who otherwise would not have been allowed to attend her senior year with her classmates. Under the policy passed Monday by a 5-3 vote, any student who does not turn 20 before Sept. 10 will be able to enroll in classes at Billings high schools. For students receiving special education services, enrollment will continue as long as the student hasn’t turned 21 before the Sept. 10 deadline, The Billings Gazette reports. The family of Emily Pennington had urged the school district to take advantage of a law passed by the Legislature in 2021 that offered some state funding for students who are receiving special education services to continue attending school as long as they had not turned 21 before Sept. 10 and had not graduated. Schools are not required to participate. Emily repeated kindergarten because she had been dealing with numerous medical issues. She will turn 19 in July, which would have made her ineligible to attend school this fall under the old policy. After the school board declined to hear Emily’s request for a change in the age-out policy, Billings West students staged a brief walk-out in support.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Former U.S. Rep. Brad Ashford, a Democrat who served one term representing the state’s Omaha-centered district, died Tuesday morning. He was 72. Ashford’s family announced his death in a Facebook post, saying that “his death was peaceful though much too premature.” Just two months earlier, Ashford had revealed he was undergoing treatment for brain cancer. Ashford was a state senator from Omaha when he unseated longtime Republican incumbent Lee Terry to represent Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District. Ashford lost the seat two years later to current GOP Rep. Don Bacon. He sought the seat again in 2018 but lost the Democratic primary to Kara Eastman. In 2020, his wife, Ann Ferlic Ashford, announced her candidacy for the seat, but she also lost the primary to Eastman. Brad Ashford shook up the general election race by endorsing Bacon over Eastman. An attorney and lifelong Omaha resident, he began his political career in the 1980s as a Democrat but switched parties several times over the years and pitched himself as an independent-minded moderate. Ashford earned his bachelor’s degree from Colgate University in 1971 and his law degree from Creighton University in Omaha in 1974. He worked as an attorney for the Federal Highway Administration in 1974 before opening a private practice the next year. In the 1990s, he became co-owner of the Nebraska Clothing Company.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The Nevada office of the FBI has a new special agent in charge, with the announcement Monday that Spencer Evans will head the bureau’s Las Vegas field office. Evans has held various investigative and leadership positions since joining the FBI in 2004 as an agent in New Haven, Connecticut. His most recent post was as deputy assistant director in human resources at FBI Headquarters in Washington. In Las Vegas, Evans replaces Special Agent in Charge Aaron Rouse, who retired in February after 25 years with the bureau. Rouse arrived in the city in 2016 and headed the Nevada field office during the 2017 mass shooting on the Las Vegas Strip that killed 58 people and became the deadliest in modern U.S. history. Two additional deaths later were attributed to the shooting.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nMerrimack: A chemical company agreed Monday to providing drinking water to about 1,000 properties in the state that showed elevated levels of toxic industrial compounds associated with serious health conditions. The New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services and Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics announced the agreement for properties in the towns of Bedford, Hudson, Litchfield, Londonderry and Merrimack. It also provides a framework should additional properties be affected. “Ensuring safe drinking water is something we take very seriously,” state Attorney General John Formella said in a statement. “This agreement is an important step forward in a continuing, multi-faceted effort to ensure impacted New Hampshire residents have access to clean drinking water.” A spokesperson for Saint-Gobain didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The company, which bought the Merrimack plant from ChemFAB in 2000, initially believed it wasn’t emitting anything harmful. But the state said that changed in 2004 after the company installed more sophisticated technology and realized it was emitting the chemical. After the company alerted the state, DES determined Saint-Gobain was exceeding state air limits for the chemical, and the company agreed to significantly reduce emissions.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: The state’s robust sports betting market broke the $1 billion mark for the sixth time last month in terms of the amount of bets taken. But the news was bad in March for seven of the nine casinos that continued to lag behind their in-person gambling revenue levels from before the coronavirus pandemic hit, according to figures released Monday by state gambling regulators. The New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement reported the state’s casinos and three horse tracks that take sports bets handled over $1.12 billion worth of such wagers in March, aided by the March Madness college basketball tournament. Yet out of that total, only $66.4 million was kept as sports betting revenue by the casinos and tracks after paying off winning bets, third-party partners and other expenses. The casinos and tracks made $423.6 million in gambling and sports betting revenue in March, up nearly 18% from a year earlier. However, that comparison is flawed because in March 2021, Atlantic City’s casinos were still operating under state-imposed pandemic-related restrictions. Going back two years is also an invalid comparison because the casinos shut down in the middle of March 2020 as the pandemic originally surged.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is getting married, and Vice President Kamala Harris has been picked to officiate. The first-term Democratic governor made the announcement through her personal spokesman Tuesday, saying a small ceremony will be held May 21 in Washington, D.C. No other details about the upcoming ceremony were released. Lujan Grisham, who is running for reelection, will be tying the knot with fiancé Manny Cordova. The couple have been together about 10 years, and Cordova was at her side during an inaugural Mass in Santa Fe before her public swearing-in ceremony Jan. 1, 2019. “We’re delighted to celebrate our wedding in front of family and close friends,” Lujan Grisham and Cordova said in a joint statement. “Like so many New Mexicans, we’ve postponed family celebrations over the past two years during this pandemic. We feel fortunate to be with our loved ones in celebration of our marriage.” The couple initially planned to get married in 2021 but had not set a date, said Jared Leopold, a spokesman for Lujan Grisham. Both Lujan Grisham, 62, and Cordova, 66, were previously married and have adult children and grandchildren. Lujan Grisham was married to her first husband, Gregory Grisham, for more than 20 years until his death in 2004. The son of ranchers, Cordova grew up in a rural community south of Albuquerque. He owns an auto repair shop in Santa Fe.\n\nNew York\n\nBinghamton: About 100,000 customers were without power Tuesday morning in upstate New York as a late-season storm dumped a foot or more of heavy, wet snow on some high-elevation areas. In the Binghamton area, Broome County Executive Jason Garnar declared a state of emergency and issued a travel ban for nonessential workers. Gov. Kathy Hochul said in an interview on Binghamton radio station WNBF that listeners in the area should stay home if they could. “It was a very heavy snow. And as a result, the weight … is snapping these limbs, which is sad when you see your beautiful trees harmed like that,” Hochul said. “But it also can be dangerous for people walking on the streets or walking under power lines or if people are getting into their cars.” Some higher-elevation areas of the Southern Tier had up to 14 inches of snow, though accumulations were less for lower elevations, according to the National Weather Service in Binghamton. “That is pretty typical for a for a late-season storm; you’re going to have quite a bit of elevation dependency,” said meteorologist Bryan Greenblatt. Power outages stretched from the Southern Tier to the Adirondack Mountains, which was forecast to get up to a foot of snow by Tuesday night.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: Buncombe County jail detainees have spent up to a week in group holding areas with no blankets, constant light, cold temperatures, and nowhere to sleep but hard surfaces, such as concrete floors, according to several people who spent time behind bars in the local facility. “There’s no cots; they don’t give you a blanket. Everyone is in flip-flops without socks. And all the drunk tanks were full. There’s 10 of you in there. And it’s all concrete,” said Eric Stimson, who said he spent five days trying to find ways to sleep and stay warm in a group cell with an overflowing toilet before being moved to a regular cell for the remainder of his 16-day DUI sentence in January. The harsh conditions were detailed by three detainees and confirmed by the Buncombe County chief public defender. They appear to represent direct violations of state rules meant to protect those in the custody of the jail, most of whom have not been convicted of crimes of which they are charged and are awaiting their day in court. Spokespeople for Sheriff Quentin Miller, who is responsible for managing the jail, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. In an attempt to block out light to sleep and find some comfort, detainees took to stuffing their court papers behind COVID-19 masks to use as eye shields, Stimson said, adding that they would stack their slippers to create something like a pillow. As far as COVID-19 infection concerns go, “if you didn’t have COVID coming in, you’ve got it now,” he said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMinot: The future of Minot State University’s sports bubble is up in the air after a blizzard last week caused it to collapse. The university was forced to cancel all the activities that were scheduled in the bubble, which is on the grounds of the athletic facility. The bubble has been used as a fallback location for softball games when weather is poor, Minot Daily News reports. And MSU planned to hold a spring football game in the bubble, which is also used for various sports practices. The athletic staff is meeting this week to begin rescheduling and searching for other places to practice. Athletic director Andy Carter said the university is waiting for the company that supplied the bubble in 2016 to send representatives to assess the damage and how much it would cost to repair it. “It’s covered in snow now,” he said. “You can’t even really get to it right now.” He said a considerable amount of sporting equipment had been stored in the bubble. “It could be a big issue. We don’t even know because we can’t see it. So we don’t know if it’s damaged or it’s just sitting there under the tarp,” he said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A judge has blocked early enforcement of an abortion law signed by Gov. Mike DeWine in December that included additional licensing requirements challenged by the ACLU and Planned Parenthood as unnecessarily onerous. Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge Alison Hatheway’s ruling Friday blocked restrictions imposed on two southwest Ohio clinics by the Ohio Department of Health that came before June 21. That date ends a 90-period for compliance that followed its original effective date of March 23. Hatheway issued a temporary restraining order against the law March 2, before it could take effect. The stated goal of the bill was to impose criminal penalties on doctors who fail to give medical care in the extremely rare circumstance of a baby born alive following an abortion attempt. However, provisions were added to the legislation that prevented abortion providers from contracting with backup physicians who teach at or contract with public medical schools. Abortion rights groups said eliminating such a broad swath of physicians to serve as their backups could lead to two clinics in southwest Ohio being closed. The lawsuit argued the requirements would almost certainly have shuttered Women’s Med in Dayton and Planned Parenthood of Southwest Ohio in suburban Cincinnati.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt signed legislation Monday to allow law enforcement to keep from the public audio or video recordings showing an officer’s line-of-duty death. The measure was drafted after Tulsa police were required under Oklahoma law to release a video of a suspect shooting two officers, one of whom later died. A jury trial began Monday for the man accused of the killing. “This bill is about protecting the dignity not only of our fallen heroes but their fellow officers and surviving family members who can be retraumatized by these recordings,” state Sen. John Haste, R-Broken Arrow, said in a statement. “It can also make it more difficult to seat a jury in such cases.” The bill prohibits the public release of such videos unless a judge determines the public interest outweighs the reason for denial. It also authorizes a deceased officer’s family members to view the audio or video. Prosecutors and defense attorneys retain the right to use such videos in legal proceedings under the new law.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Gov. Kate Brown has signed a bill into law that phases out the state’s agricultural overtime pay exemption. The Capital Press reports Brown wrote in a letter Friday to Senate President Peter Courtney and Speaker of the House Dan Rayfield that she views the bill as an important step in the right direction to correct a historic wrong. “This policy will make a significant difference in the lives of farmworkers and their families,” Brown wrote. The new law establishes overtime pay requirements for agricultural workers in Oregon after 40 hours per week, with the requirements phased in over five years starting in 2023. Under the law, farmworkers will be owed time-and-a-half overtime wages after 55 weekly hours of work next year, after 48 hours of work in 2025-2026 and then after 40 hours per week beginning in 2027. Most farmers will be eligible for one of three tiers of tax credits, depending on how many people they employ. Tax credits will incrementally decline between 2023 and 2028 and then will end or be reevaluated by lawmakers. Brown wrote that the law may need to be changed and improved over time, so she said it’s important that conversation about the issue continue.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nDents Run: The FBI might not have found any Civil War-era gold at a remote woodland site, but it definitely has records of the agency’s 2018 dig and will soon have to turn them over to a father-son pair of treasure hunters. A federal judge has ordered the FBI to speed up the release of records about the search for the legendary gold, ruling Monday in favor of Finders Keepers, the treasure hunting outfit that led FBI agents to the remote site. The group accuses the Justice Department of slow-walking their request for information. The FBI must turn over 1,000 pages of records per month, starting in 30 days, and the first batch of records must include a key report sought by Finders Keepers, U.S. District Judge Amit P. Mehta ordered. The ruling came four months after Finders Keepers sued the Justice Department over its failure to produce records on the FBI’s search. The FBI has long insisted its March 2018 dig came up empty, but Finders Keepers says the government has acted suspiciously throughout the four-year saga. Finders Keepers’ owners, the father-son duo of Dennis and Kem Parada, spent years looking for the fabled 1863 shipment of Union gold that was supposedly lost or stolen on its way to the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia. The pair eventually led the FBI to the remote site, where the agency took over.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The city’s newly formed reparations commission is considering what form payments might take and looking to other cities for inspiration. In a meeting Monday, Silas Pinto, who is serving as Providence’s first-ever director of diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging, noted that reparations are being considered and implemented in a dozen other cities, including Boston and Amherst, Massachusetts. So far, housing and land ownership comprise one of the largest spending categories for cities investing in reparations. Those funds are not paid to individuals but toward renovations and down payments, for example. Direct cash payments, tuition and scholarships have also been popular investments. Pinto said it’s evident that cities are “viewing reparations work really through the lens of closing the racial wealth gap,” and “it’s going to come down to issues around land ownership, around how are we supporting our minority-owned businesses, and how are we helping individuals?” However, as Providence is aiming to use $15 million in federal pandemic relief, it will need to comply with rules on how those funds should be spent.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Five University of South Carolina trustees won’t be allowed to run for reelection next month after some powerful lawmakers felt they were responsible for hiring a president who crudely criticized the school, interfered in daily school affairs and left in less than two years. The legislative board that screens university trustees is refusing to send them to a May 4 election by the General Assembly at which more than a dozen other trustees for universities across the state will be elected. The decision comes as the state Senate prepares to review a bill that passed the House earlier this month, the day after it was proposed, that would fire all current trustees at the end of June 2023 and redraw their districts, cutting the board from 20 members to 13. Trustees kicked off the board could run for the new seats. The University of South Carolina trustees the College and University Trustee Screening Commission refused to allow to run for reelection to a new four-year term are board chairman C. Dorn Smith as well as trustees Thad Westbrook, C. Edward Floyd, John von Lehe and Charles Williams. The trustees will be allowed to remain until either the board is restructured or the screening board takes further action.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A deadline for Gov. Kristi Noem to respond to a pair of ethics complaints levied again her last year has passed. But neither Noem nor the panel of retired judges vetting whether the Republican governor misused state airplanes for personal use and improperly interfered in a state certification program in which her daughter was enrolled will say whether a response was submitted by Friday’s deadline. The South Dakota Government Accountability Board is scheduled to revisit both complaints during its next meeting at 10 a.m. May 2 in Sioux Falls. But because the confidential nature of the board and the complaints it examines, few other details are known. Assistant Attorney General Katie Mallery, who serves as the board’s liaison, said Tuesday that the April 15 deadline for the subject of the complaints to respond remained in place, though she declined to say whether any response or responses were received by the board. Created in 2017 by the Legislature, the South Dakota Government Accountability investigates complaints against state officials. The majority of its work is done behind closed doors. Considering complaints in secret, GAB is by law required to keep any complaints and related information it receives confidential throughout its proceedings.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Republican legislators passed legislation Monday to make camping on public property a misdemeanor crime, which critics say effectively criminalizes homelessness. Under HB978, a person who camps on the shoulder, right-of-way, bridge, overpass or underpass of a state or interstate highway could face a misdemeanor offense and a $50 fine or community service requirement. The legislation cleared the state Senate last week after a lengthy debate and now goes to Gov. Bill Lee’s desk. Sponsors Sen. Paul Bailey, R-Sparta, and Rep. Ryan Williams, R-Cookeville, have defended the bill as a tool local law enforcement could use to address homelessness. Rep. Antonio Parkinson, D-Memphis, said he experienced homelessness multiple times as a child and criticized the legislation, calling for a more “compassionate” approach. Sen. Frank Niceley, R-Strawberry Plains, drew widespread criticism last week for meandering comments tenuously connecting Adolf Hitler to the legislation. Niceley said Hitler at one point lived on the streets and used the experience as a “way to connect with the masses.” “People can come out of these camps and have a very productive life, or in Hitler’s case, a very unproductive life,” Niceley said. Rep. Gloria Johnson, D-Nashville, called the comments “embarrassing” to Tennessee.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Some Republicans are pushing state leaders to declare an “invasion” at the Mexican border in response to an increase in migrant border crossings, allowing Texas to enforce federal immigration policies, according to some interpretations of the U.S. Constitution. Rep. Matt Krause, R-Fort Worth, chair of the House Committee on General Investigating, has asked state Attorney General Ken Paxton for a legal opinion on “whether the federal government has failed to uphold its obligations to protect Texas from invasion under article IV section 4 of the United States Constitution, and whether Texas has the sovereign power to defend itself from invasion.” Paxton’s opinion would be nonbinding, but his answer could add ammunition to a push from conservative groups for states bordering Mexico to use a formal declaration of an “invasion” to justify allowing state authorities to deport migrants suspected of crossing the border illegally. The effort comes as Republicans, including Gov. Greg Abbott, have continued to criticize the Biden administration for not doing enough to stem the flow of illegal immigration and as federal authorities prepare to end a Trump-era public health mandate that allowed for the immediate expulsion of migrants.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Huge numbers of Washington County students started eating breakfast and lunch at school last year when pandemic-related federal waivers made it possible for schools to offer free meals to all students. Now, the program that made those free meals possible is ending, and some hunger advocates are worried that children who benefited from the program could go back to being hungry. The Seamless Summer Option program had allowed any Washington County School District student to receive two free meals per day, regardless of status. When the COVID-19 pandemic began, school officials in Washington County and across the U.S. were concerned for students’ well-being and whether they would find enough food to eat. The U.S. Department of Agriculture set aside money to help schools offer free meals on a temporary basis. With the expiration of the federal waivers, as well as the SSO program, local schools will go back to offering free or reduced-price meals only to students who qualify under household income guidelines. With no limits on who could get their meals for free, the district saw large increases in the number of students who ate at school. In September 2020, the district provided 1,842 breakfasts and 10,712 lunches a day on average. By March 2022, those figures had jumped to 4,531 and 16,166.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: After a failed attempt to pass a plan to regulate short-term rentals, city councilors have decided to begin the process again in an attempt to reach a compromise. City officials and councilors agree that short-term rentals are contributing to the housing shortage. The ongoing argument lies in how to regulate the housing that is commonly rented through sites like Airbnb and VRBO. A new version of the ordinance that will be considered in the City Council’s ordinance committee would allow for short-term rentals to be located in detached homes, accessory dwelling units, duplexes and homes with three to four units as long as they are on the same lot as the host’s primary residence. Hosts could also rent their own home out to guests. The exceptions to the necessity for owner-occupancy would be seasonal homes and units in a multi-unit building where one unit is rented out at an affordable rate to a long-term tenant. A previous version of the ordinance that Mayor Miro Weinberger vetoed would have limited short-term rentals to bedrooms within a host’s home with few exceptions. The prior proposal would have stopped people from creating short-term rentals out of independent units on their property such as detached houses, carriage houses and units in an owner-occupied multi-unit home.The ordinance committee will bring a new proposal for regulating short-term rentals to council by June 1.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The father of a journalist fatally shot during a live broadcast in 2015 has conceded that he failed to make the ballot in the Democratic nomination contest for the 5th Congressional District. Andy Parker, who announced in January that he would seek to unseat incumbent GOP Rep. Bob Good, said in a statement Monday that he would instead throw his support to Democratic nominee Josh Throneburg. “I was looking forward to a spirited primary and campaign against Good this fall, but to my great disappointment our campaign did not meet the technical requirements to be on the primary ballot. I want to thank the thousands of Virginians and supporters across America who stood with me,” Parker said. Since the death of daughter Alison, a 24-year-old reporter at Roanoke’s WDBJ-TV who was killed by a former colleague during an interview, Parker has pushed for gun-control measures. He’s also battled with Facebook over its allowing the video of his daughter’s slaying to circulate. Parker’s campaign told WDBJ last week that it was reviewing its petition signatures after being informed that the 5th District Committee was able to verify only 937 of the 1,000 required. Alison Parker’s death also prompted her boyfriend, WDBJ anchor Chris Hurst, to run for the General Assembly in 2017. The Democrat served two terms in the House of Delegates before being unseated by a Republican last November.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected Klickitat County’s claim to a portion of the Yakama Indian Reservation, likely ending a dispute that has raged for more than a century. The court denied the county’s appeal without comment. Klickitat County had argued that 121,465 acres in the southwestern portion of the reservation, including the eastern half of Mount Adams and the Glenwood Valley, were not actually included when the reservation was created. “The Supreme Court’s decision once again validates the continuing strength of our treaty rights under the United States Constitution,” said Yakama Tribal Council Chairman Delano Saluskin. “The Yakama Nation will never compromise when our treaty is at stake.” The dispute involved ambiguous language in the tribe’s Treaty of 1855 with the U.S. government. Territorial Gov. Isaac Stevens, who drafted the treaty, wrote that the reservation’s southwestern border passed “south and east of Mount Adams, to the spur whence flows the waters of the Klickatat and Pisco rivers.” The tribe said that no such spur existed and that the Yakama Nation had always understood that Mount Adams and land known as Tract D was reservation land. That position was affirmed by the Indian Claims Commission in 1966, by an executive order by President Richard Nixon in 1972, by federal surveyors in 1982 and by numerous earlier court cases.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nGlen Jean: New River Gorge National Park and Preserve is offering special events this week to celebrate National Park Week. The park is uploading its museum collection online. Information and images give details about the prehistoric and industrial past of the communities in the area. Some of the more than 5,000 items include a miner’s belt designed for self-rescue, a fossil from a time when the entire gorge was an underwater home to marine life and a Native American hammerstone used to prepare food hundreds of years ago. On Wednesday, the public can watch Cultural Resource Program Manager David Fuerst clean a 1942 mural that depicts early 20th-century coal miners. The park hopes to restore the painting to its appearance 80 years ago. The mural demonstration leads up to the opening Friday of the Smithsonian Institution’s “Crossroads: Change in Rural America” exhibit at the historic Cottle Mountainair Hotel in Mount Hope. The exhibit runs through May 30. Winning art for the Youth Arts in the Parks Appalachian Spring Wildflower Art Contest will continue to be displayed at Tamarack Marketplace and online at nps.gov/neri/youth-arts-in-the-parks.htm.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The brother of former first lady Michelle Obama and his wife are suing a private school alleging it refused to allow their two sons to reenroll after they voiced concerns that racism and inappropriate conduct at the school had not been satisfactorily addressed. In a civil lawsuit filed in Milwaukee County Circuit Court, Craig and Kelly Robinson accuse University School of Milwaukee of terminating their 9- and 11-year-old sons’ reenrollment contracts for the 2021-2022 school year after the couple complained that teachers treated students of color and socioeconomically underrepresented students unfairly. According to the lawsuit filed Monday, the school failed to provide the supportive and inclusive learning environment it had promised in its enrollment contracts with the Robinsons. The boys had attended the pre-K-12 school for about five years, the Robinsons said Tuesday in an interview with the Associated Press. The lawsuit seeks unspecified monetary damages and a trial by jury. USM said in a statement that the enrollment decision had nothing to do with their complaints of inequity or discrimination. The independent school, with a campus that stretches from Milwaukee to the nearby suburb of River Hills, enrolls about 1,100 students every year.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Federal officials are including only about two-thirds the previously expected number of Wyoming sites for lease for oil and gas exploration this summer, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. The first such lease sale of President Joe Biden’s administration will list 129 tracts across the state, covering more than 130,000 acres, according to the paper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2022/12/29/delaware-development-the-projects-to-watch-entering-2023/69636825007/", "title": "Delaware development: The projects to watch entering 2023", "text": "Among the dominant development storylines in Delaware entering next year is the continued proliferation of industrial space across the state.\n\nOf the more than 30 projects on our list to watch in 2023 and future years, about a third involve a manufacturing or warehousing element.

In Bethany Beach, officials have threatened a fine of up to $200 fine for anyone breaking those rules.\n\n“That’s piggy-backing off the state,” said Bethany Beach Town Manager Cliff Graviet, pointing to state code language that allows for law enforcement to issue fines if the governor's emergency orders are broken.

The idea was borne out of a monthly book club for local writers, readers, mothers and teachers of different races, ethnicities and gender identities. Organizers said that living room gathering turned into a healing space grounded in a commitment to resist oppression, a goal that’s now spreading to a community book shop called 1977 Books. Described as “an abolitionist libreria, library and community space,” the shop plans to open next month, featuring poetry, memoirs and children’s books with an emphasis on authors who are queer, transgender, indigenous or people of color. The nonfiction offerings will include books on movement and organizing, progressive education and black feminist books. A community library inside will feature free used books, magazines, art and more.\n\nAlaska\n\nFairbanks: A group of advocates is petitioning for an end to wolf hunting in a national park boundary area. The Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reports the group is concerned about a decrease in the number of wolf sightings in part of Denali National Park. The group sent petitions about the Denali Park Road area to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game commissioner and the state Board of Game. Members say hunting is having an impact on the number of wolves in packs that roam near the road corridor. The National Park Service has submitted its own proposal to the game board requesting a partial closure to wolf hunting. Wolf hunting in the area is scheduled to begin Aug. 10, while trapping season is scheduled to open Nov. 1.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Environmental groups have asked a judge to stop a plan to replace existing vehicle barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border in southern Arizona. The groups argue the Trump administration unlawfully waived dozens of laws as part of the project that will ultimately damage wildlife habitat. The injunction request filed Tuesday seeks to halt work on 68 miles of replacement barriers at Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge and San Pedro National Conservation Area before the start of construction Aug. 21. A phone call seeking comment from the Department of Homeland Security on the request wasn’t immediately returned. The injunction request was made in Washington as part of a lawsuit challenging the waivers granted for the Arizona portion of Trump’s border wall efforts.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state should have harsher penalties for those who commit crimes against others because of their race, ethnicity or religion, the governor said Tuesday, following two mass shootings including one in Texas being investigated as a possible hate crime. Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he wants to end Arkansas’ distinction as one of only a handful of states without a hate crimes law. Though he didn’t specifically mention them in his remarks to the Arkansas Sheriffs Association at a meeting in Rogers, Hutchinson later told reporters he would also support the introduction of enhanced penalties for those guilty of targeting someone because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. “People should not be targeted for who they are,” Hutchinson said. He said he wants to build broad support for the measure before bringing it before the Legislature.\n\nCalifornia\n\nManhattan Beach: A Southern California seaside community is in an uproar after a home was given a new paint job featuring two huge emoji on a bright pink background. Manhattan Beach residents railed against the makeover during a City Council meeting Tuesday night, citing problems with spectators. One speaker called the paint job graffiti, and another said it was an attack on neighbors. Both bright yellow emoji are cross-eyed and have distinctly big eyelashes. One has a goofy expression with its tongue hanging out. The other has its mouth zippered shut. The new paint job appeared after neighbors reported the home was being used for short-term rentals and the homeowner was fined $4,000. Owner Kathryn Kidd told KABC-TV she didn’t realize short-term rentals weren’t allowed and denies the redecoration is retaliation.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Some teenagers in this state where marijuana is legal for adults are shifting away from smoking in favor of edible cannabis products, a study released Monday shows. About 78% of the Colorado high school students who reported consuming marijuana in 2017 said they usually smoked it, down from 87% two years earlier. The number of teens who usually consumed edibles climbed to about 10% from 2% in the same period, while the number of users dabbing increased to about 7.5% from 4%. Research about the way young people consume marijuana products is still limited, and the study’s lead author said the data could provide valuable insight for public health researchers and regulators. The study published Monday in JAMA Pediatrics is based on high schoolers’ responses to Colorado’s biennial health survey in 2015 and 2017.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHamden: Authorities say the person responsible for cutting down a distinctive tree has been arrested. The New Haven-based Regional Water Authority announced the arrest Tuesday. No name was released. The authority said the Door Tree in Hamden, a 200-year-old white oak that grew in a “distinctive doorway-like arch,” had been cut down with a chain saw July 18. The Regional Water Authority owns the land where the tree stood. David Johnson, Hamden’s municipal historian and a member of the Hamden Historical Society, which first discovered the tree had been felled, called it a “terrible act of thoughtless vandalism.” The historical society says the tree was first photographed in 1898 and was featured in works including Ripley’s “Believe It or Not.”\n\nDelaware\n\nNewark: For one year, the University of Delaware reigned as the country’s top party school. But this year, the school known for its “super parties” that often drew complaints from locals has been dethroned. On the Princeton Review’s annual list of the top party schools, UD fell behind top-ranked Syracuse University and the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa. UD had risen to the top spot on the party school list last year after placing No. 6 in 2017 and No. 12 in 2016. Throughout the school year, some UD students embraced the designation, with the No. 1 moniker becoming an often-heard rallying cry during “dages” – daytime parties – and bar crawls alike. UD’s off-campus party scene has drawn ire from longtime Newark residents in the past, so much so that in March, the City Council passed a law to curb what it called “unruly social gatherings.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Thousands of D.C. residents came out Tuesday night to promote positivity on the same day the city marked a grim milestone. The Metropolitan Police Department announced Tuesday afternoon that D.C. recorded its 100th homicide in 2019 on Monday night, WUSA-TV reports. As some MPD officers worked to solve that case, other members of the department were busy getting to know locals during National Night Out, an annual event that works to improve the relationship between police officers and the communities they serve. MPD celebrated National Night Out at several different locations across the city with music, games and food. So far, D.C. has experienced seven more murders in 2019 than it had this same time last year.\n\nFlorida\n\nNaples: In June, a massive plume of Saharan dust made its way from Africa to the Sunshine State, bringing hazy skies and vibrant sunsets while warding off storms. But months after touching down, this dust could have an adverse effect. According to researchers, this year’s iron-rich Saharan dust is setting up the right conditions for the start of a red tide bloom. “It doesn’t necessarily mean there will be one, but the odds are fairly good,” says Cynthia Heil, director of Mote Marine Laboratory’s Red Tide Institute. Saharan dust gets kicked up into the upper atmosphere by storms in the late spring or early summer, Heil says, and the dust rides the trade winds across the Atlantic Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico and other places. But it’s the iron in the dust that’s key. When deposited in open water, the iron essentially dissolves off of the dust, she says. And that iron feeds the algae that compose the red tide.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A former gubernatorial candidate who campaigned in a “deportation bus” and later pleaded guilty to falsely reporting that computer servers were stolen from his office is apologizing for his chaotic and combative campaign. Republican ex-state Sen. Michael Williams’ Facebook post to supporters Tuesday seemed to lay much of the blame for missteps on unnamed campaign advisers, writing that he was led astray by “pride, ego and bad advice.” Williams’ failed bid was marked by strong loyalty to President Donald Trump and a series of publicity stunts including campaigning in a “deportation bus” in an Atlanta-area community known for welcoming foreign refugees. In his apology, Williams said he let his campaign become “solely about doing whatever needed to be done in order to create headlines to build name ID.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: State officials say a fungal disease local to this island state has been discovered on Oahu for the first time. The Star-Advertiser reports the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources found the disease known as rapid ohia death on a dead ohia tree near schools in Honolulu. Wildlife officials say the type of rapid ohia death found is the less aggressive of two types associated with the disease. Officials say the more aggressive fungus was responsible for killing 90% of the trees on the Big Island. Officials say the department has plans to use air and ground surveys to determine how widespread it is. Wildlife officials say there is no known cure for the fungus, and it can be spread in soil that sticks to footwear, gear and tires.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Concerns about security at fairs and festivals across the state have been heightened in the wake of three recent mass shootings elsewhere that left 34 people dead and dozens more wounded. Idaho law says no city or county can stop people from carrying guns on public property, which includes county-owned fairgrounds. Elizabeth Duncan with Ada County says there will be no signs prohibiting firearms from being carried during the Western Idaho Fair, which starts this month. Last month Canyon County Fair officials initially tried to stop Idaho Second Amendment Alliance President Greg Pruett from bringing a handgun into that fair, but they eventually relented after an argument.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A Southern rock band whose logo features the Confederate flag was booked for the DuQuoin State Fair for two months before Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s staff learned of the gig and abruptly canceled it. Emails and text messages obtained by the Associated Press show that Confederate Railroad’s Aug. 27 appearance was canceled by the Agriculture Department just a day after the fair’s lineup was announced June 17. Pritzker’s office says it has an unwritten policy against using tax money to support emblems representing hate or racism. A $7,500 contract was signed in mid-April. A political blogger asked a Pritzker spokeswoman June 17 whether it was appropriate. The contract was voided the next day. Confederate Railroad frontman Danny Shirley said in an email that the name was never intended “as a political or racial statement.”\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette: A second-grader’s plea to Mayor John Dennis has yielded a benefit for area turtles. After Jack Wietbrock, 8, and brother Teddy helped a turtle find its way from the middle of Cherry Lane to the side of the road last month, Jack became concerned about the plight of other such reptiles. “We were able to save that baby, but we had a couple of times that were some not-so-great moments of seeing turtles on the side of the road,” mom Michelle Wietbrock says. “Jack said, ‘Maybe we should send a letter to the mayor.’ ” That night, he wrote: “Dear Mayor Dennis, There are turtles crossing the road and they need our help. Can you please put up a turtle crossing sign?” On Tuesday morning, Dennis summoned Jack and his family to West Lafayette’s weekly board of works meeting and announced that he’d had the street department make the warnings “to help our turtle population.”\n\nIowa\n\nOrange City: A religious activist accused of burning four LGBTQ children’s books that he checked out of a library has been convicted of criminal mischief and fined. Sioux County Attorney Thomas Kunstle says 63-year-old Paul Robert Dorr, of Ocheyedan, was found guilty of the misdemeanor Tuesday and ordered to pay $125 in fines and court costs. Dorr posted a video to Facebook in October in which he denounced the Orange City library for having the books and threw them into a burning barrel. Dorr had fought to have the charge dismissed, saying he was singled out for prosecution because of his anti-gay message. A judge rejected his argument in July, saying the only message being sent to him was “that he cannot burn books that do not belong to him.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Officials with the Topeka Rescue Mission say the organization could close next month if new funding isn’t found. Leaders said in a statement Monday that the mission is facing a $180,000 shortfall each month. It will close all its shelters and end all services if new funding isn’t found by Sept. 15. WIBW reports Mission leaders say they’ve already made money-saving moves, including announcing last week that the TRM Thrift Store would close soon. The mission provides shelter for an average of 250 people each night and provides hundreds of meals every day. TRM started in 1953 as a small room providing shelter and food to homeless men. It has expanded over the years to include shelters for women and families and to provide education, care and programs for children.\n\nKentucky\n\nElizabethtown: A memorial is being planned in central Kentucky to honor veterans of the Revolutionary War. John Humphries, president of the Colonel John Hardin chapter of the Sons of the American Revolution, told The News Enterprise that his group is working with the Daughters of the American Revolution and the City of Elizabethtown on the idea for an 8-foot-tall granite obelisk that would honor about 140 Revolutionary War veterans who settled in Hardin County. He says about $25,000 will need to be raised for the memorial, which is proposed to be at Elizabethtown’s Freeman Lake Park near the Vietnam War monument. He said he got the idea after seeing such memorials in other communities, which made him think Hardin County should have one too.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A second ex-police officer in the city has taken a plea deal in a case where the officers allegedly beat a Hispanic man and called him a “fake American.” WDSU-TV reports Spencer Sutton pleaded no contest Wednesday to disturbing the peace. He had originally been charged with battery. He received a suspended 10-day sentence and agreed to pay $5,000 to the victim, Jorge Gomez, who was beaten unconscious. John Galman, the other officer in the case, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor battery in February. Galman received a 30-day suspended sentence and a year’s probation. Gomez, who was born in the United States, raised in Honduras and served in the U.S. Army, is suing the city. A police report says Galman claimed Gomez was “stealing valor” by wearing a military camouflage-style outfit.\n\nMaine\n\nBangor: Acadia National Park is saddled with hundreds of deferred maintenance projects that officials say will cost an estimated $65.8 million the park doesn’t have. The Bangor Daily News reports that advocates and supporters have long been concerned that deteriorating roads and buildings at the park could result in fewer visitors. Surrounding communities rely heavily on tourist dollars from parkgoers. The National Park Service reports that Acadia reached its highest visitation levels ever last year, with more than 3.5 million visitors who spent an estimated $387 million in area towns. Maine representatives are supporting two congressional bills that would provide additional funding for $11 billion worth of backlogged maintenance projects at parks across the country.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is dredging the city’s inlet. Rep. Andy Harris announced that a dredge vessel arrived Tuesday. The vessel was scheduled to dredge for five days over the coming week, starting Wednesday. The dredging is being done to address sediment accumulation in an important navigation channel used by commercial fisherman and recreational boaters. Harris said the fishing and maritime industry is critical to the local economy and community, and the dredging is a high priority.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Three local hospitals have teamed up to pledge $3 million over three years to help low-income families stay in their homes. Officials at Boston Medical Center, Boston Children’s Hospital, and Brigham and Women’s Hospital say the Innovative Stable Housing Initiative’s first $1.5 million is slated for families struggling with unstable housing, including those behind on rent and at risk of eviction. The hospitals are required to devote money to community initiatives as a condition of state approval for large construction projects at their campuses. The hospitals decided to focus on housing. Dr. Megan Sandel, a pediatrician at Boston Medical Center’s Grow Clinic, which treats children, tells The Boston Globe research has shown that children, in particular, face health issues and developmental delays if they lack a safe and stable home.\n\nMichigan\n\nManistee: A federal grant of $700,000 will help a Native American tribe based in the state to build a new food distribution center. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development awarded the grant to the Little River Band of Ottawa Indians. The structure will be located next to the tribe’s existing food building in Manistee. Tribal leader Larry Romanelli tells WWTV/WWUP-TV the project will help increase the number of people served. The program already has seen a big jump in demand over the past year. The target date for completion is August 2020. The funding was included in $63 million divided among 85 Native American communities around the U.S. to improve housing conditions and stimulate community development.\n\nMinnesota\n\nRedwood Falls: Gov. Tim Walz says he wants farmers to know his administration is taking steps to ease their financial worries during the U.S. trade war with China. Walz headed to the annual FarmFest near Redwood Falls on Tuesday. The Democratic governor intends to use the giant farm expo to get a better idea of the challenges facing Minnesota’s farmers. But Walz cautions that trade policy “comes through the executive branch through the president.” President Donald Trump recently escalated the trade war with China. Minnesota Public Radio News reports Walz told an audience at FarmFest that he wants the state’s two dozen state agencies to work together to meet the needs of rural Minnesota. Walz is planning for a likely trade trip to Japan in September with the Midwest Governors Association.\n\nMississippi\n\nMorton: U.S. immigration officials raided several food processing plants in the state Wednesday, part of a large-scale operation carried out by President Donald Trump’s administration. The raids came hours before Trump was to visit El Paso, Texas, to offer sympathy to the majority-Latino border city where a man linked to an online screed about a “Hispanic invasion” was charged in a shooting that left 22 people dead. Workers filled three buses at a Koch Foods Inc. plant in tiny Morton. About 70 family, friends and residents waved goodbye and shouted, “Let them go! Let them go!” Later, two more buses arrived. A tearful 13-year-old boy whose parents are from Guatemala waved goodbye to his mother, a Koch worker, as he stood beside his father. Some employees tried to flee but were captured in the parking lot. Workers who were confirmed to have legal status were allowed to leave the plant after having their trunks searched.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: The new-and-improved History Museum on the Square opens this week after five years of planning and an investment of over $12million. Doors open to the public at 9 a.m. Thursday. And with its grand opening just around the corner, the museum recently announced it had received a special donation: the neon sign that hung outside Graham’s Rib Station. The sign was donated by Elaine Graham Estes, the daughter of James and Zelma Graham, who opened the iconic diner in 1932. They went to the bank and cleaned out their savings to purchase food and supplies for the opening. A few days later, the stock market crashed, and the banks closed, leaving most everyone else broke but allowing them to survive the Great Depression. “They were just lucky,” Estes said in 2018. “They didn’t know the banks were going to close.”\n\nMontana\n\nSuperior: A man is facing an assault charge after authorities say someone saw him throw a 13-year-old boy to the ground because the teenager didn’t remove his hat when the national anthem was played at a rodeo. The boy was taken to a hospital, but details about his condition were not released. The witness, Taylor Hennick, told the Missoulian she was at the rodeo Saturday when she heard a “pop” and saw the boy on the ground, bleeding from his ears. The assailant justified his actions by saying the boy “was disrespecting the national anthem, so he had every right to do that,” Hennick said. Curt James Brockway, 39, of Superior, Montana, made an initial court appearance Monday on a charge of assault on a minor. Prosecutors recommended his bail be set at $100,000. Brockway is a registered violent offender after being convicted of a 2010 charge of assault with a weapon.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Construction has begun on a free lodging facility for families of sick or injured Nebraska and western Iowa veterans being treated at the veterans hospital in Omaha. The Omaha World-Herald reports the $8 million Fisher House will include 16 hotel-style suites at a site near the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center. It is funded by the Fisher House Foundation with local donations and will be given to the VA when complete to operate as a federal building. It is expected to open in late 2020. There are more than 80 Fisher Houses at military and veterans hospitals around the United States, as well as two in Europe. The program was begun in 1990 by philanthropist and real estate developer Zachary Fisher.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Facebook has relaunched the globe-grabbing event called “Storm Area 51” that gathered more than 2million RSVPs to “see them aliens” after it was taken down over the weekend. “This was a mistake and the event page is now available again,” a Facebook spokesperson wrote in an email to the USA TODAY Network. The event now includes a link to an official #StormArea51 website – complete with a merchandise page offering clothing and accessories themed around the Sept. 20 event in the Nevada desert. “Something big is coming,” the site reads. And it even appears the mysterious event now has its own theme song. Facebook first removed the page Aug. 3 for violating community standards, according to CNET.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: To highlight the state’s tax-free status and thank out-of-state customers, the state liquor commission is offering them discounts at its liquor and wine outlet stores. The “No Taxation on Our Libations” sale is providing customers from Massachusetts a 13% discount, Vermont a 12% discount and Maine an 11% discount, double each state’s sales tax rate. Customers from New Hampshire and all other states will be eligible for a 13% discount. A similar promotion last year drew more than 43,100 customers from 46 states. Eligible customers can receive one-time coupons valid from Thursday through Aug. 25. To take part, customers must submit their email addresses and select their home states at www.liquorandwineoutlets.com/notax.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nBarnegat Township: The Republican mayor of this small town is urging residents to oppose a state law that requires middle and high schools to instruct students on the contributions of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender people. Mayor Alfonso Cirulli on Tuesday called the LGBT political movement “an affront to almighty God.” The 60-year-old former assistant principal opened the township committee’s meeting by urging residents to pressure Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy and the Legislature to reverse the law that was signed Jan. 31. Cirulli said the government “has no right to teach our kids morality.” Cirulli said that “we’ve crossed over the line into absurdity.” The law applies to the 2020-21 school year.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: The city will be able to digitize its permanent museum collection with the help of a $50,000 grant from the Henry Luce Foundation American Art Program. The city of Las Cruces announced the funding Monday. The city’s museum collection includes paintings, drawings, sculptures, photographs and more. Officials say the project will increase the accessibility of the permanent collection, as digital images and updated information about each piece will be made available online. Some objects also will be mapped and reproduced using three-dimensional printing technology. Visitors seeking a hands-on experience will be able to handle the reproductions. Funding from the grant will be used to hire four contract employees to complete the work.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The city’s waters have welcomed a rare visitor – a beaver. The New York Times reports the animal was seen in the Hudson River on Monday. Beavers used to be plentiful in the area a few hundred years ago but were practically made extinct as they were hunted for their pelts and driven out as the city developed and their habitat was lost. The Times says in 2007, a beaver was seen in the Bronx River, the first time one of the animals had been seen in the city in 200 years. New York adopted the beaver as its state animal in 1975, and it’s also on New York City’s seal.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state health department is barred from allowing public funds to pay for conversion therapy for minors, a controversial practice aimed at changing young LGBT people’s sexual orientations, under an order signed by Gov. Roy Cooper. Advocacy groups praised the Democratic governor’s executive order as a pioneering step to restrict the therapy in the U.S. South. Cooper’s order forbids funds controlled by executive branch agencies from paying for such therapy for minors. That includes state and federal money for the state’s Medicaid program and NC Health Choice insurance for children in low- and middle-income families. The governor’s order defines conversion therapy as practices meant to change someone’s sexual orientation or gender identity, including efforts to stifle certain behaviors or reduce romantic feelings toward the same sex.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A state audit shows Dickinson State University has lost money on its bookstore since its operations were turned over to a private company. State Auditor Joshua Gallion says the audit released Tuesday found the school reported no revenue during fiscal 2018, which was the first year of an eight-year contract with Follett Higher Education Group. Gallion says before the contract was awarded to the private company, the university reported net revenue of up to $350,000 a year. The audit says the university failed to properly review the contract when it was awarded in 2017. The school says it will work to ensure “all required provisions are included and the contract reflects the proposal.”\n\nOhio\n\nPut-in-Bay: The director of the state’s Department of Natural Resources has designated the Lake Erie Islands Water Trail as Ohio’s 12th state water trail. A department release says the trail consists of five separate sections totaling more than 50 miles around North Bass, Middle Bass and South Bass islands, Kelleys Island, and along the mainland shorelines of Catawba Island and East Harbor State Park. Department Director Mary Mertz made the designation at a ceremony Tuesday in the village of Put-in-Bay on South Bass Island. She said the state’s water trails help bring communities together, encourage environmental awareness, and provide opportunities for people to be active and get outdoors. The Put-in-Bay Township Park District led efforts to create the trail, with assistance from various federal and state agencies.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOkmulgee: The Muscogee (Creek) Nation has received a federal disaster designation to help it recover from damage caused by severe storms, tornadoes and flooding in May and June. The declaration was announced by the White House on Wednesday and makes federal funding available to the tribe and various nonprofit organizations to recover from damage caused by severe weather between May 7 and June 9. Funds will be available on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged during the storms. The tribe is also eligible for federal funds for hazard mitigation measures. Federal officials say additional designations may be made later if they are sought by the tribe and warranted by further damage assessments.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Railroad crossing crashes in the state have nearly doubled since 2013. But because such accidents are relatively rare compared to highway crashes, the increase has largely flown under the radar outside transportation circles. Oregon had 19 rail crossing accidents in 2018, up from 10 in 2013. And Marion County had the most among Oregon counties, logging 28 railroad crossing crashes since 2008. That’s 18% of the state’s 154 railroad crashes since 2008. They unfold in a variety of circumstances: drivers attempting to get around closing gates, pedestrians walking across tracks, bicyclists failing to yield. The annual statistics may not sound like much, but the number of victims since 2008 adds up, with 35 killed and 36 injured.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nBethlehem: Bethlehem Steel’s former world headquarters is gone, but fans of the defunct steelmaker can now get their hands on a piece of the demolished landmark. The National Museum of Industrial History in Bethlehem is selling commemorative bricks from Martin Tower. The 21-story building was imploded in May to make way for a $200 million mixed-use development. Workers saved nearly 1,000 bricks from the building’s loading dock and parking deck. The museum has attached a plaque to each brick and is selling them for $25 each. All proceeds benefit the museum. The museum’s president and CEO, Kara Mohsinger, calls it a “unique opportunity to own a small part of one of the most historic events to occur in the Lehigh Valley.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A city employee who says she was compelled to resign from her previous position after years of reporting coworkers’ fraudulent credit card spending is suing the city. The Providence Journal reports that Charlene Oliver previously worked as a purchasing agent for the Providence Water Supply Board. Oliver says in 2015 she began reporting to superiors that agency credit cards were being used for personal purchases, including clothes, makeup and household goods. She says she was repeatedly reprimanded and later transferred to a lower-paying municipal job. Oliver says the water board failed to investigate her reports and violated Rhode Island’s Whistleblowers’ Protection Act. An agency supervisor was charged in May with making $13,000 in fraudulent credit card purchases. The city says it doesn’t comment on ongoing litigation.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: The National Park Service says people can no longer stop by Fort Sumter for free, unregulated visits. The Post and Courier reports rangers have now limited access to the historic fort, blocking people and boaters from using a nearby sandbar beach to pop in for an unregulated visit. Park Superintendent J. Tracy Stakely announced the closure in a letter saying that “security in the era of the active shooter requires a change from previous times.” He says the beach attracts partiers instead of people hoping for a historical visit. The park service says it needs to increase security and the management of erosion and artifact looting. The nearly 200-year-old fort was the target of the bombardment that launched the Civil War.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: The state Supreme Court will be asked to decide whether police investigating a possible statutory rape need a warrant to seize a placenta discarded after an abortion. The Rapid City Journal reports that a Rapid City girl mentioned while getting an abortion in Denver in May 2018 that she had been 15 when she became pregnant by her 25-year-old boyfriend. South Dakota’s age of consent is 16. The clinic told Denver police, who turned over a placenta sample to a Rapid City detective. DNA testing showed that the boyfriend, Nathan Hankins, couldn’t be excluded as the father. He was charged in September with fourth-degree rape. A judge last week rejected a defense motion to throw out the placenta evidence. The defense is appealing to South Dakota’s high court.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A new report from the state’s tourism department shows that tourists spent an average of $60 million per day last year. The Tennessee Department of Tourist Development announced that 119 million domestic visitors swung by the Volunteer State in 2018, up from 113 million the year before. Gov. Bill Lee and Tourist Development Commissioner Mark Ezell unveiled the numbers at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum on Tuesday. The agency says travel in Tennessee generated roughly 189,700 jobs and $1.81 billion in state and local tax revenue. All 95 counties in Tennessee saw an increase in domestic travel spending. Overall, Tennessee is outpacing the nation in all areas of travel, including tax revenue and expenditures.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: State transportation officials are considering a plan that would earmark $390 million to help reduce highway deaths by straightening roads, improving lighting and adding guardrails. The Houston Chronicle reports the Texas Transportation Commission on May 30 ordered Texas Department of Transportation officials to identify strategies to cut the state’s roadway fatalities – typically about 3,900 annually – in half by 2035. Commissioners this month are expected to approve details of the safety plan that would dedicate $600 million over two years to address the issue. Commission member Laura Ryan says Texas had a confirmed 1,857 roadway fatalities for the first half of 2019, about 50 less than that same period last year. The newspaper’s investigation last year revealed the Houston region leads the nation’s major metro areas in avoidable roadway deaths.\n\nUtah\n\nOgden: Thousands of dead fish have washed ashore at Pineview Reservoir this summer. The Standard-Examiner reports biologists with the state Division of Wildlife Resources have noticed a massive die-off at the Weber County site. Many of the fish were young black crappies, freshwater fish that like to live in flooded vegetation. DWR aquatic biologist Chris Penne said the fish have likely died from overpopulation, hotter temperatures and receding water levels. He said dropping water levels have forced the fish into shallow water along the shoreline where they become “stressed and crowded.” There was a similar die-off of fish at Pineview last year that had affected hundreds of fish. Penne said the fish will likely continue to die if temperatures stay hot in Utah.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: A study suggests that the city install traffic circles at certain intersections to improve traffic flow and safety for drivers, cyclists and pedestrians. The findings of the yearlong street scoping study were presented this week at a second public meeting. The aim is to find walking and bicycling improvements on Main and Barre streets. The report proposed safety related changes to roadways, intersections, sidewalks and shared-use recreational paths. The Times Argus reports the study was paid for by a $20,000 grant from the VTrans Bicycle and Pedestrian Program and a matching grant from Montpelier. The findings come as the imminent completion of a shared-use path between Taylor and Main streets will bring more cyclists and walkers into conflict with traffic.\n\nVirginia\n\nFort Monroe: Gov. Ralph Northam is praising the state’s removal of Confederate President Jefferson Davis’ name from an archway at the site where the first enslaved Africans arrived in Virginia 400 years ago. Northam said at a news conference Tuesday that removing the letters from a 1950s-era archway reading “Jefferson Davis Memorial Park” at Fort Monroe will make the state more “welcoming and reflective of our values.” The letters were removed Friday. They will be placed in a museum at the former military base, which overlooks Chesapeake Bay and was the site of the 1619 arrival of the state’s first Africans. Davis was imprisoned at the fort after the Civil War. Northam pledged to work toward racial reconciliation earlier this year after a racist yearbook photo almost forced him from office.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: A measure that seeks to repeal an initiative to restore affirmative action in the state will be on the November ballot. The secretary of state’s office said Wednesday that it certified Referendum 88 for the general election. The opponents of Initiative 1000, which passed the Legislature in April, had 90 days to gather 129,811 valid signatures to force a public vote. The referendum campaign submitted more than 213,000 signatures. Affirmative action has been illegal in Washington since Initiative 200 was approved by voters in 1998. I-1000 prohibits using factors such as race as the sole qualifier for an otherwise less-qualified applicant, and it bans mandatory quotas. It permits state agencies to establish diversity goals and timelines and consider being part of a minority group – also including age, disability or military status – as a contributing factor for an applicant.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The mayor of the capital city wants to try out new ways to deal with vacant and abandoned properties that have drawn the ire of residents. Mayor Amy Shuler Goodwin on Monday announced the introduction of two bills that would increase fines on vacant properties and create an agency to help manage the buildings. She says residents complain to her office every day about the vacant properties. City Attorney Kevin Baker says the increase in fees will help the city deal with the properties, and the Land Reuse Agency will encourage redevelopment.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state Department of Natural Resources is investigating a spill at a Jackson County frac sand mine. The Wisconsin State Journal reports the spill occurred Saturday at the 670-acre Wisconsin Proppants Hixton mine in the town of Curran northwest of Black River Falls. Town Chairman Dwight Swenson says he saw signs of a spill Saturday morning on Curran Coulee Creek and notified the DNR. He took photos of orange-colored water in the creek and about 2 miles downstream where the creek enters the Trempealeau River. DNR spokesman Andrew Savagian says it’s unclear what sort of material was released or how much. Investigators took water samples Tuesday. Plant manager Hamilton White referred questions to the DNR, saying he wasn’t at liberty to comment.\n\nWyoming\n\nYellowstone National Park: Yellowstone National Park officials have confirmed that a lightning strike sparked a fire that destroyed a historic lookout tower during a severe thunderstorm. Park staff have cleaned up the site and repaired a radio repeater at the burned-out Mount Holmes Fire Lookout, but there are no plans to restore the building. An employee manning the lookout on top of Wyoming’s Mount Washburn reported the fire July 16. The tower, which was burned to the ground, was built in 1931 at an elevation of about 10,000 feet. Park officials have reopened the summit and the Mount Holmes Trail.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/02/26/robocop-jimmy-carter-amtrak-news-around-states/115507776/", "title": "RoboCop, Jimmy Carter: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nHomewood: State regulators have suspended the alcohol license of a Birmingham-area bar over alleged violations of the state’s pandemic health order in what an official described as the first such case under COVID-19 rules. Regulators accused Grocery Brewpub in Homewood of violating rules about face mask requirements, occupancy limits and social distancing, Alabama ABC spokesman Dean Argo told WBMA-TV. The emergency suspension issued Tuesday was Alabama’s first license suspension linked to pandemic health rules, he said. Photos shared recently on social media showed people packed into the nightspot with few face masks visible. Bar owner Rayford Cook told the station the business was cited for violating Alabama’s mask ordinance, which requires facial coverings in public. “I look forward to our upcoming hearing regarding this matter and addressing it so we can provide a safe environment for patrons to enjoy in the future,” Cook said in a statement. A hearing is expected in April, but the business cannot serve alcohol until then. An order that has been in place since July requires face masks in public when within 6 feet of someone from another household.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The city’s health department has arranged mobile clinics to provide COVID-19 vaccinations specifically targeting members of Alaska’s community of Pacific Islanders. The clinics Tuesday and Thursday were the first targeting a specific community since the pandemic began, the Anchorage Daily News reports. The focused clinic strategy was used by the department during past illness outbreaks. There were about 160 appointments available for the two clinics, officials said. “In order to make sure some of these other groups get access, we basically created some private clinics,” said Christy Lawton, Anchorage’s public health division manager. “We’ll still serve people who are eligible, but we’re not getting the message out the same way.” The clinics were advertised via word of mouth among Pacific Islanders rather than the usual appointment sites accessible to the public, officials said. “The minute any appointments go on those, they go like hotcakes. People with time to sit at a computer and refresh to get them,” Lawton said. The targeted clinics were possible because Anchorage health officials had discretion in the use of monthly vaccine supplies from the state, allowing the city to do “pocket allocations.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: With COVID-19 cases dipping and teachers getting vaccinated, some school districts are looking to return to in-person learning as early as next month. The Osborn School District in Phoenix, which has been doing virtual learning full time since the start of the school year, will welcome students back into classrooms March 30. A survey conducted by the district found 90% of staff have already been vaccinated. Ylenia Aguilar, president of the district’s governing board, said officials expect that number to be closer to 95% in March. She knows the district has been very lucky. “We’ve been able to work and partner up and had access to multiple vaccination opportunities, which we know is not the case for other school districts in other areas, specifically rural areas,” Aguilar said. “We are ready to open.” The state Department of Education’s top official promised to help districts across the state safely transition back to in-person learning. But that would likely not look the same as before. The state wants to make sure mitigation measures such as plexiglass between desks and up-to-date ventilation systems are in place, State Superintendent of Public Instruction Kathy Hoffman said.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The number of people hospitalized because of the coronavirus dropped Wednesday to its lowest point since the fall as the state added 803 new virus cases. The Department of Health said the state’s COVID-19 hospitalizations dropped by 49 to 496, the fewest since Oct. 3. The state’s coronavirus cases now total 317,396 since the pandemic began. The state’s COVID-19 deaths increased by 10 to 5,387. Over the past two weeks, the rolling average number of daily new cases in Arkansas has decreased by nearly 72%, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers. Arkansas received 22,500 more doses of the vaccine since Tuesday. The department said 553,004 of the 887,090 vaccine doses allocated to the state so far had been given. Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Tuesday announced the state was lowering the eligibility age for the vaccine from 70 to 65. “As anticipated, we are receiving additional doses of the COVID-19 vaccine,” he said in a statement released by his office. “By expanding the eligibility of those who can get the vaccine to 65 and older, we will continue to administer these shots as quickly and efficiently as possible.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Los Angeles County on Wednesday reported another 806 deaths from COVID-19 during the winter surge, pushing California’s toll above 50,000, or about one-tenth of the U.S. total from the pandemic. The county, which has a quarter of the state’s 40 million residents, said the deaths mainly occurred between Dec. 3 and Feb. 3. The Department of Public Health identified them after going through death records that were backlogged by the sheer volume of the surge’s toll. “It is heartbreaking to report on this large number of additional deaths associated with COVID-19 and a devastating reminder of the terrible toll the winter surge has taken on so many families across the county,” Barbara Ferrer, Los Angeles County’s health director, said in a statement. Johns Hopkins University put California’s overall COVID-19 death toll at 50,890. The grim figure comes days after the U.S. recorded a half-million deaths. While the nation’s most populous state has the highest number of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S., it is ranked 25th in the number of cases per capita because of its large population. It took 10 months for the state to hit 25,000 deaths on New Year’s Eve and less than two months for that number to double.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: State officials have said additional front-line workers and people with multiple chronic health conditions could become eligible for COVID-19 vaccines starting late next week. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment confirmed the state is expecting to move into the next phase of its vaccination plan on or around March 5 but did not provide details on when everyone in the phase would be eligible, The Denver Post reports. The new phase will encompass front-line workers across multiple industries, including the U.S. Postal Service, grocery stores, public transportation, faith communities and journalists. It would also expand to people with two or more high-risk health conditions, including cancer, diabetes, Down syndrome, obesity and pregnancy. People with only one high-risk health condition would be eligible under an upcoming vaccination phase expected in spring, along with people between 60 and 64. Democratic Gov. Jared Polis said the new phase will start when about half of eligible people in the previous phase have received the vaccine. The state is currently offering doses to first responders, residents 65 and older, residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, and people in health care or education.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Thousands of new residents have come to the state during the pandemic as workers in New York, Boston and elsewhere look to relocate as they work from home, economic development officials said. More than 16,500 new residents moved into the state in 2020. That compares to a loss of 7,520 residents from Connecticut in 2019, the state Department of Economic and Community Development announced. “People are rediscovering the Connecticut lifestyle a little bit and knowing what it means to have a little bit of extra space, maybe a little bit of a backyard,” Gov. Ned Lamont said. “If you think this may not be the last time we ever have to quarantine, Connecticut’s not a bad place to be.” Carol Christiansen, the president of the Connecticut Association of Realtors, said home prices have risen by about 20% over the past year, with fewer houses on the market than people looking to buy. The median sale price for a single-family home in the state in 2020 was an all-time high of $300,000, a 15.4% increase from 2019, according to a report this month from The Warren Group, which tracks real estate data across the country. Glendowlyn Thames, the deputy commissioner of the DECD, said the state also saw a 9% increase in new business startups last year.\n\nDelaware\n\nNewark: Two weeks into the spring semester, the University of Delaware is facing a spike in coronavirus cases. The uptick has caused the university to issue new restrictions on dining and building occupancy. As of Wednesday, the university reported 154 cases among students and faculty this week. UD has increased its number of students and faculty on campus compared to the fall semester. In-person course offerings have nearly doubled from 9% of undergraduate classes to 17%. This week’s daily COVID-19 health screenings put UD’s daily on-campus population just shy of 6,000, about double the number of people who were typically present in the fall. Contact tracing connected the spread to the increased number of students in dining halls, said Andrea Boyle Tippett, spokesperson for the university. “With the start of the spring semester, many students understandably want to socialize and connect with friends,” Dennis Assanis, university president, said in a letter to students and faculty. “Unfortunately, such increased levels of social activity and contact promote transmission of the virus.” To slow the spread, campus dining hall meals will be grab-and-go only. Students may not gather to share meals indoors on campus, including in residence hall common spaces.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Frustration is mounting among many residents eager to get vaccinated after D.C.’s online appointment system had a dismal start on the first day eligibility was expanded to a new group, WUSA-TV reports. The city initially said in a tweet that a high volume of traffic could cause delays. But it also became evident from the flurry of residents commenting on social media that the vaccine portal somehow didn’t update to accept eligible residents under the new phase. Residents had to be 65 or older, have a qualifying medical condition or be part of an eligible workforce. The city listed 20 eligible conditions, including cancer, HIV, asthma, hypertension, pregnancy and obesity. Sianna Boschetti said she kept refreshing the website and filled out the questionnaire, only to receive a message at the end that she wasn’t qualified for the vaccine. “I was very bummed, and I was very surprised,” Boschetti said. “After all of the buildup to this, they made this little mistake – they forgot to update the website or didn’t prepare for the volume of people.” Another resident said he tried calling the health department but couldn’t get through. DC Health acknowledged the problems and said it was working with Microsoft to understand why heavy traffic blocked some eligible individuals from getting through.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: The state will open vaccine sites in six underserved minority communities, Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Thursday, responding to criticism that such neighborhoods had been previously skipped. DeSantis also said he expects Florida will be able to expand eligibility in March and is optimistic that by sometime in April, inoculations will be widely available as vaccine supply increases. “We are going to lower the age as soon as the seniors are taken care of,” DeSantis said during a news conference at Edward Waters College, a historically black school in Jacksonville. It will have a vaccination site along with Florida A&M University in Tallahassee, Broward College, and community centers in Miami-Dade and Osceola counties. DeSantis said the sites will be modeled after one opened recently in the Palm Beach County town of Pahokee. The governor received criticism earlier this month after he announced that the Publix supermarket chain would be that county’s sole distributor of the vaccine. That left the predominately black farming communities of Pahokee, Belle Glade and South Bay near Lake Okeechobee isolated, as they are at least 25 miles from the nearest Publix. Those areas “don’t have the retail pharmacy, they don’t have the health care infrastructure, so we brought it,” DeSantis said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nPlains: Now that former President Jimmy Carter and his wife are vaccinated against COVID-19, they have returned to one of their favorite things: church. Maranatha Baptist Church announced on its Facebook page Wednesday that Carter, 96, and Rosalynn Carter, 93, were again attending worship in person. The couple has been in the sanctuary the past two Sundays, Pastor Tony Lowden said in a video. Jimmy Carter hasn’t resumed teaching his Sunday school class, which once drew thousands of visitors annually. But video from last Sunday’s service showed both of the Carters sitting in their customary spots on the front pew and wearing face masks. The former president waved as members applauded their presence. “They’ve both had their shots,” Lowden said from the pulpit. In a reminder to keep a safe distance from the couple, Lowden said if someone gets tackled by him, another man or Secret Service agents, “it’s because we’re still practicing social distancing.” With the Carters once again in church, Maranatha Baptist posted rules that also include mandatory face masks and temperature checks, limited building capacity, reservations, and no photographs. Before the pandemic, visitors usually gathered around the couple for pictures at the end of worship.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: Some Maui businesses face tough calls about who should be exempt from universal mask rules as the county pushes for greater compliance. Privacy laws prevent businesses from asking customers for proof of underlying health issues that exempt them from wearing masks in public, The Maui News reports. Business operators worry some shoppers may be abusing exemption rules by claiming to have medical conditions only to enter without masks. Requiring customers with medical or disability exemptions to continue wearing face shields complies with Maui County protocols and the state’s emergency proclamation regarding the virus, county spokesperson Brian Perry said. Businesses also have the authority to refuse entry or service, unless an exception such as a medical condition applies, Perry said. “The proclamation also addresses the use of face shields as a substitute for face masks, but only if there’s an applicable exception to the face covering requirement,” Perry said. The proclamation remains unclear about allowing exempt customers without face coverings to enter businesses, even with health screenings. Businesses who violate the mask mandate may be subject to enforcement, fines or mandatory closure, Perry said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Two lawmakers have dropped their lawsuit against the Republican-led Legislature and leadership that alleged lax coronavirus protocols at the Statehouse. Democratic state Reps. Sue Chew of Boise and Muffy Davis of Sun Valley notified the federal court Wednesday that they were dismissing the lawsuit. The court filing didn’t reveal why they dropped the case. Both lawmakers have health conditions that put them at higher risk of severe complications from COVID-19: Chew is diabetic and has hypertension, and Davis is a paraplegic with reduced lung function. There have been documented cases of the virus among Capitol staffers and lawmakers, but legislative leaders in conservative Idaho have declined to require masks, and lawmakers aren’t allowed to attend and vote on legislation remotely. A separate lawsuit brought by several disability rights organizations against the Legislature, House Speaker Scott Bedke and Senate Pro Tempore Chuck Winder over a lack of coronavirus restrictions is still moving forward in federal court. That case contends officials have failed to make reasonable accommodations to ensure that people with conditions that put them at greater risk from COVID-19 can still participate in the legislative process.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The state expanded its COVID-19 vaccination eligibility Thursday to include people younger than 65 with conditions that would put them at higher risk of COVID-19 and those with disabilities. The move came one day after the state set a new record for COVID-19 vaccinations. Joining the group of residents within Phase 1B of Illinois’ vaccination plan are those with conditions such as obesity, diabetes, pulmonary disease, smoking, heart conditions, chronic kidney disease, cancer, solid organ transplants, sickle cell disease and those who are pregnant. People with disabilities under the age of 65 are also included and are specified by the Illinois Department of Public Health as “physical disability, developmental disability, visual disability, hearing disability, or mental disability.” In a statement, Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he was excited to expand the categories, coming as supply is likely to rise due to the eventual approval of Johnson & Johnson’s one-shot vaccine. The state administered 130,021 vaccinations Wednesday, setting a record for overall doses given in a day. The state also set records for first and second does of the vaccines. The new record helped push the seven-day average to 66,274 doses.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A day after the state expanded vaccine to all Hoosiers 60 and older, health officials doubled down on eligibility restrictions and announced new guidelines for clinics administering shots. Without enough vaccine for all Hoosiers, state health commissioner Dr. Kristina Box said Wednesday that officials are stressing adherence to a vaccine rollout plan that bases shot eligibility on age, rather than moving up teachers and other essential workers as other states have done. Several clinics that have “ignored” those guidelines will not receive any more first-dose vaccines, Box said. She said state health officials are reaching out to other clinics that have deviated from the eligibility guidelines “to find out why and to reeducate them about the importance of following the state’s priority list” when scheduling appointments and adding names to waitlists. “We are not trying to be the vaccine police; that is the last thing we want to be,” Box said. The state health department’s chief medical officer, Dr. Lindsay Weaver, said clinics have also been instructed to stop administering first doses to people who live in other states to ensure “that every dose received in Indiana goes to Hoosiers.” About 19,000 health care workers and first responders who work in Indiana but live in other states were inoculated, Weaver said.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Gov. Kim Reynolds said Thursday that essential workers and some individuals with disabilities likely will become eligible to receive COVID-19 vaccinations in early March. According to projections she shared at a news conference, 70% of people within those populations are expected to receive at least one dose of the vaccine by the start of April. When the state reaches that 70% milestone within a population group, Reynolds said, it will begin vaccinating the next group of Iowans. Reynolds said that by next week, the state is projecting 70% of “tier one” populations – which include first responders, public school teachers and staff, and other child care staff – will have received at least one dose. She said 70% of Iowans 65 and older are expected to receive the first dose of the vaccine by mid-March. That allows the state to begin opening up vaccinations to other populations, including essential workers in food processing, agricultural production, distribution and manufacturing. People with disabilities living in home settings who are dependent on care staff will also become eligible, along with their care staff. A new website – www.vaccinate.iowa.gov – will be available Friday to help Iowans find access to the vaccine, Reynolds said. It will include a vaccine locator and answers to frequently asked questions.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Lawmakers moved ahead Wednesday with a measure designed to help courts and prosecutors deal with a backlog of criminal cases caused by the coronavirus pandemic and a proposal to limit state and local officials’ power in setting restrictions in future pandemics. The House gave first-round approval to a bill that would suspend until May 2024 a Kansas law that sets deadlines for criminal trials to protect defendants’ constitutional right to a speedy resolution of their cases. Those deadlines have been suspended during the pandemic, but prosecutors fear that once Kansas ends its state of emergency for COVID-19, they won’t be able to get all the cases to court in time to avoid having them dismissed. Wednesday’s debate showed that some lawmakers are nervous about a three-year suspension. “Delaying it to 2024 is just asking for people drag their feet,” said Rep. Barbara Wasinger, R-Hays. “I say we do one year at a time.” Kansas’ speedy trial law generally requires defendants to be brought to trial within six months of entering a plea, or the case against them is dismissed. But courts have postponed trials throughout the pandemic, and House Judiciary Committee Chair Fred Patton, R-Topeka, said there’s now a backlog of about 5,000 cases.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The Democratic governor on Wednesday urged state lawmakers to move past an impeachment effort that targeted him for his actions to combat the spread of COVID-19, saying it’s time to renew respect for “the role of government and how it works.” Gov. Andy Beshear said a legislative panel made the “right choice” Tuesday night when it recommended that no action be taken on a remaining petition calling for his removal from office. From the outset, the governor denounced that petition and others as meritless. “Now I hope that in Frankfort we can all be adults in the room and move forward and leave it behind,” Beshear told reporters Wednesday. The panel’s recommendation that no further action be taken on petitions against Beshear and Attorney General Daniel Cameron will be submitted to the Republican-dominated House. The petitions took aim at Beshear for his coronavirus-related restrictions and Cameron for his handling of the Breonna Taylor death investigation. Beshear has said his virus-related orders have saved lives, and he portrayed the petitioners seeking his ouster as anti-government extremists. Kentucky’s Supreme Court ruled last year that the governor had the authority to put restrictions on businesses and individuals to try to contain the coronavirus.\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport: The Food Bank of Northwest Louisiana is a part of a fight against hunger that’s only gotten more difficult with the COVID-19 pandemic. The food bank collects, sorts and stores food before distributing it to its more than 150 nonprofit partner agencies, which include organizations, shelters and churches. Between March and December 2020, more than 14,234,668 pounds of food were distributed to residents in need across Caddo, Bossier, Webster, Claiborne, Bienville, Red River and DeSoto parishes. It was a 42% increase from the year before, which officials credited to the hardships of the pandemic. “Since COVID, so many people have lost jobs that we saw a huge uptick in the need for food and service. Most of our growth has come because of the pandemic,” said Martha Marak, executive director of the Food Bank of Northwest Louisiana. Feeding America projects that 1 in 6 people could experience food insecurity because of the pandemic, and people of color are even more likely to face hunger. The higher demand on food banks was noticed by a collective of donors who then collaborated to help carry the load.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The director of the Maine Center for Disease Control said the incoming supply of vaccine is stable and growing, and the number of COVID-19 deaths in the state topped 700 on Thursday. The Maine Department of Health and Human Services expects to receive an 8.4% increase in COVID-19 vaccine doses for a total of 30,080 next week, officials said. On top of that, 8,980 doses are being shipped from the federal government directly to pharmacies across the state. And additional doses of a new vaccine, from Johnson & Johnson, could come next week if it receives emergency approval, Dr. Nirav Shah, Maine CDC director, told reporters. “For the first time, we have stability in what our projections look like not just for the next few days but the next few weeks,” he said. Shah spoke on the same day the Maine CDC reported an additional 24 deaths, a day after 17 deaths were reported. Those deaths, 41 over two days, brought the total number of deaths to 701. The two-day figures reflect some of the highest death tolls in weeks and stand in contrast to an overall downward trend in deaths and hospitalizations since the start of the year. “We’re not out of it,” Shah said. Even though there are many positive trends, people need to remain vigilant, he said.\n\nMaryland\n\nNewark: Worcester County Public Schools will transition all hybrid students to in-person learning beginning March8. “Our staff has worked extremely hard both at the central office level and school level to make this possible,” Superintendent Lou Taylor said. “I want to assure you that we are going to do this as safely as possible, meaning safety will be our No. 1 priority.” Worcester County has been in Stage 3 of its return plan, which had many students in an A-Week/B-Week rotation. The district started to return students from virtual learning in January. Taylor said students will still need to wear masks, social distance and remain at home if ill. He said the biggest issue for WCPS will be bus transportation. Social distancing will not be possible on many buses, according to Taylor, who urged students to use other methods of transportation to the school building. “We will have kids sitting with others who do not necessarily live in the same household,” he said. “But I assure you our bus drivers and transportation personnel will make sure that those buses are clean, disinfected, and all students and adults will be wearing masks every time we enter those school buses.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: Nurses at St. Vincent Hospital have given notice that they plan to strike early next month unless management agrees to boost staffing to better protect patients during the coronavirus pandemic and after it ends, according to the nurses’ union. About 800 nurses at the Worcester facility plan to start the strike at 6 a.m. March 8, according to a statement Tuesday night from the Massachusetts Nurses Association. The nurses are in contract negotiations with Dallas-based Tenet Healthcare, which owns the hospital. Tenet and St. Vincent management “refuse to heed nurses’ call to increase staffing levels to better protect their patients during the ongoing COVID-19 crisis and beyond,” the union said in a statement. “We really feel that staffing is the most important issue, and we’ve heard nothing about it from (management) except that staffing is fine. We work at the bedside. It’s not fine,” said Dominique Muldoon, a St. Vincent nurse who has been at the forefront of negotiations. St. Vincent maintains that staffing levels are appropriate and called its most recent contract proposal Jan. 28 its “last, best, and final” offer. The latest contract proposal also includes wage increases between 5% and 22% by the end of 2022 and enhanced benefits for part-time nurses.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: One of the pandemic’s latest casualties: a statue of RoboCop. A year ago, the plan for the eagerly awaited RoboCop statue outside the Michigan Science Center seemed clear. Now the final destination for the monument to pop culture is up in the air again. The Michigan Science Center will no longer be the permanent home for the grassroots-driven work of art, as first reported by the Metro Times. In a statement, the museum expressed gratitude for being part of the RoboCop statue’s journey since 2018, when it was announced that the 11-foot-tall bronze sculpture would be installed on its grounds. The statement said that “given the pandemic’s unprecedented pressures, MiSci’s resources must now be entirely focused on our core mission of serving Michigan’s students and families.” The effort began in 2011 with an offbeat idea that launched a successful crowdfunding campaign led by a community arts group, Imagination Station. Brandon Walley, a Detroit filmmaker and key part of Imagination Station’s quest to make the RoboCop dream a reality, said the statue is essentially done. “It’s all assembled and put together,” he said, with application of the final patina underway. “He will need a home, and we’re exploring possibilities. ... We’re still going through a pandemic, so we’re just happy to have it completed.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Public health officials are asking families to get tested for the coronavirus every two weeks from now until the end of the school year. A state Department of Health campaign announced Wednesday is reaching out to families, health professionals, schools and youth organizations to help encourage regular testing. “Over the past few months, the number of students attending in-person classes has significantly increased, with thousands more expected to return to the classroom in coming weeks,” Health Department Assistant Commissioner Dan Huff said, adding that many people will be resuming sports and other activities. “To protect this progress, we need to use all the tools at our disposal.” Of Minnesota’s 480,845 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 80,417 have been in those under the age of 20, or about 17% of all cases. The state is also beefing up vaccination plans for older residents. At least 70% of Minnesotans age 65 and older will get at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine before the state moves on to the next phase, according to Gov. Tim Walz. He said Thursday that the next tier will expand eligibility based on underlying health conditions and workplace exposure risk. Based on current projections, people in the next phase will begin getting inoculated in April, Walz said.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state health department reported 920 new coronavirus cases and eight COVID-19-related deaths Thursday. Since the virus hit the state in March, a total of 292,811 cases and 6,613 coronavirus-related deaths have been reported. There are currently 81 outbreaks at Mississippi nursing homes. Long-term care facilities have recorded 10,378 cases of the coronavirus and 1,945 related deaths as of Thursday. Residents between the ages of 25 and 39 represent the largest portion of the infected population across the state, with 64,245 cases reported as of Tuesday, the latest figure available. Among patients under 18, children between ages of 11 and 17 have the highest infection rate, with 22,334 cases identified. The 65-and-older age group has the highest total number of deaths with 5,066 reported. According to health department data, 358,246 people have begun the vaccination process in Mississippi as of Wednesday. About 167,077 people have been fully immunized against COVID-19 since the shots began in December.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: The four-campus University of Missouri system won’t require incoming students to take admission exams again this fall because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The MU Faculty Council voted to extend the pilot test-optional admissions policy for an additional year, the Columbia Daily Tribune reports. Because it’s a pilot program and temporary, it doesn’t require further approval by the UM System Board of Curators, spokesman Christian Basi wrote in an email. “We know there are still a lot of students who won’t have the opportunity to test,” said Kim Humphrey, MU vice provost for enrollment management. Under the pilot program, all first-time students who apply for fall 2021 will be allowed to have their applications reviewed with or without test scores. “It is essential that the UM System adopt a test-optional admission policy for the class of 2021 to provide access to prospective students who may not have access to take standardized tests due to the COVID-19 pandemic,” the proposal said. “Each campus will establish a minimum GPA requirement that allows us to be competitive while also maintaining institutional standards.”\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: U.S. Sen. Jon Tester announced he has introduced legislation to restore long-distance passenger rail service to Montana’s Hi-Line and to reinstate employees who lost their jobs after Amtrak announced deep service cuts last May, after April ridership crashed to less than 5% of what had been a year earlier in the wake of the pandemic. Beginning Oct. 19, passenger rail service on Amtrak’s 15 long-distance routes was slashed. That included the Empire Builder, the only route serving Montana. Rail service along the Empire Builder, which makes 12 stops across Montana’s Hi-Line, has now been cut from seven days a week to just three. Tester said the service cuts have been harmful to rural communities that rely on regular passenger rail service to access critical health care at large urban hospitals and for whom it provides a large economic boost in tourism. Tester’s bill proposes an additional $166 million in federal funding for Amtrak specifically targeted at restoring a seven-day schedule of long-distance rail service and recalling Amtrak employees who were furloughed because of the service cuts. 2020 was a disastrous year for national passenger railroad, which only a year before had been on the cusp of showing a profit for the first time in its nearly 50-year history.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state’s Department of Health and Human Services and partners are working with various organizations to reach out to minority communities to discuss the safety and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine as well as listen to concerns and feedback Nebraskans. Two online town halls Thursday were hosted by Bluestem Health, a Lincoln-based health center, and the New Era Baptist State Convention, an organization of historically African American Baptist Churches in Nebraska.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: All Las Vegas-area middle and high school students can return to classrooms for hybrid in-person instruction in phases rolled out after the youngest pupils go back to campuses next week, school administrators said Wednesday. Clark County School Superintendent Jesus Jara said sixth and ninth graders and high school seniors can return to class beginning March 22, and grades seven, eight, 10 and 11 can return April 6. They will have two-day-a-week classroom schedules. Pre-kindergarten through grade five will return at that time to five days a week. Jara and school board President Linda Cavazos made the announcement – accompanied by school trustees and representatives of the district’s employee unions – just days before the nation’s fifth-largest school district begins hybrid schedules for pre-K to third grade students. Cavazos said officials were balancing the effects of the pandemic including “physical safety from COVID-19 and mental and emotional safety from the accompanying stress and anxiety.” The hybrid model has half the class attend on Mondays and Tuesdays. Classrooms are sanitized on Wednesdays. The other half of the class attends Thursdays and Fridays. On days pupils are not in class, they are scheduled for online instruction.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A new program will help eligible residents who can’t pay their rent and utilities because of the coronavirus pandemic, Gov. Chris Sununu said Thursday. The federally funded New Hampshire Emergency Rental Assistance Program will be administered by the New Hampshire Housing Authority, in coordination with the Governor’s Office for Emergency Relief and Recovery. To be eligible for assistance, at least one person in the household must qualify for unemployment benefits, have had their income reduced, have encountered significant costs, or have experienced other financial hardship due to COVID-19. The household must also be at risk for homelessness and meet certain income requirements. Landlords may apply for assistance on behalf of their tenant, with the tenant’s permission. Assistance is available retroactive to April 1, 2020, through the date of application. Households may receive help for a total of 12 months. Details about the program are available at www.NHHFA.org/emergency-rental-assistance. Application information will be available by March 15.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Family and friends of many nursing home residents will be able to visit their loved ones indoors – some for the first time in nearly a year – state officials announced Wednesday. But visits will be limited for now only to nursing homes in seven counties that have seen COVID-19 activity drop significantly in the past two weeks to “moderate” status based on a health department’s risk assessment. Those counties are Somerset, Hunterdon, Mercer, Camden, Burlington, Gloucester and Salem. “This is good news,” Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli said at a briefing. “We are seeing the outbreaks in our long-term care facilities decrease.” Nursing homes closed their doors to visitors in mid-March under state orders to try to stem the spread. COVID-19 still devastated New Jersey’s nursing homes, killing 7,813 residents and 143 employees – about 40% of the state’s death toll. Outdoor visits were allowed in June after key metrics such as hospitalizations and deaths from the pandemic’s first wave dropped. Indoor visits were allowed in late summer at some facilities that met certain benchmarks. But that gradually stopped as the second wave of COVID-19 began to rise in the fall, said Laurie Facciarossa Brewer, New Jersey’s long-term care ombudsman.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The Democrat-led state House of Representatives voted Wednesday to increase state spending on public education, health care and relief to businesses in efforts to chart a financial path out of the pandemic. The House endorsed a $7.39 billion general fund spending plan for the fiscal year that begins July 1 on a 60-10 vote, with many leading Republican legislators opposed. Spending on public education would increase by 5.5% to nearly $3.4 billion annually. Many lawmakers in the Democrat-dominated Legislature also want to shore up state spending on Medicaid amid a surge in enrollment in the federally subsidized health care program for the needy. “A pandemic as well as economic volatility is a challenge,” said Rep. Patty Lundstrom, D-Gallup, chairwoman of the lead House budget committee. “We are versatile enough to recognize immediate needs.” The budget proposal is linked to a package of pandemic-related economic relief that would provide $200 million in grants to businesses for rent and mortgage obligations and provide a $600 tax rebate to low-wage workers. The spending plan would provide four months of state taxation relief for restaurants and pay off $325 million in debt racked up by the state unemployment trust fund.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Tens of thousands of middle school students returned to their school buildings Thursday for the first time since city schools were closed in November amid a surge in coronavirus infections. Classroom doors opened for the 62,000 students in grades six through eight whose parents chose a mix of in-person and remote learning for their children. There are about 196,000 students in those grades in the city’s public schools. Mayor Bill de Blasio greeted children returning to school in the Bronx and said later that “it was wonderful to see the energy and the hope and the understanding that this is part of how we move forward.” He said a teacher told him: “I want to be here. It feels right.” Students receiving in-person instruction in the city are required to wear face coverings at all times, maintain distance from others and submit to random coronavirus testing. De Blasio said the city has performed 500,000 tests for the virus on students and staff members since the school year started. The mayor said more than 30,000 city educators have been vaccinated against the virus so far. United Federation of Teachers President Michael Mulgrew, whose union represents more than 120,000 teachers, guidance counselors and other school staff members, said that’s not enough.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: With cases and other key metrics trending downward, Gov. Roy Cooper on Wednesday announced the state will ease gathering and occupancy restrictions and end its 10 p.m. statewide curfew starting Friday. For the first time since early in the coronavirus pandemic, the Democratic governor is allowing bars and taverns to offer indoor service. His new executive order also increases alcohol sale cutoff times by two hours from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. and lets those businesses operate at 30% capacity up to 250 people. If they follow state health guidelines such as mask-wearing and physical distancing, nightclubs, conference spaces, indoor amusement parks, movie theaters, and sports and entertainment venues may also operate with the same capacity. “Easing these restrictions will only work if we continue protecting ourselves and others from this deadly pandemic,” Cooper said at a news conference. Larger sports venues able to seat more than 5,000 people can host up to 15% of their fans, provided they adhere to additional safety restrictions. Restaurants, breweries, wineries, gyms, bowling alleys, swimming pools, museums, outdoor amusement park areas, hair salons and retailers are given a 50% capacity limit.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: As COVID-19 numbers continue to dwindle, Gov. Doug Burgum has signed an executive order terminating several prior executive orders issued during the pandemic that he said have fulfilled their stated objectives and are no longer necessary. The terminated orders pertained to temporary emergency licensing requirements for health care facilities and workers; workers’ compensation eligibility for first responders, health care workers, funeral home directors and employees, as well as individuals providing care to those with intellectual or development disabilities; the transfer of surplus state property needed for COVID-19 response; the reopening of certain businesses; work registration requirements for those seeking unemployment benefits; and public hearings conducted by the Department of Environmental Quality. Burgum also terminated a prior executive order last week that had allowed for Public Service Commission permit hearings and Department of Trust Lands public land leasing auctions to be conducted by remote means.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The ability of the governor to issue public health orders during a pandemic would be restricted under a bill in the state House that is the GOP’s latest effort to rein in the executive branch’s authority. A House committee reviewed a GOP-backed bill Wednesday that looks to create legislative oversight of emergency orders made by fellow Republican Gov. Mike DeWine and the Ohio Department of Health. The effort is similar to a bill that passed in the Senate last week that would limit public health emergency orders to 90 days and give the General Assembly the power to rescind those orders by resolution after 30 days. It’s the latest in a series of yearlong efforts by GOP lawmakers to curtail DeWine’s pandemic response, including his issuing of a statewide mask mandate, the now-expired curfew and a strict lockdown in the spring. Proponents of both the House and Senate bills believe DeWine and the state health department have issued orders during the past 11 months of the pandemic that have remained enacted for longer than necessary and thus unduly damaged small businesses and the economy. Opponents of the effort, which include several medical institutions, have called it unconstitutional and warned it would decentralize the state’s response during an emergency and cost lives in the process.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state health department will pay nearly half a million dollars to Microsoft for the company’s work to build Oklahoma’s COVID-19 vaccine scheduling website. Documents from the department show the company billed $472,302 for creation of the website, and additional costs are likely. Many of the vaccine appointments made in the state have been booked through the state’s scheduling portal, vaccinate.oklahoma.gov. But some seniors have struggled to navigate the website. Many Oklahomans have expressed frustration about the lack of available appointments on the website – a result of limited vaccine supply. Microsoft is constantly working with the state health department to adjust and improve the site, said Dr. David Rhew, the company’s chief medical officer. Microsoft is doing similar work in cities, states and countries around the globe, Rhew said. There’s not a one-size-fits-all model, but there are common needs across the spectrum, he said. Most entities wanted to be able to register individuals into a system they could also use to schedule appointments. Oklahoma officials also wanted to tie the scheduling element in with vaccine tracking and allowing health care entities and other providers to report to the state’s immunization registry, Rhew said.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Federal pandemic stimulus payments last year will generate $112 million in additional Oregon taxes because of a quirk in state tax law and mean many people are on the hook for a higher tax bill. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports the taxes will affect 877,000 taxpayers, about half of all those who received federal stimulus payments in 2020 and early in 2021. They would owe an average of about $130 apiece from just the first stimulus payments last spring; many lower-income workers would owe $100 or more. Lawmakers from both parties say that’s unfair, and the Legislature is examining a fix that would wipe out the higher tax bill. But with the April tax filing date approaching, it’s not clear there’s consensus to make a change. The stimulus payments were structured as a tax rebate, which means they aren’t subject to federal or state income taxes. But Oregon is one of six states that allow taxpayers to deduct a portion of their federal tax payments from their state income taxes. Most years, the deduction functions as a state tax break. But when the federal government is giving out stimulus payments, it reduces the size of that break. A lower federal tax bill means there’s less to deduct from a filer’s state taxes.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The chairs of the state Senate Education Committee on Wednesday asked the Biden administration to waive this year’s requirement for school standardized testing because of the pandemic. Sens. Lindsey Williams, D-Allegheny, and Scott Martin, R-Lancaster, wrote in a letter that they understood the need to find out how much learning and what kind of learning children missed during the pandemic. But students also need “some sense of stability before we thrust additional stress on them in the name of determining what schools ‘deserve’ more funding,” they wrote to President Joe Biden and Acting Education Secretary Miguel Cardona. Gov. Tom Wolf’s Department of Education is considering allowing districts to administer the Pennsylvania System of School Assessments and Keystone Exams over the summer or in September, when schools are expected to be back to educating children in classrooms, rather than remotely. On Monday, the U.S. Education Department said it will not allow states to forgo federally required standardized testing in schools this year but will give them flexibility to delay testing or hold it online. The Biden administration said states also can apply to be exempted from certain accountability measures tied to the results.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state is doing a better job of getting vaccines into the arms of more people and at a much faster rate than before, Lt. Gov. Daniel McKee said Thursday. McKee, who will take over as governor if Gov. Gina Raimondo is confirmed as President Joe Biden’s commerce secretary, had been critical of the state’s vaccine rollout efforts under Raimondo. Both are Democrats. The state isn’t sitting on supplies as long, and two state-run mass vaccination sites in Providence and Cranston have increased capacity, he said at a news conference just days before the one-year anniversary of the detection of the state’s first presumptive case. “Getting more shots into arms right now will get kids back to school, get people back to work and get us back to normal,” McKee said. Rhode Island has been administering about 6,600 shots per day for the past week, state Department of Health Director Dr. Nicole Alexander-Scott said. The goal is to build the state’s capacity to administer vaccines as fast as possible once supply increases, McKee said. To that end, the state is planning two more mass vaccination clinics at the former Benny’s store in Middletown and at the old Sears location in Woonsocket soon.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A bill that would prevent lawsuits against businesses and other groups by people who contract COVID-19 as long as federal and state health guidelines were being followed passed the state Senate on Thursday. The bill, which was one of the top priorities of business leaders this session, passed 40-3 and now goes to the House. The bill does nothing to protect people who don’t follow the rules and put customers or employees in danger, said Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey, one of the sponsors. Opponents of the bill said existing laws could handle the problem and pointed out that there is just one lawsuit pending in state court in which someone blames a business for their illness. The South Carolina Chamber of Commerce said its members wanted this bill to provide some certainty as they reopen and struggle with challenges from the pandemic. “It will go a long way toward ensuring they can remain operational, keep South Carolinians employed, and make it through these challenging times,” interim Chamber CEO Swati Patel said in a statement.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The South Dakota Department of Health reported eight additional COVID-19 deaths Thursday, bringing the total number of related deaths in the state since the pandemic began to 1,873. The new deaths included three people 80 or older, as well as three 70-79 and two 60-69. The state also reported 156 new coronavirus infections. Active cases increased to 1,948. Of the 100 COVID-19 patients occupying a hospital bed in South Dakota, 20 were receiving intensive care, and 12 were on ventilators. The number of vaccine doses administered through the Department of Health increased to 197,050, to a total of 130,148 people. That number does not include doses administered from federal entities.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state Department of Health announced it will soon lift its state-specific visitation restrictions for long-term care facilities. Nursing homes and other facilities should use the federal guidance provided by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services starting Sunday, health officials said in a news release Wednesday. The agency said all of Tennessee’s nursing homes and skilled nursing home facilities have finished giving both doses of COVID-19 vaccinations, and the state’s assisted care living facilities and residential homes for the aged are expected to be fully immunized by the end of the week. Meanwhile, Nashville Mayor John Cooper cited the drop in cases Thursday as he moved to ease restrictions starting Monday, with social distancing and mask-wearing requirements remaining in place. Bars and restaurants serving alcohol can stay open until 1 a.m., with up to 125 people per floor and an increase in bar counter seating, he said. City-approved events can increase from 500 to 1,000 people, with weddings increasing from 75 people to 125 people maximum, Cooper said. Event venues can stay open until 1 a.m. The outdoor gathering size limit will increase from eight to 25 people. Museums, zoos and other attractions can increase capacity to a level that just maintains social distancing, Cooper said.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Gov. Greg Abbott announced the launch of a statewide program to vaccinate homebound seniors Thursday, saying he expects vaccine shipments to ramp up in the coming weeks, which will allow Texas to move on to new tiers of vaccine recipients “sometime in March.” Texas currently allows COVID-19 vaccinations for health care workers and other first responders, those 65 and older, and residents 16 and older with underlying health conditions. It’s not clear who will be next in line. “The good news is there’s going to be a record amount of vaccines available across Texas this week, with increasing numbers going forward,” Abbott said, speaking from a fire station in Corpus Christi. He also said the increase in vaccinations could lead to the end of coronavirus restrictions, including the statewide mask order. Most Texas businesses, including restaurants, must keep their occupancy rates at 75%. In any hospital region where COVID-19 patients make up more than 15% of available beds, businesses must reduce to 50%, bars must close, and elective procedures must halt. “We’re working right now on evaluating when we’re gonna be able to remove all statewide orders, and we will be making announcements about that pretty soon,” Abbott said.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Gov. Spencer Cox doubled down Thursday on his prediction that there will be gatherings without masks by the Fourth of July, contrary to predictions from the nation’s top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci. Cox told reporters he’s feeling optimistic about the nation’s vaccine rollout and expects mass gatherings could be held without masks this summer. His comments contradict predictions from Fauci who said earlier this week that Americans may still be wearing masks outside their homes in 2022. “I’m not gonna be wearing this on the Fourth of July, and I’m gonna be in a parade somewhere,” Cox said, holding a mask. “But if I’m wrong, then I’ll come here, and I’ll admit that I’m wrong and that we’re gonna do something different.” Cox announced Thursday that residents 16 and older with certain health conditions can make appointments to be vaccinated immediately. The group was initially expected to be able to get shots starting March 1. Utah experienced a dip in vaccine distribution last week because a shipment of 36,000 Moderna doses was delayed by recent storms. Cox said the state is “rapidly working to make up the decrease.” It has been approved to get 20,000 doses of the new single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine by early next weekpending federal approval, Cox said.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Residents 65 and older can now make appointments to get their COVID-19 vaccinations at Walgreens pharmacies, the state Department of Health said Thursday. Walgreens received an unexpected 4,300 first doses of the vaccine for Vermonters through the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program, the state said. People can sign up online or call Walgreens. The Health Department announced earlier this week that Vermonters ages 65 and over will be able to begin making vaccination appointments March 1. The Walgreens appointments come in addition to the appointments that newly eligible residents can begin to make Monday. Meanwhile, firefighters in Rutland won’t be required to be vaccinated, town officials decided. The town board of health voted earlier this month not to require the shots, although those who wish to participate in fire department activities must follow safety protocols as outlined by the fire chief. Selectman John Paul Faignant, who is also the town health officer, told the Rutland Herald the majority of the department’s members have been vaccinated. “I know the ones that haven’t. They all have pretty good reasons,” he said. Those who opt not to get the vaccine must follow extra safety measures, such as temperature checks and signing in when they go to the station, he said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The state Senate gave final approval Thursday to legislation that would require schools to provide full-time, in-person instruction as the coronavirus pandemic drags on. The chamber voted 36-3, sending the measure sponsored by GOP Sen. Siobhan Dunnavant to Gov. Ralph Northam. If signed as is, it would take effect July 1. Dunnavant said that effective date was the bill’s only flaw. She said she hoped Northam would consider amending the measure so that it would take effect immediately, given substantial bipartisan support it won in both chambers. The House passed it a day earlier on a vote of 88-9. “Our children needed to be in school last fall. We have spent an enormous amount of time discussing the science and the evidence that support that,” said Dunnavant, who is an OB-GYN. The bill would allow limited exceptions. If a school has high levels of coronavirus transmission, it could temporarily revert to virtual learning. The measure also includes a new definition of what counts as in-person learning. Setups that some districts have turned to involving a nonteacher monitor proctoring online learning in a classroom would not meet the standard.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A judge has rejected a landlord group’s challenge to several Seattle laws meant to protect renters from eviction once the coronavirus pandemic moratorium expires. King County Superior Court Judge Johanna Bender on Wednesday found the laws, including Seattle’s ban on winter evictions, largely constitutional, The Seattle Times reports. The Rental Housing Association of Washington sued in an effort to block the laws, arguing the regulations would gut their rights under state law. Bender did strike one part of a law requiring landlords to allow payment plans for rent accrued during the pandemic. The city banned late fees, interest and other charges because of late payment during the pandemic. Bender struck down the reference to interest payments, citing a state law allowing landlords to collect interest on unpaid rent. The remainder of the ordinance, including the prohibition on charging late fees, can remain in place, she ruled. The Rental Housing Association’s lawsuit did not challenge Seattle’s ongoing moratorium on evictions during the pandemic but instead sought to nullify three laws that would affect eviction proceedings after the moratorium ends.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Following the state Board of Education’s announcement Tuesday that students up through eighth grade should return to school full time next week, Mineral County Superintendent Troy Ravenscroft said he has applied for a waiver to allow the county’s students to attend four days a week for now. If that waiver is not granted, however, all Mineral County students will return to school full time beginning Monday. The state board’s vote Tuesday was designed to eliminate blended schedules in which students have alternated between classroom and online learning and to bring students back to full time learning by March 3. Those families that have chosen to keep their children in all virtual learning since the pandemic started will not be affected. Included in the board’s ruling is the stipulation that counties can apply for a waiver to conduct in-person learning four days per week and virtual instruction on the fifth day. As for high school students, the state board said they, too, are to return to five days a week unless a county’s coronavirus infection rate is high. The rationale for that is that “older students may transmit the virus at rates similar to adults,” according to the WVDE.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A year into the coronavirus pandemic, state lawmakers are still debating face masks. Republicans who control the Legislature are pushing their colleagues to debate and vote on legislation in person but won’t require everyone to wear masks – an environment Democrats are warning could put those who visit and work in the Capitol at risk. The inconsistent mask-wearing is emerging as a flashpoint between Democratic lawmakers who want all members to wear face coverings at all times until everyone is vaccinated and some Republicans who refuse to wear them. The tension spiked last week on the Senate chamber floor when Republican leaders of the Senate refused to allow Democratic members to participate virtually and did not require the body to wear masks while sitting and bellowing together in one space. Over the last two floor sessions in the Senate, about 10 Republicans did not wear masks – about 30% of the chamber. Both Senate leaders and the chairman of the health committee were among them. At one point, Democratic Sen. Chris Larson pointed out the Senate has a rule for male members to wear jackets but not face masks after Senate President Chris Kapenga asked him to change his attire.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: An official with the University of Wyoming said in a statement that an investigation into racist interruptions during a virtual Black history event last week has revealed one suspect was using an internet provider in Maryland. Administrators are now looking into more secure options for Zoom and other virtual events. University spokesperson Chad Baldwin said the other four suspects used virtual private networks, which made them appear to be calling from outside the United States, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. The university’s Black Studies Center was hosting a panel discussion Feb. 15 when panelists and attendees were interrupted by pornographic images and videos on the screen and a voice shouting racist slurs and phrases. “This has happened at dozens of other universities in recent months,” Baldwin said. “Our security analysts for our IT department feel strongly this was a coordinated effort by people from elsewhere. And that they’re doing this all across the country.” The university police and IT department are working with the FBI to investigate the incident, according to the statement.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/02/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/10/03/balloon-fiesta-yard-shark-street-stunts-news-around-states/50798083/", "title": "Injured musher, yard shark: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A state appeals court has upheld the felony convictions of a man who served 38 years as sheriff in a northern Alabama county. In the unanimous ruling Friday, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals also denied former Limestone County Sheriff Mike Blakely’s request for a new trial, AL.com reports. “This evidence was sufficient for the jury to have concluded that Blakely acted with intent to use his public office to obtain personal gain,” Presiding Judge Mary B. Windom wrote. Blakely was removed from office in August 2021 after a jury convicted him of theft and abuse of power. Prosecutors said the theft charge was tied to accusations that he deposited $4,000 of campaign funds into his personal account. The abuse of power charge was tied to Blakely borrowing money from a jail safe that held inmates’ money. Prosecutors said Blakely received $29,050 in interest-free loans from the safe. Blakely’s attorneys argued that no inmate was ever deprived of money. The trial judge gave him a three-year sentence. Blakely remains out on bond and can ask the Alabama Supreme Court to review the case. Blakely’s attorneys argued to the appeals court that the state failed to show sufficient evidence that he intentionally used his office for personal gain.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A reality television star and Iditarod musher was injured last week while helping to clean up storm damage along the state’s western coast. Jessie Holmes, who since 2015 has starred in “Life Below Zero,” a show about life in rural Alaska produced by National Geographic TV, was injured by falling debris in a building in the community of Golovin on Wednesday, the Anchorage Daily News reports. He was flown for treatment to Nome and then sent to an Anchorage hospital, where officials said he was treated and released. “I wanted to take a moment to let everyone know how much I appreciate all the love, support, and prayers,” Holmes wrote in a post on his kennel’s Facebook page Thursday. Parts of Alaska’s Bering Sea coast were left with severe damage beginning Sept. 16 when the remnants of Typhoon Merbok traveled north through the Bering Strait. Holmes had reached out to defending Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race champion Brent Sass and two other mushers, Jeff Deeter and Richie Beattie, to travel to hard-hit Golovin to volunteer in the cleanup effort, Sass told the Anchorage newspaper. On Wednesday, they were pulling waterlogged plywood and insulation to help them dry out, Sass said. They were standing underneath the plywood when Holmes pulled down a board, and the entire area collapsed on top of them. Holmes, who finished third in this year’s Iditarod, was trapped underneath the pile of plywood, insulation and other building materials.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: All Arizona parents now can use state tax money to send their children to private or religious schools or pay home-schooling costs after an effort by public school advocates to block a massive expansion of the state’s private school voucher law failed to collect enough signatures to block it. Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs announced Friday that her office’s review of signatures turned in a week ago to refer the expansion to the ballot came up short of the nearly 119,000 that were needed. Hobbs is a Democrat running for governor who opposed the plan. Republican Gov. Doug Ducey championed the plan and signed it into law in July. He celebrated on Twitter, saying “Let’s Roll!” and “Parents Prevail.” Arizona now has the nation’s most expansive private school voucher law. It allows parents of the state’s more than 1.2 million school-age children to get 90% of the state money that would normally go to their local public schools and use it for private or other school costs. That’s typically about $7,000 per student. The effort to block the expansion passed by the GOP-controlled Legislature over Democratic opposition was organized by Save Our Schools Arizona, a grassroots group of teachers, parents and public education advocates who blocked a similar expansion in 2017. Voters then overwhelmingly rejected the law in the 2018 election.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Voters will decide next month whether recreational marijuana will be legal in the state. Issue 4, to legalize cannabis for residents 21 and older, will be on the Nov. 8 ballots. And the votes will count, the state’s high court has ruled. The Arkansas Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the petition submitted by Responsible Growth Arkansas is sufficient. “Accordingly, we grant the petition and order the Secretary of State to certify the proposed amendment for inclusion on the Nov. 8 general election ballot,” the court said in its opinion. Steve Lancaster, an attorney for Responsible Growth Arkansas, the group that gathered the petition signatures, said he learned of the ruling late Thursday afternoon. “It was a surprise to all of us,” Lancaster said. About 193,000 signature were submitted – over 100,000 signatures more than required to make the ballot. “We were well above what we needed,” Lancaster said. “The result is what we expected from the very beginning. We put a lot of work into a good ballot title, and the court agreed this is good to go to let the voters in Arkansas make their own decision on this. And we’re very grateful to the court for giving the people the right to make this decision.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday announced that oil refineries could start selling more polluting winter-blend gasoline ahead of schedule to ease soaring fuel prices, directly contradicting his own goals for reducing climate emissions. The average cost of a gallon of gas was $6.30 in California on Friday, far above the national average of $3.80, according to AAA. Newsom administration officials said the difference between state prices and the national average has never been larger. The Democratic governor also called on state lawmakers to pass a new tax on oil company profits and return the money to California taxpayers. Lawmakers don’t return to the Capitol until January, and Newsom’s office provided few details on the proposal. “They’re ripping you off,” he said of the oil industry in a video posted to Twitter. Oil industry representatives said it is state regulations that cause higher prices in California than the rest of the country. The summer blend of gasoline that refineries are required by law to produce in the hotter months costs more money to make but is designed to limit greenhouse gas emissions and smog during summer months. Most refineries can’t switch to the winter blend until November.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: When people who had been homeless for years moved off the city’s streets and into apartments, they were far less likely to end up in hospital emergency rooms or get locked up in jail. But they still died at the same rate as those who lived outside, the Colorado Sun reports. That’s the grim finding from a new study of Denver’s social impact bond program, which sends outreach workers to find the highest users of taxpayer-funded services including hospitals, detox centers and the jail. Hundreds of people who were chronically homeless have been housed through the program, which began seven years ago. Previous research showed that the first 250 participants had cost the government a total of $7.3 million per year when they lived outside and in shelters and cycled through the health care and criminal justice systems. After they were housed, researchers found a 40% reduction in arrests, a 30% reduction in jail stays, a 65% decrease in detox services and a 40% drop in emergency department visits. The reductions made up for half of the cost of the program, which was started with $8.6 million from eight private investors as well as local housing resources. The researchers, from the Urban Institute based in Washington, D.C., noticed high levels of mortality among those who were living in supportive housing. A second study confirmed the death rate among those in apartments was the same as those living outside.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Citing a U.S. Supreme Court decision earlier this year, gun rights groups and firearms owners have launched another attempt to overturn the state’s ban on certain semi-automatic rifles that was enacted in response to the Sandy Hook School shooting. A new lawsuit was filed Thursday in federal court by three gun owners, the Connecticut Citizens Defense League and the Second Amendment Foundation seeking to overturn the state prohibition on what they call “modern sporting arms” such as AR-15-style rifles like the one used to kill 20 first graders and six educators at the Newtown school in 2012. “We all deserve to live in safe communities, but denying ownership of the most commonly owned firearms in the country is not the way to achieve it,” Holly Sullivan, president of the Connecticut Citizens Defense League, said in a statement. “The recent U.S. Supreme Court decision … has opened the door to this challenge, and we believe Connecticut will be hard pressed to prove its statutes are constitutional.” State officials vowed to defend the 2013 gun laws. “Connecticut’s gun laws save lives, and we are not going back,” state Attorney General William Tong said in a statement. “We will not allow weapons of war back into our schools, our houses of worship, our grocery stores, and our communities.”\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Perfect attendance isn’t just for bragging rights anymore – for one University of Delaware student, it’s going to mean money, too. This year the University of Delaware athletics department has unveiled the Cockpit HENergy Challenge, a high-stakes contest to incentivize football game attendance. At the end of the season, one UD student who attended all six home football games will be randomly chosen to win $10,000 in financial aid. “Student engagement is really important to us, and it’s important to the program, in terms of the support and stance and making that atmosphere on game day feel really positive, not just for the team but for the students as well,” said Nick LaMarca, who oversees marketing and engagement for the UD athletics department. LaMarca said the department chose to give out financial aid as the prize after “thinking about what’s important to the students.” He said the money comes from the athletics department specifically, not the university overall. To win the competition, UD students must scan their student football tickets before halftime at every home game. Students who participate in the games – including players, marching band members and people in the UD spirit program – are not eligible.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Two bills introduced in Congress on Thursday aim to begin the process of creating a national museum for American LGBTQ+ history and culture in D.C., WUSA-TV reports. U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., a co-chair of the Congressional LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus, introduced the pair of bills ahead of the nation preparing to celebrate LGBTQ+ History Month in October. “As our community faces unprecedented attacks and attempts to erase our history, we must preserve and protect our stories for future generations,” Pocan said. The bills would establish an eight-member commission to study the potential creation of the national museum and to establish it within the Smithsonian Institution. The bills would be required to be signed into law to become the newest Smithsonian. Pocan said it is vital to remember the nation’s collective past, especially as certain states seek to constrain and repeal existing rights by passing bills that are harmful to LGBTQ+ youth and the community as a whole. During the process, the developed commission would look into the success of the potential Smithsonian museum by creating a plan of action for the establishment, proposing a fundraising path, identifying potential locations within the District to house the facility and more.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Myers: Photos and videos of sharks and other marine life swimming in suburban floodwaters make for popular hoaxes during massive storms. But a cellphone video filmed during Hurricane Ian’s assault on southwest Florida isn’t just another fish story. The eye-popping video, which showed a large, dark fish with sharp dorsal fins thrashing around an inundated Fort Myers backyard, racked up more than 12 million views on Twitter within a day, as users responded with disbelief and comparisons to the “Sharknado” film series. Dominic Cameratta, a local real estate developer, confirmed he filmed the clip from his back patio Wednesday morning when he saw something “flopping around” in his neighbor’s flooded yard. “I didn’t know what it was – it just looked like a fish or something,” he said. “I zoomed in, and all my friends are like, ‘It’s like a shark, man!’ ” He guessed the fish was about 4 feet long. Experts were of mixed opinion on whether the clip showed a shark or another large fish, likely a swordfish. George Burgess, former director of the Florida Museum of Natural History’s shark program, said in an email that it “appears to be a juvenile shark,” while Dr. Neil Hammerschlag, director of the University of Miami’s shark conservation program, wrote that “it’s pretty hard to tell.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A federal judge on Friday found that Georgia election practices challenged by a group associated with Democrat Stacey Abrams do not violate the constitutional rights of voters, ruling in favor of the state on all remaining issues in a lawsuit filed nearly four years ago. “Although Georgia’s election system is not perfect, the challenged practices violate neither the constitution nor the VRA,” U.S. District Judge Steve Jones in Atlanta wrote, referring to the Voting Rights Act of 1965. He detailed his reasoning in a 288-page order. The lawsuit was filed in November 2018, just weeks after Abrams narrowly lost the governor’s race to Republican Brian Kemp. Throughout that contest, Abrams had accused Kemp, then secretary of state, of using his position as the state’s top elections official to promote voter suppression. Kemp vehemently denied the allegations. Kemp on Friday applauded the ruling, calling it a loss for Abrams. “Judge Jones’ ruling exposes this legal effort for what it really is: a tool wielded by a politician hoping to wrongfully weaponize the legal system to further her own political goals,” Kemp said in a statement. Abrams and Fair Fight expressed disappointment in the decision but said the lawsuit helped bring about positive change in Georgia.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin visited the state last week amid lingering community frustration and distrust after jet fuel from a military storage facility last year spilled into Pearl Harbor’s drinking water, poisoned thousands of military families and threatened the purity of Honolulu’s water supply. Austin traveled to the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility in the hills above Pearl Harbor on Friday and met the commander of the joint task force in charge of draining its tanks so it can be shut down. He also met with several families affected by the fuel spill and Hawaii state officials, the military said in a news release. The meetings were closed to the media, and Austin didn’t hold a news conference afterward. Outside Joint Base Pearl Harbor Hickam, several dozen protesters held signs saying “Navy Lies” and “Shut Down Red Hill.” People driving by – including many exiting the base – honked in support. Samantha McCoy, whose husband is in the Air Force, said her family suffered migraines, rashes, skin sores and gastrointestinal problems that only subsided when they moved out of military housing last month. She called on Austin to make more medical care available to families. “It took four months of daily migraines to even get a referral to a neurologist. And that’s really unacceptable,” she said at the protest.\n\nIdaho\n\nMoscow: A box truck equipped with a bright LED billboard began circling around the University of Idaho campus Friday. “Pregnant? You still have a choice,” said one of the bright blue-and-white messages flashing across the side. “You can still get abortion pills by mail,” read another message. The moving billboard was a salvo by Mayday Health against Idaho’s anti-abortion laws, including some that prohibit state employees from promoting or endorsing abortion or emergency contraception. The organization seeks to inform people in anti-abortion states how to access abortion and contraception. Mayday Health chose Moscow for the action after the university warned employees not to refer students to abortion or birth control providers lest they run afoul of the state laws. “This effort is part of protecting free speech and the First Amendment,” said Kaori Sueyoshi, Mayday Health ‘s head of strategy. “We want to make sure that students at the University of Idaho and surrounding area have accurate information about how to get birth control pills, Plan B (emergency contraception) as well as how to get safe abortion access.” University of Idaho Provost Torrey Lawrence said the legal guidance simply was intended to protect staffers. Boise State University recently issued similar, albeit less strict, advice.\n\nIllinois\n\nZion: Millions of Ahmadi Muslims around the world believe holy miracle happened in Zion 115 years ago. The Ahmadis view this small city, 40 miles north of Chicago on the shores of Lake Michigan, as a place of special religious significance for their global messianic faith. Their reverence for the community began more than a century ago – with fighting words, a prayer duel and a prophecy. Zion was founded in 1900 as a Christian theocracy by John Alexander Dowie, an evangelical and early Pentecostal preacher who drew thousands to the city with his faith healing ministry. The Ahmadis believe their founder, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, defended the faith from Dowie’s verbal attacks against Islam and defeated him in a sensational faceoff armed only with prayers. Most current residents may not have an inkling of that high-stakes holy fight of a bygone era. But for the Ahmadis, it is one that has created an eternal bond with the city of Zion. Over the weekend, thousands of Ahmadi Muslims from around the world congregated in the city to celebrate that century-old miracle and a significant milestone in the life of Zion and of their faith: the building of the city’s first mosque.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: All tax rebate payments from the state’s budget surplus have been printed and mailed, Indiana State Auditor Tera Klutz said. “We successfully completed printing on September 21 and sent the last batch of automatic taxpayer refund checks to the postal service on September 22,” Klutz said in a statement Thursday. “Most Hoosiers who filed a 2020 tax return in 2021 should have received their automatic taxpayer refund via direct deposit or mailed check by now.” More than 1.5 million checks with the $125 refund were mailed, Klutz’s office said. Eligible Hoosiers will also receive additional payments for $200 for individuals or $400 for couples filing jointly. The Indiana Department of Revenue noted that the eligibility requirements for the two refunds are different. Although all who were eligible for the initial $125 payment qualify for the subsequent $200 refund, some who were not eligible for the first do qualify for the second. Direct deposit payments for the first round of rebates were sent starting in May.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Nearly two years after a federal policy required the nation’s hospitals to unveil the hidden costs of medical care, a tiny fraction of Iowa facilities are in compliance, according to a new report. And patients are paying the price. Only six of the state’s 61 hospitals in Iowa reviewed by researchers – 10% – have complied with the federal rule intended to bring more transparency to health care costs, according to the audit by PatientRightsAdvocate.org published in August. Iowa’s compliance rate is even worse than the national rate. The audit of 2,000 hospitals nationwide found that 319 hospitals, or 16%, complied with the rule. Noncompliant hospitals ranged from small, independent hospitals to some of the largest health care systems in the country, according to PatientRightsAdvocate.org. Iowa health care officials contend their noncompliance is not for lack of trying. Hospitals face significant barriers to publishing the massive amounts of data required under the federal rule, they say. “If you don’t have the knowledge, tools, resources or financial availability to get it done, I’m sure hospitals are not compliant for those reasons,” said Heather Vandewater, business office and patient access director for Mary Greeley Medical Center in Ames.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Three months after the National Park Service announced James Williams as the new superintendent of Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Park, the site opened its doors Friday in celebration of the 30th anniversary of its designation. The symposium at the Brown v. Board of Education site also welcomed leaders from five new affiliated areas and an additional National Park Service site. “It’s just interesting to me to get to know the people, get to know their stories, and see the potential for us as an agency to help the American people understand the complexity of the Brown decision and all the history that went into it,” Williams said. Last week’s symposium is historic because it brought together – for the first time – people from each of the sites that are part of Brown v. Board of Education National Historical Park, said Sean Dixon, president of Visit Topeka. He noted that President Joe Biden last May signed the Brown v. Board of Education National Historical Park Expansion and Redesignation Act. That act continues federal government efforts to recognize the landmark Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision, which banned racial segregation in schools in 1954.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: An advisory committee set up this year by Gov. Andy Beshear reported that many Kentucky adults favor legalizing medical marijuana, Beshear’s office said Friday. The Democratic governor formed the Medical Cannabis Advisory Committee after a bill to legalize medical marijuana died in the state Senate this year. The committee found that Kentuckians who suffer from chronic conditions are not getting relief from painkillers and opioids and fear their addictive properties, Beshear said. The committee also reported that residents are crossing state lines to obtain medical cannabis where it is legal and want to return to Kentucky without breaking the law. The panel found that military veterans from Kentucky reported that cannabis use eased post-traumatic stress disorder, Beshear’s office said in a news release. Justice and Public Safety Secretary Kerry Harvey, the committee co-chair, said the panel did not hear any opposition at town hall meetings on the topic. “Everyone who spoke supported legalizing medical cannabis in Kentucky,” Harvey said. “We heard from many Kentuckians that use cannabis for its beneficial medical effects but can only do so by breaking the law as it now exists.” Beshear said he is considering the information while he decides what steps to take next to legalize medical marijuana, which he supports.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Rule No. 1 for this week’s animal blessing at a Catholic university: “Please leave venomous animals at home.” Rule No. 2: Be prepared to clean up after your pet. “We will provide a pet station with complimentary water and waste bags,” said a news release Thursday. The group blessing of the animals – all comers welcome – will be the first since 1999 at Loyola University New Orleans. The Rev. Justin Daffron, Loyola’s interim president, and Parleaux, a black cockapoo he trained as the university’s therapy dog, will attend, university spokeswoman Patricia Murret said Thursday. The service is scheduled for Tuesday evening on the lawn next to the university’s church. Oct. 4 is the feast day of St. Francis of Assisi, patron saint of animals, ecology, merchants and Italy. Churches and schools from the East Coast to the West Coast hold Blessing of the Animals services. Murret said they were popular at Loyola during the 1990s but apparently fell by the wayside for the next two decades. She doesn’t know why. She said someone suggested resuming the tradition at a late August or early September meeting “about alumni events, bringing people together, reconnecting in this post-pandemic world as we return to life and joy and connections with each other.”\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state housing authority has halted new applications for emergency rental assistance while it waits to find out if a request for more federal money will be approved. MaineHousing said in a statement that an “unanticipated uptick in demand” and uncertainty about new revenue prompted the decision to pause applications. The program started in March 2021 and stopped taking applications at the end of the day Thursday. The housing authority described the program as a temporary support that is funded via federal money through COVID-19 relief laws. The authority said the pause will allow more than 11,000 pending requests to be processed. The program has helped more than 33,000 households and spent more than $275 million, MaineHousing officials said. The program is mostly used to pay rent directly to landlords. MaineHousing spokesperson Scott Thistle said the pause in applications “a fiscally responsible and reasonable move that will allow us to ensure all who have already applied to this program get a fair opportunity to receive help.” Dozens of other states have paused or ended similar programs.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Aging infrastructure contributed to an E. coli contamination of the city of Baltimore’s water system in early September, officials said last week. A confluence of events in several parts of the water system reduced chlorine levels, which led to three positive tests for E. coli, a Department of Public Works official told The Washington Post. City officials also detailed their findings during a City Council hearing Thursday. The contamination led to a boil-water advisory for a wide swath of the city and into Baltimore County, which is served by the city system, The Baltimore Sun reports. No illnesses were linked to the contaminated water, a city spokeswoman said Friday.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: A former tenant charged with setting a fire at an apartment building that claimed the lives of four people pleaded not guilty at her arraignment Friday and was held without bail. Yvonne Ngoiri, 36, faces four counts of second-degree murder as well as arson and assault charges in connection with the May 14 blaze in Worcester. Among the victims was a man who in 2018 had sued right-wing radio host Alex Jones’ Infowars website. Ngoiri, who once lived in the building, was taken into custody Thursday, the office of Worcester District Attorney Joseph Early Jr. said in a statement. The cause of the early-morning fire at the three-story, six-unit building was determined to be “incendiary,” according to the district attorney’s office, but no motive was disclosed in court. Ngoiri is scheduled back in court Nov. 29. The victims have previously been identified as Joseph Garchali, 47; Christopher Lozeau, 53; Vincent Page, 41; and Marcel Fontaine, 29. In addition, several residents were injured, including one who jumped from a third-story window and two who suffered from smoke inhalation. The building had about 20 tenants. Two nearby buildings were also damaged. Fontaine sued Infowars in 2018, saying it posted his photograph on its website the day of a mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida, depicting him as the gunman.\n\nMichigan\n\nOdessa Township: A homeowner has been charged with shooting and wounding an 84-year-old woman who was canvassing door-to-door against a proposed constitutional amendment that would guarantee the right to abortion in the state. Richard Harvey was charged Friday on charges of felonious assault and reckless discharge of a firearm causing injury charges, Ionia County Prosecutor Kyle Butler said in a statement. Harvey surrendered to authorities Friday morning and was being held in the county jail. The State Police investigated the Sept. 20 shooting at Harvey’s home in Odessa Township and submitted charging recommendations to the prosecutor’s office, Butler said. The canvasser, Joan Jacobson, told investigators she was asking a woman at the home to vote against Proposal 3 in November when she was told to leave. Jacobson told The Detroit News that she was headed to her car when she “heard a shot” and “felt some pain.” Jacobson said she then drove to a local police station and was later treated at a hospital. Harvey, 74, told WOOD-TV he shot Jacobson accidentally while she was arguing with his wife, and he told Jacobson numerous times to leave their property. Harvey said he fired a warning shot at a tree, and the woman continued “ranting and raving” and waving a clipboard.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Mayor Jacob Frey said Thursday that he is nominating a former public safety director from New Jersey as his top pick for the city’s next police chief, at a time when the department is struggling with depleted staffing and the uncertainty of an ongoing federal investigation following the killing of George Floyd. If confirmed by the City Council, Brian O’Hara, deputy mayor of Newark, would be taking over a department that some city leaders and community members had sought to abolish in recent years, and he would lead the agency through court-ordered changes that are expected as the result of the U.S. Department of Justice’s ongoing probe into policing practices. “What we heard loud and clear is that people wanted a changemaker,” Frey said. “They wanted a reform-minded candidate that would both be accountable to the city of Minneapolis and our residents and also able to drive down crime in a serious way. … Minneapolis has been asking for change, and Brian O’Hara, the deputy mayor, is answering that call.” O’Hara said Thursday that he will work toward driving down gun violence, building up ranks in the police department, and working with the community “to heal the heart of this great city,” and he plans to build a department so good that people of all races and backgrounds will want to be part of it.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The University of Mississippi is paying tribute to 89-year-old James Meredith 60 years after white protesters erupted into violence as he became the first Black student to enroll in what was then a bastion of Deep South segregation. Meredith was honored Saturday during the Ole Miss-Kentucky football game, receiving a framed Ole Miss jersey with the number 62 – for 1962, the year he integrated the university. The ceremony happened two days after he attended the Rebels’ practice to speak to players. “He came and revolutionized our thinking. He came to open our closed society,” Donald Cole, who retired in 2018 as the university’s assistant provost and head of multicultural affairs, said during a celebration Wednesday night. The enigmatic Meredith, who lives in Jackson, has long resisted the label of “civil rights leader,” as if civil rights are separate from other human rights. He has said his effort to enter Ole Miss was his own battle to conquer white supremacy. Meredith’s being honored at the Ole Miss-Kentucky game was an ironic echo of history. Two days before he enrolled on the Oxford campus in 1962, race-baiting Gov. Ross Barnett worked a white crowd into a frenzy at a football stadium in Jackson. Ole Miss fans waved Confederate flags to support their Rebels over the Kentucky Wildcats and to defy any move toward racial integration.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: Lawmakers on Thursday gave final approval to an income tax cut that Gov. Mike Parson requested and ditched a last-minute proposal to cut corporate taxes. The Republican-led Missouri House voted 98-32 in favor of the bill, which would cut income taxes from 5.3% to 4.95% beginning next year and phase in additional cuts until the rate hits 4.5%. The bill applies to the top income tax rate, which covers those who make more than about $8,700 a year in taxable income. The additional cuts would be triggered by revenue growth benchmarks tied to inflation. The roughly $1 billion measure also eliminates the lowest tax bracket, meaning earners who bring in less than about $1,000 a year no longer will have to pay state income taxes. The measure now heads to Parson, who is expected to sign it. The Republican governor called lawmakers back to work to spend some of the state’s record revenue surplus on tax cuts. “We are thrilled that the General Assembly has answered our call to cut Missourians’ taxes and return some of their hard-earned dollars,” he said in a statement. If Parson signs the bill into law, taxpayers who make between $22,000 and $66,000 a year would on average see savings of $10 to $50 next year because of the income tax cut, according to an analysis by the Missouri Budget Project.\n\nMontana\n\nBridger: An evacuation warning was put in place for residents near the town after a train derailed, and two fuel cars ruptured and leaked an estimated 31,000 gallons of gasoline, authorities said Saturday. BNSF Railway Co. said there were no injuries, and crews were working with local officials and hazardous-materials responders to safely clear the site. The derailment of the southbound train occurred on a curving portion of the track about half a mile east of the small south-central Montana town of Bridger, population of about 660, about 45 miles southwest of Billings. “Two of the derailed cars were compromised and leaked gasoline,” BNSF spokesman Ben Wilemon said in an email to the Associated Press. “The cause of the derailment is under investigation.” A 30,000-gallon tank emptied completely, and a second damaged tank leaked about 1,000 gallons before BNSF workers repaired the tank, The Billings Gazette reports. There was no immediate information on whether the spill contaminated groundwater or the area’s irrigation systems. Authorities said about 15 cars derailed not long after midnight. Four of the derailed cars contained petroleum. Officials said the train was also moving coal, sorghum and particle board. The tracks in that area in some portions run near the meandering Clark’s Fork of the Yellowstone River.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A passenger’s cellphone automatically alerted responders after a car hit a tree early Sunday in a crash that killed all six of its young occupants, authorities said. Five men in the car died at the scene of the crash about 2:15 a.m. in Lincoln, about 3 miles east of the state Capitol, police said. A 24-year-old woman died later at a hospital where she was taken in critical condition. The five men who died included the 22-year-old driver. The other victims were one 21-year-old, one 23-year-old and two 22-year-olds. Police did not release any details on what caused the crash but said it was reported by an iPhone that detected the impact and called responders automatically when the phone’s owner didn’t respond.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Thousands of people in hundreds of cars took over northern Nevada parking lots and intersections Friday night and into Saturday, performing stunts in souped-up vehicles and leading to crashes and arrests, police said. Police beefed up nighttime staffing after social media posts urged people from San Francisco and Portland, Oregon, to come to the “sideshow” in Reno, Police Lt. Michael Browett said. The disturbances started late Friday as several hundred cars and their occupants met in the parking lot of a still-open Walmart store. Police tried to break up the crowds, and drivers sped off, meeting up again at several intersections and industrial parks into Saturday morning. A dozen people were arrested, 14 cars impounded and 33 people issued citations. Browett said Reno is just the latest city to see late-night takeovers by auto enthusiasts who ignore law enforcement efforts to stop the illegal and dangerous activity. “I don’t know what the underlying movement is with this group, but it goes a little beyond cars,” Browett said. “They’re very anti-authoritarian, and they basically just show up and do whatever they want.” In Reno, no one was seriously injured. But Browett said those arrested face charges including reckless driving, hit and run causing injury and weapons possession.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nNashua: Investigators are trying to determine the cause of a fire that heavily damaged a strip mall, the fire department said in a Saturday news release. The fire in the building on Amherst Street that contained a number of businesses was reported about 7:30 p.m. Friday. People who were inside a pizza shop and an Asian market left the building before firefighters arrived. The fire was brought under control in about an hour. There were no injuries. The Nashua Fire Department says the structure was left unusable by the fire. The City of Nashua Fire Marshal’s office is trying to determine the cause of the fire.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The Democrat-led state Senate on Thursday confirmed Gov. Phil Murphy’s former chief counsel to be New Jersey’s attorney general. Attorney General Matt Platkin had been serving as the state’s acting top law enforcement official since earlier this year when Murphy nominated him. “I pledge to continue to work tirelessly to end the scourge of gun violence, to strengthen trust between law enforcement and the broader public, and to protect the rights of our residents,” he said. Platkin, 35, served as the Murphy administration’s top attorney overseeing pending bills and executive orders for the Democratic governor from the start of the administration in early 2018 until late 2020. He left to take a post at the firm Lowenstein Sandler where he handled white-collar cases and business disputes. Platkin was a fixture during Murphy’s regular news conferences during the COVID-19 pandemic and regularly fielded questions related to executive orders aimed at curbing the effects of the virus. He was also a lead negotiator for the governor for three annual budget bills and oversaw the vast appointment and nominations apparatus in the governor’s office. New Jersey’s governor is among the most powerful in the country because the state constitution provides for the executive to appoint many offices in the state.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Hundreds of hot air balloons lifted off Saturday morning, marking the start of an annual fiesta that has drawn pilots and spectators from across the globe to the high desert for 50 years. As one of the most photographed events in the world, the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta has become an economic driver for the state’s largest city and a rare – and colorful – opportunity for enthusiasts to be within arm’s reach as the giant balloons are unpacked and inflated. Three of the original pilots who participated in the first fiesta in 1972 and the family members of others are among this year’s attendees. That first year, 13 balloons launched from an open lot near a shopping center on what was then the edge of Albuquerque. It has since grown into a multimillion-dollar production. Pilot Gene Dennis, 78, remembers the snowstorm that almost caused him to miss the 1972 fiesta. He had to rearrange his flight plans from Michigan so he could make it to Albuquerque in time. The weather was perfect when he got to New Mexico, said Dennis, who flew under the alias “Captain Phairweather.” He was quoted at the time as saying he had brought good weather with him. He was on the hook again, as pilots hope predictions for the rest of opening weekend are fair. “Ballooning is infectious,” Dennis said, describing being aloft like drifting in a dream, quietly observing the countryside below.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Struggling taxi drivers have gotten $225 million in debt relief over the past two weeks, but thousands more loans have yet to be refinanced after a cabbie debt crisis, officials and advocates said Friday as the relief program deadline was extended. Over 1,000 loans have been refinanced in the first two weeks of the program. It was announced in August after drivers appealed for years for help with a crippling economic crunch surrounding the city’s famous yellow cabs. “Every time we raised our hands to hail a cab at a curb, they responded. Now it’s time for us to stand with them, and that’s what we’ve done,” Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, said at a news conference where scores of drivers lined the steps of City Hall. Still, the major lender participating in the program, Marblegate Asset Management, said it had yet to hear from the borrowers of roughly 2,000 eligible loans. An estimated 850 loans handled by other lenders haven’t been addressed, according to Bhairavi Desai of the Taxi Workers Alliance, a drivers’ union. Officials urged drivers with Marblegate loans to inquire by the program deadline – now extended by a week, to next Friday – and encouraged other lenders to participate.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: One week before election officials begin processing by-mail ballots in the closely watched Southern swing state, the GOP is pursuing its latest legal challenge to the electoral procedures established by the Democrat-led State Board of Elections. The North Carolina Republican Party filed two motions in Wake County Superior Court last week, asking the court to block the board from enforcing its prohibition of county election officials scrutinizing signatures on absentee voting documents. The legal challenge follows the state board’s July rejection of a Republican Party request to authorize county officials to compare signatures on absentee ballot request forms and container envelopes with the signatures included in voter registration records. Citing concerns that the proposal would create unequal voting access, the board denied the request in a 3-2 party-line vote, with three Democrats voting against signature checks and two Republicans voting in favor. “Why the Board of Elections continues to undermine the integrity of our elections is inexplicable,” North Carolina GOP Chairman Michael Whatley said. “The NCGOP is pursuing this lawsuit to ensure our elections remain secure and free from doubt.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMcHenry: A man accused in the fatal hit-and-run of a teenager after a small-town street dance is now charged with murder, after prosecutors say he intentionally ran over the 18-year-old, according to upgraded charges made public Friday. Shannon Brandt, 41, was initially charged with criminal vehicular homicide in the Sept. 18 killing of Cayler Ellingson, but that charge has been dropped. The new charge – murder with a dangerous weapon – is a felony that carries a maximum sentence of life in prison upon conviction. Brandt is also charged with leaving the scene of a crash that resulted in death. According to a probable cause affidavit released Friday, Brandt told a 911 dispatcher that if it had been a total accident, he wouldn’t be so scared, “but I know it was more than that.” Brandt initially told authorities that there had been a political argument and that Ellingson was part of a “Republican extremist group.” Many conservatives took to social media to decry the alleged motive in Ellingson’s death. But investigators have said that the case was not political in nature and that there is no evidence to support Brandt’s claim that Ellingson was a Republican extremist. Brandt’s attorney, Mark Friese, said Friday that he would not comment yet because the Ellingson family is grieving, the community is in mourning, and he hasn’t received all of the case background.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Medical marijuana patients are happier with the state’s program than they once were, but they continue to face high prices and a shortage of doctors who can recommend cannabis, according to a new study. The report from Ohio State University’s Drug Enforcement and Policy Center found more than half of survey respondents reported some level of satisfaction with the medical cannabis program, including 15.3% who were “extremely satisfied.” About 35% of people were dissatisfied with the program, an improvement from 55% last year. The center conducted its survey in April and March and received more than 2,500 responses. The high cost of medical marijuana in Ohio is the biggest problem, according to patients. While the price of plant product in the state declined 17% during the past year, costs in neighboring Michigan dropped even further, making a trip out of state more appealing than buying from an Ohio dispensary. During a 13-month period, an Ohio patient on average paid $4.08 more per gram than someone in Michigan. “They see a huge price difference between Michigan and Ohio, and I think that’s one of the things that might be driving dissatisfaction,” said Jana Hrdinova, the study’s author and administrative director of the Drug Enforcement and Policy Center.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: A teenager was killed and another wounded in a shooting at a high school homecoming football game Friday night, police said. The victims, both 17, were shot during the event at McLain High School for Science and Technology shortly before 10 p.m., according to a statement by the Tulsa Police Department posted on Twitter and Facebook. “When Officers arrived, we found two victims amongst the crowd of hundreds. One 17-year-old male was pronounced dead at the scene,” the post said. The surviving victim was taken to a hospital in critical condition but has improved to stable condition, the statement said. Several officers and a K-9 unit searched nearby neighborhoods but were not immediately able to find the suspected shooter, who ran away from the scene, police said. Police said the suspect is believed to be another 17-year-old.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: State environmental regulators have issued a $2.7 million fine to an electric charging company over accusations it sold fraudulent credits through the agency’s clean fuels program. The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality said Friday that it discovered Thompson Technical Services, or TTS Charging, sold more than $2 million in fraudulent credits, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports. The program, implemented in 2016, is designed to help the state reduce its greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector by 37% by 2035. It provides credits as incentives to companies that produce transportation fuels like electricity or biofuels. Those companies can then sell credits to other companies in order for them to comply with state emissions rules. According to DEQ, TTS Charging falsely claimed more than 16,000 in credits in June, alleging it dispensed nearly 15 million kilowatt hours of electricity from three vehicle charging stations. “They hadn’t dispensed any electricity; they hadn’t even set up the charging stations,” said Harry Esteve, a spokesperson for the agency. The company then sold the credits for nearly $1.8 million to oil and natural gas transportation company, Elbow River Marketing, based in Canada. The state agency has revoked TTS Charging’s account with the clean fuels program.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: Max Baer, the chief justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, has died only months before he was set to retire, the court confirmed Saturday. He was 74. Baer died overnight at his home near Pittsburgh, the court said in a news release. The court didn’t give a reason for his death but called his “sudden passing” a “tremendous loss for the court and all of Pennsylvania.” The court said Justice Debra Todd now becomes chief justice “as the justice of longest and continuous service on the court.” She is the first female chief justice in the commonwealth’s history, a court spokesperson confirmed. “Chief Justice Baer was an influential and intellectual jurist whose unwavering focus was on administering fair and balanced justice,” Todd said in the release. “He was a tireless champion for children, devoted to protecting and providing for our youngest and most vulnerable citizens.” Gov. Tom Wolf ordered state flags at commonwealth facilities, public buildings and grounds lowered to half-staff, saying he was “extremely saddened” by the death of such a “respected and esteemed jurist with decades of service to our courts and our commonwealth.” Baer, a Duquesne Law graduate, was an Allegheny County family court judge and an administrative judge in family court before he was elected to the high court in 2003 and became its chief justice last year. Baer also served as deputy attorney general for Pennsylvania from 1975 to 1980 and was in private practice before entering the judiciary.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The most closely guarded secret entrusted to the governor may be knowing what happens on the NBC singing competition “The Voice.” For several weeks, it was rumored that Gov. Dan McKee’s daughter, Kara McKee, was lined up for an on-screen audition for the show, which airs on Monday and Tuesday nights. Last week, the governor’s office confirmed that she would be on the show but declined to say more. The Democrat sidestepped direct questions about how well his daughter fares to talk about how wonderful she is. “We’re very proud of our family, and Kara in particular right now – she’s taken over from my mom ... in terms of being the star of the family,” he said. “We’re very proud of Kara and her move to spend the time on a music career that she’s left the corporate world to pursue.” McKee’s 94-year-old mother, Willa McKee, who moved back in with her son’s family, stars in a popular campaign ad whose punchline says that her son isn’t doing too bad “for a governor that lives with his mother.” His daughter, 37, most recently worked in digital operations for TJX, the corporate parent of TJ Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods. Why won’t the proud papa talk about how she does on the competition? “We signed all these agreements,” he said, referring to nondisclosure agreements.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Gov. Henry McMaster has temporarily suspended campaign activities as he leads the state’s response to Hurricane Ian. McMaster’s campaign said the Republican incumbent canceled a fundraiser scheduled for Friday night in Clemson, as well as an appearance for tailgating before the Clemson Tigers’ football game Saturday. McMaster had been talking with officials across the state and holding daily briefings last week as the state made preparations for the storm, which ravaged Florida and barreled onward to South Carolina’s coast. Politics and hurricanes often collide in the state, where the final months before the November general elections can turn into busy storm seasons. In 2018, both McMaster and his Democratic opponent, then-Rep. James Smith, pulled down their campaign events as Hurricane Florence approached the state. Smith, who was a major in the South Carolina National Guard, was activated during that storm response, tasked with coordinating the distribution of resources across the state.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem indicated Friday during her reelection campaign’s lone debate with her Democratic challenger, state lawmaker Jamie Smith, that if reelected she will uphold the state’s abortion ban that provides no exceptions for rape or incest. The Republican governor explained her position simply as “pro-life,” while pledging to push for expanded parental leave in the state and alleviate the toll of inflation on people’s budgets. Smith called Noem’s stance extreme and said it was endangering women’s lives and causing concern among physicians for its lack of clarity on when an abortion is allowed – only to save the life of a pregnant woman. “It’s clear to me that South Dakotans overwhelmingly support a woman’s right to an abortion,” Smith said. “We talk about freedom all the time, except the freedom to make this choice.” The gubernatorial race’s lone head-to-head meeting of the two candidates featured Noem touting her record of a hands-off approach to the COVID-19 pandemic. Smith, who is facing an uphill election in the heavily Republican state, cast himself as a moderate. He was quick to point out that the grocery-tax repeal Noem suddenly embraced last week was an initiative he has been pushing for years, and when the state House passed the proposal in March, support from Noem was lacking.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Problems with rape kit evidence testing keep haunting Memphis. A city long plagued by a heavy backlog of untested sexual assault kits was shaken by Cleotha Henderson’s arrest in the killing of Eliza Fletcher after she was abducted during a morning jog last month. So when authorities said his DNA was linked to a rape that occurred nearly a year earlier – charging him separately days after he was arrested in Fletcher’s killing – an outraged city turned to the obvious question: Why was he still on the streets? The case of Henderson, who already has served 20 years in prison for a kidnapping he committed at 16, has reignited criticism of Tennessee’s sexual assault testing process. That has included calls for shorter delays from the testing agency, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, and questions about why Memphis didn’t seek to fast-track a kit that could have been tested in days. Instead, it took nearly a year, unearthing key evidence too late to charge Henderson before Fletcher’s killing. The tragic outcome brings back memories from the early 2010s, when Memphis revealed a backlog of about 12,000 untested rape kits that took years to whittle down and led to a lawsuit that’s still ongoing. The new rape charges have spurred another lawsuit accusing the Memphis Police Department of negligence for the delay.\n\nTexas\n\nConroe: A deeply divided federal appeals court has ruled that a Texas judge may start the day with prayer, overturning a district court decision. Judges on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans split 2-1 in opinions handed down Thursday, reversing a ruling made without a trial by U.S. District Judge Kenneth M. Hoyt. Montgomery County Justice of the Peace Wayne Mack doesn’t force anyone to attend the prayers before court formally opens, Judge Jerry E. Smith wrote for himself and Judge Kurt D. Engelhardt. Mack “takes great pains to convince attendees that they need not watch the ceremony – and that doing so will not affect their cases,” he wrote. Judge E. Grady Jolly responded: “For the majority to find that there is no evidence of coercion, suggests, in my opinion, willful blindness and indisputable error.” He noted that Mack is a Pentecostal minister who made a campaign promise to establish prayer in his courtroom. “He has previously criticized opponents of his prayer ceremony and has acted hostile following a litigant’s noncooperation in the prayer,” Jolly wrote. The Freedom From Religion Foundation sued Mack in 2017 for itself and an anonymous lawyer who said he attended the sessions out of fear that not doing so would hurt his clients.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Russell M. Nelson, the president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, told members of the faith Saturday that abuse was “a grievous sin” that shouldn’t be tolerated and would bring down the wrath of God on perpetrators. Though the leader of the nearly 17 million-member faith did not mention it directly, the remarks were the first on abuse from a senior church leader since the Associated Press published an investigation into how the church handles reports of sexual abuse when brought to its attention. “Let me be perfectly clear: Any kind of abuse of women, children or anyone is an abomination to the Lord,” Nelson, who members of the faith believe is a prophet, said in Salt Lake City at a church conference. The AP’s investigation found the hotline the church uses for abuse reporting can be misused by its leaders to divert accusations away from law enforcement and toward church attorneys. The story, based on sealed records and court cases filed in Arizona and West Virginia, uncovered a host of concerns, including how church officials have cited exemptions to mandatory reporting laws, known as clergy-penitent privilege, as a reason to not report abuse. Since its publication, the church has said the investigation mischaracterizes its policies.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Dispensaries began selling marijuana for legal recreational use over the weekend. FLORA Cannabis in Middlebury, Mountain Girl Cannabis in Rutland and CeresMED in Burlington were the only retailers ready to begin sales Saturday. A fourth business has been licensed to sell recreational pot but isn’t ready to do so yet. As happened with the rollout of recreational marijuana sales in other states and in Canada, Vermont’s inaugural weekend was “more of a soft opening,” as more product manufacturers and testing facilities come online and as more people harvest the plant, said James Pepper, chair of the state Cannabis Control Board. Vermont joins 14 other states with legal adult-use cannabis sales, according to the Marijuana Policy Project. Four others – Connecticut, New York, Rhode Island and Virginia – and Washington, D.C., have legalized the use of recreational marijuana, but sales haven’t started there yet. Vermont’s Cannabis Control Board prioritized review and waived licensing fees for social equity applicants. Such applicants are Black or Hispanic or from communities that historically have been disproportionately affected by cannabis being outlawed or who have been or had a family member who has been incarcerated for a cannabis-related offense.\n\nVirginia\n\nGala: He won in the dogfights of World War II, he won in the Olympic boxing ring, and he won in Virginia Supreme Court. Now a stretch of highway in Botetourt County is named in honor of Norvel LaFallette Ray Lee. Descendants of Lee recently traveled to his birthplace from as far as Alaska to unveil a placard along U.S. 220 that details his life and accomplishments, on what would have been his 98th birthday. “I hope this marker will inspire people to learn more about Norvel, his extraordinary achievements and his place in the history of our country,” said state Del. Terry Austin, R-Botetourt. “I want to acknowledge this man who overcame the adversities of segregation to become a Tuskegee Airmen and a gold medalist in the Olympics.” Born in Eagle Rock in 1924, Lee won fights by air and in the boxing ring, including Olympic gold in 1952, but is known also for taking a stand against segregation on his way home from the 1948 Olympics. “While returning from the 1948 Olympics, traveling by train, he was asked to give up his seat to a white person,” Austin said. “Mr. Lee declined to do so and was arrested. Eventually the Virginia Supreme Court did the right thing and ruled in Mr. Lee’s favor.” Undefeated in Virginia Supreme Court on what became a landmark civil rights case, Lee went on to retire from boxing with two Golden Glove titles and a 100-5 win-loss record, said the Rev. Nelson Harris of Heights Community Church in Roanoke.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: A woman who was sexually assaulted by a police officer has filed a tort claim against the city. The woman is seeking $1 million in damages, alleging “red flags” related to now ex-police Officer Nathan Nash’s behavior were ignored, KREM-TV reports. Nash was convicted in August on one count of third-degree rape and one count of second-degree rape in two separate incidents in which he was on duty. The woman intending to sue says in the claim that the city’s hiring, training and supervision of Nash was inadequate and a proximate cause of her injuries. The city allowed Nash to use his power and police uniform to prey on women he encountered during the performance of his duties, according to the claim. The city has about two months to respond. Nash is in custody at the Spokane County Detention Center awaiting a mid-October sentencing for the rape convictions. Throughout his trial, Nash maintained his innocence. He was first charged in 2019 when a woman accused him of rape while investigating her case. Another woman in 2021 told police about a similar experience.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Marshall University is getting a $13.8 million funding boost from the state to help finish construction of a baseball stadium. Gov. Jim Justice announced the contribution Thursday from the state Water Development Authority’s Economic Enhancement Grant program. “This has been a long time coming, and I am so proud to play a small part in getting this project across the finish line,” Justice said. “They’ve been talking about building a baseball stadium since I was a brown-haired kid playing golf at Marshall back in the ’70s. Finally, it’s going to happen, and this community can get the monkey off its back.” Marshall has never had an on-campus baseball stadium. The new facility will be built across the street from Marshall’s football stadium. The stadium is expected to cost about $23 million. The city of Huntington and Marshall are contributing nearly $10 million, the governor’s office said in a statement. Construction is scheduled to begin this month, with a tentative completion date of March 2024.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Two lawsuits filed last week argue that election clerks should be allowed to accept absentee ballots that are missing portions of witness addresses – the next step in the ongoing legal battle that has pit conservatives against liberals in the battleground state. The lawsuits, filed three days apart on Tuesday and Friday, come after a judge in Waukesha County circuit court in September sided with Republicans and said election clerks are barred from filling in missing information on the form that serves as an envelope for absentee ballots. The judge struck down guidance issued by the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission, in place for six years, saying that clerks could fill in missing information. The judge agreed with Republicans that there is nothing in law allowing clerks to do that. The practice, known as ballot curing, was unchallenged until after Donald Trump’s narrow loss in 2020, when nearly 1.4 million voters cast absentee ballots, and COVID-19 vaccines weren’t available yet. Absent any guidance, there is confusion among election officials about how much of an address must be provided by the witness to allow for the ballot to be counted. Those with partial witness addresses should be accepted, not rejected, according to a lawsuit filed Friday by the League of Women Voters of Wisconsin.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The state doubled its wind-power generating capacity from 2019 to 2021 and is looking to add more wind farms in the next five years. The Casper Star Tribune reports researchers at the University of Wyoming say that boost in power generation is like adding another coal-fired power plant. The increase has pushed Wyoming’s wind-power generating capacity from about 1,600 to about 3,200 megawatts and from 17th to 14th in the nation in wind-power capacity. Enough future wind farms have been proposed to the Wyoming Industrial Siting Council to nearly triple the state’s wind-power capacity. The University of Wyoming report released in June sought to measure the economic impacts of wind projects in the state. It found that building another 6,000 megawatts of wind capacity would support close to 1,600 long-term jobs. It would also inject $1.2 billion into the state economy during construction and add another estimated $210 million annually. Researchers said that includes $89 million in government revenue. Additionally, if the turbines were built in Wyoming, the revenue produced in the state could be even more.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/01/31/mammoth-cave-sharks-waterfall-chasing-valentines-divorce-news-around-states/41114873/", "title": "Mammoth Cave sharks, waterfall chasing: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Gov. Kay Ivey fractured her shoulder after being tripped by the state’s “first dog,” her office said Wednesday. Ivey spokeswoman Gina Maiola said the governor is in an arm sling after being tripped by her mixed-breed dog named Missy. The rescue pooch unintentionally tripped the governor at home Tuesday night, Ivey’s office said. The 75-year-old Republican governor issued a statement about the injury, saying, “You’ll see me in a sling, but this won’t slow me down one bit.” “I’ll keep you posted on the recovery, but most importantly, Missy is also doing just fine.” Ivey is scheduled to deliver Alabama’s annual State of the State address Tuesday night to mark the opening of the legislative session. Last year, the governor announced she had been diagnosed with early-stage lung cancer and was being treated with radiation. Her office said in January that medical scans showed a good response to treatment and that her doctor considered her cured.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: State officials have forecast poor returns for Kenai River king salmon in the upcoming spring and summer fishing season. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game released the estimates Monday. This year’s forecast of salmon during the early run through June 30 is just 4,794 large fish, which would rank as the eighth-lowest return in the past 35 years but higher than last year’s run of 4,216 fish, state biologists said. The department classifies large fish as those greater than 34 inches in length. The average return over the past 35 years is more than 9,100 king salmon in the early run. The department predicts a similar result – 22,707 large king salmon – during the late run that lasts through August. The return would be about 60% larger than last year’s escapement of just 12,780 fish, which failed to meet the department’s sustainable escapement goal of 13,500 to 27,000 fish.\n\nArizona\n\nSupai: Reservations to hike to the idyllic green waters of Havasupai Falls don’t come easy. Those who hope to reserve a 2020 hiking permit and campground reservation when they go on sale at 8 a.m. Saturday can take some steps in advance to improve their odds of getting one of the 350 spots available each day. Hopeful hikers can make an account at havasupaireservations.com and pre-enter credit card information to save time when the permits go on sale. Phone reservations are not accepted. Available trip dates start March 1, and it’s best to have a first choice and a few backup dates in mind before sales begin. Last year, the reservations were mostly gone within five hours of going on sale. New this year, reservation-holders can list potential alternative trip leaders beforehand to make it possible to transfer a reservation to someone on that list free of charge.\n\nArkansas\n\nWest Memphis: A casino has debuted sports betting in its soft opening this week, officials said. Southland Casino Racing began accepting wagers Tuesday for the upcoming Super Bowl, as well as on NBA games, college basketball, NASCAR racing, PGA tournaments and more, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. Approved by voters in November 2018, Amendment 100 to the state Constitution authorized Southland Casino Racing to expand into a full-fledged casino. It is the third Arkansas casino to win the commission’s approval to begin sports wagering. “We have been working toward this for a while,” said Jeff Strang, Southland’s senior marketing director. International Game Technology announced Tuesday that it signed a multistate sports betting agreement with Southland’s parent company – Delaware North Cos. Gaming and Entertainment – to power retail sports betting in Arkansas and West Virginia.\n\nCalifornia\n\nCalexico: Strong winds gusting across Southern California blew down several panels of a new barrier being installed along the U.S.-Mexico border, a newspaper reports. The U.S. Border Patrol said the panels fell into Mexican territory Wednesday about 100 miles east of San Diego where the border runs between the U.S. city of Calexico and the Mexican city of Mexicali, the San Diego Union-Tribune reports. The 30-foot-tall panels had just been anchored in concrete that had not yet cured when the gusts hit, the newspaper says. The panels fell onto a road. “Luckily, Mexican authorities responded quickly and were able to divert traffic from the nearby street,” U.S. Border Patrol Agent Carlos Pitones said. U.S. Customs and Border Protection was working to retrieve the panels from Mexico, the Union-Tribune reports.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state has launched two pilot programs focused on reducing carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency at cannabis cultivating businesses, officials said. The programs started Wednesday and support Democratic Gov. Jared Polis’ mission to cut greenhouse gases 50% by 2030, The Denver Post reports. The Carbon Dioxide Reuse Project partners Denver Beer Co. with the Clinic cannabis dispensary to recycle carbon emissions. Denver Beer Co. plans to use a a carbon-capturing machine to provide carbon dioxide produced during the brewing process to the clinic, which will use the gas to stimulate plant growth. The brewery expects to recycle more than 150,000 pounds of carbon dioxide – enough to meet all the clinic’s needs, Earthly Labs CEO Amy George says. The Colorado Cultivators Energy Management pilot will enable cannabis businesses to enlist the help of local electric cooperatives and utility companies to examine their energy use and ways to become more efficient.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A Rembrandt portrait that hasn’t been exhibited in the U.S. in more than half a century is coming to a local museum starting this weekend. “Titus in a Monk’s Habit” will be on exhibit at Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art in Hartford from Saturday through April 30, the museum said in a statement. The portrait depicts the Dutch artist’s teenage son in 1660. It’s on loan from the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. Rembrandt van Rijn created the artwork “at a crucial moment in his late career when he was revamping his business as a painter and recovering from bankruptcy,” the museum said. “It opens questions about the artist’s career, his use of traditional subjects and the bold technique that has won him enduring fame,” Oliver Tostmann, curator of European art, said in a statement. “With his son in the role of a poor monk, it is a heart-wrenching interpretation of the human condition and an echo of the family’s humbled economic state.”\n\nDelaware\n\nNewark: A University of Delaware program that starts this fall will allow high school students to get an early start on their college studies. The Early College Credit Program will be free and open to juniors and seniors in all 74 public, charter and private high schools throughout the state, the Delaware State News reports. The introductory courses – which will be in subjects such as astronomy, philosophy, art history and more – will be transmitted via video from UD’s Newark campus and streamed to the students’ high schools. The high school students will be enrolled alongside college students. “One of the things we are excited about with this new program is that high school students have the opportunity to interact with regular undergraduates on campus, virtually,” says Lynn Okagki, deputy provost for academic affairs at the university. Participation will allow students to earn both high school and college credits.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Attorney General William Barr on Thursday nominated Timothy Shea, one of his closest advisers, to be the next top prosecutor in the nation’s capital. Shea will lead the largest United States attorney’s office in the country, one that has been historically responsible for some of the most significant and politically sensitive cases the Justice Department brings in the U.S. He is a senior counselor to the attorney general and was Barr’s right-hand man helping institute reforms at the federal Bureau of Prisons after Jeffrey Epstein’s death at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City. As the U.S. attorney in the District of Columbia, Shea would oversee some of the lingering cases from special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, along with a number of politically charged investigations.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Cities and counties wouldn’t be able to ban sunscreens containing ingredients that some researchers say harm coral reefs, under a bill passed by the state Senate on Wednesday. The Senate voted 25-14 in favor of the bill after no discussion or debate. If it becomes law, a Key West ordinance to ban the sale of sunscreens containing oxybenzone or octinoxate would be nullified. The Key West ban is set to go into effect next year. Research has shown the chemicals can cause coral bleaching, and the reefs around Key West attract divers, snorkelers and fishing enthusiasts. But Republican Sen. Rob Bradley has said previously that he sponsored the bill because protecting people is more important, and the research hasn’t proven the chemicals actually harm reefs. An identical House bill has been making its way through committees.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: After trying last year to place restrictions on electric scooters all across Georgia, a state Senate committee now wants the state to keep its hands off. The Senate Transportation Committee on Tuesday unanimously approved a new version of Senate Bill 159, which would define electric scooters in state law. But it would do nothing else, leaving other regulations up to local governments. State Sen. Steve Gooch, a Dahlonega Republican, told committee members Tuesday that’s how the scooter companies and local governments both want it. “Local governments should be doing backflips and cartwheels,” Gooch said. “They’re getting everything they asked for.” The cities of Atlanta, Brookhaven and Decatur have authorized scooters, as has Georgia Southern University. But a Senate study committee report filed last year found 12 other cities had banned or placed temporary moratoriums on scooters.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: Thurston Lava Tube in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park could reopen within a month if a final repair project is successful, an official said. A park spokeswoman said the tube will be reopened to the public after a nearby restroom facility is restored to working order, The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports. Thurston Lava Tube was one of several attractions at the park that were closed indefinitely after the Kilauea volcanic eruption, which began in May 2018 and destroyed more than 700 homes on the Big Island. Also called Nahuku, the lava tube remained closed after Hawaii Volcanoes National Park reopened in September 2018. Scientists and engineers wanted to confirm the tube was structurally sound after thousands of earthquakes rattled the park during the eruption. The park must repair and bury an electrical line, which could take two to four weeks, spokeswoman Jessica Ferracane said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state’s prisons are overcrowded and dilapidated, the inmate population is rapidly growing, and taxpayers could save millions by building a prison, state auditors told a panel of lawmakers this week. The findings came from the Office of Performance Evaluations’ report on managing the state’s correctional capacity, which took a close look at staffing levels, inmate populations, the condition of the actual prison buildings themselves and how those factors will likely affect Idaho in years to come. “Idaho is at a critical juncture in planning how it will house inmates,” an office evaluator, Lance McCleve, told members of the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee. “Just since 2016, we’ve seen about an 18% increase of inmates incarcerated in prisons.” That dramatically outpaces the state’s population growth of about 6% in the same period, McCleve said.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Elections officials disclosed fresh problems Wednesday with the state’s automatic voter registration program, including at least one eligible voter who said she registered to vote but ended up on an opt-out list. The program is already under fire for mistakenly registering more than 500 people who indicated they weren’t U.S. citizens, of whom 15 people voted in 2018 and 2019 elections. Election officials said at least eight of the people have long voting histories and were likely U.S. citizens, leaving seven voters in question. The individuals involved were applying for standard driver’s licenses at secretary of state’s offices. Details were scarce on the new issues, disclosed at a State Board of Elections meeting. Brenda Glahn, an attorney with the secretary of state, said registrations of eligible voters who appeared to decline to be registered were still sent to election officials.\n\nIndiana\n\nMuncie: Hundreds of Ball State University students gathered for a rally to demand the early retirement of a white professor who called police on a black student who refused to change seats last week during a class. A crowd of 200 to 300 students, some carrying protest signs, converged Tuesday outside the Whitinger Business Building. It’s where Sultan “Mufasa” Benson, a senior business-administration major, left marketing professor Shaheen Borna’s class after the tenured faculty member called police on him. Benson, who is from Chicago, recounted how he felt when Borna asked him to move to the front row from the back of the class. “Why am I being moved?” Benson said he asked the Iranian-born professor. “No answer. ‘You can move or we can call the police.’ ” Though Benson said he feels like “another statistic” that Ball State is using to advertise its black student enrollment, he thanked school President Geoffrey S. Mearns for attending the rally and listening to them.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A bill proposed by a group of Republican lawmakers that would have amended the Iowa Civil Rights Act by removing protections against discrimination for transgender people is dead, a powerful committee chairman said. Nine Republican House members sponsoring the bill introduced it Wednesday morning, but by evening Republican Rep. Steven Holt, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee to which the bill was assigned, said he wouldn’t allow it to move forward to a subcommittee hearing. “It’s dead,” Holt said. “It just would have had a lot of unintended consequences.” Iowa law currently prohibits discrimination based on gender identity, race, creed, color, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, religion, ancestry and disability. Gender identity was added in 2007 when Democrats regained control of the Legislature and held the governor’s office with the election of Gov. Chet Culver.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: The Kansas Highway Patrol has a practice of unlawfully targeting motorists based on their out-of-state license plates or Colorado travel plans, due to that state’s legalization of marijuana, according to a federal court filing Thursday. Among the allegations contained in the new filing are statistics showing that drivers with out-of-state plates made up 93% of all the agency’s traffic stops in 2017. The case began as a hand-scrawled complaint filed last December by two irate drivers themselves in federal court. It got some significant legal firepower when the American Civil Liberties Union and Kansas City, Missouri, attorney Sam Diederich filed an amended complaint on their behalf. The revised complaint references a serious imbalance in people of color in targeted vehicles. It also challenges a law enforcement practice known as “the Kansas Two Step,” a maneuver used to detain drivers for canine drug searches after a traffic stop.\n\nKentucky\n\nMammoth Cave National Park: Paleontologists have found remarkably intact fossils from ancient sharks in Mammoth Cave. The discovery hundreds of millions of years in the making began when Mammoth Cave specialists Rick Olson and Rick Toomey came across fossils as they explored and mapped the cave system and sent photos to Vincent Santucci, senior paleontologist for the National Park Service in Washington, D.C., for help identifying them. Santucci then sent John-Paul Hodnett, a paleontologist and program coordinator at Dinosaur Park in Maryland, to help with what became the Mammoth Cave National Park Fossil Shark Research Project. The fossils were parts of a head that belonged to a Saivodus striatus shark, about the size of a great white. Thanks to the slow erosion of the limestone in the cave, the shark’s teeth are mostly intact and extremely detailed. More than 100 individual specimens have been discovered so far during the project.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state’s new legislative leaders quickly signed off Thursday on plans to borrow up to $350 million to replenish the account that pays for state-financed construction work, the first major financial decision for the latest House and Senate term. The Bond Commission, a panel of state officials that oversees publicly financed construction spending, agreed to the March general obligation bond sale without objection. The proposal provoked no discussion from the House’s and Senate’s new budget and tax committee chairmen, sitting on the panel for the first time in their new roles. The borrowing will keep cash flowing to a long list of projects, including coastal restoration work, state park improvements, road and bridge projects, college building repairs and local projects favored by lawmakers.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Maine lobsters need to arrive alive at their destinations, and a proposal before the Legislature is aimed at making it more certain that happens. Democratic Sen. Eloise Vitelli of Arrowsic has introduced a bill that would exempt truck drivers transporting live lobsters from some hours-of-service restrictions. Vitelli said the proposal would extend an exemption already granted to transporters of potatoes, broccoli and livestock. “Getting lobsters quickly to market in Boston is essential for Maine lobster dealers to maintain and grow this iconic industry,” Vitelli said. Vitelli introduced the bill Tuesday, and it will face votes in committee before moving on to the full state Senate and House of Representatives. Virginia Olsen, a lobster fisherman from Stonington and board member of the Maine Lobstering Union, said members of the industry are at “an economic disadvantage when trying to bring our live product to market under the current time restraints.”\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A rarely open U.S. House seat has drawn a crowded field of 24 Democrats and eight Republicans in a special primary for the office held by the late Rep. Elijah Cummings. Candidates in the majority-black district’s Tuesday primary include Cummings’ widow, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings; and Kweisi Mfume, a former NAACP head and one of three men who’ve held the seat in the past 49 years. Republicans on the ballot include Kimberly Klacik, an activist whose social media video of trash and run-down buildings in Baltimore caught President Donald Trump’s attention before he described the district in a tweet as a “rodent-infested mess.” Mfume, who stepped down in 1996 to lead the NAACP after serving five terms as a congressman, is telling voters in the heavily Democratic district his experience separates him from the crowd.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state is pushing ahead with efforts to amend the U.S. Constitution to restore limits on political spending by corporations. A commission charged with weighing potential constitutional amendments aimed at countering the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision released an interim report Wednesday updating its progress. Members of the Massachusetts Citizens Commission said the goal of the amendment would be to give Congress and states the power “to regulate contributions and expenditures in our federal, state, and local elections to secure the free speech and representation rights of all Americans, combat corruption and protect the integrity of elections.” A ballot question approved by Massachusetts voters in 2018 created the commission. The report pointed to a sharp rise in spending in elections, most concentrated in the hands of a small slice of the electorate, the commission said.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Marie Woo, who’s earned a reputation as “the potter’s potter” and as an educator, researcher and curator who’s played a major role in spreading awareness of Chinese folk pottery, was announced Thursday as the 2020 Kresge Eminent Artist. The lifetime achievement award, which comes with a $50,000 prize, is given annually to a metro Detroiter for distinguished contributions to the arts and the community. Known both for her mastery of clay and her continuing commitment to experimentation and innovation, Woo, 91, joins 11 other past winners. It’s a collection of Detroit luminaries that includes the late jazz trumpeter Marcus Belgrave, photographer and activist Leni Sinclair, painter and sculptor Charles McGee, and the late Michigan Opera Theatre’s artistic director David DiChiera. Woo is the first Kresge Eminent Artist to represent the art of ceramics.\n\nMinnesota\n\nLonsdale: A local Roman Catholic priest apologized Wednesday for saying in a sermon that Islam was “the greatest threat in the world” to the United States and Christianity. The Rev. Nick VanDenBroeke apologized in a statement issued by the St. Paul-Minnesota Catholic archdiocese. He had made the comments in a Jan. 5 sermon at the Lonsdale church where he serves as pastor. The Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a civil rights group, had called on the state’s Roman Catholic church leaders to repudiate the sermon after the newspaper City Pages published an article about the sermon. In the statement from the archdiocese, Archbishop Bernard Hebda said the church’s teaching is clear, and he quoted Pope Benedict XVI as saying the church looks with esteem to Muslims, who worship God through prayer, fasting and the giving of alms.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A proposal to give most teachers at least a $1,000 pay raise is starting to move forward at the state Capitol. The plan won approval Thursday in the Senate Education Committee. It will go to the Senate Appropriations Committee another day, and it must pass there before it can go to the full Senate. Senate Bill 2001 would give $1,000 across-the-board raises to most teachers and teachers’ assistants. Teachers in the first two years of their careers would receive slightly larger raises of $1,100. That’s an effort to boost the beginning salaries. Mississippi has long had some of the lowest teacher salaries in the nation. Republican Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann and several other officials said during the 2019 campaign that increasing teacher pay would be a priority this year.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Republican state senators put forth a new plan Wednesday that would scrap “partisan fairness” and “competitiveness” from the criteria used to draw state House and Senate districts – reversing a key part of a ballot initiative approved by voters just two years ago. Senators began debating the newly proposed constitutional amendment Wednesday. If approved by the Legislature, it would go to a public vote later this year. In addition to changing the redistricting criteria, it also would abolish a voter-approved state demographer position to draw districts and return the task to a bipartisan commission used in the past. Like the successful “Clean Missouri” initiative on the 2018 ballot, the new GOP proposal would package the redistricting changes with other potentially popular ethics reforms. “If you like Clean Missouri, you’re going to love Cleaner Missouri,” said Sen. Denny Hoskins, a Republican from Warrensburg.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians Chairman Gerald Gray will be Sen. Jon Tester’s guest of honor at the State of the Union address Tuesday. “I’ve worked with many leaders in the Little Shell Tribe over the past 20 years, and Chairman Gray is right up there at the top,” Tester, D-Mont., said Thursday in a news release. “He is a relentless advocate for his people who built strong coalitions but wasn’t shy about putting the screws to me and the rest of the delegation when he needed to.” Gray said that he was “grateful” to be invited and that Tester “was so instrumental in the restoration of my tribe’s federal recognition.” Each senator is allowed one guest. After more than 100 years of efforts by the tribe, federal recognition was signed into law Dec. 20 as a part of the National Defense Authorization Act. The Little Shell Tribe is based in Great Falls and has nearly 5,400 members.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Families in the state who want access to high-quality child care may be out of luck depending on where they live or how much they make, according to a report released Thursday. The Nebraska Early Childhood Workforce Commission’s report found access to child care varies widely, with 11 of the state’s 93 counties having no licensed child care facilities. The report also found a high turnover rate among early childhood care providers, driven in part by low pay. The median wage for early childhood professionals teaching in community-based child care centers was $18,706 in 2016, according to the report. That’s nearly $1,400 below the federal poverty line for a family of three. The commission is a part of the Buffett Early Childhood Institute at the University of Nebraska.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: McCarran International Airport says a jump in the number of travelers in December pushed it to a record 51.5 million passengers in 2019. An airport year-end report made public Wednesday came more than a month after officials held a ceremony marking the arrival of a record 50 millionth passenger in one year. The previous 12-month record was 49.7 million in 2018. The Clark County Department of Aviation counted nearly 4.25 million arriving and departing passengers in December, up 9% from the same month in 2018. Airport chief Rosemary Vassiliadis said domestic passenger volume grew 3.9% for the year, with big increases by low-cost carriers Sun Country, Frontier and Spirit airlines. Southwest Airlines is by far the busiest airline, accounting for more than 17 million passengers last year. But the airline was down 3.7% from its total of more than 18 million in 2018.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state Senate on Thursday gave preliminary approval to a bill to establish and then gradually increase the minimum wage. The state currently defaults to the federal minimum wage of $7.25. Lawmakers last year approved the creation of a state minimum wage, but Republican Gov. Chris Sununu vetoed it. The vote Thursday in the Democrat-led Senate was 14-10 to raise the state minimum wage to $10 an hour in 2021 and $12 an hour in 2023. Supporters noted that New Hampshire continues to fall behind its New England neighbors. On Jan. 1, Vermont, Maine, and Massachusetts all raised their minimum wages. Opponents said the bill would push small businesses to reduce hours and increase automation of jobs.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Nine hospitals in areas with some of the state’s highest rates of shootings will share $20million in an intervention program designed to reduce violence, particularly related to guns. The distribution of federal money is a nationally unique approach to “disrupt the cycle of violence,” Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said. New Jersey is now making the biggest investment of federal Victims of Crime Act funding for such a program, he said. “This is not a garden variety, ‘Every state’s doing this,’ ” Gov. Phil Murphy said. “We’re the only state doing this.” The money will help establish “hospital-based violence intervention programs” to support victims but also try to prevent future incidents. The idea is to intervene at a crucial moment in an individual’s life – after being shot, for example – and provide services such as counseling, case management or even removing a tattoo that could be used to identify them for retaliation.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Legislators could receive state salaries for the first time as the result of a newly proposed constitutional amendment. A panel of legislators led by state Democratic Sen. Linda Lopez of Albuquerque endorsed the proposed constitutional amendment Wednesday that would give the recently founded State Ethics Commission authority to set salaries for lawmakers and other elected official including the governor. New Mexico runs the only unsalaried legislature in the nation, though members receive a $162 daily stipend during sessions and reimbursement for some travel expenses. Amendment sponsor Sen. Daniel Ivey-Soto, an Albuquerque Democrat, said that handing over salary decisions to the ethics commission would depoliticize the matter and avoid the taboo against lawmakers approving their own pay.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state has set some of the nation’s most ambitious goals on fighting climate change, but some activists say it isn’t moving fast enough. Lawmakers holding budget hearings this week faced protests from environmental and left-leaning groups who criticized the lack of new solar and wind projects breaking ground in the state. Protesters filled rows at a hearing to call for the state to do more to boost electric vehicles and energy efficiency and block construction of infrastructure for natural gas, which contributes to global warming. “Six months ago, Gov. Cuomo signed the nation’s most aggressive climate legislation, promising that New York would ‘lead the way forward’ and ‘set a new standard,’ ” said Conor Bambrick, director of climate policy for the environmental group Clean Water for Environmental Advocates of New York. But New York needs to do much more to match the “urgency of the climate crisis,” he said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: A car dealer is opening up his sales lot to homeless people whose cars are their only means of shelter. James Charles made the move after a member of his sales team went to repossess a woman’s car, WBTV reports. “The gentleman who was repossessing the car said, ‘We can’t take the car, there’s somebody living in the car,’ ” said Charles, manager at Kiplin Automotive Group in west Charlotte. Charles said he looked for a shelter for the woman, but all of them were full. So he put her up in a hotel for a few nights, until she had a more permanent solution. That, Charles said, was the sign he needed to launch his plan. His dealership now offers space for other families, with security cameras, bright lights and an open invitation. “You can come here,” Charles said. “We will allow you to stay on our property, and of course, we’re going to help you find a place if we can.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state should reinvest half of the earnings from its voter-approved oil tax savings account to grow the fund’s principal by billions more dollars over the next decade, Gov. Doug Burgum said Wednesday in his State of the State speech. The state is “strong, growing and full of boundless opportunity,” but “there’s a lot more we can do,” the first-term Republican said during his nearly two-hour speech at the University of North Dakota in Grand Forks. Burgum’s speech was somewhat unscripted and largely fell short on policy specifics, including his plan to spend earnings from the state’s Legacy Fund, which voters enacted in 2010. How and when earnings from the fund should be spent has long been point of contention even among Republicans in the GOP-led Legislature.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The nation’s oldest civil rights organization has endorsed a ballot initiative aimed at streamlining the state’s voting process. The NAACP’s Ohio Conference announced its backing for the Ohioans for Secure and Fair Elections measure Wednesday. In a statement, conference president Tom Roberts said the NAACP sees the campaign as “a necessary step” to modernizing Ohio elections. If voters approve the proposal, Ohioans would be automatically registered to vote when conducting business at state Bureau of Motor Vehicles offices, and early voting locations would have to be open on the two weekends prior to Election Day. That would allow eligible voters to register and vote on the same day. The requirement that voters be registered during BMV trips unless they opt out is also part of pending House and Senate legislation.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The body of a woman found in central Oklahoma nearly 40 years ago and known only as “Lime Lady” has been identified as a missing Las Vegas woman, authorities said Thursday. DNA testing with the help of the DNA Doe Project identified Tamara Lee Tigard as the woman whose body was found April 18, 1980, on the banks of the North Canadian River in Jones on the outskirts of Oklahoma City. Tigard, who was shot to death, was found on what would have been her 21st birthday, Oklahoma County Sheriff’s Capt. Bob Green said. Tigard was known for decades only as “Lime Lady” because her body had been covered in lime in a possible attempt to destroy it, but instead the lime helped preserve her remains. It is not known how long she was in Oklahoma, according to Sheriff P.D. Taylor. Investigators have also determined she was in the U.S. military, serving in the Army, Green said.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Democrats in the Statehouse are seeking to have voters change its quorum rules so that walkouts by lawmakers can no longer stymie legislation. The joint resolution, filed this week before the Legislature starts its short 2020 session Monday, would ask voters to change quorum rules, allowing the Statehouse to convene with only a simple majority of lawmakers present instead of the current two-thirds requirement. Senate Democrats say all but three other states require a simple majority for a quorum. Senate Majority Leader Ginny Burdick, a Democrat from Portland, had been expected to introduce the proposed constitutional amendment. “Stopping the work of the people by denying a quorum is unconscionable and undemocratic,” Burdick said last year. If the Legislature approves the resolution, voters would then decide on the proposed change in the 2020 election.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A $45 million project to upgrade the state’s emergency radio communications system is on time and within the budget, but the purchasing process has encountered some glitches, the state auditor general said Thursday. A report released by Democratic Auditor General Eugene DePasquale identified errors in the bidding process but concluded they would not have changed the 2016 contract award. It also said there was inadequate documentation about the qualifications of people involved in awarding the contract. The statewide radio project, known as PA STARNet, began with a $179 million expenditure in 1996 that developed into a massive boondoggle, eventually costing the state more than $850 million. It produced a system that was badly flawed, with poor reception, software problems, short battery life and reliability shortcomings.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state Department of Correction is failing to comply with a court order limiting the time an inmate can be held in solitary confinement to 30 days, a federal judge ruled. U.S. District Court Chief Judge John McConnell faulted the department for not seeking court approval after an inmate serving life was held in disciplinary segregation for 60 days in 2014, the Providence Journal reports. McConnell ruled the department “unilaterally and substantively” changed the so-called Morris Rules in 2005, when it instituted a policy that prisoners could be held in disciplinary segregation for 31 days to a year on a single offense. The judge’s ruling received praise from the American Civil Liberties Union in Rhode Island, which agreed to represent the inmate and others who find themselves in similar situations in the future.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A bill that would bar anyone using a cellphone while driving from holding the phone in their hands appears to be dead for the year. The Senate Transportation Committee decided Wednesday not to vote on the bill. It could still come up later in the session, but often that action sends a bill into a limbo from which it does not return. The bill would require anyone making a cellphone call to use a Bluetooth device or have the phone in a dock and use the speaker. It does not prohibit one swipe to get the function to work. Text by voice would also be legal if the phone isn’t held. Opponents of the bill said the state already has a distracted driving law. Supporters said that usually only kicks in after a crash, and the bill would prevent wrecks. The House has passed a similar bill, and sponsor Rep. Bill Taylor said he thinks if the Senate ever gets on board, it can become law.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Proponents of creating schools focused on Native American language and culture have two weeks to rework their proposal after Gov. Kristi Noem opposed the initiative. A state Senate committee on Thursday deferred a bill that would create Oceti Sakowin schools that teach Lakota, Dakota and Nakota language and culture. Several teachers are trying to open schools in Native American communities that would attempt to address educational achievement gaps among Native American students. “I see a system that isn’t working, and we’re looking for something that is working,” said Sage Fast Dog, an educator who is planning to open a school on the Rosebud Indian Reservation. Parents testified about how children had struggled with their identity after facing teachers and schoolmates who were insensitive to the culture of the Oceti Sakowin, which is commonly known as Sioux.\n\nTennessee\n\nMurfreesboro: An attorney is giving away free divorce representation to one client for Valentine’s Day. W. Scott Kimberly said in a news release that for many people Valentine’s Day is “another reminder that they remain trapped in a relationship that they cannot leave because of financial problems, because of a spouse who refuses to agree to a divorce, or for some other reason.” This is the third year the Murfreesboro divorce attorney will give away his services. Last year, Kimberly selected two winners, saying he had a hard time narrowing down the entries. Applicants are asked to share the story of why they want a divorce. Applications are accepted through Valentine’s Day, with a winner selected on Feb. 17. Although Kimberly won’t charge for his services, the winner will be responsible for court costs and filing fees. “This giveaway is a chance to help someone move on with their life,” Kimberly said.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A state historical review panel delayed a vote this week on whether to move the Alamo Cenotaph, a memorial to the 200 Alamo defenders killed by the Mexican army in an 1836 assault during the war for Texas independence. The Texas Historical Commission put off its vote for at least two months, saying commissioners want more information on where the monument might be moved and what restoration work it may need. It’s a key piece in a major renovation of the Alamo. The 58-foot-tall marble slab has been a focal feature of Alamo Plaza in downtown San Antonio since 1939. Planners of a $450 million Alamo renovation project have proposed moving the monument to a place about 500 feet to the south of its longtime home, a proposal that has drawn fierce opposition from descendants of the Alamo’s 1836 defenders.\n\nUtah\n\nSpringdale: Against the towering, red cliffs of Zion National Park, Provo native band The National Parks will be holding their first music festival April25. The indie-pop band says the Superbloom Music Festival will be held at the O.C. Tanner Amphitheater in Springdale. The National Parks will headline, and other local Utah and West-based bands will perform as well – Joshua James, The Strike, Tow’rs, The Federal Empire, Ellee Duke and Brother. The National Parks lead vocalist and guitarist Brady Parks said many of the bands and artists performing at the festival are people he’s been friends with and fans of for a long time. “Zion holds a special place in our heart,” Parks said. The festival will be an all-day “destination” event, he said. Local vendors and food trucks will be at the festival, and a VIP campfire concert will be held nearby the night before. Tickets are on sale now.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: State legislators are reviewing a bill that would ensure rights for the homeless. The House bill would seek to establish “a homeless bill of rights and prohibiting discrimination against people without homes,” the Times Argus reports. Rep. Tom Stevens, a Democrat, has twice submitted the bill since 2017 to the House General, Housing and Military Affairs Committee, without it being approved. The bill’s intent is to ensure that no person would be subject to civil or criminal sanctions “for soliciting, sharing, accepting or offering food, water, money or other donations in public places.” Under the bill’s provisions, an aggrieved person would also have the right to petition in civil court for appropriate relief against damages suffered and costs incurred as a result of violations of their rights. The resolution notes that a count of the state’s homeless population last January found 1,089 lack secure housing, 23% of whom are children.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Democrats in the state House are advancing a package of gun-control measures they say are needed to improve public safety. The new Democratic majority in the House voted Wednesday to advance a package of gun measures over vocal opposition from Republicans, who said the measures infringe on law-abiding gun owners’ rights. The bills include limiting handgun purchases to once a month; universal background checks on gun purchases; allowing localities to ban guns in certain areas; and a red flag bill that would allow authorities to temporarily take guns away from anyone deemed to be dangerous to themselves or others. A final vote is expected Thursday to pass the measures and then send them to the Senate, which has already passed its own versions gun-control bills. So far neither chamber has approved a proposed assault weapon ban, a top priority for Gov. Ralph Northam and one that’s drawn fierce resistance from gun-rights advocates.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Republican state legislators have introduced a bill – which includes a pilot hatchery project in Bellingham – that they believe will help increase the salmon population and help the orca whales. The Bellingham Herald reports the Salmon Repopulation Act, Senate Bill 6509 and House Bill 2741 were recently introduced and referred to committees. The bills would attempt to bring a public-partnership in state-approved hatcheries and potentially build a new hatchery on Bellingham’s waterfront. In a news conference in Olympia on Tuesday, several GOP legislators talked about the need for this public-private model to get more fish in local waters. “This is about acting now for the orca,” said Sen. Ann Rivers, R-La Center. “What the orca need more than anything else is food to eat, and we can’t wait on this.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: State officials are trying to find someone interested in preserving a historic bridge connecting West Virginia and Ohio. The Aetnaville Bridge, also known as the Georgia Street Bridge, was built in 1891. It lies over the back channel of the Ohio River from Wheeling Island, West Virginia, to Martins Ferry, Ohio. The bridge was originally part of the streetcar system in Wheeling and later converted to a toll road for automobile traffic. It became toll-free in 1953 and was part of U.S. 252 until it was closed in 1988 due to deterioration. Anyone interested in the bridge must submit a preservation and financial plan as well as information about the intended use of the bridge, the Division of Highways said in a news release. If no one is interested, the bridge will be demolished, the agency said. Requests to assume ownership of the bridge must be submitted by April 15.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers signed an executive order Wednesday creating a task force on student debt, fulfilling a pledge he made during his State of the State address last week. The task force will consist of a number of state officials or their designee, including the governor, the state schools superintendent, and the presidents of the University of Wisconsin System and the Wisconsin Technical College System, according to the order. Two state senators and two state representatives from each party will also serve on the the panel. State Department of Financial Institutions Secretary Kathy Blumenfeld will serve as chairwoman. The order directs the task force to study student loan debt and its causes, evaluate current policies, and provide recommendations on how the state can best address the problem and improve families and students’ financial situations.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Preliminary numbers show a sharp increase in traffic deaths in the state in 2019. The 147 people killed on roads in 2019 was up by 36 compared with 2018 and the most since 2015. The reason for the increase isn’t clear. The Wyoming Department of Transportation hasn’t yet analyzed its numbers for 2019. One reason could be more deaths per wreck, department spokesman Jeff Goetz told the Casper Star-Tribune. Generally most crashes are attributable to driver distraction, alcohol or drug use, or driving too fast for conditions, Goetz said. Wyoming road deaths have largely declined since the early 2000s, when close to 200 people died on Wyoming roads annually.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/31"}]}
