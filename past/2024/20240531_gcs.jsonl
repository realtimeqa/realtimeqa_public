For some, it's evidence of higher power. For ...", "text": "Editor's note: An updated cloud forecast for the April 2024 total solar eclipse is in. Read the latest eclipse forecast and news as of Monday, April 8.\n\nOn April 8 in Gatesville, Texas, members of Coryell Community Church will congregate at the campus’ hilltop site where a trio of 70-foot crosses tower over the city of 17,000, 38 miles west of Waco.\n\nThe region lies in the center of the approaching solar eclipse’s path of totality, the last such event to affect the contiguous United States until 2044. Ancient cultures viewed the dusk-like darkness prompted by the passing of the moon between the Earth and the sun, temporarily blocking the sun’s light, as a sign of the gods’ anger or even their impending departure.\n\nInstead, Coryell’s “Eclipse of the Crosses” family gathering will feature live music, games and worship – an occasion to celebrate. Meanwhile, organizers at the Jewish Community Center of Greater Buffalo have bought a thousand eclipse glasses for a viewing event, complete with black-and-white half-moon cookies.\n\nWhat time is the 2024 solar eclipse?Here's when you should look up in your area\n\nAs the faithful convene in scattered Christian, Jewish and Muslim communities around the country, the gatherings reflect how celestial events once seen as ominous by some religious communities continue to wield spiritual significance today.\n\n“An eclipse is yet another opportunity to witness the handiwork of God that exists in the universe,” said Eric Moffett, Coryell’s lead pastor. “We aren’t looking for any omens in the cosmos, but we are using this as an opportunity to, for a little over four minutes, be reminded that we live in a world made by God and sustained by his love and goodness.”\n\nEclipses have inspired fear and awe among civilizations throughout history, from the Aztecs to the ancient Hindus. They're also associated with some major religious events, including the darkness that accompanied Jesus’ crucifixion in Christianity and, in Islam, the passing of the Prophet Muhammad’s son, Ibrahim.\n\nAs the Bible's Gospel of Mark 15:33 reads: \"And when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.\"\n\nSuch references often emphasize the power of God over the cosmos, said James Willis, an assistant professor of practice for religion at the University of Indianapolis.\n\n“What we today see as an astronomical event, people previously interpreted as having life-and-death significance,\" Willis said.\n\nEarlier this month, in the Choctaw Nation newspaper Biskinik, a recurring column exploring Choctaw culture noted the sun was considered to bring life and good fortune; for some communities, when solar eclipses occurred, it was as if great black squirrels in the sky were devouring the sun. In response, all were called upon to make noise to frighten them away.\n\nBradley Schaefer, a professor of astronomy at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, said in most pre-modern cultures, the sun god was among the most powerful deities in the pantheon. An eclipse represented the destruction of that god – or at least a dire sign.\n\n“Where better to put signs from the gods but in the heavens?” Schaefer said. “If you see a sign in the heavens, it’s got to be from the gods. They’re telling us something, and what was universal from culture to culture is that it was always bad.”\n\nIn Islam, eclipses offer an occasion to pray\n\nFourteen centuries ago, as Islam’s Muhammad and his supporters grieved his deathly ill son, the prophet watched the toddler breathe his last as the skies darkened above them – the beginning, it is believed, of a total eclipse.\n\nAs the story goes, speculation spread among Muhammad’s followers that even the sun and moon were grieving his loss. In response, he summoned them to prayer and dispelled that notion, but added that such events, as signs of God’s power, should nonetheless inspire them to pray.\n\nOmid Safi, a professor of Islamic studies at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, said tradition holds that both solar and lunar eclipses are “divine matters unfolding in nature” while honoring the prophet’s “steadfast refusal to use the fortuitous occasion of a solar eclipse at the passing of his son as a way of bolstering his own standing.”\n\nWhile Islam’s eclipse prayer is not a mandatory one, many still take time to recite it. During last fall’s annular eclipse, Muslim Americans around the U.S. gathered in places such as the Muslim Community Center–East Bay in Pleasanton, California; The Mecca Center in Willowbrook, Illinois; and Commons Park in Fridley, Minnesota.\n\nNadia Abuisnaineh, who volunteers as a NASA solar system ambassador in the Minneapolis area, organized the Minnesota event hoping not only to pique her community’s scientific curiosity but also its sense of identity as Muslims.\n\nStill, she had no idea the public gathering would come as Palestinians scrambled to evacuate northern Gaza in anticipation of a massive counteroffensive by Israeli forces, a week after the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas on Israel. The timing made the gathering all the more powerful, she said.\n\n“My community was very hurt, and for them, it was a time to reflect and ask God to alleviate the pain and suffering,” Abuisnaineh said. “I never imagined that five months later, with the second eclipse coming, that we would still have to think about this and be advocating for our brothers and sisters in Palestine.”\n\nThose who witnessed the October eclipse were overcome by the event, she recalled, in particular, two older people who were moved to tears.\n\n“Whether they were tears of grief because of what was happening in Gaza or just being overwhelmed by the eclipse and strengthening their relationship with God, it’s a privilege to allow people to do that,” she said.\n\nWith the April 8 event coming during the most intense period of Ramadan, Abuisnaineh isn’t planning to arrange another prayer gathering. Instead, she plans to remind community members to use the time to reflect.\n\nAn avid stargazer who takes any opportunity to view the night sky, she’s not about to miss a solar eclipse.\n\n“If it’s sunny, I’ll take out all my eclipse glasses and knock on every door in my neighborhood,” Abuisnaineh said. “It’s just a bummer to live your life and not know these things happen.”\n\nEclipse for kids?Decoding the sky: A definitive solar eclipse guide for kids (adults also welcome)\n\nA warning of God’s imminent wrath?\n\nPerspectives on eclipses vary widely within the Jewish community, said Mark Horowitz, chief operating officer for the Jewish Community Center of Greater Buffalo, New York. More conservative members, he said, still consider them warnings, especially for those in their path of totality.\n\n“There are a lot of people who don’t believe it’s a time for putting on glasses, getting together and drinking or whatever people are going to do,” Horowitz said. “Some people believe it’s a time for prayer and introspection.”\n\nThe Hebrew word for eclipse, he noted, translates to “defect.”\n\nWeather on eclipse day:Everything to know about Monday's total solar eclipse: Latest forecast includes optimism\n\n“When the luminaries are stricken, it is an ill omen for the world,” reads the Talmud, a central text of Judaism. The passage offers the example of a king who, after preparing a feast for his servants, becomes angry with them and orders the removal of the lantern illuminating their banquet.\n\nEven now, some say celestial happenings warn of God’s imminent wrath; some have even claimed they bear political significance. In November 2022, some ultraconservative Christian pastors said the approaching blood moon lunar eclipse portended a surge of Republican midterm wins.\n\n“God is warning America of impending disaster and destruction,” Anne Graham Lotz, daughter of iconic evangelist Billy Graham and founder of AnGel Ministries, wrote on her blog as the solar eclipse of August 2017 approached.\n\nMore recently, Lotz has seen speculation among some that the combined paths over the U.S. of this year’s eclipse and the previous two solar eclipses appear to mimic the shapes of the first and last letters of the Hebrew alphabet – in other words, the beginning and the end.\n\n“Maybe people are reading too much into it,” she said. “But when you look at the world, you don’t need an eclipse to know that things are getting really dangerous. Maybe it’s telling us it’s time to get right with God and the people in our lives so that we have no regrets.”\n\nEclipses offer a spiritual experience, even for nonbelievers\n\nSchaefer, of Louisiana State University, said as the science behind eclipses began to be understood, some used such knowledge to their advantage, among them Christopher Columbus, who in 1504 was shipwrecked with his crew in Jamaica and for months relied on local natives to provide food in exchange for trinkets.\n\nAs those gifts started to wear thin, the natives refused to continue, Schaefer said. Columbus seized on the idea of using an approaching lunar eclipse to convince the locals he could commune with the gods and make the moon disappear.\n\n“That’s the beauty of science, is when you make predictions they come true,” Schaefer said. “Columbus knew it was just a shadow. But the Jamaicans saw it as a death of a god. Once you understand what an eclipse is, it’s no longer the realm of the gods.”\n\nStill, he said, even the way Americans view eclipses has changed over time. Accounts of New Yorkers witnessing a total eclipse in 1924 described silent crowds of people solemnly taking it in.\n\n“Now it’s just raucous fun,” Schaefer said. “No one is fearful that Jupiter will come down and steal their soul.”\n\nWitnessing a solar eclipse, however, can provide a spiritual experience, even for those who aren’t necessarily religious, he and others said.\n\nFormer NASA engineers Jeff Stone and his wife, Susan, will be experiencing the eclipse from their hilltop home in Kerrville, Texas.\n\n“Her priority was to have a nice view,” Stone said. “My priority was to be as close to the centerline of the eclipse as possible. We managed to do both.”\n\nWhen they worked as flight controllers for the Space Shuttle program at Houston’s Johnson Space Center, the couple traveled to Mexico in 1991 to experience nearly seven minutes of totality when a solar eclipse passed over the region. They’ve been eclipse-chasers ever since.\n\nOn April 8, the Stones will host a dozen-plus visitors from as far away as Sweden to experience this year’s event.\n\n“It’s such an emotional event,” Stone said. “It touches your soul, it really does. Any time you realize there’s something bigger than you, it gives you perspective. Surely that power has a purpose.”\n\nIn Buffalo, Horowitz said the eclipse, an obvious reminder of nature’s beauty, offers a chance to reflect on nature’s fragility and to find hope amid worldly chaos and personal challenges.\n\n“You can sometimes be clouded by all that darkness,” he said. “The natural world is trying to tell us that beyond the darkness, there is light.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/archives/2014/11/15/protecting-our-dwindling-water/74070200/", "title": "Quenching Our Future, Part 1: Protecting the Rio Grande Basin's ...", "text": "Marty Schladen\n\nElPaso\n\n›› Do you speak Australian?

Because the subject is so big and so thorny, it's a project that is likely to last years.\n\nThe analysis has involved scores of interviews and a trip to Australia, the world's driest inhabited continent and the scene of a catastrophic drought that blazed through the century's first decade.\n\nIn the early 2000s, El Paso civic leaders worked hard to show the region had enough water to retain the massive Fort Bliss Army post, and in 2005, it won a massive expansion.\n\nBut by the early 2000s, the region might already have been plunged into a new era of drought. Last year was the driest since the Rio Grande Project Act was signed in 1906.\n\n\"In this area, we've been promoting and promoting and promoting, and, finally, we've gotten all this growth,\" said Jesus \"Chuy\" Reyes, who manages the county's biggest water user, El Paso Water Improvement District No. 1. \"To think we may not have enough water to sustain that is scary.\"\n\nBy the end of the century, water supplies in the Rio Grande from all sources will decrease by about a third, according to estimates by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which, along with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, manages water in the basin.\n\n\"There's a lot of people who depend on a water source that has an uncertain future to it,\" said Brad Udall, a water scientist at Colorado State University.\n\nUdall is the son of former U.S. Rep. Morris Udall of Arizona and nephew of former Interior Secretary Stewart Udall, who were at the center of federal water policy for the West in the 1960s and '70s — an era of huge mistakes and great reforms.\n\nBrad Udall says that when it comes to national policy, the Rio Grande Basin doesn't get respect.\n\n\"The area just doesn't seem to be on the radar screen — especially for water problems,\" he said.\n\nIn fact, a NASA news release this summer about groundwater depletion in the rest of the country said, \"The Colorado River is the only major river in the southwestern United States.\"\n\nThe document ignored the 1,900-mile Rio Grande, which waters three major cities, forms 1,200 miles of the border with Mexico and makes possible billions of dollars worth of agriculture throughout its length. The river provides drinking water for about 3 million people in New Mexico, El Paso and Juárez.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, Elephant Butte Reservoir — on which downstream residents, businesses and farms depend for all of their surface water — had been reduced to a mere puddle, holding only 3 percent of its capacity.\n\n›› Drought Dries Elephant Butte Reservoir\n\nExperience in Australia and along the Rio Grande shows it's possible to survive in regions with little water. That survival is only possible if people understand that the availability of water is diminishing, and drastic steps must be taken to sustain our water and our future.\n\nHard decisions lie ahead if we hope to avoid being driven from the Southwest the way past scarcity appears to have driven out earlier civilizations such as the Anasazi, who held on for 600 years in what is now Northern New Mexico. After centuries of deforestation and misuse of water, scientists believe a drought sealed their ultimate doom.\n\nSeen, but not noticed\n\nIn his 2011 book \"The Big Thirst,\" Charles Fishman explains how water comes from space and has been on Earth in a fixed amount. It's a fundamental part of weather and the ecosystem and it's the essential molecule in our bodies.\n\n\"Given that water is both the most familiar substance in our lives, and the most important substance in our lives, the really astonishing thing is that most of us don't think of ourselves as having a relationship to water,\" Fishman wrote. Meanwhile, \"it's perfectly natural to talk about our relationship to our car or our relationship to food, our relationship to alcohol, or money, or to God.\"\n\nWith the advent of plentiful, clean water, Fishman continued, life expectancy has increased dramatically.\n\n\"We've spent the last hundred years in a kind of aquatic paradise: our water has been abundant, safe and cheap,\" he wrote. \"The 20th century was really the first time when all three of those things were true. It has created a kind of golden age of water, when we could use as much as we wanted, whenever we wanted, for almost no cost.\"\n\nAt least in the Rio Grande Basin, that golden age appears to be at an end, said David Gutzler, a climatologist at the University of New Mexico who sits on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nGutzler, along with the overwhelming majority of his colleagues, believes that human activity is making the Earth warmer. There's less consensus about how quickly it's happening, and how exactly to predict its effect on individual regions such as the Rio Grande Basin, he said.\n\nPeople don't even have to believe that humans are heating the planet to worry that not enough water will run down the Rio Grande in the not-so-distant future, Gutzler said.\n\n\"We had tremendous population growth in the late 20th century,\" he said. \"We can't assume that conditions during that population growth will continue. That would be a huge mistake.\"\n\nThat's because an analysis of other data — including those gleaned from the rings of 700-year-old trees — indicates that the period when El Paso, Juárez, Las Cruces and Albuquerque grew so rapidly was unusually wet, scientists say.\n\n\"Much of the recent, huge urban population growth in the middle Rio Grande region has taken place during an anomalously wet period in the late 20th century that is not at all typical of millennial average conditions,\" Gutzler wrote in a 2013 scientific paper.\n\n›› Read paper here\n\nOne of the cruel ironies of water is that Earth won't ever run out of it, but its distribution can change so that it washes over some places and it mummifies others.\n\nFor desert cities such as El Paso, this is hardly news. Deluges — such as one that drowned the city in 2006 — punctuate droughts such as the Texas \"drought of record\" that ran from 1950 to 1957, scorching all but 10 counties into disaster areas.\n\nEven when they're dealing with flooded streets as they were in September, El Paso's water managers have to plan for the months and years when little or no snow will fall in Colorado's San Juan Mountains, which supplies 60 to 65 percent of the water in the river.\n\nThe El Paso Water Utility has a complex portfolio of supplies, balancing water pumped from the ground with surface water it buys from El Paso Water Improvement District No. 1. The two are connected to the same hydrologic system — if the river runs dry, the ground underneath will eventually be pumped dry.\n\nThe El Paso utility is aware of this and has long been taking steps to conserve. Through a series of measures, per-person consumption in El Paso has fallen by 41 percent since the 1970s.\n\nThat puts it well ahead of many of its counterparts.\n\n\"Per-capita water use in El Paso is the lowest in the state of Texas,\" said Bill Hargrove, the director of the Center for Environmental Resource Management at the University of Texas at El Paso. \"I think they're one of the best water utilities in the country, but you have to look at their competition.\"\n\nEven with its conservation efforts, the supply-demand equation poses serious challenges for the utility.\n\nThis summer, demand peaked at more than 160 million gallons a day — close to its present capacity to pump from the ground. The utility holds annual rights to another 23 billion gallons of surface water, but access to it diminishes in a drought, when the Elephant Butte Irrigation District and El Paso County Water Improvement District 1 have to divvy up what little water is available.\n\n\"We need to be in a position where we can live without water from the Rio Grande,\" said John Balliew, president and CEO of the water utility.\n\nTo further hedge against shortage, El Paso Water Utility will build an advanced-treatment plant in 2017.\n\nKnown as \"potable reuse,\" the system will purify already cleaned wastewater used for irrigation and send it to the utility's residential and business customers. That will add 10 million gallons a day — a needed enhancement, but probably not enough to deal with the stresses of dwindling supply and growing population.\n\nThe biggest gulp\n\nSome of the largest utilities and some of the smallest households are continuing to innovate ways to conserve water. By far, the biggest potential for savings lies in agriculture.\n\nIn the West, 80 percent of the water is used to irrigate pecans, cotton, fruit, vegetables and water livestock. The rules that govern such use don't account for the future scarcity that scientists now predict.\n\nThey arise from a tangle of laws, interstate compacts and treaties that were written at a time when the government saw the West as an arid wasteland in need of settlement. As dams were built, reservoirs were filled and new lands were opened to irrigation. Reliable water was available in immense quantities, making possible the Southwest's great cities.\n\nBut the original rules and policies did a poor job of anticipating a time when there might not be enough water — no matter how far you diverted it or how many mountain ranges you pumped it over.\n\nIn \"Cadillac Desert,\" his classic book on the subject, Marc Reisner wrote that under the current system, not only do many Western farmers have few incentives to conserve, they can suffer financial losses for doing so.\n\nSandra Postel, a freshwater fellow with the National Geographic Society, recently told water managers that the haphazard patchwork of management needs to change.\n\n\"We don't have comprehensive standards for agricultural water use,\" she said.\n\nThose standards, Postel said, should take into account the entire systems they're meant to protect.\n\n\"I think we need to think bigger and bolder — at the river-basin scale,\" she said.\n\nLearning the hard way\n\nThrough a decadelong drought, Australia was forced to think on such a scale.\n\nBy the mid-2000s, the drought in the country's biggest river basin, the Murray-Darling, had become so severe that policymakers were worrying that people in Melbourne might not be able to take showers. Even now, residents in the region stick three-minute timers to their stalls to remind themselves to clean up and get out.\n\nAustralia has placed special emphasis on agricultural conservation because, as in the U.S. Southwest, that's where the vast majority of water goes. Australia has transformed the way farmers use the resource — trading it in robust commodity markets and revolutionizing the infrastructure that carries it to their fields.\n\nConditions on the Rio Grande might prompt similar urgency, Brad Udall said.\n\n\"If the drought continues, we might end up where the Australians are,\" he said.\n\nThe new system of allocating water in Australia was greeted with great fear and skepticism among Australian farmers and many have been shaken out of the business. Many of those who remain acknowledge that radical change was needed and in many ways it has been a boon to the industry.\n\n\"There have never been so many farmers changing how they farm their land,\" said Ian Mansbridge, a fourth-generation farmer and a director of the Goulburn-Murray Rural Water Corp. \"The drought wasn't bad for farmers in the sense that it made them understand how much water they need to do what they do.\"\n\nSoutheastern Australia is a far different place when compared with the region that is watered by the Rio Grande. What seems to be working there might not be possible here.\n\nBut the need for change is certain.\n\n\"We need a whole new framework,\" UTEP's Hargrove said.\n\nMarty Schladen may be reached at 512-479-6606.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/environment/2015/12/10/pumped-beyond-limits-many-us-aquifers-decline/76570380/", "title": "Pumped beyond limits, many U.S. aquifers in decline", "text": "Story by Ian James and Steve Reilly | Photos and video by Steve Elfers | Dec. 10, 2015\n\nSUBLETTE, Kansas – Just before 3 a.m., Jay Garetson’s phone buzzed on the bedside table. He picked it up and read the text: “Low Pressure Alert.”\n\nHe felt a jolt of stress and his chest tightened. He dreaded what that automated message probably meant: With the water table dropping, another well on his family’s farm was starting to suck air.\n\nThe Garetson family has been farming in the plains of southwestern Kansas for four generations, since 1902. Now they face a hard reality. The groundwater they depend on is disappearing. Their fields could wither. Their farm might not survive for the next generation.\n\nAt dawn, Jay was out among the cornfields at the well, trying to diagnose the problem. The pump was humming as it lifted water from nearly 600 feet underground. He turned a valve and let the cool water run into his cupped hands. Just as he had feared, he saw fine bubbles in the water.\n\n“It’s showing signs of weakening,” he said sadly, standing in the shoulder-high corn.\n\n“This’ll last another five or 10 years, but not even at the production rate that we’re at here today,” he said. “It’s just a question of how much time is left.”\n\nTime is running out for portions of the High Plains Aquifer, which lies beneath eight states from South Dakota to Texas and is the lifeblood of one of the world’s most productive farming economies. The aquifer, also known as the Ogallala, makes possible about one-fifth of the country’s output of corn, wheat and cattle. But its levels have been rapidly declining, and with each passing year more wells are going dry.\n\nAs less water pours from wells, some farmers are adapting by switching to different crops. Others are shutting down their drained wells and trying to scratch out a living as dryland farmers, relying only on the rains.\n\nIn parts of western Kansas, the groundwater has already been exhausted and very little can be extracted for irrigation. In other areas, the remaining water could be mostly used up within a decade.\n\nThe severe depletion of the Ogallala Aquifer is symptomatic of a larger crisis in the United States and many parts of the world. Much more water is being pumped from the ground than can be naturally replenished, and groundwater levels are plummeting. It’s happening not only in the High Plains and drought-ravaged California but also in places from the Gulf Coastal Plain to the farmland of the Mississippi River Valley, and from the dry Southwest to the green Southeast.\n\nIn a nationwide examination of the problem, USA TODAY and The Desert Sun analyzed two decades of measurements from more than 32,000 wells and found water levels falling in nearly two-thirds of those wells, with heavy pumping causing major declines in many areas. The analysis of U.S. Geological Survey data revealed that:\n\nNationwide, water levels have declined in 64 percent of the wells included in the government database during the past two decades.\n\nThe average decline among decreasing wells has been more than 10 feet, and in some areas the water table has dropped more than 100 feet during that period – more than 5 feet per year.\n\nFor 13 counties in Texas, New Mexico, Mississippi, Kansas and Iowa, average water levels have decreased more than 40 feet since 1995.\n\nNationally, the average declines have been larger from 2011-2014 as drought has intensified in the West. But water tables have been falling consistently over the years through both wet and dry periods, and also in relatively wet states such as Florida and Maryland.\n\nAcross the High Plains, one of the country’s largest depletion zones, the average water levels in more than 4,000 wells are 13.2 feet lower today than they were in 1995. In the southern High Plains, water levels have plunged significantly more – in places over 100 feet in just 20 years.\n\nAquifers are being drawn down in many areas by pumping for agriculture, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of the nation’s use of fresh groundwater. Water is also being drained for cities, expanding development and industries. Across much of the country, overpumping has become a widespread habit. And while the symptoms have long remained largely invisible to most people, the problem is analogous to gradually squandering the balance of a collective bank account. As the balance drops, there’s less of that resource to draw on when it’s needed.\n\nAt the same time, falling groundwater levels are bringing increasing costs for well owners, water utilities and society as a whole. As water levels drop, more energy is required to lift water from wells, and those pumping bills are rising. In areas where aquifers are being severely depleted, new wells are being drilled hundreds of feet into the earth at enormous cost. That trend of going deeper and deeper can only go on so long. When groundwater levels fall to precarious lows and wells are exhausted, farming businesses can suffer. And in particularly hard-hit communities, such as parts of California, homeowners have been left relying on tanker trucks to deliver their water.\n\nSince the beginning of the 20th century, the United States is estimated to have lost more than 1,000 cubic kilometers of water from the nation’s aquifers – about 28 times the amount of water that can be held in Lake Mead, the country’s largest reservoir.\n\nThat estimate of water losses from 1900 through 2008, calculated by USGS scientist Leonard Konikow, shows the High Plains has accounted for 35 percent of the country’s total depletion. California’s Central Valley accounted for more than 14 percent, and other parts of the country have depleted the remainder, about half of the total.\n\nIn places, water that seeped underground over tens of thousands of years is being pumped out before many fully appreciate the value of what’s lost. The declines in groundwater in the United States mirror similar decreases in many parts of the world.\n\nNASA satellites have allowed scientists to map the changes underground on a global scale for the first time, putting into stark relief a drawdown that has long remained largely out of sight. The latest satellite data, together with measurements of water levels in wells, reveal widespread declines in places from Europe to India, and from the Middle East to China.\n\n“Groundwater depletion is this incredible global phenomenon,” said Jay Famiglietti, a professor of earth system science at the University of California, Irvine, and the senior water scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. “We never really understood it the way we understand it now. It’s pervasive and it’s happening at a rapid clip.”\n\nFamiglietti and his colleagues have found that more than half of the world’s largest aquifers are declining. Those large-scale losses of groundwater are being monitored from space by two satellites as part of the GRACE mission, which stands for Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment.\n\nSince 2002, the orbiting satellites have been taking detailed measurements of Earth’s gravity field and recording changes in the total amounts of water, both aboveground and underground. Using that data, the researchers have created a global map showing areas of disappearing water as patches of yellow, orange and red. Those “hotspots” mark regions where there is overpumping of water or where drought has taken a toll.\n\nThe map shows that, just as scientists have been predicting due to climate change, some areas in the tropics and the higher latitudes have been growing wetter, Famiglietti said, while many dry and semi-arid regions in the mid-latitudes have been growing drier. In those same dry regions, intensive agriculture is drawing heavily on groundwater. And with little rain to recharge the aquifers, their levels are dropping.\n\n“Many of these resources are finite,” Famiglietti said. “It took tens of thousands of years to accumulate this water, and we’re burning through it in a matter of decades.”\n\nIn many regions, government agencies and water districts have studied the problem but haven’t taken sufficient steps to manage aquifers or prevent declines.\n\nAlongside climate change, groundwater depletion has become another human-caused crisis that could bring devastating consequences. As aquifers are pushed far beyond their natural limits, water scarcity is battering farms, undermining economies and intensifying disputes over water.\n\nIn parts of the southern High Plains, farmers are feeling the effects. Some counties have seen small decreases in population as people have moved away. Local leaders have been expressing concerns about what sorts of businesses can help sustain their economies as water supplies dwindle.\n\nThe Kansas Geological Survey has mapped out how much longer the aquifer can support large-scale pumping. It projects that some places still probably have more than a century of water left, but that large patches of western Kansas will go dry in less than 25 years. Some areas will likely run out faster, within a matter of years.\n\nThe Ogallala Aquifer’s decline shows what the world can expect in other areas where groundwater is being quickly depleted, Famiglietti said. “The fact that they’re running out of water means that we will no longer be growing food there, and so where will that food come from?”\n\nIn Haskell County, Kansas, windswept fields of sorghum and corn stretch to the flat horizon in a swaying sea. The huge farms, many of them in the thousands of acres, still appear lush and productive. But driving along the arrow-straight country roads, Jay Garetson can point out spots where wells have gone dry – both on his family’s land and other farms.\n\nAll that’s left at one of his decommissioned wells is a round metal cover on a concrete slab, with a rusty Frigidaire lying on its side next to it. His grandfather once used the refrigerator to store oil for the pump.\n\nOpening the well’s metal lid, Jay dropped in a rock. It pinged off the steel casing. More than five seconds later, there was faint splash.\n\n“Now the only water it finds is a couple three feet at the very bottom of the well that the pumps can’t effectively access anymore,” Jay said, his voice echoing in the empty well.\n\nHe and his brother, Jarvis, drilled this well in the early 2000s when a shallower well failed. It lasted less than a decade, and then it went dry in 2012, forcing them to drill again – this time 600 feet deep, down to the bedrock at the bottom of the aquifer. It’s hard to say how long that well might last.\n\nIf the water keeps dropping about 5 feet per year, he said, it might be finished in as few as 10 years.\n\n“Very simply, we’re running out, and it’s happening far faster than anybody anticipated,” he said. “And as optimistic as I’d like to be about the future, the window for that optimism is closing very quickly.”\n\nHe put the cover back on the old well, pointing out a tag that was placed on it by a state regulatory agency.\n\n“We’re documenting very well the demise of the aquifer, but we’re not making the real-world changes in the way we manage the aquifer to really do the serious things that need to happen,” Jay said. “We seem to be unwilling to take the necessary steps to actually reduce water usage.”\n\nJay is an influential farmer and a longstanding member of the Kansas State Board of Agriculture who has been appointed by both Democratic and Republican governors. He has many ideas about how to extend the life of the aquifer, including mandatory water cutbacks that would be shared by farmers. But he has faced resistance from those who oppose mandatory limits.\n\nOver the past five years, the pumping capacity of the Garetsons’ wells has decreased by about 30 percent as the water table has fallen. They’ve been forced to plant less corn and instead more wheat and sorghum, which use less water and bring in smaller earnings.\n\nWhen Jay’s grandparents drilled wells in the mid-20th century, they were told the water supply was inexhaustible. They had clung to their land through the hardships of the Dust Bowl, when blowing drifts of soil and grit decimated crops and sent many others packing. In the decades that followed, they built a successful business on the water they pumped from the ground.\n\nSince then, numerous studies have shown that the status quo is far from sustainable. Starting in 1986, Congress directed the USGS to monitor and report on changes in the levels of the Ogallala Aquifer, recognizing its economic importance. An estimated 30 percent of the groundwater used for irrigation in the country is pumped from the aquifer. Researchers have projected that without action to slow the losses, the portion of the aquifer in Kansas will be nearly 70 percent depleted within 50 years.\n\n“What frustrates me is with all this knowledge and all this information, we still collectively refuse to act,” Jay said. “I don’t understand how we can all be so lacking in courage when we all can clearly see this is a train wreck happening in slow motion.”\n\nThe costs of inaction are visible just down the road, at a farmhouse where Jay lived as a young boy. Today the white house is abandoned. Weeds have grown around the front steps. Scraps of wood lie in a pile on the porch like logs on a campfire.\n\nWhen the well went dry two years ago, a farm employee was forced to move out. The Garetsons drilled test holes but found no more water to tap.\n\nIn the yard, Jay pointed out the spot beneath a dying elm tree where he used to play on the swings. “It’s probably seen its last swing set in the yard,” he said wistfully.\n\n“It’s something I used to read about and study, you know, the Dust Bowl. And you would see these abandoned farmsteads, and now I’m actually seeing it in my own lifetime,” he said. “Now we’re kind of at the end of the tracks here, and the only thing left to do is decide whether we should go ahead and push the house in and burn it, or probably the most painful option in my mind is to stand back and watch time just slowly melt it down.”\n\nThe worst-case scenario, he said, is that within a decade many more homes in the area could look just like this one – dry and deserted.\n\nThe United States, along with India and China, is one of the largest users of groundwater in the world.\n\nThe federal government has estimated that in 2010, the country used 76 billion gallons of fresh groundwater per day. That’s 117,000 cubic feet per second, roughly comparable to Niagara Falls. Wells across the country are pumping out as much water – even slightly more – than the average flow of approximately 100,000 cubic feet per second that tourists see plunging from the top of Niagara Falls.\n\nWhen groundwater is pumped from wells, some of it is soaked up by plants, some evaporates, some courses through pipes to cities, and some soaks back into the ground. Part of it ends up flowing into the oceans, adding to the global problem of rising seas as glaciers and ice sheets melt.\n\nMost of the planet’s available freshwater lies underground. Aquifers store water like sponges, holding it in the spaces between rocks, sand, gravel and clay. So much water is now being sucked from some aquifers that those underground spaces are collapsing and the surface of the Earth has been permanently altered.\n\nThe ground has sunk in parts of California, Texas, Arizona and Nevada, cracking the foundations of houses, leaving fissures in the ground, and damaging roads, canals and bridges. As layers of aquifers gradually subside, their water-storing capacity is irreversibly decreasing.\n\nGroundwater levels have changed relatively little in some of the country’s wetter areas, as rainfall and snowmelt have offset the amounts pumped out. But even in pockets of the Northeast and upper Midwest, there have been significant declines. Average water levels in Cumberland County, N.J., for instance, decreased nearly 6 feet over the past two decades. In Outagamie County, Wis., there was a decline of 6.1 feet.\n\nElsewhere, there has been significant depletion across entire regions, largely driven by agriculture. Average water levels fell by 5.7 feet across the Mississippi River Valley aquifer system, by 12.6 feet in the Columbia Plateau basaltic rock aquifers of the Pacific Northwest, and by 17.8 feet in some of the Snake River Plain’s aquifers of southern Idaho.\n\nAs the nation’s population grows, expanding cities and suburban development are also having an effect. Total U.S. water use has decreased in recent years due to improvements in efficiency and conservation, but the cumulative strains on groundwater have continued to build.\n\nBig drops in water tables have occurred in many parts the country. The U.S. Geological Survey’s data show that individual monitoring wells with water level decreases of more than 100 feet in the past two decades are located in a long list of states: California, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Maryland, Washington, Oregon, Kansas, Iowa, Arkansas, Idaho, Arizona, Louisiana, Colorado, Wyoming and Mississippi.\n\nSaltwater has been seeping into declining aquifers along portions of the Atlantic coast in places such as Hilton Head, S.C. and Savannah, Ga., and beneath coastal cities in Florida such as Jacksonville, Miami and Tampa. When saltwater intrusion taints supplies of drinking water, it can force water districts to use different wells or invest in other costly solutions.\n\nIn parts of the desert Southwest and the Great Plains, natural springs that used to gush from the ground have dried up.\n\nThere have also been long-term declines in groundwater levels around urban areas including Chicago, Milwaukee, Wis., Long Island, N.Y., Baton Rouge, La., Memphis, Tenn., and Houston.\n\nIn each state, the use of groundwater falls under different laws. In many areas, though, the agencies charged with managing water supplies have allowed aquifers to fall into a state of perpetual overdraft, with water levels receding deeper by the year. Even where groundwater regulations exist, pumping often remains largely unchecked.\n\n“Like your bank account, you can’t keep depleting it forever. That’s a non-sustainable condition,” the USGS scientist Konikow said. “Society will have to do something about it. Some areas, they are doing things about it. Other areas, it’s going to kind of slap them in the face at some point as a wake-up call.”\n\nIn the farm country of Grant County, Kansas, where grain silos tower over fields that stretch out to a flat horizon, the chamber of commerce hosts an annual dinner that has been a tradition for 53 years. Hundreds of people line up while volunteers dish out local food: barbecued beef, sweet corn, candied squash and prized doughnuts made with milo, another name for sorghum.\n\nThe dinner consistently attracts top state politicians. This September, when Lt. Gov. Jeff Colyer gave a speech to a packed auditorium, he emphasized the importance of water.\n\n“We all know here that the lifeblood of our land is that Ogallala Aquifer below us,” Colyer said. “We’ve got to rely on that water.”\n\nHe said that’s why Gov. Sam Brownback recently launched an effort to develop a “50-year water vision” for the state. Colyer said southwestern Kansas is working to preserve its water, and he pointed to the large cattle industry and the fast-growing dairy business as signs of a bright economic future.\n\nThose applauding at the long tables included Jay Garetson, his wife, Jill, and two teenage sons. But while Jay credits the state government with doing more than ever to focus on water, he’s concerned the consensus-building approach and the voluntary measures being promoted aren’t enough.\n\nIn his office, he rolled out a map to explain why. The map is marked with patches of orange and red denoting areas that have relatively little water left. In one of those spots, “right in the bull’s eye,” he pointed to the family’s hometown of Sublette.\n\nThe biggest problem, he said, is that no one can slow down the decline alone. And those who try to use less water will have the aquifer pumped out from beneath them by neighbors.\n\n“Everybody’s got a straw in the same soda,” Jay said. “When you have a common resource, and the individual motivations are to accelerate the use rather than to stretch it out over a period of time, the net result is everybody loses.”\n\nThe economics of the profit-driven status quo are driving the depletion, he said, and that points to a need for the state and the regional groundwater district to intervene – like a referee in a sporting event that has deteriorated into a free-for-all. He said the referee should “call a timeout.”\n\nThen, he said, “we need to sit down and think about changing the rules.”\n\nWells have been drawing out less water and going dry in places from eastern Colorado and the Texas Panhandle. Northern portions of the aquifer in Nebraska still have more water remaining, but parts of the southern High Plains have been left with parched fields.\n\nIn areas where little water remains, people have been turning to dryland farming, relying on the rains to grow wheat and other crops. That switch leads to sharply reduced earnings per acre. It requires farmers to use much bigger acreages to turn a profit. It means the land will support far fewer farms, and that could bring hard economic times.\n\nJay’s brother Jarvis explained how profound those changes could be, pausing from his work after changing a flat tire on a center-pivot irrigation system.\n\n“It’s tough to think about what’s been in my family for well over a hundred years not being here in 20. It may mean that my kids or my nephews don’t come back, may not even have a chance if that’s their desire,” he said, his voice quavering. “It’s just tough to think about it not being there. I mean, it’s a way of life.”\n\nTrying to make the aquifer last longer, some farmers have been adopting water-saving irrigation systems. A sign on one highway reads: “Make Every Drop of Water Count.”\n\nMarieta Hauser, a dryland farmer who is director of the Grant County Chamber of Commerce, said she’s concerned about what sorts of businesses could take the place of irrigated farming, which drives the economy.\n\n“Ideally we all want the aquifer to last forever. It’s not going to. We realize that. So what’s the best way to go forward and maintain the viability of our communities and our businesses?” Hauser said. “Those are the discussions that I hear more than anything, is ‘What’s going to happen to our communities when irrigation is not viable?’”\n\nSome towns, such as Ulysses and Johnson City, have been buying water rights from farmers to secure enough drinking water supplies to keep the taps flowing.\n\nOne experiment aimed at slashing water use on farms is underway in Sheridan County, in northwestern Kansas, where the state’s first “Local Enhanced Management Area,” or LEMA, was established in 2013. Through that five-year plan, farmers are trying to keep within a “budget” that calls for a 20 percent reduction in water use.\n\nEven as that strategy is showing signs of working, water managers acknowledge it’s not coming close to halting declines in the aquifer. It’s simply buying a bit more time.\n\nMark Rude, executive director of the Southwest Kansas Groundwater Management District No. 3, can put a specific number on the gap between the amounts of water pumped and the quantities of rainfall that recharge the aquifer in an average year: “We’re only about 9 percent sustainable.”\n\nIn other words, the people of southwestern Kansas are pumping out 11 times more than the aquifer’s natural recharge. People are barred from adding new wells in the area. If a new well is drilled, it needs to replace another well that is shut down.\n\nIn practice, the water rights system doesn’t limit pumping at all. In fact, farmers are using much less than they would be permitted under the system of appropriated groundwater rights, which was established decades ago when water seemed plentiful and flood irrigation was the norm.\n\n“Ultimately, I think, budgeting the aquifer is where any area has to start. How much do you have and how much are you willing to see consumed? That’s always a difficult step,” Rude said. When the water district has held meetings and asked farmers whether they’re in favor of developing a water budget, some have been apprehensive about restrictions or mandates.\n\nWhile some keep pumping, others are leaving. Within the traditional Mennonite community, elders have begun sending away young couples to settle in other areas such as the Snake River Plain in Idaho, where even though aquifer levels are declining, more water remains. They’re leaving, Rude said, “because as the water supply leaves, the intensity of agriculture leaves, and the job opportunities also leave.”\n\nFor every acre that runs out of irrigation water and starts being dry-farmed, the state estimates the economy loses nearly $4,000 a year.\n\nThe difference between irrigated fields and dryland farms appears starkly on a large satellite photo on the wall of the water district’s office in Garden City. Patches of brown border the green circles of center-pivot irrigation systems.\n\nMoving a hand across the map, Rude pointed out spots where springs and streams have dried up. One spring was a popular swimming hole half a century ago, he said, and it doesn’t flow anymore.\n\nDecades ago, the Arkansas River used to flow between Garden City and Dodge City. Now all that’s left are scattered patches of reeds in the dry riverbed.\n\nJay Garetson’s wife Jill, who is a teacher, lived near the flowing river as a child. She has watched it disappear, drained by diversions upstream and the declining water table. As a girl, she used to follow her father into cornfields while he fixed sprinklers. Now he’s out of water and relying on several oil wells for income.\n\n“I don’t think we can continue to do things the way we’re doing them,” she said. “Some serious action has to be taken quickly.”\n\nThe Garetsons’ 17-year-old son, Jared, is cautiously assessing the future and thinks it may be difficult to return home to farm after college.\n\nEvery year he helps out during the corn harvest, and as a hobby he flies a drone to film the harvester mowing down golden rows. But he said the aquifer now seems like a gas tank with its gauge approaching “E.”\n\n“If we lose the aquifer, we lose probably 80 percent of our crops out here,” Jared said. “If our water supply is shut off, that’s a huge amount of food that we’re going to have to find elsewhere.”\n\nThey are a close-knit family, and stories of their farming history are woven into conversations around the kitchen table. It’s a legacy that may be slipping away for Jared.\n\n“I’ve thought, why don’t we just pack up, sell the farm and leave? And we’ll find somewhere else that’s got water and that’s going to continue to have water, where we can build?” Jared said. But that’s a difficult idea for his parents and grandparents to accept. “It’s been our home for 113 years now, and for all that to go away and just stop that, that hundred-year-old investment, and that’d be really hard to just pack up and say goodbye to everything.”\n\nAs for Jared’s future, he said in order to make long-term investments in farming, it would be crucial to secure enough water for the next 40 years.\n\n“Until we’ve got our water issue taken care of, then I basically have no future here,” Jared said. “It’s kind of sad, but it’s the harsh reality.”\n\nLarge rice farms in the Mississippi River Valley depend heavily on water pumped from wells. So do fields of cotton, soybeans and corn across portions of Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas and Missouri. The farms are drawing out significantly more than is naturally replenished, and the valley’s alluvial aquifer system has been declining.\n\n“Here, we actually get a lot of rain so you tend to not think of it as being in danger of running low on water,” said Brian Clark, a USGS hydrologist in Little Rock, Arkansas. “But just the sheer amount of use kind of poses that issue.”\n\nOfficials in Arkansas, which is the country’s top rice-producing state, are updating the state’s water plan with proposals for coping with a growing “groundwater gap” in the eastern portion of the state. They’ve recommended building infrastructure to make surface water the primary irrigation source for areas that now depend on a declining supply of groundwater.\n\nOther proposed regulatory changes aimed at addressing strains on groundwater are being debated elsewhere, in wet regions as well as dry regions of the country.\n\nIn Arizona, state lawmakers have been under increasing pressure to consider groundwater regulations for some of the same rural areas that fought off restrictions about 35 years ago. Some farmers and residents in southeastern Arizona are concerned that unregulated pumping is drawing down groundwater levels, and have been pushing the legislature for action to limit the expansion of irrigated farmlands and begin charging fees for groundwater use.\n\nIn Wisconsin, where some people are concerned about farms’ wells drawing down streams and lakes, a bill pending in the legislature would allow state regulators to establish “groundwater protection areas” where there would be tighter permitting rules for new high-capacity wells in order to prevent environmental impacts. The proposed measures would also ease the permitting process for redrilling or repairing existing wells.\n\nIn Iowa, growing demands are being placed on the Jordan Aquifer as water is pumped for cities, farms, and industries such as ethanol plants. In June, the Iowa Environmental Protection Commission approved a new rule aimed at limiting pumping. The measures divide wells into tiers based on how much water levels have declined, and lay out procedures for reductions in water use in areas where the aquifer has dropped significantly.\n\nFlorida has also faced problems with groundwater declines as expanding development has strained water supplies. As the vast Floridan Aquifer has been drawn down, the amounts of water flowing from some of the state’s natural springs have decreased significantly, altering the sensitive environments where fish, turtles and other wildlife have long flourished.\n\n“We have springs that are going silent because they’re not bubbling with the artesian pressure that they did in the past,” said Robert Knight, president of the Gainesville-based Florida Springs Institute, which advocates reducing the extraction of groundwater to safeguard the natural springs. He pointed out that much of the water pumped from wells is being sprayed on lawns.\n\nAs freshwater is pumped out, more seawater has been moving inland underground. And water managers across Florida have been tracking the problem and investing in remedies, including more desalination plants.\n\nThe Tampa Bay area built a seawater desalination plant that can churn out 25 million gallons of drinking water a day. The Tampa Bay Water plant, which has been operating since 2008, has helped reduce the stresses on the area’s groundwater supplies. But that has come at a price, with cost of construction alone totaling $158 million.\n\nAs the Ogallala Aquifer has declined beneath their land, Jay and Jarvis Garetson have been locked in a bitter dispute with a neighboring landowner over water.\n\nThey’re suing the company American Warrior, which owns adjacent farmland, in a case that could set a legal precedent in Kansas.\n\nThe case revolves around one of the Garetsons’ wells. They own a vested water right that is one of the oldest in the area, and they have priority under the state’s “first-in-time, first-in-right” system. They’ve claimed “impairment” of that well by two of the company’s nearby wells.\n\nAmerican Warrior holds junior water rights, and a judge issued an injunction temporarily barring the company from using the wells while the case proceeds.\n\nMike O’Brate, vice president of the family-owned American Warrior, accused the Garetsons of suing out of “greed” and said a lawsuit isn’t the right way to settle the dispute. He said if the Garetsons win, it will set a bad precedent and more suits will follow.\n\n“Everybody will want to file these to shut off their neighbors,” O’Brate said. “Attorneys are going to get filthy rich in a fight over water. It’s not a good thing.”\n\nThe Garetson brothers said the 2012 lawsuit was necessary to defend their family’s livelihood.\n\n“The fact of the matter is, we have a vested right to their junior rights, and Kansas water law is very clear,” Jarvis said. “And the sad thing is we had to get the courts involved to make it happen.”\n\nJay said that in addition to pressing the state to enforce its laws, they hope to call attention to the urgent need for action to preserve the aquifer.\n\n“I guess our family’s decided we’d rather call a question and force everybody to make an informed decision one way or the other than to be complicit in the death of something that didn’t have to go out this way,” he said.\n\nAfter the lawsuit was filed, the Garetsons faced hostility – even death threats.\n\nAs aquifers decline, more legal conflicts are likely to flare up in places across the country. Many disputes have already ended up in the courts.\n\nMississippi, for instance, is in a long-running legal battle with Tennessee and the city of Memphis, claiming the neighboring state is taking groundwater that belongs to Mississippi. In California, where many aquifers have been divvied up by courts, the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians is suing two Coachella Valley water districts in a fight over rights to groundwater.\n\nIn Kansas, the state Water Office and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have studied a proposal to build an aqueduct that would carry water from the Missouri River to the High Plains, and have estimated the cost at $18 billion.\n\nWhen Jay and his family start talking about water, the conversation touches on mega-fixes, such as the idea of building a wind-powered pipeline from the Mississippi River.\n\nIn the meantime, Jay holds out hope there is still time to save what’s left and extend the use of the aquifer. “But it’s going to take immediate action and it’s going to take mandatory action, and that’s something that is hard for most of us out here, who are pretty individualistic and self-reliant, to contemplate.”\n\nAny imposed cutbacks would be painful for everyone, though the pain could be spread around, he said. And water credits could be traded, creating a market that would help deal with scarcity and put the limited water toward high-value uses.\n\nJay sometimes wonders if roadside billboards would help increase the sense of urgency. He envisions signs with cross-section drawings of the aquifer “that show the reservoir declining and force people to admit at least, if we’re not going to act, that it was an informed decision not to act.”\n\nDriving down a dirt road through farmland, Jay talked about what losing the aquifer would mean for his family.\n\n“Thinking about Jared and the challenges that his generation faces, that’s what leaves you gasping for air. It kind of leaves you at a loss for what to do next,” he said, wiping a tear.\n\nJay said he and his brother keep trying to gain five or 10 years by using a new crop or new irrigation technologies. He said their father, Jesse, encourages them to “keep pushing” and keep praying.\n\n“We’ll succeed somewhere. I just always thought it would be here,” he said as he pulled into his gravel driveway next to a cornfield.\n\nHe stood beside the mud-splattered pickup, petting his dog.\n\n“In spite of everything I do and we do, it’s still not enough,” he said, sniffling softly. “My boys and my nephews will never have the … they won’t have the same opportunity.”\n\nHe paused, keeping his composure.\n\n“If they stay here, it’ll be a salvage operation. It won’t be an expansion or a growth or an improvement. It’ll be a salvage operation,” he said. “That’s the mentality they’ll have to have – unless everybody can come together. The problem is everybody won’t come together, in my experience, until it’s too late.”\n\nAs he began to cry, he walked away.\n\nIan James reported from Kansas and Steve Reilly reported from McLean, Virginia.\n\nSteve Elfers of USA TODAY, Caitlin McGlade of The Arizona Republic and Chad Gillis of The News-Press in Fort Myers, Fla., contributed to this report.\n\nThis special report was produced with a grant from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/12/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/hurricanes/2023/05/05/hurricane-season-2023-starts-june-1-predictions-names-and-more/70183694007/", "title": "Hurricane season 2023 starts June 1.

But experts have already noted this season comes with a high level of uncertainty based on a developing El Niño and an unusually warm Atlantic Basin.\n\nA Weather.com analysis indicates that the Gulf of Mexico, off the Southeast U.S. coast and in the eastern Atlantic, is unusually warm for spring. The area already dodged its first scare in early April after forecasters began watching for the potential development of a tropical or subtropical storm, which ultimately fizzled.\n\nApril tropical systems are rare. The last one was Tropical Storm Arlene in the Central Atlantic in 2017. No tropical system has been documented in the Gulf of Mexico in April.\n\nHurricane versus nuke:The 10-megaton reason a nuke doesn't stand a chance against a hurricane\n\nFirst storm of 2023 hurricane season:First subtropical storm of 2023 Atlantic hurricane season happened in January, says NHC\n\nNational Hurricane Center issues tropical outlook with good news\n\nWhile there are a little more than two weeks to go before the official start of the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season, today marks the day when the National Hurricane Center starts issuing its daily tropical outlook.\n\nThe tropical outlook is a daily report that describes the potential for tropical development over the Atlantic basin, which includes not only the Atlantic north of the equator, but the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico.\n\nAll is quiet in the Atlantic basin, with no tropical waves noted.\n\nHurricane predictions for 2023\n\nMeteorologists from Colorado State University in April predicted that a total of 13 tropical storms will form, of which six will become hurricanes. A tropical storm becomes a hurricane when its sustained winds reach 74 mph.\n\nA typical year averages about 14 tropical storms, with seven spinning into hurricanes, based on weather records that date from 1991 to 2020.\n\nThis forecast covers storms that form in the Atlantic basin, which includes the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nColorado State meteorologist Phil Klotzbach told USA Today that two of the six predicted hurricanes should develop into major hurricanes – category 3, 4 or 5 – with sustained wind speeds of 111 mph or greater.\n\n'Large uncertainty':How bad will the 2023 hurricane season be? Why this year's forecast comes with 'large uncertainty'\n\nWhat role does El Niño play?\n\nStrong westerly winds spurred on by El Niño – a natural climate pattern marked by warmer-than-average Pacific Ocean water – tend to prevent nascent Atlantic storms from developing. This occurs because those increased upper-level winds can tear apart hurricanes as they try to form.\n\nIn its latest forecast released in April, the Climate Prediction Center issued an \"El Nino watch,\" noting that El Niño could appear as soon as May, with a 62% chance it forms at some point between May and July of this year.\n\nAccording to CSU, a potentially robust El Niño and an unusually warm tropical and subtropical Atlantic sends conflicting signals that create uncertainty in current predictions.\n\n“Our analog seasons exhibited a wide range of outcomes, from below-normal seasons to hyperactive seasons,” said Klotzbach. “This highlights the large uncertainty that exists with this outlook.”\n\n2023 Hurricane names\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization (WMO) announced the 2023 Atlantic tropical cyclone names. The names are issued alphabetically, using six rotating lists maintained by the WMO.\n\nThis year's list of names was last used in 2017. Four of the names from the list were retired following that season: Harvey, Irma, Maria and Nate, which have been replaced by Harold, Idalia, Margot and Nigel. Storms are named once they gain enough strength to develop into tropical or subtropical storms. While these names are often reused, some hurricanes cause so much destruction that the WMO retire them from use.

Others have complained about bugs and error messages.\n\nCBP One app:The app worked for this family. Others raise concerns\n\nCastillo decided to make the trek to the U.S. after people threatened to kill her and everyone else in the store she worked at unless they were paid a ransom.\n\nCastillo, her daughter and her cousin traveled for 15 days, hitching rides in the back of trucks, she said. Once in Mexico, she tried to cross the border to turn herself in, but she was detained and sent back to Mexico under Title 42.\n\nShe found the shelter in San Luis and has been at Divina Providencia since December. Months of trying to get an appointment with no luck had made her feel hopeless.\n\n“I said I guess I’ll have to settle here,” she said. “I would cry thinking about how I didn’t want to return (to Guatemala).”\n\nHowever, almost two weeks ago, Castillo successfully booked an appointment on May 2 for mid-May.\n\nFor Amaya, Thursday was the day she successfully got an appointment.\n\nAmaya left El Salvador when her family began to receive death threats after being forced to pay a fee to keep their shop open.

The church has served as temporary shelter since 2018, coordinating with federal authorities to receive and help undocumented immigrants who are released after crossing the border.\n\n“Authorities have just called us telling us that they want us to increase our capacity,” Campos told The Republic. “As of right now, we have the capacity to receive about 100 migrants. Today we received 40.”\n\nHe said that his church does not typically receive undocumented folks on Fridays.\n\nCampos said that the last thing they want is to overload the facilities and, moving forward, volunteers will try to help those who are arriving as quickly as possible, connecting them with their relatives and clearing up space for others to arrive.\n\nUnlike 2018, when Campos would personally pick up immigrants from the Welcome Center in Phoenix, now border officials drop off immigrants to Phoenix-area shelters.\n\nMagdalena Schwartz, pastor at Vineyard Community Church in Gilbert, also received a call asking her to receive more immigrants than they usually accept.\n\n\"I told them that we could not expand our capacity because since we did not receive funds, we would continue receiving the same numbers that we have received up to now, maybe 40 or 50 more, but not too many,\" she said.\n\nVineyard has capacity for 150 people. On Thursday 42 arrived and on Friday they received another 48 people. Schwartz explained that the reception of immigrants only takes place on Thursdays and Fridays.\n\nPastor Héctor Ramírez, of the church Iglesia Cristiana El Buen Pastor in Mesa, said he received a call from Arizona officials asking him if he could pick up immigrants, saying they had several \"buses\" full of people in Yuma and they had nowhere to take them.\n\n“For security reasons, we only take in 90 people,” said Ramírez, “We only have four showers, few bathrooms, and when people fill the place, problems begin, because we don't have enough resources or volunteers to attend to all of them.”\n\nOn Thursday they received 32 immigrants of which only seven remained by Friday afternoon. According to Ramírez, they expect to receive a larger group of immigrants next week now that Title 42 restrictions have been lifted.\n\n— Javier Arce\n\nTime will reveal impact on migrant aid organizations, shelters\n\nNOGALES — With thousands of migrants waiting at the border to claim asylum and cross into the U.S., local aid organizations were still waiting to get a better idea of what’s ahead.\n\nBy late Friday morning, the Arizona side of the Nogales border entry had calmed from the morning rush of commuters with no obvious signs of asylum seekers in the mix.\n\n“As of right now we haven’t seen any major changes,” said Diego Piña-Lopez, program manager for Casa Alitas Welcome Center in Tucson, the morning after the restrictions were lifted.\n\nThe main task for shelters and aid organizations will be adapting to the specific needs of the migrant population they are anticipating.\n\nMany people have been waiting to claim asylum for months or years, and have very few clothes or possessions, he said.\n\nFurther, a large portion of migrants coming from Central America bring with them heart-wrenching stories of their journey including what Piña-Lopez calls their “Sophie’s choice:'' to stay in their current situations or to bring their children on the weeks-long trek through the Darién Gap, one of the most dangerous migration routes in the world.\n\n“We as shelters are going to learn more of what the needs are for those folks and might have to increase a variety of our services to support those folks,” he said.\n\n— Lacey Latch\n\nVenezuelan migrants await asylum appointments\n\nNOGALES, Sonora — Wilmer Rafael Carson Castillo left his home in Venezuela eight months ago.He sat on a metal bench steps away from the Dennis DeConcini Port of Entry in Nogales, Sonora, on Friday, waiting for a scheduled CBP One appointment with three other Venezuelan migrants who all attended the town hall meeting at the Kino Border Initiative migrant shelter the day prior.They sat on the bench more than three hours before their scheduled CBP One appointment at noon.“I feel happy and content because I’m going to be with my family,” Castillo said. “The experience is very difficult but you have to fight it. You have to fight for the wellbeing of the family.”Castillo crossed the border without authorization in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, after being in the city for roughly three months. Castillo, his wife and his two children, 7 and 9, were detained by Border Patrol before Castillo was separated from his family and expelled in Tijuana, he said.\n\nHis wife and children were paroled into the country.Castillo stayed in Tijuana for about 20 days before he was able to book a CBP One appointment in Nogales for Friday. Castillo and his friend were both traveling in a large group after they crossed the Darién Gap, one of the world’s most dangerous immigration routes that connects Panama and Colombia.It took Castillo nine days to cross the Darién. Migrants must traverse the treacherous path of jungle and mountains, facing robbers, hunger, deadly animals and illness.“If you get sick there, you stay, because how do you get out of there,” Castillo said.“Suddenly you get out of the jungle, well, the other jungle is Mexico.”Some Venezuelan migrants have said that they prefer the deadly Darién Gap to traveling through Mexico, where they are often robbed, assaulted or in danger of being kidnapped. Castillo and his fellow traveler were now the only ones from the group who had not made it into the U.S. yet, he said.Within the port of entry nearby, two families sat on the ground in the pedestrian lane for the Secure Electronic Network for Travelers Rapid Inspection, an expedited program that allows preapproved, low-risk travelers to cross into the U.S. more quickly.A young boy from a family from southern Mexico sat next to his mom as he played with a yellow toy car on the ground. The family, with four small children, were indigenous language speakers and their CBP One appointment may take longer than others, given that border officials must get a translator to help.\n\nThe family may be released as late as 6 p.m. Friday, according to Chelsea Sachau, managing attorney of the Border Action Team at the Florence Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project. Sachau was present at the port of entry Friday to help asylum seekers as they wait for their appointments.Castillo urged fellow migrants to be patient and apply for an appointment through the CBP One app.“We’re happy because we got the appointment and I hope that God gives us the pass over there,” Castillo said.\n\n— José Ignacio Castañeda\n\nLegislators call upon Hobbs to ‘activate all available’ resources\n\nRepublican members of the Arizona Legislature called upon Gov. Katie Hobbs to “activate all available state resources” to address the end of Title 42.\n\nThe lawmakers sent the governor their letter Thursday.\n\n“The State of Emergency in Arizona’s border counties that former Governor Ducey declared on April 20, 2021, is still in effect and continues as long as these conditions exist,” they wrote, adding that there should be $240 million in the Border Security Fund. The Legislature created the fund to prevent illegal entry into the state.\n\n“We call upon you to take immediate action and activate all available state resources to keep our communities safe from these dangerous and unprecedented threats,” said the letter from Reps. Gail Griffin (Hereford), Lupe Diaz (Benson), Tim Dunn (Yuma), Michael Carbone (Buckeye), and Michele Pena (Yuma).\n\n— Ryan Randazzo\n\nThousands of migrants estimated to be waiting to cross border\n\nNOGALES, Sonora — The line to cross into the U.S. through the Dennis DeConcini Port of Entry stretched out of the entry turnstiles and into the nearby sidewalk Friday morning.\n\nThe number of people in line was typical for this time of day and even shorter than other days and times, according to Francisco Olachea Martin, an advocate who provides humanitarian assistance to migrants regularly near the port of entry.\n\nHere are some figures on migrants:\n\nThere are 360 migrants present on the Mexican side of the border in Nogales, Sonora, according to estimates released by the Mexican government.\n\nThere are 26,560 migrants on the Mexican side of the U.S.-Mexico border, per the government’s estimates.\n\nThere’s 10,000 migrants in Ciudad Juarez, 7,000 in Reynosa and 3,000 in Tijuana.\n\nNine hundred forty-two migrants were sent back to Mexico on Thursday with the majority of them coming from Venezuela.\n\n— José Ignacio Castañeda\n\nGreater number of asylum seekers expected to arrive in Phoenix on Friday\n\nA total of 180 asylum seekers arrived on Thursday at The Welcome Center, a 340-bed shelter located in a remodeled school in Phoenix.\n\nAnother 220 asylum seekers are expected to arrive Friday, said Stanford Prescott, senior communications officer for the International Rescue Committee, which runs the center.\n\nThe number of asylum seekers arriving Thursday and Friday is above the approximately 110 arrivals the center had been receiving before Title 42 ended Thursday night but is well within the center’s capacity to serve, Prescott said.\n\nSome of the asylum seekers were dropped off at the center directly by U.S. Department of Homeland Security authorities. Others arrived from shelters in Tucson and Yuma, Prescott said.\n\n— Daniel Gonzalez\n\nGuatemalan president’s calls stir controversy\n\nGuatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei has been making calls to over half a dozen lawmakers, giving Republicans new fodder for bashing Biden over his immigration policies.\n\nAt issue is whether Guatemala could take in migrants with their sights set on the U.S.-Mexico border. That is one of the key initiatives the Department of Homeland Security is rolling out as the pandemic-era immigration policy ends.\n\nAs late as Thursday, the country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs had still not confirmed publicly whether they would be collaborating with the Biden administration's plan, Guatemalan paper Prensa Libre reported.\n\nLawmakers, including Rep. Tony Gonzales, R-Texas, said Guatamalan officials were frustrated they could not reach officials in the Biden administration.\n\n— Staff reports\n\nNo surge in Nogales as of Friday morning\n\nNOGALES — The morning after Title 42 officially expired, virtually nothing had changed on the U.S. side of the Dennis DeConcini port of entry in Nogales.\n\nHundreds of pedestrians trickled through into Arizona in a slow stream, as so many of them do every day.\n\nThere were no clear signs of significant delays as groups of schoolchildren in their uniforms giggled while racing up the ramp after gaining entry, passing by teenagers and workers who were preoccupied with their own conversations and daily routines.\n\nBecause traffic was limited to one lane on each side, it was slow-moving but consistent.\n\nNumerous shuttle operators were waiting at the top of the ramp presumably in anticipation of a potential surge but soon realized there wasn’t going to be a sudden rush of new customers.\n\n— Lacey Latch\n\nCiscomani helps introduce law to extend Title 42\n\nRep. Juan Ciscomani, R-Ariz., and Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, introduced legislation Thursday to extend Title 42 for two years, which would allow officials to expel migrants at the border.\n\nIt would exempt people from removal if they face “persecution or torture because of their membership in a social, political, or religious group, or on a case-by-case basis for humanitarian or medical reasons,” according to an announcement from lawmakers.\n\nThe bill mirrors legislation in the Senate from Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., and Thom Tillis, R-N.C.\n\n“The expiration of Title 42 has brought greater chaos and uncertainty to our southern border,” Ciscomani said in a prepared statement. “Border communities in my district and other states cannot shoulder the burden of this crisis any longer.”\n\n— Ryan Randazzo\n\nFirst asylum seekers arrive Friday in San Ysidro\n\nTIJUANA — The first group of asylum seekers to be processed at the San Ysidro port of entry in San Diego under post-Title 42 changes lined up early Friday morning at the Chaparral border crossing in Tijuana.\n\nThese asylum seekers had secured appointments previously using the CBP One phone app. A large portion of the group included asylum seekers from other parts of the world such as Russia.\n\nPrior to the end of Title 42, Customs and Border Protection had been making 200 appointment slots available each day to migrants waiting in Tijuana to be processed for asylum. But starting on Friday, the number of daily appointments increased to 240, according to Enrique Lucero, the director for Tijuana’s Migrant Affairs Office.\n\nLucero estimates that there were more than 14,000 migrants presently waiting in Tijuana’s shelters and hotels to claim asylum in the United States.\n\nStarting on Friday, all asylum seekers waiting in Mexican border cities were required to make an appointment using the CBP One app in order to be considered for asylum in the United States.\n\nAny other migrant that attempts to cross the border without authorization will be presumed ineligible for asylum under a final rule that took effect on Friday. The rule also makes migrants ineligible if they did not seek protection at a country they traveled through on their way to the United States.\n\n— Rafael Carranza\n\nNo asylum seekers yet in Nogales without appointment\n\nNOGALES, Sonora —The line of people waiting to cross into the U.S. was tailing out of the entrance gates at the Dennis DeConcini Port of Entry early Friday morning. Friday is the first full day that Title 42 is no longer in place.\n\nThe line stretched down the sidewalk nearby. A number of students are in line to cross into the U.S. and go to school.\n\nA handful of people with folded manila envelopes stood in a pedestrian lane. The people were potentially waiting for their scheduled CBP One appointment at 7 a.m.\n\nThere was no sign of asylum seekers attempting to show up at the port without a CBP One appointment.\n\n— José Ignacio Castañeda\n\nAll quiet as Title 42 lifts\n\nNOGALES, Sonora — No one stood in line at the passenger crossing at the Dennis DeConcini Port of Entry when Title 42 was finally lifted at 9 p.m. after more than three years.\n\n“It feels a bit anticlimactic,” said Chelsea Sachau, managing attorney of the Border Action Team at the Florence Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project.\n\nMigrants may be waiting to see what happens in the hours and days after the end of the restriction before showing up at the port of entry, Sachau said.\n\nPeople may have been discouraged to approach the port of entry because of the Biden administration’s finalized rule that would restrict their access to asylum.\n\nFlyers announcing the new expanded functions of CBP One were taped along the fences of the passenger crossing.\n\n— José Ignacio Castañeda\n\nSinema again blasts Biden over Title 42\n\nU.S. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema blasted the Biden administration just before Title 42 expired on Thursday, reiterating her longtime complaint about the government being unprepared for its effects along the border.\n\n“The Administration’s insufficient preparation for the end of Title 42 is unacceptable, and Arizona border communities bear the cost,” Sinema, I-Ariz., said in a statement.\n\n“As Title 42 ends, I’ll continue pushing for additional assistance to Arizona communities in need, and I will keep working with (Sen. Tom Tillis, R-N.C.) and other bipartisan partners to help secure our border, keep Arizonans safe, and ensure migrants are treated fairly and humanely.”\n\nThe statement ratchets up concerns Sinema has voiced since Biden has sought to end the pandemic-era health rule that has helped limit immigration.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\nJudge blocks ‘paroling’ of migrants\n\nWASHINGTON − A federal judge in Florida on Thursday blocked a Biden administration plan to release migrants in the U.S. on \"parole\" because of a surge expected once the emergency immigration restriction known as Title 42 lifts.U.S. District Judge T. Kent Wetherell in the Northern District of Florida wrote that a Biden administration memorandum outlining the parole policy appeared to conflict with a decision from the court in a separate case earlier this year.\n\nWetherell, nominated by then-President Donald Trump, said his order would take effect at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time.\n\n\"The Southwest Border has been out of control for the past 2 years,\" Wetherell wrote. \"And it is about to get worse because, at midnight tonight, the Title 42 order expires.\"\n\n— USA TODAY\n\nMexican police fan out along border\n\nTIJUANA — As the expiration of Title 42 neared on Thursday night, Mexican police and military fanned out along the U.S.-Mexico border fence in Tijuana.\n\nMembers of Mexico’s Federal Police, the Mexican Army and the National Guard could be seen on Thursday evening setting up patrol points every few hundred yards in the areas of Tijuana west of the San Ysidro border crossing with San Diego. The National Guard could also be seen moving across Tijuana on Thursday evening.\n\nMexico’s President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador had pledged to deploy the military in the lead-up to Title 42, especially along Mexico’s southern border with Guatemala to stem the flow of migrants crossing through Mexico.\n\nWhile most of the attention along the border has been focused in Ciudad Juarez, in the past migrants have attempted to rush the border fence in Tijuana leading U.S. officials to deploy tear gas on at least two occasions.\n\nSome of the areas where Mexican soldiers set up guard include the portion where a makeshift camp of asylum seekers had propped up on the American side of the fence, two miles west of the San Ysidro crossing.\n\n— Rafael Carranza\n\nBusiness as usual in Nogales, Arizona, as leaders prepare\n\nNOGALES — Despite the uncertainty ahead regarding Title 42, things on the American side of the border in Nogales were largely operating like normal on Thursday.\n\nChildren continued to play excitedly in the schoolyards just a stone’s throw away from one of the busiest border crossings in the state while cars and pedestrians made their way through town.\n\nPeople shopped, ate and crossed into Mexico and back with relative ease, thanks at least in part to a shorter-than-average wait time throughout most of the day.\n\nIf it weren't for the occasional marked Border Patrol car passing by, someone strolling through the city this afternoon could be completely oblivious to the looming expiration of the pandemic-era restrictions.\n\nWhile Nogales Mayor Jorge Maldonado has been working closely with law enforcement and the leaders in Mexico, he doesn’t expect anything too far out of the norm when Title 42 eventually ends.\n\nWhen he wakes up on Friday and looks at the entry, he said he expects to see the “same tranquility” that usually characterizes the daily flow of travel through the port.\n\nNogales, along with other border towns in the state, have been told to expect migrants somewhere in the “low hundreds,” Maldonado said.\n\nBut instead of the mad rush of people that many might be picturing, he said the limited processing ability in the city will likely mean long wait times, even for those who have scheduled appointments through the agency app.\n\nWhile the city has three ports of entry, the DeConcini port is the only processing center available to manage all of the migrants.\n\n“There’s no reason to have 200 to 300 people in line if they’re not going to be able to process them,” he said. “Stay at the shelters, eat, sleep, whatever, until your time comes.”\n\nHe also warned that those who decide to walk in instead of making an appointment will be handled last.\n\nAnother reason Maldonado isn’t particularly worried is because Nogales is usually resistant to many of the problems faced by other busy border towns because it lacks certain resources.\n\n“We don’t have a federal courthouse. We don’t have all that here for all their needs,” he said. “None of these people are looking to stay here.”\n\nInstead, the city serves primarily as just one of many stopovers on a migrant’s journey, he said. Most who arrive here are gone within 48 hours.\n\nAnd while he’s not specifically concerned about a rush of people, he did join other border town leaders in requesting an emergency declaration for the area, largely as a precaution to protect locals.\n\n“If you don’t do it and you spend funds, you won’t get refunded,” he said. “There’s no reason why we should spend taxpayers' money, the community’s money on situations that are being forced onto us.”\n\n— Lacey Latch\n\nYuma organization reaches maximum capacity\n\nSOMERTON — The only organization helping migrants released by U.S. Border Patrol in Yuma County reached their maximum capacity just hours before Title 42 is slated to be lifted.\n\nThe Regional Center for Border Health helped 798 asylum seekers released into Yuma on Thursday move on to their destinations.\n\nOnce Title 42 ends at 9 p.m. Thursday night, local officials expect the numbers of people crossing the border to increase dramatically.\n\n“We are going to reach our capacity and there is nothing we can do,” said Amanda Aguirre, the president and CEO of the Regional Center and former Arizona state senator.\n\nTheir capacity to process migrants and help them purchase bus and plane tickets out of Yuma is between 700 and 800 people.\n\nAt Yuma City Hall, Mayor Douglas Nicholls announced Thursday that Border Patrol plans to release 141 migrants into various areas of the county on Friday. Those who will be released are people who have been vetted and allowed to go through the judicial process to seek asylum, a process that could take years.\n\nThose 141 street releases are on top of the 800 migrants Aguirre expects to pass through the regional center Friday.\n\nAt the news conference, Nicholls also demanded President Biden declare a national state of emergency at the border. He said Yuma County has seen an increase in the last month from 300 to 1,000 people crossing every day.\n\n“We don’t want street releases, but the numbers that are crossing the border is going to be so overwhelming. We are already overwhelmed,” Aguirre said.\n\nFor those 141 people Aguirre said the center will try to process them in another location with help from the Yuma Fire Department.\n\nThe Regional Center for Border Health is also working to send some of the additional asylum seekers to Phoenix, while they put others in a hotel as they wait for more buses.\n\nTypically, the Regional Center for Border Health sends buses to pick up the migrants directly from the detention centers.\n\nAguirre explained because of Yuma’s lack of transportation access — a bus stop with just one bench and just a few buses a day, and an airport with limited flights — street releases add challenges for asylum seekers trying to get to their sponsors.\n\nAguirre said typically sponsors buy the tickets for them and the center will help with additional funds if they need more money for the tickets.\n\n— Sarah Lapidus\n\nMigrants wait to be processed\n\nSAN LUIS — About 100 people huddled under white canopies Thursday afternoon, waiting in lines to be processed by U.S. Border Patrol.\n\nMost were men of different ages. All had been standing in the Yuma County heat for hours. By 3 p.m., it was 86 degrees, and some of them had been waiting for several days.\n\nThe migrants were on the other side of Trump’s 30-foot wall, drinking from water bottles left by volunteers with the AZ-CA Humanitarian Coalition. The smell of sweat mixed with the hot, dusty air.\n\nIn groups of about 30 people, border patrol agents took migrants’ passports, and photos of their faces before having them load buses to take them to the processing centers.\n\nFarmland and bumpy dirt roads sprawled out opposite the migrants into Yuma.\n\nMigrants described how they had stayed under these tents the previous night in frigid temperatures. The cold forced them to find wood for fires to keep themselves and the children warm. Some people had been there for as many as four days and others had just arrived. Earlier that morning migrants said there had been about 300 more people including women and children.\n\nSome men were dressed in button-up shirts with jeans, others in T-shirts and others in sweaters. Most had backpacks. Everyone was lacking shoe laces, as requested by border patrol agents.\n\nAfter hours and days of standing huddled under the white canopies, many audibly sounded disappointed when border patrol told them they were changing shifts and it would be three more hours.\n\n“Sit down, but stay in your spot,” a border patrol agent suggested to them.\n\n— Sarah Lapidus\n\nUS House passes Secure Border Act\n\nWith Title 42 expiring Thursday, the U.S. House of Representatives passed The Secure Border Act of 2023, the Republican immigration and border bill. The legislation would, among other things, compel U.S. Customs and Border Patrol to have at least 22,000 agents and resume construction of the border wall.\n\nArizona’s congressional delegation voted along party lines, with all Republicans (Reps. David Schweikert; Eli Crane; Andy Biggs; Juan Ciscomani; Debbie Lesko and Paul Gosar) voting for it. Only two GOP members in the entire House voted against the legislation: Reps. John Duarte, R-Calif., and Thomas Massie, R-Ky.\n\n“My home state of Arizona is getting pummeled by the flood of invading illegals,” Gosar said in a statement. “I have visited the border countless times. I have witnessed firsthand the destruction caused by this lawlessness. … With this vote, Republicans have done what Joe Biden refuses to do: secure the border, stop the lawlessness and make America safe. I am proud to have cast my vote in favor of the Secure the Border Act.”\n\nBiggs said the legislation \"better secures our southern border, turns off the incentives for illegal immigration, reestablishes order and integrity in our immigration system, and provides Border Patrol Agents the resources and legal tools necessary to regain control of the border.”\n\nAll Democrats from Arizona (Reps. Ruben Gallego, Greg Stanton, and Raúl Grijalva) voted against it.\n\n“There is no universe in which this bill is a serious solution to reforming our immigration system,” Gallego said in a statement. “Comprehensive reform means addressing the humanitarian crisis, cracking down on traffickers, and reforming the asylum process so that legitimate applicants are not waiting years in limbo.”\n\nGrijalva blamed \"the broken immigration system that Congress has failed to fix.\"\n\nThe Secure Border Act of 2023 is unlikely to pass in the Senate and faces a veto threat from President Joe Biden.\n\n— Tara Kavaler\n\nPort of entry across border in Nogales fortified\n\nNOGALES, Sonora — Shipping container barriers topped with concertina wire and metal poles blocked three vehicle lanes into the U.S. at the Dennis DeConcini Port of Entry on Thursday afternoon. Two of the green and beige containers flanked the vehicle lane for cars coming into Mexico.\n\nGraffiti sprayed onto one of the containers read “bad junk” underneath bold black letters that read “property of U.S. Army.” Spools of the concertina wire were stacked from floor to ceiling at one of the openings of the port.\n\n“CBP has taken several steps to maintain the security of our facilities in the event of large crowds to include slowing or halting the flow of traffic, the implementation of port hardening infrastructure and the deployment of officers to ensure the safety and integrity of the port of entry,” John Mennell, U.S. Customs and Border Protection's public affairs specialist for Arizona, said in a written statement.\n\nThe concertina wire has been at the port since May 3 when a photo of the wire was posted to Facebook by someone waiting to drive through.\n\nThere also appeared to be an increased presence of Mexican military personnel near the traffic roundabout steps from the port of entry. The overall scene of the port of entry otherwise was calm with normal operations going on.\n\n— Jose Ignacio Castaneda\n\nVineyard Community Church receives nearly 50 migrants\n\nNearly 50 migrants arrived at the shelter at Vineyard Community Church in Gilbert on Thursday morning, most of them having journeyed for weeks from Peru, Colombia, Ecuador and Dominican Republic.\n\nMost of them said they arrived after fleeing unsafe circumstances, extortion, threats, financial and political instability and a lack of job opportunities. Many said they had been waiting to enter the United States for about two weeks, and a few said they had been waiting for nearly a month.\n\nAt the shelter, they received water, food, coffee, clothing, and a bag of toiletries.\n\nMagdalena Schwartz, the director of the shelter and pastor at the church, said the number was about the same she has seen in past weeks.\n\nThe shelter opened its doors to receive migrants in October 2018 and since then has been receiving them weekly on Thursdays and Fridays, Schwartz said.\n\n\"Here we receive them, we help them continue the entire asylum procedure, we give them all the instructions, and we give them food, we give them coffee, we give them what we can,\" Schwartz said.\n\nSchwartz said she fears the shelter might not be prepared for the end of Title 42, and she urged the state government to provide local organizations with more funding to better assist people who come in seeking help.\n\nShe also asked for the help of the community with donations, particularly clothing.\n\n\"We have very little clothing because the funds aren't enough,\" Schwartz said. \"Many of these people arrive with clothes from three or two months ago that have not been changed, and they really appreciate that they can wear new clothes and feel clean.\"\n\n— Laura Daniella Sepúlveda\n\nTitle 42 timing not significant for families at Mesa church\n\nAsylum seekers dropped off at the Iglesia Cristina Buen Pastor Church in Mesa ate a spaghetti lunch served by volunteers, took showers and changed into fresh clothes provided by the shelter Thursday.Héctor Ramírez, the pastor, and volunteers began driving some families to the airport or to local hotels to spend the night since the church has stopped providing overnight shelter.\n\nNone of the families who spoke to The Arizona Republic said they had timed their trip to the U.S. because Title 42 was ending. They said they were fleeing domestic violence, threats from organized criminals and severe poverty in their communities in Ecuador, Bolivia, Peru and Colombia.\n\n— Daniel Gonzalez\n\nSmall border communities seek federal emergency\n\nJoining the chorus of Arizona politicians and institutions asking for a federal emergency declaration to address the end of Title 42 are several small communities in the state.\n\nThe cities of Douglas, Nogales, San Luis and Somerton, as well as the Yuma County supervisors, all are calling for a federal emergency declaration.\n\n“A federal emergency declaration needs to be considered immediately to address the challenges that come with the end of Title 42 provisions,” San Luis Mayor Nieves Riedel said in a news release.\n\n“The sheer number of migrants can easily overwhelm the capacities of the Border Health Center operations of providing temporary shelter and basic medical services. We fear those released or entering our city will not have the transportation options necessary to get to major cities with broader shelter capabilities – like Yuma or Tucson.”\n\nStatements from the other communities echoed similar concerns.\n\nSan Luis has a population of about 36,000.\n\n“Our dedicated men and women in our Police Department and Fire Department face tremendous strain,” Nieves continued. “Most importantly, we cannot leave our residents without their services in emergency situations.\n\n— Staff reports\n\nNormal day at Phoenix bus station ahead of Title 42 end\n\nLuis Enrique Chavarría and José Palacios are two Nicaraguan immigrants who met Thursday at the Greyhound terminal in Phoenix while waiting for the bus that would take them to their destinations — one to Colorado and the other to California.\n\nIn addition to being from the same country, the two have other things in common: They turned themselves in at the U.S.-Mexico border, applied for asylum and received a work permit from the authorities while their immigration cases are processed.\n\nAt midday Thursday, the Greyhound terminal located at Buckeye and 21st streets, operated with the normal activity of any given weekday, with about 30 people waiting for the bus.\n\nBoth Chavarría and Palacios were released into the U.S. just last month. They are making their way to other states where their loved ones live.\n\nBoth are in favor of the U.S. granting asylum to migrants fleeing their countries, but have mixed opinions regarding the end of Title 42.\n\n“It is very difficult, one risks their life to undertake this journey that sometimes ends badly,” Chavarría said. “I think ending Title 42 would be like motivating people to come, to hit the road without imagining what awaits them.”\n\nChavarría, 21, who was a professional soccer player in Nicaragua, said that in Mexico he had to travel in a truck with about 300 others. “We couldn't breathe, 12 women fainted, we were lucky to finish the trip, but there are many who don't make it,” he said.\n\nPalacios, 35, who worked picking crops in Nicaragua, said he has family and friends who dream of making their way to the U.S. in search of a better life.\n\n“There is no other option. In Nicaragua, you do not have the support of the government, there is no work, a lot of crime. I had to leave my wife and my daughters to seek a better life,” Palacios said. “I understand migrants because I am one of them, and I am in favor of receiving them in the United States, granting them permits because all we want is to work and have a better life.”\n\n— Javier Arce\n\nMigrants warned of scammers\n\nNOGALES — Pedro De Velasco, director of education and advocacy at the Kino Border Initiative, warned migrants against scammers near Nogales ports of entry seeking to take advantage of the change in U.S. policy.\n\nKino Border Initiative officials have previously received reports from migrants who had received calls from people claiming to be with U.S. Customs and Border Protection or with the consulate’s office asking them to confirm their CBP One appointment.\n\nDe Velasco urged migrants during a town hall at the migrant shelter not to believe the false calls as they attempt to request asylum through the government app.\n\n— José Ignacio Castañeda\n\nMigrants cheer the end of Title 42\n\nNOGALES, Mexico — The news of Title 42’s sunset was met with a round of applause from about 200 migrants who had gathered at the Kino Border Initiative migrant shelter in Nogales, Sonora, on Thursday morning.\n\nShelter officials led a town hall to inform migrants about the end of the border restriction on Thursday night while also advising them about President Joe Biden’s new rule that would heavily restrict their access to asylum.\n\nThe finalized rule would require migrants to request and be denied asylum in a country that they passed along their way to the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nSome migrants had previously asked shelter officials if they could show up to the Dennis DeConcini Port of Entry when Title 42 expires at 8:59 p.m. in Arizona.\n\n— José Ignacio Castañeda\n\nMakeshift camp rises near U.S.-Mexico border near San Diego\n\nTIJUANA, Mexico — A makeshift camp with migrants waiting to be processed by U.S. Border Patrol popped up approximately 2 miles west of the San Ysidro Port of Entry in San Diego.\n\nThe camp is located on the border enforcement zone on the American side, in between the two border barriers separating San Diego from Tijuana.\n\nThe number of migrants camped out was unclear, but Tijuana officials estimated there were 500 people.\n\nMakeshift tents using tarps or metallic mylar blankets lined the secondary border fence.\n\nAnother large group sat on the dirt floor waiting a few feet south of the fence for further instructions.\n\nOn Thursday morning, more than a dozen marked and unmarked Border Patrol vehicles were at the camp, along with numerous agents. CBP helicopters also flew overhead repeatedly.\n\nBorder Patrol vans stopped at the camp to pick up smaller groups of migrants. But it was unclear what would happen to the larger group.\n\nWith hours to go until the end of Title 42, the scene in San Diego resembled the situation in El Paso as migrants waited to be processed.\n\n— Rafael Carranza\n\nArizona congressional delegation calls for action\n\nArizona's congressional delegation took to Twitter to express their opinions on the end of Title 42.\n\nRep. Gosar, R-Ariz., tweeted that the border would be inundated with migrants when Title 42 ends. He wrote: \"Border states must repel the invaders as is their right.\"\n\nReps. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., and Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz., expressed support for The Secure Border Act of 2023, the Republican immigration and border bill set to pass the House on Thursday.\n\nRep. Greg Stanton tweeted a letter he took the lead on writing with the New Democrat Coalition to Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and minority leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., expressing opposition to the GOP bill and calling for a bipartisan solution to immigration. Stanton is the chair of the coalition's Immigration and Border Security Task Force.\n\nSens. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., and Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., both expressed that Arizona would bear the brunt of Title 42 ending, and that they have and would continue to put pressure on the Biden administration to provide additional assistance to Arizona.\n\nRep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., was at the border Tuesday and spoke with Politico.\n\n“Look, we’re about to come up onto a very serious time in two days. I think at this point, we should really put on the table an emergency declaration,” Gallego said, according to a transcript provided by his staff. “I think that will actually do a lot of help for that area. I think that talking to the mayors and the nonprofits in the area, that’s something that I think could actually be more helpful kind of help deal with the situation we’re seeing on the ground.”\n\n— Tara Kavaler\n\nMesa church welcomes usual number of asylum seekers\n\nA Department of Homeland Security bus pulled into the parking lot of Iglesia Cristiana Buen Pastor — the Good Shepherd Christian Church — in Mesa at 8:19 a.m.\n\nA total of 32 asylum seekers stepped off the bus, all of them families with children. Hector Ramirez, the pastor, stood in the parking lot welcoming the asylum seekers in Spanish.\n\n“Bienvenidos,” Ramirez said.\n\nThe asylum seekers came from Argentina, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Paraguay, Colombia, Brazil and Angola.\n\nThe number of asylum seekers and the countries they came from is what the church typically receives every Thursday. He expects the number of asylum seekers dropped off at the church could triple by next Thursday.\n\nTitle 42 expulsions have mostly applied to asylum seekers from Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Cuba and Venezuela.\n\nAs a result, Ramirez said he expects to see more asylum seekers from those countries dropped off at the church once Title 42 ends.\n\nMost of the asylum seekers only remain at the church for a few hours or overnight until they or relatives in the U.S. can purchase plane tickets to travel to their final destinations, usually in other states.\n\nAfter arriving at the church, Ramirez explained why they were there.\n\n“You are in the United States,” Ramirez said inside the church sanctuary, as the travel-weary asylum seekers sat in chairs, many of them with small children and babies. “You are not prisoners. You are free.”\n\nThe asylum seekers were given hot coffee, juice and sandwiches for breakfast. They sat at long white plastic tables, texting relatives with updates.\n\nRamirez also huddled the asylum seekers in the front of the church to pray. He warned that they would face many challenges in the U.S. applying for asylum, and he asked God to protect them. Some parents wept.\n\n— Daniel Gonzalez\n\nMore:How Phoenix humanitarian groups are preparing for end of Title 42\n\nNogales urges federal emergency declaration\n\nNOGALES — Nogales city officials urged the Biden administration to consider declaring a federal emergency as the community struggles to manage the increase in migrant arrivals in Title 42’s waning hours.\n\nThe declaration would cut through the red tape and give the federal government the ability to supply the city with the resources, personnel and infrastructure it needs, according to a written statement from Nogales Mayor Jorge Maldonado.\n\n“I’m incredibly proud of the work we’ve done and will continue to do to mitigate the impact of this migrant surge, but with what we have now, I know it isn’t enough,” the statement said.\n\n“That’s why I firmly believe the option of a federal emergency declaration should be explored.”\n\n— José Ignacio Castañeda\n\nArizona medical centers prepare to get busy\n\nDOUGLAS — As migrant street releases begin in southern Arizona prior to the lifting of Title 42, medical providers were also preparing for a surge in migrants.\n\n“There is strong coordination and communication locally,” Chiricahua Community Health Centers said in a statement.\n\nThe health care provider runs clinics in Douglas and throughout Cochise County.\n\n“We are all trying to figure out what may happen and be as prepared as we can given the circumstances at hand,” said Jonathan Melk, the CEO of Chiricahua Community Health Centers in an interview with KOLK News 13.\n\nHe reiterated that while there are not enough health care providers to care for the local community, they will do what they can for the influx of migrants, but they would need help.\n\n“If there was something more that was needed, a larger effort, or a more sustained effort, then we would need help with that,” he said.\n\nAdditional effort could include using their mobile clinics, which will cost $5,000 per day to operate.\n\nAccording to a statement released by Chiricahua, Douglas will be used as a “transit point” where asylum seekers will be offered transportation to migrant shelter Casa Alitas in Tucson, run by the Catholic Community Services of Arizona.\n\n“Our current understanding is that they are planning to release about 200 individuals per day and have already started a beta test of the process whereby they cluster street releases and direct people through immigration and let them know that a bus will be at the Walmart parking lot to take them to Tucson,” Chiricahua said in the statement.\n\nWhile migrants are not obligated to take the bus, according to the health care provider, almost everyone has accepted the offer of transportation.\n\nDouglas Mayor Donald Huish said that while there are no long lines of migrants crossing the border into Agua Prieta, the Mexican city adjacent to Douglas, there are about 6,000 people in Hermosillo, who were expected to either head toward Nogales or Agua Prieta in the next few days.\n\n— Sarah Lapidus\n\nWhat is Title 42? What is Title 8?Here's what to know about US border policies\n\nYuma will seek federal money to address increased migrant flow\n\nYUMA — Yuma announced it is working with federal, state and regional partners to prepare for the anticipated surge of migrants after Title 42 is lifted Thursday night and replaced once again by the immigration enforcement process under Title 8.\n\nAccording to the city, Yuma County sees more than 1,000 migrants crossing the border every day. This high number of people crossing the border led Mayor Douglas Nicholls to issue an emergency proclamation.\n\nThose who entered the U.S. into Yuma were transported out of the county by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Regional Center for Border Health.\n\nHowever, after Title 42 ends, the Border Patrol Yuma sector is expected to become even busier and reach capacity. If capacity is reached, the city said it is prepared to work with federal, state and local government entities, as well as humanitarian organizations to “address the humanitarian crisis.”\n\n“The City does not have funding for the transportation, feeding and sheltering of migrants and in the event has to provide any services, would request reimbursement from the appropriate state and federal agencies,” Yuma said in a news release.\n\nThe city responded to locals who were concerned the city might use the Yuma Readiness and Community Center as a transition area for migrant releases, noting the site was assessed for this purpose, but “it is no longer an option.”\n\n— Sarah Lapidus\n\nMigrants line up at the border to turn themselves in\n\nYUMA — Early Thursday, more than 100 people lined up to turn themselves into Border Patrol at a gap in the wall at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nPeople stood solemnly in line with looks of exhaustion etched on their faces.\n\nPeople of all ages were present: parents with infants and toddlers, several elderly people, a few older teenagers, and many middle age and young adults. Some were dressed in winter jackets and hats, others wore jeans and sweatshirts. Others were underdressed for the brisk morning, wearing just shorts and slip-on sandals.\n\n“Embarazada,” or pregnant, one woman called out to the Spanish-speaking agent. He brought her to the front of the line.\n\nBorder Patrol agents took groups of people to a lit area along the wall. They had them take their shoelaces off, put their documents in small plastic bags and took photos of them. Then they loaded them up in white buses to take them to the processing facility, frisking them before letting them on the bus.\n\nBy 3 a.m., five buses had come and taken 40 people each. There were at least 20 countries represented that night with a variety of languages spoken, including Spanish, Chinese, French and Nepalese, among others. After the buses left, more people trickled across the vehicle barrier, waiting for their turn in line.\n\n— Sarah Lapidus\n\nAs Title 42 ends, migrants dream of entering US\n\nNOGALES, Sonora — Many people waiting in border communities in Mexico fled their home countries because of poverty, gang violence, political violence and climate change.\n\nThe Kino Border Initiative provides services to hundreds of people a day and can house up to 85 people who are allowed to stay up to 10 days in its shelter. The nonprofit serves food and connects people with services, from social work to medical assistance, legal assistance and therapy. Many come to use the shelter's Wi-Fi to apply on the CBP One application for appointments to enter the U.S. and plead their asylum cases.\n\nBrayan Martinez, 24, from Colombia, escaped after being forcibly recruited by armed groups in Bogotá.\n\n“I was scared, so I came here. They threatened me. They killed two of my uncles,” he said in an interview last week. They violated him, he said, and he was terrified they would kill him. One day he found an opportunity and escaped.\n\nMartinez said he had been trying to get an appointment on the CBP One application, but it kept glitching and just showed him error message after error message.\n\nHe said he hopes someone can help him.\n\n“I don’t want to return. I’m scared of going back,” Martinez said.\n\n— Sarah Lapidus\n\nBorder Patrol is as prepared as it can be for border restriction's end, Tucson chief says\n\nTUCSON — The chief patrol agent of Tucson’s Border Patrol Sector said Monday that the agency was “incredibly well prepared” for the end of a pandemic-era border restriction days before it was expected to expire.\n\nJohn Modlin, chief patrol agent of the U.S. Border Patrol's Tucson Sector, detailed how the agency was preparing Monday at an event at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. While Modlin underscored the Border Patrol’s readiness for the end of Title 42, he described its sunset as “concerning” and said capacity was strained at Arizona Border Patrol holding facilities.\n\n“It's hard to understand what's coming at us,” Modlin said. “I think we're as prepared as we can be for it.”\n\nU.S. officials are estimating migrant encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border to increase to 10,000 per day when the restriction lifts.\n\nThere have been 146,301 migrant encounters by Border Patrol in the Tucson sector so far in fiscal year 2023, which began in October, according to CBP data. Encounters increased by about 19% from the same time last year, per CBP data.\n\n— José Ignacio Castañeda Perez\n\nGovernment app for asylum seekers, CBP One, doesn’t work very well\n\nMigrants who want to seek asylum in the United States must use the government’s new CBP One app to schedule appointments with border officials after Title 42 lifts at 8:59 p.m. Thursday.\n\nHowever, the app has received negative reviews since it was rolled out by the Biden administration.\n\nRead more about the legal, technical and practical concerns that critics have raised about the app in this report.\n\n— José Ignacio Castañeda Perez\n\nMaricopa County Supervisor asks Biden for emergency resources\n\nMaricopa County Supervisor Thomas Galvin on Wednesday wrote to President Biden asking for additional emergency resources to help the region address the expected increase in people crossing the border.\n\n“Unfortunately, for Arizona generally, and Maricopa County specifically, the federal government is needlessly creating a humanitarian issue with very real consequences for the economy and security on our communities which are still reeling from the social impact of the pandemic,” Galvin wrote.\n\n“Not having properly communicated plans from the federal government, ahead of an anticipated surge in migration, will make an already dire situation demonstrably worse. This is problematic, at the very least on a good-governance level, and, at worst, it is a humanitarian crisis in the making.”\n\nHe said county communities deserve to be safe and secure “and migrants should be treated fairly and humanely,” and that county residents deserve “nothing less” than additional emergency resources to ensure that happens.\n\n— Ryan Randazzo\n\nArizona sheriffs meet with Gov. Hobbs over safety concerns\n\nTen county sheriffs met with Gov. Katie Hobbs on Tuesday to discuss their concerns that the end of Title 42 could create safety concerns across the state if large numbers of people attempt to cross the border.\n\nOne concern was that human and drug-smuggling cartels could take advantage of a chaotic situation, according to the Arizona Sheriff’s Association.\n\n“For decades, the federal government has failed Arizona with its unsuccessful attempts at border security,” Arizona Sheriffs Association president and Yavapai Sheriff David Rhodes said. “Sheriffs and other law enforcement from across the state seize as much fentanyl here than the rest of the country combined. We need the resources to combat drug and human smuggling. Our message to Gov. Hobbs was plain and simple: help is needed.”\n\n— The Arizona Republic staff\n\nThe Arizona Republic answers your questions about the end of Title 42\n\nWondering about the turmoil surrounding the end of Title 42, which expires at 8:59 p.m. Thursday?\n\nU.S. border officials have used the public health policy, which was enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic, to quickly expel migrants nearly 3 million times.\n\nSince its implementation, asylum seekers hoping to gain entry into the United States have been stymied. The Biden administration was bracing for a surge based on that pent-up demand at the border.\n\nJosé Ignacio Castañeda Perez, The Republic's border reporter, gives you a crash course on Title 42 with this explainer: \"What is Title 42 and is it ending?

Finney, dafinney@dmreg.com\n\nMORE MAKING WEIGHT: Current updates to this blog are here\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 19, 2016\n\nRedefining health\n\nThank you to everyone who turned out earlier this month for our Making Weight event at the Wellmark YMCA of Greater Des Moines.\n\nIt was a wonderful evening of conversation between myself, members of my medical team and readers who’ve followed this journey for more than a year.\n\nWe spent most of the session answering questions from the audience. It was a thoughtful public discussion of obesity, mental health and wellness.\n\nI offer my deepest thanks to dietitian Jacque Schwartz of Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center in Clive, physical therapist Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, Dr. Eric Barlow, psychiatrist from Compass Clinical in Urbandale, and trainer Nate Yoho of CrossFit Merle Hay.\n\nRegular readers have read many a praiseful paragraph about these people, as well as Dr. Shawna Basener, my family doctor, who could not attend, and my psychologist, who chooses to remain anonymous in these columns.\n\nThe event allowed a lot of people to learn just how spectacular these people are and how much the care about not only my personal health but that off all their patients and clients.\n\nOne of the points I emphasized in response to an audience question is one that I want to make here: It is essentially that you connect with your healthcare providers on an intellectual and emotional level.\n\nI’m not a fan of the word “providers” when describing the people have helped me to lose nearly 100 pounds in the last year. I prefer the term “partners.”\n\nThis isn’t just semantics. A partnership is a dynamic in which both people involved benefit from progress. I believe every member of my team is invested in my continued improvement. And if you can’t say that about your doctor, your coach or mental health professional, they it might be time to make a change.\n\nAn intimate relationship with your team is essential. You have to be able to trust doctors and therapists with your worries, be open about uncomfortable things in your life, with your body and goals.\n\nBarlow brought up an interesting point during the event. He said he wished he could have similar meetings with the health care teams that worked with his regular patients.\n\nThe realities of the daily practice of medicine prevents regular face-to-face meetings between physicians, mental health professionals, trainers and dieticians.\n\nBut all professionals present agreed the holistic approach would benefit patients. Hopefully, as the medical field continues to evolve from reactive care to preventative care, we will figure out better ways for medical professionals to communicate more effectively between offices and across disciplines.\n\nThe most surprising question of the evening came from my dear friend Tyler Teske, a fellow East High School alumnus, who showed up to support his old locker mate.\n\nTyler asked me if my experiences working to curb morbid obesity, contain my mood disorders and other issues helped me redefined the meaning of health for me.\n\nThe question gave me pause.\n\nThe truth is I don’t think I ever gave much thought to a definition of health until mine failed me. I never thought about the long-term consequences of what I put in my body, how sedentary my life had become or the psychological consequences of those actions or inactions, as the case may be.\n\nI think I thought healthy simply meant not being sick. But now I know it is much more than that. It is more than just diet, exercise, medicine and maintenance.\n\nHealth, to me, is not merely the absence of illness, but the presence of wellness. And wellness, like life itself, is not a destination but a journey.\n\nHere is to Year 2 of Making Weight. As always, I thank you for reading and wish you the love, dignity and respect all humans deserve.\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 12, 2016\n\nAnxious days\n\nI’ve really been struggling with my anxiety disorder the last week or so.\n\nThat’s bad news on multiple fronts.\n\nFirst, panic attacks stink. My heart races. I sweat. My hands shake. It feels as if I’m in the middle of a life-threatening situation just sitting in my apartment trying to watch the NBA Playoffs.\n\nThe worst attacks feel like my skin is itching on the inside.\n\nSecondly, anxiety spurs binge eating. Panic attacks are chemical imbalances in the brain. Biologically, my body will do whatever it thinks is necessary to restore proper chemical balance.\n\nMedication helps. But in the throes of the attack, I’m prone to hit the fridge or drive the restaurant. And I’m not likely to pick green beans or broccoli when I get there.\n\nI’m looking for a tiny boost of serotonin, the most common and one of the most powerful naturally occurring mood regulators in the brain.\n\nSometimes that comes from fried food or pizza or whatever.\n\nOne day last week, in a fit of anxiety, I plowed through a pound of boneless chicken wings and a pound of taco meat slathered on cheese sauce.\n\nIt felt great for all of 15 minutes. The good vibes from the short serotonin burst quickly faded. The anxiety again churned my gut. This time the cause was simple: I’d ingested a lot of calories at a time when I’m trying to lose weight.\n\nThe third thing I do when my anxiety is bad is buy things I don’t need with money I don’t have. The effect on mood is the same as overeating. It feels really great to get a new toy, book or movie for my collection.\n\nBut again the anxiety resurges, because I’ve spent money meant for rent, groceries, retirement or other necessities.\n\nAs I have written many times, you can spend yourself into bankruptcy and eat yourself into an early grave.\n\nThe most obvious question here that if I recognize the destructive nature of these patterns, why, then, don’t I simply stop them?\n\nI’ve written before about schema. These are the behavior patterns we all develop to negotiate the world. A simple schema would be not putting our hands on hot burners to avoid being burned.\n\nThese schemata form when we’re young. And you really can’t change them. What you do is build new ones to create new behavior patterns that are more constructive.\n\nLet me assure you typing that sentence is a lot easier than acting on it. My schemata are deeply rooted and hard to override.\n\nI won’t get into the details of my childhood other than to say it was chaotic. I learned to take pleasure in food and presents. These things gave me the security and comfort in ways my family situation did not.\n\nThe trouble is the emergencies of my childhood have long since passed, but the patterns of behavior remain. And so, too, does the nagging anxiety.\n\nSometimes I can tell what causes a panic attack. I can trace it to an incident or problem I’m having. Other times, panic seems to strike me from what I like to call “free-floating anxiety.”\n\nOne afternoon last week, I dozed off during a basketball game. I woke up in a full-blown panic attack. Was I ruminating on some troublesome problem in a dream? It’s impossible to say.\n\nThe good news is I have a terrific support system in place. Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my first set of parents died, are always there for comfort and support. My girlfriend takes many late night calls, as does my saintly therapist who helps me break the cycle of anxiety.\n\nStill, these cycles are exhausting. The drain my creative energy and I find myself cold, distant and detached from the people I love the most.\n\nI should also mention that the transcranial magnetic stimulation treatments, or TMS, that I underwent last year do not directly treat anxiety.\n\nI consider that treatment a resounding success. It sent my depression into remission or, at least, severely curtailed it. I have not suffered a major depressive episode since I completed the treatment in December.\n\nI controlled the anxiety with prescription medication. And my talk therapist and I work every two weeks to find ways for me to break the negative thoughts that spiral into dark thinking.\n\nThere was, at least, one spot of positive news on the Making Weight front. At my latest weigh in, I lost 11.8 pounds in a month.\n\nThat brings my total weight loss up to 99.8 pounds since the journey began more than a year ago.\n\nI know there is a long way to go before I’m anything approaching fit. I also know all too well there will be bad days ahead, both mentally and physically.\n\nBut even an anxiety junkie like me can say losing nearly 100 pounds is a good day.\n\nFRIDAY, MAY 6, 2016\n\nTalking ' Making Weight'\n\nDaniel Finney recently spoke to Iowa Public Radio about his one year anniversary of Making Weight. Take a listen to the conversation below:\n\nMAKING WEIGHT EVENT\n\nJoin Register columnist Daniel Finney for a talk about a year in his effort to lose weight and regain his health. Meet some of the people who've helped him along the way, including trainer Nate Yoho, physical therapist Stefanie Kirk, dietitian Jacque Schwartz, physician Dr. Shauna Basener and psychiatrist Dr. Eric Barlow. The talk, which is free and open to the public, is scheduled for Thursday, May 12 from 5 to 6 p.m. at the Wellmark YMCA of Greater Des Moines, 501 Grand Ave. To register, visit: https://tickets.desmoinesregister.com/e/making-weight-one-mans-journey-from-fat-to-fit/tickets.\n\n\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 5, 2016\n\nFat jokes\n\nCriticism comes with being a columnist. It’s only fair. This newspaper gives me a lot of space to share my opinions. It’s reasonable some people will disagree, even vehemently so.\n\nBut there’s one trend I notice in negative responses I receive that I struggle to understand.\n\nFor example, a reader who disagreed with my column in which I said convicted murderer Joseph “Jo-Jo” White Jr. should never be released from prison wrote this email response:\n\n“I find it difficult to believe that one who has done such damage to his own body can pass judgment on another judged by the state to have committed a terrible crime against another human being.”\n\nThat's a whopper of a non-sequitur, but if I translate this correctly, it really says, “You’re fat. You shouldn’t have an opinion about a murderer getting released from prison.”\n\nAnother reader, who described himself as a 31-year journalist, did not care for my profile of Drake University President Earl “Marty” Martin. After he finished his criticism of that piece, he added:\n\n“Eagerly awaiting your next ‘Really folks, I’m trying to lose weight … oops, I gained 7 pounds’ series. I do wish you good health.”\n\nAside from having severe doubts about the sincerity of the writer’s wishes for my good health, I’m stumped by those sentences.\n\nA generous reading of the email might suggest he’s simply not a fan of anything I write for the paper. Or perhaps in the heat of writing an email — that “firing off a note” cliche comes from somewhere — his desire to get a really cutting line typed overcame his sense of decorum.\n\nI can understand that. It’s happened to me as a writer more times than I would like to admit.\n\nBut I think he threw in the dig about my recent gain of 7 pounds as simple spite.\n\nIt is as if he did not have enough confidence in his original criticism and decided, “You know what? I'll throw the fat thing in there, too.”\n\nThis is where I get confused. I understand disagreement with my work. But I don’t understand the base need to attack me or anyone else because of their weight, body size or appearance.\n\nPlease don’t read this as “woe is me.” It isn’t. As I said, I understand criticism comes with job.\n\nBut cruelty does not — and it shouldn’t come with anyone’s job. It genuinely troubles me that people think pointing at fat people and laughing is still acceptable.\n\nI’ve written before how I cringed when retired late night TV host David Letterman riffed on New Jersey Gov. Chris Cristie’s weight. There are many things about Christie ripe for lampooning, but his weight seems the least and laziest of topics.\n\nBut it isn’t just comedians and emailers. Making fun of fat people for sport is commonplace.\n\nThe cruel website peopleofwalmart.com posts unflattering pictures of shoppers at the retail chain, many of them holding obese people up for ridicule.\n\nI have a friend who once posted a picture of an obese woman riding her scooter through the drive-through of a fast food restaurant. He made comments I thought were mean and I posted a response. We argued a bit. Nothing came of it.\n\nSomeone will almost certainly accuse me of being politically correct for pleading with the public to be kind to obese people, myself included.\n\nI am OK with that. Political correctness, though it can be overdone, is simply people asking others to describe them with dignity and respect. All people deserve that.\n\nUnderlying all these “fat funnies,” I believe, is the myth that obesity is a simple problem of self-control. Put down the fork. Eat less. Move more.\n\nIf you’re fat, the thinking goes, it’s your fault.\n\nThere are reams of scientific research that show obesity has roots in genetics, changes in the makeup and portions of food we eat, socio-economic status, childhood trauma and a host of other issues.\n\nBut instead of scientific evidence, which the public seems all too eager to ignore, I will appeal on humane grounds.\n\nI am not an overly religious person, but I believe the Sermon on the Mount attributed to Christian savior Jesus Christ is probably the finest treatise on how humans should treat one another ever written.\n\nI won’t quote it here because this is not Sunday School. I encourage you to Google it sometime and keep an eye on the lines about mercy.\n\nThen consider whether we might not have a much better world if we focused on mercy instead of fat jokes.\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 21, 2016\n\nControlling hunger\n\nSometimes it’s tough having a former U.S. Army Ranger as your psychologist.\n\nI sank into his recliner last week feeling glum.\n\nMy weight was up. I worked with my nutritionist. We decided to trim my daily calorie goal by 200 in an effort to restart the weight loss.\n\nBut I was really feeling the difference. I found myself thinking about eating a lot more than I had at any point since I began this effort to lose weight and regain my health.\n\nI complained of the problem to my therapist, who asks not to be identified in these columns because of the work he does with public safety agencies.\n\nMy therapist told me a story about Ranger survival training when he and his troop were on one ration a day.\n\n“The first few days, you were so hungry you would drink swamp water just to have something in your stomach,” he said.\n\nWell, then. I guess it isn’t all that bad after all.\n\nEating is a biological necessity. But hunger pangs can be controlled in much the same way I work to wrangle anxiety when it bubbles in my brain.My therapist wasn’t going with tough love, though. He was making a point.\n\nThe best tactic I’ve found for stemming panic attacks before they blossom – besides prescription medication, of course – is by breaking the cycle of thinking that causes panic to spiral.\n\nSometimes this is phoning a friend. Other times it’s distracting myself with a good book or even taking a nap.\n\nI’ve found the same tactics in nursing my way through attacks of hunger pangs, with a few exceptions.\n\nTV is rarely a good pick because if you’re feeling hungry there are a lot of commercials about food and none of them are particularly healthy options.\n\nBut favorite movies on DVD or a Netflix binge watch is much better than a food binge in the kitchen.\n\nConversation is always good, but don’t ruminate on food. I might call my girlfriend and complain about being hungry, but we switch topics fairly quickly to the latest antics of her cats.\n\nI call my friend Paul in Memphis to talk about how bad the summer movie slate looks. And so on.\n\nI want to make a couple of points here. I’m not talking about starving myself. That’s just as unhealthy as eating junk food.\n\nI’m talking about the hunger pangs that come not from the biological need to eat but thinking about food, being tempted by the smell of a favorite dish or the reflex desire to eat out of sheer boredom.\n\nI struggle with bored eating lot. I find myself looking into the refrigerator for entertainment rather than sustenance.\n\nAnother appetite control technique I’ve learned: Avoid fast foods. I don’t mean the drive-through restaurants. I mean premade foods that you can pop in the microwave or tear into like potato chips or other snack food.\n\nMost of my grocery bill goes to fresh veggies, meats, a few fruits, eggs and so on. The only quickie foods I have on hand are protein bars, which are low in calories and high in nutrients. So if I do break down and have an unnecessary snack, noshing on one of those isn’t a terrible choice.\n\nThe best thing, though, is a distraction. And the good thing about my apartment it is that it’s stacked ceiling to floor with books, movies and music. I can always find something to do besides eat.\n\nSo far it’s worked. As of this writing, I’ve stayed within my new calorie goal for 21 consecutive days. We’ll see how well it’s paid off at my next weigh in in a week or so.\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 14, 2016\n\nA setback amid celebrations\n\nLast week, we celebrated the one-year anniversary of Making Weight, my ongoing effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI wrote a big front-page story in the April 10 edition. We hosted a Facebook Live chat on Facebook.com/DesMoinesRegister. (Click here to watch a replay.)\n\nI received dozens of emails, letters and phone calls. Almost all praised me and several readers shared their own experiences.\n\nIt felt great.\n\nThis doesn’t: I’ve gained 7.2 pounds since my last weigh in.\n\nIt is the biggest single weight gain I’ve had between benchmarks since I started the process.\n\nI can easily find where I got off track.\n\nI bought foods that I shouldn’t have, like peanuts, which are high in nutrients but also heavy in fats. In the recommended servings, they’re a fine snack.\n\nBut the recommended serving is very small. But I take a handful and then another and then another. And pretty soon a half pound of nuts has been consumed.\n\nThey are a poor choice to have in the house.\n\nI didn’t do much better eating out. A while back, I had some nachos for the first time in a while. It was like an alcoholic trying to take a single drink.\n\nPretty soon nachos were regular meals. Sometimes, I’m ashamed to admit, those nachos were “appetizers” followed by full meals.\n\nI got sick in late February and early March. I missed several sessions at the gym. And I didn’t eat well during that down time.\n\nI looked at MyFitnessPal, the smartphone app I use to track calories. Some days I hadn’t logged all my calories. Other days, I blew my calorie goal.\n\nI think I blew my calorie goal for seven out of 10 days at one point in March.\n\nNow, the weight gain is not all bad. The computer at Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center in Clive gives me information about water weight and muscle mass.\n\nSince my workouts with Nate Yoho, owner of CrossFit Merle Hay, began in February, my muscle mass has increased by more than 6 pounds.\n\nThat’s terrific news. As Nate says: “You don’t get stronger by adding fat.”\n\nI am getting stronger. But I’ve also added some fat.\n\nI worked with dietitian Jacque Schwartz at the Nutrition Center. I decided to reduce my daily calorie goal from 2,700 to 2,500.\n\nAs of this writing, I’ve stayed at or below that goal for 13 days in a row.\n\nBut that’s come with its own side effect: I’m hungry.\n\nSince this journey began, I’ve been able to lose weight largely without major hunger pangs.\n\nYet I feel them with this 200-calorie cut. They’re manageable. If I get too hung up on them, I do what I always do when I get locked into a pattern of negative thinking: I phone a friend.\n\nSometimes it’s my therapist. Sometimes it’s a text message to Nate. Sometimes I call my girlfriend or my buddy, Paul, in Memphis, Tenn.\n\nWith my girlfriend and Paul, we don’t necessarily talk about eating and food. Sometimes we talk about movies, TV and sports — just anything to break the loop of thinking.\n\nPretty soon I forget about being hungry.\n\nWhat I don’t want to forget, however, is that are these lapses are natural.\n\nI’m not going to spend a lot of time beating myself up about this. Yeah, I gained some weight. But I have all the tools in place to lose that again and make more progress.\n\nAnd I’ve already taken action to stop the current slide. There’s been a lot of broccoli and green beans consumed in my house recently. My George Foreman Grill is getting a lot more work.\n\nWith hard work and continued vigilance, I’ll have a lot better news to report the next time I step on that scale.\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 31, 2016\n\nThrowing weight around\n\nI stayed in bed Monday morning and pulled the covers over my head.\n\nI fiddled with a “Star Wars” video game on my smartphone when the alert from my calendar popped up. It was time to go to the gym.\n\nI did not want to go. I spent part of the weekend, as did many of my colleagues, covering the deaths of four people in a tragic head-on crash on Interstate 80 near Waukee.\n\nAmong the dead were two Des Moines police officers. I did not know the officers personally, but I worked as a police reporter for several years before eventually becoming a columnist.\n\nMy uncle Larry was a Des Moines cop. I’ve spent years learning about police procedure, tactics, their mindset, the challenges and struggles of the job.\n\nIn the process, I’ve gotten to know some law enforcement professionals very well. Some I call close friends. And I felt their grief even though it was not mine to carry directly.\n\nI was having a hard time with my emotions after writing about the incident. In fact, my brain chemistry was so jumbled up that I took some time off just to attempt to relax.\n\nI want to be very clear: I do not equate the emotional state I was in with that of those who lost loved ones, including the police.\n\nMy struggles were insignificant and infinitesimal compared to those who lost a son, a daughter, a mother, a father, colleague, friend and so on.\n\nStill, I did, in fact, have an emotional reaction to those officers’ deaths, and the last thing I wanted to do was go to the gym.\n\nBut I thought of the officers who reported for duty the next day and did a job far tougher than stacking paragraphs. The absolute minimum I could do was get out of bed and go to the gym.\n\nWhen I arrived at CrossFit Merle Hay, my coach, Nate Yoho, spotted something off about me right away as we began warm-up stretching.\n\n“You look like you have a lot on your mind,” he said.\n\nWe talked about the sad events of the weekend and where my head was at.\n\nNate knows tragedy. I first met him after his wife, Laura, died of brain cancer and their daughter, Caralyn, was born by surrogate a few months later.\n\nNate, of course, isn’t a therapist. But he’s a smart man and one whose experiences grant him good perspective.\n\nWe talked while I worked out. As the sweat ran, my heart rate picked up and my blood pumped, I was able to focus on something other than the confused set of emotions rattling around in my mind.\n\nNate put me through paces on a deadlifting exercise. For some time, I’ve joked to Nate that I was looking forward to the day when I could throw weights on the floor.\n\nThe fitter and more experienced athletes in Nate’s gym do a variety of lifts that after they’re done, they simply let the heavy weights fall to the ground rather than risk injury by trying to lower them to the ground.\n\nUntil that session, Nate worked gingerly adding weight to my deadlifts because of my tender, oft-injured back.\n\nPerhaps sensing I was ready for a challenge or simply that I needed to put my mind to work on something other than sadness, he challenged me with the heaviest weight I had deadlifted to that point.\n\n“When you’re done with your reps, I want you to drop that bar on the ground,” Nate said.\n\nHe showed me the proper technique. I lifted. I focused on breathing and form. And when my reps were done, I let loose of that bar.\n\nIt slammed into the rubberized floor with a satisfying clatter. I lifted my arms in the air with some sense of relief.\n\nThrowing that weight on the floor did not erase my sadness. But it sure helped.\n\nAnd my exchanges with Nate that day made me realize how much I had come to trust this man with both my physical health but also as a friend and confidant.\n\nThat epiphany did lift my mood. Because among the best medicine for sadness is the knowledge that you are not alone in this world.\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 24, 2016\n\nMental, physical health linked\n\nI recently wrote about a woman who is dying of lung cancer. Someone asked me if the subject of my story smoked. She didn't.\n\nThe question is, in a way, a natural outgrowth of decades of anti-smoking campaigns. The link between smoking and lung cancer is scientific fact.\n\nBut an unintended consequence of those campaigns is that when people suffer from lung cancer, there is almost an attitude of, “Well, they deserved to die wheezing because they were stupid enough to smoke.”\n\nI thought about the question in the context of my own ongoing recovery from morbid obesity. Writing about this publicly has brought scores of kind notes and letters from readers who share the same struggle, know of others who do or empathize with the journey.\n\nBut occasionally — and mercifully rarely — I will hear from the reader who believes this ongoing chronicle is self-indulgent and displacing real news. After all, the argument often goes, obesity is my own fault.\n\nIn essence, I’m fat because I ate too much and I deserved it.\n\nThere is some truth to that. I have overeaten for much of my life and rarely exercised. But no one reaches 563 pounds — the weight at which I began changing my life to avoid crippling myself at 40 — simply by overindulgence.\n\nThere is a growing body of research that links childhood trauma with obesity. Kaiser Permanente, a health care company in Oakland, Calif., did some groundbreaking investigations into the link in the early 1980s and was the subject of a Time magazine profile in 2010.\n\nThe data essentially says people with high adverse childhood experiences have higher risk for a host of negative health problems as adults, including alcohol and other drug abuse, chronic depression, heart disease, smoking and, yes, obesity.\n\nAdverse childhood experiences describe a wide array of problems ranging from verbal, physical and sexual abuse to problems related to poverty, abandonment, family history of mental illness and drug abuse and other issues.\n\nI took a 10-question survey at acestoohigh.com, a very good website about adverse childhood experiences, and scored a 4. That’s the highest category measured by the Kaiser Permanente ACE Study.\n\nWithout going into unnecessary detail about my childhood, it was, to say the least, a challenge.\n\nAnd, no, I’m not blaming me being obese directly on childhood trauma. But I absolutely believe in the link.\n\nWhen you suffer trauma as a child, you do what you can to feel safe and comfortable. The things I did most often to feel safe and comfortable was eat and buy things: toys, comic books, movies and so on.\n\nThese actions, my behavioral therapist tells me, create a chemical reaction in the brain that calms me, even if briefly.\n\nThe problem is, of course, you can spend yourself into bankruptcy and you can eat yourself into the grave.\n\nI work with my therapist twice a month to learn new ways to cope with stress. He takes a call from me two or three times a week when I face an anxiety situation that could spiral into negative thinking that could lead to anything from overeating to suicidal thoughts.\n\nJust the act of talking out those thoughts helps them dissipate and remove the chance of me acting on them.\n\nOne knee-jerk reaction might be to say, “Look, childhood was a long time ago. Get over it already.”\n\nCognitive function, alas, is more complicated than that.\n\nI am also 40 years old. That means I’ve been acting on a series of behaviors ultimately bad for my health for a very long time.\n\nPsychologists called these learned behaviors schemata — a learned cognitive response to certain stimuli.\n\nHere’s the tricky thing about schemata. They can’t be changed. Once they’re in place, you’re stuck with them.\n\nWhat you can do, though, is build new ones. This is a tough task. I’ve been in therapy off and on since I was 15 years old.\n\nMy behavioral therapist, who asks I not name him because of the work he does with public safety agencies, is the best medical professional I’ve ever worked with.\n\nThe work we’ve done in our two years of sessions is some of the most important and life-changing in my life.\n\nAnd still I find myself reaching out to him when I am on the precipice of or in the middle of a panic attack. That is, in fact, part of a new schemata that’s under construction. When the cycle of negativity starts, find a way to break it.\n\nSo, to bring this back to the obesity battle, yes, I ate too much of the wrong things for a long time. And sometimes I still indulge where and how I should not.\n\nBut like a smoker who is trying to quit or a cancer sufferer trying to survive, I am working as hard as I can to find a new path to a healthier life while fully realizing I will stumble and fall often along the way.\n\nAs for the idea that a smoker who gets lung cancer or an obese person with health problems “deserve them,” I think of Clint Eastwood’s line before he kills Gene Hackman’s sadistic sheriff in “The Unforgiven:”\n\n“Deserves got nothin’ to do with it.\"\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 17, 2016\n\nEnjoying exercise? It happens\n\nBoy, it felt good to get back to the gym last week.\n\nAnd that’s a sentence that I never expected to type. I mean I’m the kid who used to walk the mile in middle school. I rarely even tried in P.E.\n\nBut there I was last Monday at the gym eagerly putting on my shoes and getting ready for the day’s activity.\n\nI missed nearly two weeks of workouts because of a heavy chest cold that left my lungs wheezing. Two rounds of steroids and antibiotics and three doctor visits finally got me back on my feet.\n\nAs a side note, as someone who lives with an anxiety disorder, the heavy stimulants in steroids and oral inhalers made for a very edgy couple of weeks without much rest.\n\nBut once Nate Yoho, my coach and owner of CrossFit Merle Hay, started putting me through my paces, I started to feel spectacular.\n\nIn fact, I think I got an exercise high. This is a rush of endorphins in the brain spurred by exercise. Runners talk about it a lot when they push to a new level of exertion.\n\nI’d never experienced it before. But it felt great.\n\nThat I actually enjoy exercise and look forward to it as a part of my thrice weekly routine is a compliment to Nate.\n\nHe designs workouts that are varied. I rarely do the same thing twice in our three sessions.\n\nNate also excels at the human touch. On my second day back, the weather was pleasant. We took a short walk in the parking lot as a cooldown activity.\n\nNate told me my confidence of movement was improving. I didn’t know what that meant.\n\nHe said I approach activities less tentatively than I did when we started working together. I pick up weights without fear of injury, he said.\n\nI thought about what this meant. I came to Nate after finishing physical therapy with Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nThe pain of limited movement was fresh in my mind. I also had a mindset that an injury meant I had to stop, rehab and restart the process.\n\nBut as I’ve gotten more comfortable working with Nate, I’ve begun to realize that some nagging problems — such as knots in my calves — can be treated on the spot.\n\nNate “rolls out” the knots with a special tool he has. It’s unpleasant, but it’s an intense discomfort in the short term to avoid limping for a full day.\n\nI felt my calves, which had been dormant with the rest of my body during my illness, tighten up during a stepping exercise Nate gave me.\n\nI told Nate they were right on the edge of knotting up. He adjusted the workout to more upper body and core challenges and we avoided aggravating the calves further.\n\nAt the end of the day, I drank my protein shake. I had a couple extra bananas that evening as snacks. The calves felt acceptable the next day. They were sore, but not injured. We got on with the business of working out.\n\nThe key lesson here is the clear line of communication between Nate and I. I feel comfortable telling him, “Hey, this isn’t working.” And I trust him to challenge me to get better.\n\nThe blessing of this is that it allows me to focus on continuing to recover from morbid obesity without relying on the singular metric of how much I weigh.\n\nYes, I’m still morbidly obese. But in just a couple of months, my strength, flexibility and mobility have all improved that even I, the ultimate skeptic in recognizing my own personal improvement, can notice the difference every day.\n\nThis is an important and somewhat risky period in the recovery, I think. Once I cross the 100-pound mark for weight loss, there is a temptation to let up, to look back at how far I’ve come and rest on my laurels.\n\nThat’s why I’m so blessed to have Nate and his gym in my life. Nate is a master of thinking both day-to-day and big picture. He comes up with the workouts that get me sweating and stressing three times a week.\n\nBut then he talks about what I think is patently impossible: pull-ups, competing in CrossFit Games and so on.\n\nI tend to keep my focus in the present. I’m not even sure I want to compete as an athlete. But having someone looking that far ahead does make it easier for me to avoid feeling too satisfied and, instead, keep moving forward.\n\nWEDNESDAY, MARCH 9, 2016\n\nBetter even when sicker\n\nOddly enough, I appreciate the improvements to my physical health most when my body fails me.\n\nHere’s what I mean: For almost two weeks, I’ve been plagued by a bronchial infection that I can’t shake. My lungs sound like a saw cutting through old wood.\n\nThe breathing problem curtailed my workouts with my coach, Nate Yoho at CrossFit Merle Hay, for more than a week.\n\nIt’s tough to exert yourself when you can barely get a chest full of air.\n\nStill, I think of how much worse I would have been if I were still carrying the 94.8 pounds I’ve lost over the last 11 months.\n\nI am by no means svelte, but I am definitely stronger. Even with diminished lung capacity, I’m able to walk to and from my car without stopping. I’m able to walk into the doctor’s office without assistance or breaking out in a fugue of sweat.\n\nI like how many of those sentences begin with “I’m able.”\n\nAn infection like this would have totally incapacitated me a year ago.\n\nI’ve been sickly to be sure, but I’ve mostly been able to work.\n\nMy voice hasn’t been strong, but my body has had enough strength for short bursts of energy needed to get things done: Pick up prescriptions or supplies at the grocery store and so on.\n\nI remain morbidly obese, of course, but the progress from March 2015 to March 2016 astounds me most when I hit a challenge such as illness.\n\nThen there’s this strange feeling: I actually miss the gym. Early in the lung ailment, I pushed through a workout and I got sicker. It wasn’t my brightest move, but I have come to enjoy my time with Nate.\n\nHis gym is as he promised: a place where anybody of any ability level can feel comfortable getting stronger.\n\nI’ve come to look forward to my thrice weekly appointments there the way I used to look forward to hanging out with my high school sports teammates or my weekly Dungeons & Dragons group.\n\nThere is a camaraderie. The gym is absent of judgement and heavy on encouragement.\n\nSo that I haven’t been able to go due to illness has been a disappointment both physically and socially.\n\nI really want to round off a full 100 pounds before the end of March, when the year anniversary of Making Weight rolls around.\n\nI still hope to pull that off, but this lung problem slowed that, to be sure, but Nate checks in on me nearly every day. That’s dedication.\n\nAnd I must admit, I’ve been blessed with a good cross-section of people who work very hard to help me get better.\n\nWhen the cold first started to migrate to my chest, I went to an urgent care clinic. The doctor prescribed a round of medications. But as that course wound down, it was clear the problem wasn’t working.\n\nI groused about this on Facebook and got a surprising response.\n\nMy family doctor, Shauna Marie Basener of Mercy Westown Internal Medicine Clinic, messaged me and told me to get into see her at once.\n\nDoes that count as a house call in the social media age?\n\nI don’t know. I guess we’ll see when the bill arrives.\n\nBut I must appreciate a doctor who is paying close enough attention to my health that she reads my status updates.\n\nI did, in fact, go to see Shauna and she got me on a new round of medicine. A chest X-ray showed no signs of pneumonia. That’s good, though I’m still wheezing as of this writing.\n\nStill, I feel pretty good, at least from a mental standpoint. Just as I appreciate the physical transformation spurred by Nate and physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy, I am grateful for Shauna’s doting care.\n\nIn fact, I’m so enamored with Shauna’s work that I’m going to follow her when she changes offices in April and moves to an office in Ames.\n\nSure, it’s a few extra miles on my Dodge, but when you develop a relationship with a good doctor – or any healthcare provider – you do what you can to preserve it as long as possible.\n\nSo my message to my fellow travelers on the journey back from obesity is that there are good people out there – doctors, therapists, trainers and others – whose mission in life is to help you get better.\n\nWho are we to turn our back on such open acts of kindness?\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 3, 2016\n\nNow we're getting somewhere\n\n\"Have you tried on some of your old pants?\" said Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my first set of parents died.\n\n\"No,\" I said.\n\n\"Well, you should,\" she said. \"These are getting pretty baggy. The cuffs are dragging on the ground.\"\n\nThis conversation repeated itself a half dozen or so times in the last two or three months. She asked. I said, \"No.\"\n\nI still had several smaller sizes of khakis hanging in my closet at home. But I refused to pull them off the hanger.\n\nI was too scared.\n\nYes, I'd lost weight since my efforts to recover from morbid obesity began nearly a year ago. But I refused to recognize it.\n\nI looked in the mirror and did not see what I was, but remained haunted by what I was not.\n\nThis is the way of things for a lot of people in a vain culture. But it is an especially acute problem for the obese. I simply could not see any difference.\n\nSure, when my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, pointed out specific things I could do after working with her that I couldn't do months ago, I intellectually understood that to be true.\n\nBut I didn't feel it. I still felt like the same lumpy, hopeless fat guy who was a few french fries away from a heart attack.\n\nSometimes, I still do.\n\nEven now, when my fitness coach Nate Yoho works me out three days a week at his CrossFit Merle Hay gym, I see great leaps forward in physical abilities.\n\nA major part of Nate's program is retesting me on exercises we've done a few weeks earlier to see how much stronger and faster I've become.\n\nHe posts the numbers to a private Facebook page that only he, Stefanie and I can see. We talk about the improvements.\n\nI really do feel stronger. I notice it in small ways, like the ease in getting up from a chair or getting out of my car.\n\nAt the beginning of this journey, it must have looked like my Dodge Charger was giving birth to a 563.2-pound baby elephant every time I got out of it.\n\nI once needed my arms to pull myself to a standing position because my poor, overburdened and arthritic knees couldn't take the strain.\n\nNow, I just stand up without so much as a sigh or groan. That's a credit to the paces both Stefanie and Nate put me through.\n\nBut this pants thing was too much for me. I was afraid that despite all that progress, I would somehow slip on that smaller size and they would be as tight as they were when I pushed them to the back of the closet with the other \"maybe someday\" clothes.\n\nI finally acquiesced to Mom 2.0's request after a session at Nate's gym. He takes videos of me doing various exercises to show me what I'm doing right and wrong with form.\n\nHe showed me squats from my first week working with him and squats about a month later. I happened to be wearing the same shirt and shorts in both videos.\n\nI noticed my belly was visibly flatter in the profile shots. I made Nate show me both videos multiple times. He agreed. There was much less Finney in the second than the first.\n\nStill, it was hard for my brain to accept it. I showed the videos to my girlfriend. She reminded me she had been telling me for months that I'd slimmed out in the face and my belly was less bulky.\n\nSo I went home and pulled that pair of pants a size smaller and pulled them on. They fit marvelously, maybe even a hair looser than I would have expected.\n\nAfter that, I decided it was time to do something I'd been avoiding since December: Get weighed.\n\nI knew my diet had faltered during the holidays and my exercise evaporated before I started working with Nate.\n\nBut now it was late February and I was wearing slightly smaller pants. Progress seemed to be lurching in the proper direction. I might as well test the theory with an actual measurement.\n\nThe result: I was down 13 pounds between Dec. 14 and Feb. 23. I've lost a total of 94.8 pounds since this journey began nearly a year ago.\n\nI want to knock out that last 5.2 pounds before the year is up, just to get a nice triple-digit loss.\n\nBut, of course, I immediately got a vicious chest cold that sidelined me at the gym for several sessions.\n\nStill, the momentum is shifting in the right direction. It's going well enough that even I can see it.\n\nFRIDAY, FEB. 19, 2016\n\nChallenge, encouragement hallmarks of workouts\n\nIt still feels weird to call Nate Yoho “my personal trainer.”\n\nNate owns CrossFit Merle Hay, where I’ve taken up an exercise regime in my latest effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nThere is something very gauche about the phrase, like showy jewelry or riding around in a stretch SUV limo. I guess I’m just aggressively middle class that way.\n\nThe term I prefer is “coach,” because it feels both more accurate and less pretentious. And it describes my relationship with the man.\n\nThe best coaches are teachers. And Nate definitely teaches me with each session.\n\nEarly on, my legs burned and my back ached so bad I wanted to quit.\n\nNate taught me about protein drinks. I always thought protein drinks were for body builders.\n\nNot so, Nate said. Science says a high-protein drink within 45 minutes of an intense workout will help build muscle and encourage recovery.\n\nI was skeptical. But I went off to the grocery store and bought a few of the Hy-Vee brand plastic jars of whey protein that were low in sugar and carbohydrates and high in the nutrients Nate recommended.\n\nI put two scoops in some water, shake it up and drink it after workouts.\n\nAnd … wow.\n\nThe difference was awesome. My muscles were still sore after workouts, but the searing pain from lactic acid buildup was gone.\n\n“Recovery,” Nate said, “is just as important as the workout.”\n\nThese protein drinks gave me new life for workouts. I don’t tolerate pain well.\n\nAnd since I live with general anxiety disorder, my brain chemistry malfunctions tend to take a rational caution about pain and turn it into a paralyzing fear.\n\nNow that I knew the protein shakes work just like my coach said they would, I could embrace workouts with greater vigor.\n\nOne of the things I enjoy most about working with Nate is the way his mind seems to be always working on the parallel processes of challenging me and encouraging me at the same time.\n\nEarly in our workouts, we did a cycle of exercises that were timed. I performed four cycles of belly crunches, calorie burning on a rowing machine and ring rows, which require me to pull myself up to a standing position from an incline using gymnast’s rings.\n\nI was to do four cycles, taking breaks as I needed.\n\nThe first time we did this on Jan. 26, it took me 13 minutes, 38 seconds. I gasped for air the entire time and took many water breaks.\n\nI confess I needed the water less than I was simply stalling for time to get my breath back.\n\nWe retested the cycle about two and a half weeks later on Feb. 11. I made the cycle 2 minutes, 36 seconds faster than the last time.\n\nNate said he typically doesn’t retest this quickly on exercises. But that’s where the encouragement side of his challenge-encouragement dynamic comes in.\n\nNate wanted to show me that I was making progress even if my brain stubbornly refused to see it.\n\n“The numbers don’t lie,” he said.\n\nAnother little touch Nate offers: He checks in every day by text.\n\nHe texts after workouts to see how my body is feeling.\n\nHe texts before workouts to check my mental readiness.\n\nHe texts on off days just to ask how I’m holding up.\n\nThe other day I told him I had some soreness in my triceps after some bench press work we did.\n\nI told him it didn’t hurt. In fact, it felt kind of cool. It reminded me, “Oh, yeah. I worked out and that was cool.”\n\nNate replied: “You’re body is starting to figure out what’s going on.”\n\nAnd maybe my brain will follow along soon, too.\n\nTUESDAY, FEB. 9, 2016\n\nLife after my 'brain zap'\n\nMany readers have asked me how my “brain zap” treatment for chronic depression went.\n\nI hesitated to answer right away because I wanted to get more data before I gave a definitive answer.\n\nBut more than a month after I finished transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, under the direction of Dr. Eric Barlow at Compass Clinical Associates in Urbandale, I can safely say the treatment was a resounding success.\n\nA brief recap: TMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the nerves in the brain to make them more receptive to the naturally occurring mood-regulating chemicals swirling around in our gray matter.\n\nI live with what is known as progressive depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder.\n\nThat simply means that I sometimes get very sad or very scared beyond what is reasonable for what’s going on in my life.\n\nA portion of this problem is caused by chemical imbalances in my brain. I’m essentially not getting enough of the juices that make me better at handling stress or grief.\n\nI took TMS five days a week for six weeks and once a week for another several weeks.\n\nOthers noticed the change in my mood before I did. My Grandma Newcomb said I seemed like my old self. Barlow said after a couple weeks that I was a lot more animated and brighter than I had been when the process began.\n\nI remained skeptical, in part because that’s how a good paragraph stacker should be, and in part because hope is a tough thing to embrace for people who live with depression.\n\nNow, though, having lived life after treatment, I would say my depression is in remission.\n\nI don’t know if that’s a term Barlow or the medical community would use, but that’s how I feel.\n\nRemission feels like the right noun because I recognize my depression is not cured. It’s a condition I live with like high blood pressure or Type II diabetes.\n\nI can do what it takes to keep those conditions in check, but they’re still a part of my health profile.\n\nI still have down days. But that’s it. It’s a day or two at the most. It isn’t a month or three months.\n\nI’m much better at recognizing when I’m down and acting to break the cycle. Sometimes this involves changing activities. Sometimes it means taking a nap.\n\nI still see a cognitive behavioral therapist twice a month. The other part of mental illness is understanding how you think, why you think that way and developing new ways to cope with the world.\n\nI liken the process to being asked to run 10 yards on a football field loaded with dozens of tackling dummies.\n\nAfter a while, you get winded because there are so many obstacles you can’t make progress.\n\nTMS removed half or more of those tackling dummies from my path. I work in therapy sessions to either dodge those other obstacles or find new ways to cope with them.\n\nI’m not the kind of person who endorses medical procedures. That’s a personal choice that individuals need to make in consultation with their medical team, family and their own values.\n\nI will say this: My behavior therapist is deeply skeptical of TMS and believes I am experiencing a strong placebo effect.\n\nHe might be right. I trust my behavioral therapist with my life. And he’s by far the best therapist I’ve ever had, and one of the finest men I’ve had the pleasure to know.\n\nHe might also be wrong. TMS, placebo or otherwise, helped me be more comfortable with who I am.\n\nIt didn’t make me a cheerful person. My coworkers and editors will attest to that.\n\nBut it allowed me to be more comfortable with who I am and accept myself, foibles and all.\n\nAnd that’s a wonderful thing, when I used to spend days ruminating on what a crummy person I am.\n\nOne side note: though anxiety and depression often occur together as mood disorders, they are separate conditions.\n\nMy anxiety is probably about the same as it always has been. It ebbs and flows, spiking and dropping based on what’s going on my life.\n\nI still find myself calling my talk therapist when I get into a mess of persistent ruminative thoughts — that is, getting stuck in a rut of negative thinking that tends to take a small problem and expand it to the worst possible ending.\n\nBut even my talk therapist agrees that I am getting better at recognizing those periods of gloomy rumination and breaking the cycle by calling him to talk it through.\n\nSo for now, I’m embracing life without the burden of feeling like I’m a bum, but I’ll always be braced for the possibility such thoughts will reoccur.\n\nTHURSDAY, FEB. 2, 2016\n\nWanting to quit\n\nSometimes I feel like Humpty Dumpty, the fairy-tale egg man who fell off a wall and required all the king’s horses and men to reassemble him.\n\nI propped my right knee on pillows and gingerly leaned back into my bed.\n\nTwo weeks of training at my friend Nate Yoho’s CrossFit Merle Hay studio left me with a swollen knee, knots in both calves and the return of the lower back pain that started me on my journey to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI was ready to quit. I wanted to quit. I was hurt, humbled and ashamed.\n\nI knew joining a gym and working with a personal trainer would be a challenge for my obese body.\n\nI just did not realize how much my body would rebel against the change – and how hard the emotional repercussions of that rebellion would hit me.\n\nFirst, I should note that Nate is an excellent trainer. He speaks in a clear, gentle voice and explains all the exercises, lifts and other activities to me in clear instruction.\n\nHe focuses on proper form and injury prevention just as much as my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk, of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nThe problem is my body. I carry a lot of weight in the front of my torso – my gut. Over years of hauling this girth around, I’ve developed the bad habit of leaning back slightly to balance out the extra weight that pitches me forward.\n\nThe problem is all that leaning back has compressed my spine in the lower back. And those compressed vertebrae pinch nerves. This leads to shooting pain that I sometimes feel all the way to my finger tips and toes.\n\nIt also makes sitting, standing or any kind of movement from a prone or supine position exceptionally painful.\n\nI aggravated my back doing a lifting exercise. When fatigue sets in, I start to rush. When I rush, I lose form. And when I lose form, I hurt myself.\n\nIn this case, I leaned back a few too many times while lifting weights.\n\nNate didn’t notice it at the time because I didn’t feel pain and didn’t grimace. Conversely, when knots developed in my calves, he stopped the exercise right away because he saw the pain in my face.\n\nBut over a few days, the back injury caught up with me. I became immobile.\n\nThat’s when the fear and shame crept in.\n\nNate has made every effort to make his gym as comfortable and inviting to me as possible. But there are mirrors and I see myself. I may have lost a lot of weight to this point, but I still don’t like my own reflection. That’s a self-esteem problem and I’m working on it.\n\nWhen the back injury returned, I knew exactly what happened. I overcompensated for that weight on my gut pulling me forward.\n\nIt felt as if my own body betrayed me. I got emotional. My thoughts spiraled to unrealistic finalities. Had I done so much damage to my body that getting from fat to fit was actually impossible?\n\nI was ready to quit the gym and just crawl under my blanket and hide from the world.\n\nEnter all the king’s horses and men.\n\nThe first call I made was to my therapist. I told him my dilemma. He suggested that maybe the exercise was too much for my current weight.\n\nI told him I was worried that I liked him saying that because it was what I wanted to hear. I wanted to quit.\n\nIf I quit, though, I wanted it to be because I was injured or was really overwhelmed, not because I was afraid.\n\nMy therapist replied: “Then you’re going to make the right decision whatever you decide because you’re asking the right question.”\n\nI texted Stefanie and told her of the injury. I confessed I was thinking about quitting.\n\nShe urged me to stick with it. Care for the injuries, she said. Tend to the pain. But I had to keep moving.\n\n“There were days in the first five sessions with me that we didn’t make any progress but you kept coming back,” Stefanie wrote.\n\nIt may be cliché, but it is often difficult for men to talk to other men about emotions. Still, I confided to Nate my emotional worries along with my physical ones.\n\nHe, too, urged me to come in for my final workout of the week. He said we didn’t have to go hard. We could even meet for lunch. He just wanted the conversation going.\n\n“It’s OK to be emotional about it,” he wrote. “How could it not be? I think if you continued your old ways making it to 50 would be pushing it. Look at what you’ve done in the past six to nine months. You’re on the right path.”\n\nHow could I turn my back on a man who was working so hard to convince me to get better?\n\nFinally, I called my primary care provider, Dr. Shauna Basener at Mercy Internal Medicine in Clive. She thought exercise – at a reduced level – was OK.\n\nShe renewed a muscle relaxant prescription and another anti-inflammatory that is slightly stronger than over-the-counter stuff.\n\nSo, I iced my knee. I took my medicine. And with a mixture of trepidation and resolve, I went to my last workout of the week.\n\nNate put together a cycle of exercises that didn’t require much bending. He constantly checked on the condition of my back. We both remained vigilant on spine position.\n\nThe workout was not as intense as previous sessions. But it did not matter.\n\nFor that day, winning was just getting through the door.\n\nFRIDAY, JAN. 29, 2016\n\nTHE NEW GYM\n\nI barely slept the night before I reported to CrossFit Merle Hay to work with my new trainer Nate Yoho.\n\nAnticipation is the worst part of starting anything especially for a chronic anxiety junkie like me.\n\nI passed off my trembling upon walking in the studio as an effect of the cold weather. The truth was I had no idea how this was going to go.\n\nI half expected to leave on a stretcher.\n\nThe activity started off poorly. The first thing Nate did was take my picture, front, profile and side.\n\nI enjoy having my picture taken about as much as I enjoy listening to a dental drill at top volume on a movie theater speaker system.\n\nNate said they were to mark my progress. He posted them to a Facebook page that only he and I are a member of.\n\nWe started with some stretches. I managed to get through that without breaking into flop sweat.\n\nNate explained every step calmly and articulately. I started to settle.\n\nNext were something called box squats. Per Nate’s instruction, I held my hands over one another and sat down on a box.\n\nThis is not as easy as it reads, especially for someone who carries his weight in his doughy middle.\n\nNate cautioned me to be mindful of form. He told me which muscles to use and how to rotate my legs.\n\nThe sweat the fell by this point was from exercise rather than nerves.\n\nWe moved to standing push-ups. He put a weight bar on a rack. I leaned forward into it and pushed back to a standing position. This too is not as easy at reads.\n\nAgain, Nate directed my form. I followed directions as best I could. My editors wouldn’t believe how easy I was to command.\n\nThe bench press came next. I just did the standard 45-pound bar. We rotated between the bench press and a stepping drill similar to one I had done many times in physical therapy with Stefanie Kirk over at Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nWe finished with some dumbbell exercises. I was beat. I pulled my towel out of my gym bag and changed my shoes.\n\nDay 1 was finished. I had survived.\n\nStefanie texted me: “I haven’t received an SOS call, so I’m guessing everything went OK.”\n\nIt did. The workout was good. I felt like I’d really done something.\n\nThe second day brought a new set of exercises. Nate introduced me to deadlifting technique. We worked just with the bar again focusing on form rather than strain.\n\nI got plenty of strain anyway.\n\nWe worked on a shoulder exercise before we advanced to the toughest part of the workout.\n\nNate sets a series of exercises out. This time it was something called “ring rows,” crunches and using a rowing machine.\n\nRing rows involve grabbing metal rings attached to straps that are lashed to a metal frame. I leaned back to about a 45 degree angle and pulled myself up to standing position. I did that eight times in a row.\n\nThen I hustled over to do 10 crunches — what old people like me used to call sit-ups with a slightly different technique that involves a special pillow to support the lower back.\n\nWhen I finished that, I switched to the rowing machine, where my goal was to burn eight calories.\n\nThe goal was to complete four sets of all three exercises. I wheezed and groaned my way through it. I stopped to get water. Nate made me stop once to catch my breath.\n\nThe whole thing took 13 minutes, 38 seconds. We finished with a 300 meter walk.\n\nNate said we’ll revisit that work out in a few weeks and mark the progress by how much more quickly I’m able to work through the cycle.\n\nThings went along fine, but I don’t think I truly trusted Nate until my third day at his shop.\n\nWe worked a step exercise and I felt my right calf muscle pull. It was a familiar feeling. It happened several times in physical therapy with Stefanie.\n\nBut Nate caught my grimace right away. He asked what hurt. I told him. We stopped. I laid prone on the floor.\n\nNate worked the calf muscle with a piece of PVC pipe, rolling the knot out similar to the way Stefanie used to torture me with these metal tools.\n\nHe cautioned me that when I feel something off, I needed to tell him. The goal was always to avoid injury.\n\nAnd this is a weird thing to say about your trainer, but in that moment I felt safe with him. I knew he cared about my health. He offered to train me after all.\n\nBut here he was working on the injury, telling me how to handle it and looking for ways to keep the workout moving forward without causing a bigger problem.\n\nThis is the kind of moment that builds a bond between coach and “athlete.” (Nate calls all his clients athletes. I don’t feel like one, but it’s not wise to contradict the guy who spots you when you lift weights.)\n\nWe finished the last day with some rope climbing. I sat on a bench. My goal was to pull myself into a standing position by mostly using my arms.\n\nIt was tough.\n\n“This is the first step to you one day being able to do a pull-up,” Nate said.\n\nI told him that my life has been pull-up free for 40 years. It’s never happened. I couldn’t even do it in high school when I weighed 190 pounds, played basketball and regularly jogged.\n\nNate smiled.\n\n“I’ll take that as a challenge,” he said.\n\nAnd I had this odd feeling that he might just get me to pull it off.\n\nTHURSDAY, JAN. 21, 2016\n\nUNCERTAINTY ABOUND\n\nMy nerves are really getting to me now.\n\nBy the time these paragraphs reach our print edition, I will have graduated from physical therapy for a second time.\n\nThe next step is work with personal trainer Nate Yoho of Crossfit Merle Hay in Urbandale.\n\nAnd I am terrified.\n\nI can’t get a good handle on why. I know some of it rests with a fear of failure.\n\nAnd if I’m honest, I’ve let nutrition and exercise slide in recent months.\n\nThat enthusiastic burst this summer faded in the fall and all but evaporated in winter.\n\nThis is true for lots of people who exercise and struggle with weight.\n\nThe holidays provide so many irresistible treats. The weather discourages activity.\n\nBut I’m in a funk and I won’t deny it anymore. Weight loss plateaued in October.\n\nI’ve probably gained a few pounds because more fried foods, fatty foods and carbohydrates have found their way onto my plate and into my stomach.\n\nNo, that’s not the right way to say it. Food isn't animated. It didn't jump down my throat. It was me. I chose and chose poorly.\n\nEven Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my first set of parents died, has had to scold me not to go for a third bowl of her delicious chili.\n\nI haven’t made an appointment with my nutritionist, Jacque Schwartz at Mercy Weight Loss & Nutrition Center in Clive, since late November.\n\nI put it off using the holidays as an excuse. The truth is I didn’t want to look at that number, because I knew it went in the wrong direction or, if I was very lucky, just stayed the same.\n\nJacque has again and again admonished me not to take my weight as the end all, be all of my health.\n\nBut I do. Everybody does. Thinner and leaner is better. Rounder and plumper is not.\n\nSo I’ve avoided going to see her because I’m afraid to face the number.\n\nI know, I know. I should just suck it up and go and get back on track.\n\nI should. And yet I don’t.\n\nBecause not knowing gives me a slim hope that I haven’t undone as much work as I think I have.\n\n(And given my penchant for anxiety-driven self-flagellation, I’ve practically convinced myself I weigh more than I did when I started this process last March.)\n\nI’ve enjoyed my work with physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy. She’s the best. She really is.\n\nAside from my talk therapist, I cannot think of a better relationship I’ve had with a medical professional in my life.\n\nStefanie has worked with me as much as possible on this transition from her clinic to Nate’s gym.\n\nShe went as far as to talk to Nate on the phone about what we’ve done, what I can do and where I need to improve.\n\nShe tries hard to convince me I’m in better shape than I feel. But my anxiety is stubborn even when controlled by medication.\n\nI am afraid I am going to fail. I am afraid I’m not going to get any better and the slide to immobility will begin again.\n\nThis is the reality of the recovery. I’ve written about this many times: “Rocky” movies have montages. Life does not.\n\nRight now, I feel like I’m playing the same note over and over again. It’s tedious. It’s tiring. I want to give up. I just want to roll over, pull the covers up and go back to sleep.\n\nBut Stefanie stares me down with her big brown eyes and reminds me I once couldn’t walk more than 156 feet without stopping because of pain.\n\nNow I’m doing balancing exercises that weren’t even possible back in May when I discharged from physical therapy the first time.\n\nI try hard to keep these positives in mind. But I have a mirror. And I don’t like what I see. And every little comment, even the ones by people I don’t know and shouldn’t care about, seems to hit like a punch.\n\nI spoke to a fraternal group the other day. The first question from an audience member — the first damn question — was “how much do you weight?”\n\nI answered, but I felt like an exhibit at a freak show. I feel that way more often than I’d like to admit.\n\nI wish I could type inspiring paragraphs for readers every week with a smile on my face and joy exploding from my fingertips.\n\nBut that isn’t how this works. There are highs, lows and everything in the middle.\n\nI’m in a low right now and have been for longer than I’d like to admit.\n\nSo I’m going to have to take some of my own advice. When you get low, you’ve got to ask for help.\n\nStefanie has taken me as far as she can. Now I turn to Nate and his skills.\n\nAnd I’ll have to find the fortitude somewhere to keep moving forward.\n\nWEDNESDAY, JAN. 13, 2016\n\nTOUGH TALK\n\nA reader wrote in to ask my advice on a delicate question.\n\nI’ll pause for regular readers to stop laughing.\n\nThe reader carries a few extra pounds herself and has followed this blog as I write about my efforts to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nShe noted that a friend of hers is obese. The woman loses her breath walking from her desk to the restroom.\n\nThe reader wanted to know my advice for talking to her friend about the subject.\n\nWell, that is dicey, isn’t it? The reader knew that.\n\n“I know that when people would tell me that I needed to lose weight, it only saddened me — making me more likely to eat more,” the reader wrote.\n\nI am afraid I don’t have very good advice here.\n\nObesity is absolutely a life-threatening health condition.\n\nBut unlike most diseases, it comes with a great deal of shame and scorn.\n\nI don’t want to get into the victim culture debate when it comes to obesity. But no one blames someone who gets cancer for getting cancer.\n\nWell, unless they smoke. I always find it odd and crude after someone dies of lung cancer to have someone ask, “Did he smoke?” If so, I guess he must have deserved to die.\n\nAnyway, there is, of course, some measure of personal responsibility in maintaining a healthy weight.\n\nBut to argue that a person is obese simply because they overeat oversimplifies a complex disease.\n\nAnd yes, I call obesity a “disease.” Because that’s what it is. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention agrees with me.\n\nObesity has roots in genetics, food portions, the chemistry of food and even trauma.\n\nSure, the No. 1 reason I am morbidly obese is because of overuse of my excellent hand-to-mouth coordination.\n\nBut the underlying causes: including a chaotic childhood and depression and anxiety conditions that I’ve written about here are just as important.\n\nI overeat when I’m stressed. I binge eat to feel better. I make poor food choices when I’m anxious or depressed. These are all part of a holistic approach to treating the problem.\n\nSo the first bit of advice I’d give: Don’t assume obesity is just because the person lacks self-control.\n\nThe second thing, and this is very important, remember that the person knows they are obese, or at least fat.\n\nNobody ever had to tell me I was fat. I knew. I thought about it every time I saw a reflection in the mirror or a window.\n\nI knew it every time my arthritic knees cracked and popped when I stood up or my embattled back cried out when I tried to shop for groceries.\n\nAnd, as the reader noted of her own experience, when people brought it up to me, I just slipped into a deeper depression, ate more and was more self-destructive.\n\nI had a good friend tell me point-blank that I was too fat and he was worried he was going to have to attend my funeral soon.\n\nI knew it came from the heart and he meant it from the deepest part of personal concern.\n\nI ignored him. I ignored the doctor who diagnosed me with Type II diabetes, too.\n\nI only sought help with my body broke down to the point that I could not do my job and could barely function.\n\nI don’t believe it has to come to that for everybody.\n\nI do believe that everyone has to come to terms with their disease in their own way.\n\nI would never discourage a friend from expressing concern over the health of another friend.\n\nBut be forewarned: Even if you do it in the kindest possible way, with the gentlest language or with blunt force honesty, there’s every chance there will not lead to immediate change.\n\nSo, yes, dear reader, talk to your friend about your concerns about her health. But take extraordinary pains to make sure she knows your words come from a place of love and not judgement and scorn.\n\nBecause believe me, she’s doing enough of that to herself already.\n\nTUESDAY, JAN. 5, 2016\n\nMOST IMPROVED\n\nNate Yoho was busy with a client when I arrived at his gym shortly before 10 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nNate owns Crossfit Merle Hay, located on the backside of the former Carlos O’Kelly’s restaurant in a strip mall south of the Interstate 35-80 bypass.\n\nI took a seat on one of the barstools – still emblazoned with the defunct O’Kelly’s logo. I watched the action.\n\nA woman easily taller than 6 feet jumped on a wooden box that looked to be about 3 feet tall.\n\nThe woman looked like an athlete. Her body size and shape reminded me of the late Missy Lange, a former Drake women’s basketball player who was 6-foot-4 whose former coach, Lisa Bluder, once described as “having the perfect body for basketball.”\n\nThe woman jumped on the box about 30 times. She didn’t grunt once. Her balance was impeccable.\n\nShe moved from the box jumps to deadlifting what appeared to be 225 pounds. She sweat, but she was in total control – strong, powerful and determined.\n\nBehind her, another fit man was squatting on one leg in a balance exercise that looked nigh impossible to me.\n\nMy first thought, my only thought, was to get the hell out of there. This place was not for me. This was for fit people, not fat slobs who injure their back lifting 10-pound barbells.\n\nNate was a minor league baseball player. He was a real athlete. I was never a real athlete. I played basketball and baseball as a boy, but I was terrible. I just wanted to be on the team with the other guys. It was something to do other than go home.\n\nI won “Most Improved Player” my sophomore year at Winterset High School. This is because I went from making zero of 10 free throws at the beginning of the season to four of 10 free throws by the end of the season.\n\nNate finished with his client and took me next door to a quieter room. His 2-year-old daughter, Caralyn, was with him. She ran around with adorable boots with animal faces on the toes.\n\nNate had kind eyes and a gentle manner. He shares the same gift of making a person feel welcome and at ease possessed by Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my parents died.\n\nStill, I could not conceal my nervousness. I felt overwhelmed at the sight of the powerlifters next door.\n\nNate assured me.\n\n“You won’t start there,” he said. “If anything, the first few days are going to be kind of easy. I would rather have that than you going too hard and getting hurt.”\n\nNate opened with a thorough interview. He wanted to know what kind of exercise I’ve been doing in physical therapy, how I hurt myself most recently and my comfort level with various stresses on knees, my back and so on.\n\nNate is good at his job. I can tell because when he talked, I actually believed I could do whatever he put in front of me. I feel the same way when I work with my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nYet as I walked out to my car, I felt overwhelmed again. I was never, ever going to be powerlifting like those people I saw today. I remembered trying out for the East High School basketball team my junior year.\n\nI was so slow in sprints that Coach Chuck Sutherland, after two days of tryouts, offered to let me be team manager. I was much better at taping ankles and handing out towels and Gatorade than playing sports.\n\nI had a talk therapy appointment after meeting with Nate. My therapist asked me what I was so afraid of.\n\nI said I was afraid of getting hurt and I was afraid I couldn’t do it.\n\nMy therapist said what I was really afraid of was embarrassment. He said I was focused on the wrong thing.\n\n“Embarrassment is an emotion, not a measure of performance,” he said. “You’re right. You may never be able to do what those other people in the gym can do. But that isn’t the goal. The goal is to improve your health.”\n\nI thought about this. He’s right. I’m not shooting for varsity here. I’m just trying to fit into movie theater seats and build up the strength and endurance for everyday life.\n\nCome to think of it, “strength for everyday life” was a phrase Nate used.\n\nSo, in a few weeks, I’ll be at Nate’s gym. I’ll be the one in the back, covered in flop sweat and going about an eighth of the speed of everybody else.\n\nBut if everything goes well, I might just win Most Improved Player again.\n\nTHURSDAY, DEC. 31, 2015\n\nRECLUSE NO MORE\n\nI start work with personal trainer Nate Yoho, who owns Crossfit Merle Hay in Des Moines, as soon as I discharge from my latest round of physical therapy, which looks to be about Jan. 22.\n\nI meet with Nate soon to look at his gym and talk about training techniques. The occasion will mark the first time we’ve met in person despite the fact that I’ve written four stories about him as both reporter and columnist.\n\nRegular readers will remember the beautiful, tragic love story of Nate and his wife Laura. They met while working at a gym. They fell in love.\n\nNate’s proposal was so romantic a jewelry store later recreated it for a commercial. But Laura got aggressive brain cancer. She died in July 2013. Their daughter, Caralyn, was born in November that year by surrogate.\n\nThe story is easily the most heart-wrenching and beautiful I’ve written in my career. But I never met Nate.\n\nThe first time I wrote about him, I was on a tight deadline trying to beat the TV competition. The other times, though, well, that’s a little hard to talk about.\n\nREAD THE SERIES:\n\nWhen I was writing about Nate, I was at the peak of my obesity: more than 560 pounds. I was having a real hard time getting around physically.\n\nThe walk from the parking garage to the office, about a block, was almost too much for me at the beginning and ending of my workdays.\n\nNagging and cyclic injuries often laid me up for days at a time.\n\nSo whenever possible, I did my interviews over the phone, even on stories as sensitive as this one.\n\nThere were many reasons for this. One was that I was afraid wherever I met people, there would not be a chair strong enough to hold my weight.\n\nThis was a real concern. Once I was at an assignment where I was sitting on a metal folding chair. It collapsed beneath my weight. I landed flat on my back in a room full of laughing school children.\n\nThere is a sort of slapstick humor to that, of course. Even I can see it.\n\nBut there is an underlying truth that is far more terrible: I was so ashamed of my body and appearance that I didn’t want to be seen.\n\nThat’s a horrible feeling to have.\n\nNate, for his part, was always kind to me. He actually wanted to meet me after one of the stories I wrote about him.\n\nAnd I admitted to him something that I never told anyone: I was afraid to meet him because I didn’t feel worthy.\n\nNate is a guy who is doing life right. He was a pro baseball player in the Milwaukee Brewers system. He takes care of his body.\n\nHe married a beautiful, loving woman who shared his passion for fitness. He tended to her until her last moments.\n\nAnd he dotes on their daughter.\n\nI look at Nate and see all the things I am not, especially physically.\n\nI don’t know why I opened up to Nate in this way. Like I said, we’d never met before in person.\n\nBut he trusted me with his intensely personal story about his wife and daughter. There was a connection there beyond the paragraphs.\n\nNate asked me some time ago if I was a recluse when I felt ashamed, even around the people I trust.\n\nI did and I do. I never want the people I love to see me at my worst.\n\nBut that was a long time ago. I’ve lost 82 pounds since then. I can do things physically that I thought were impossible when I first spoke with Nate.\n\nSo finally I took Nate up on his offer to help me get fit. That’s what he does for a living at Crossfit.\n\nAnd hopefully he will help me show myself and the people I love me at my best.\n\nTUESDAY, DEC. 22, 2015\n\nBAD MATH\n\nI sat down at Jethro’s BBQ near Drake University for dinner with a pal last week.\n\nI opened up MyFitnessPal, the smartphone application that I use to track my calories. A new feature popped up.\n\nIt allowed me to search restaurants in my area based on the GPS location of my phone.\n\nThis is a major development.\n\nSince I began using the app, back in March when the weight-loss journey began, I’ve been forced to estimate the calories in foods at my favorite restaurants.\n\nI eat out a lot, more than I should. This would, at least, provide me with a consistent baseline.\n\nThat was the good news.\n\nThe bad news was I was vastly underestimating the calories of several of my favorite foods.\n\nNot all the restaurants in my area are on the app, but Jethro’s is. And a few of my favorites are heavier in calories that I figured.\n\nThis goes a long way to explaining the lengthy plateau in weight loss. I was guessing wrong and it was going against me. I was treading water instead of making meaningful strokes to the other side.\n\nThe truth is I’ve probably been blowing my calorie goal more often than I thought for months.\n\nThis was a frustrating revelation, but it is better to know than to constantly be wondering what is going wrong.\n\nOnce you know what’s going wrong, then you can make adjustments.\n\nSpeaking of adjustments, my work with physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy continues to go well.\n\nI’d been sick with a fever and some gastrointestinal issues and missed our last session.\n\nI don’t like missing appointments with Stefanie. No matter what my mood is going in, I’m usually feeling centered and sharper going out.\n\nThe rest was doing well. My posture has improved as well as my form in walking.\n\nIt is still a strange thing for me to think about so many different things as I walk.\n\nTighten the abs. Adjust the pelvis to a neutral position. Flex the gluteus muscles as part of my stride. Keep my hips steady and not swaying. Force my toes to point forward.\n\nWhat a list to consider just to take a step.\n\nBut bad form leads to injuries and that leads to more setbacks. This plateau has gone on long enough. It feels too much like wallowing. It’s time to break through to the next level.\n\nHoliday eating is always a challenge. I was frustrated enough with my plateau in November to skip one Thanksgiving meal with my Uncle Larry and Aunt Sharon and have a scaled-down, healthier offering with Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my parents died.\n\nI have two Christmas celebrations planned this season. I’ll have lunch – pork loin is the main course – with my parents.\n\nMy folks are watching their weight, too. Mom 2.0 is a type II diabetic like me, so she’s mindful of carbs and sugars in her offerings.\n\nMom 2.0 also will be cooking the meal for the other Christmas gathering, set on Dec. 28, which brings Dad 2.0’s side of the family to my folks’ stately east-side manor.\n\nThere will be more foods to avoid at that gathering than our Christmas Day festivities, but I think I’ll manage.\n\nI find my appetite can be slaked by good helpings of foods that I like and are low in calories and high in nutrients. I just have to be mindful of portions.\n\nBut if the story MyFitnessPal tells me is true, then I’ve got a lot of work to do to get my diet changes back in order.\n\nI eat out to socialize, either with friends or with the acquaintances I meet among bartenders and servers.\n\nMy girlfriend is changing jobs soon and that means she’ll be working fewer nights. We are committed to eating healthier.\n\nThe easiest way to do this is to make our own meals. I think it’s time I started putting my crock pot to use as well as my George Foreman Grill.\n\nI’m sure there will be plenty of trips to Jethro’s, Tasty Tacos and other favorite haunts.\n\nBut now is the time to hunker down and get serious about this recovery. I’ve made great progress to be sure, but this isn’t the time to start feeling satisfied.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 18, 2015\n\nCHANGING DIRECTIONS\n\nAnxiety precedes every visit to my primary care doctor.\n\nThis is not a reflection on Dr. Shawna Basener of Mercy Westown Internal Medicine Clinic. She is an excellent doctor with a terrific, upbeat attitude whose approach to medicine matches mine: The best medicine is no medicine.\n\nUnder her care, I’ve already shed an expensive cholesterol medication and a diabetic pill. In my latest visit, she encouraged me to drop an iron supplement because my blood hemoglobin numbers are strong.\n\nStill, I get very worked up before every visit. I feel like going to the doctor is like going to the mechanic. She's going to find something wrong and it’s going to be very expensive.\n\nThe night before doctor visits, I’m rife with anxiety. I sleep fitfully if at all. I drive myself to the brink of a crack-up just to get a checkup.\n\nThe news came in mostly good. My A1C, the critical measure for diabetes, was down to 5.3, lower than my September visit. My blood pressure, the doctor said, was perfect.\n\nBut the weight, well, it was the same. Actually, it was up two-tenths of a pound. That’s such an insignificant number that it could be thrown off by how big a cup of water I had when I took my morning medications.\n\nStill, I was discouraged. For nearly three months, I’ve been unable to move that number on the scale.\n\nI know. I know. Plateaus are a part of weight loss. My nutritionist tells me that. My physical therapist tells me that. Social media commentators tell me that.\n\nStill, I feel like I’m in a car that just won’t start.\n\nMy eating habits aren’t horrible. My blood work shows that. I’ve excised most sugars and carbohydrates from my diet. I keep to my daily calorie goal of 2,700. I’m usually much lower.\n\nInjuries have hampered my physical activity. I reinjured my back going too hard on the elliptical machine at my gym. I went back to my physical therapist to get it worked on. She’s focused on form and balance.\n\nThis involves a lot of awkward retraining of my posture. Tuck the pelvis in. Tighten the butt muscles. Squeeze the hips. It feels silly and weird. But if there’s a person in this world I trust to get me on the right physical path, it’s Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nStefanie and I are going to be working through the end of the year and maybe slightly into the new year.\n\nAfter that, well, I need to change my fitness routine in a significant and meaningful way.\n\nMy attitude toward exercise is soured. I don’t know if it is the colder weather or the rain and gray skies or simply apathy. But home seems so warm and comfortable and the gym seems so dull and uncomfortable.\n\nStill, if this weight loss effort — and this column, for that matter — is going to be anything more than complaining about not having the mojo to exercise, I need to do do something different.\n\nAs soon as I’m discharged from physical therapy, probably in mid-January, I’m going to start working out with my friend Nate Yoho.\n\nRegular readers might remember Nate from a story I wrote about him and his late wife, Laura, who died of cancer. Their daughter, Caralyn, was born by surrogate a few months after Laura died. It’s probably the most popular and touching story I’ve ever written.\n\nNate and I have kept in touch. He is a former minor league baseball player and fitness guru who owns his own gym. Several times, he’s offered to develop a program for me. I always turned him down.\n\nI gave lots of lame reasons. But the truth was basic: I was afraid.\n\nNate is the real damn deal when it comes to fitness. The guy has arms like steel cable.\n\nAnd, well, I’m a wimp. I was afraid I would get hurt or be embarrassed.\n\nBut these days, it’s pretty embarrassing to write once a week about how I haven’t really been exercising and I haven’t lost any weight.\n\nSo I finally took Nate up on his offer.\n\nTo his credit, he’s got the same upbeat attitude Dr. Basener has when I visit her. So maybe I’m worried about nothing.\n\nIn a way, this is only fair.\n\nNate trusted me with the most intimate story of his life. The very least I can do is trust him to help in my ongoing effort to save my own life.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 11, 2015\n\nDEPRESSION SPECTER\n\nI’ve lived with chronic clinical depression for a long time.\n\nThe transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, treatments I took under the direction of Dr. Eric Barlow at Compass Clinical in Urbandale seem to have done their job.\n\nTo recap, TMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the nerve endings in the brain to make them more receptive to mood-regulating chemicals such as serotonin.\n\nI took acute treatment five days a week for six weeks. I’m finishing the year taking maintenance treatments once a week.\n\nI think it worked. I would like to declare it an unqualified success, but, like I said, I’ve lived with depression for a long time. I’ve had breaks in the blackness only to fall right back down that bottomless elevator shaft.\n\nIn real, measurable terms, I feel less depressed. And that, in itself, is a strange thing to feel.\n\nSometimes I think depression is stalking me, just outside the periphery of my vision, waiting to strike if I let my guard down.\n\nSo far, that hasn’t happened.\n\nBarlow is so pleased with my progress, he suggested we begin to taper my antidepressant medication and sleeping pills.\n\nI am wary of this, but also excited.\n\nThe excitement comes from the fact that many antidepressants, including the ones I take, come with a side effect of increased appetite and weight gain. Since I’m fighting morbid obesity as it is, it would be nice to remove one of the obstacles, no matter how small it is.\n\nBut the wariness is great as well. I feel pretty good right now. Do I dare tamper with it?\n\nIn the short term, anyway, the answer is yes.\n\nNot long after I finished the acute treatments, I noticed I was sleeping a lot.\n\nSleeping a lot is a behavior I associate with depression, especially the deeper varieties that include anhedonia — loss of interest in things that previously gave me pleasure.\n\nI would put on a ballgame and sink into the recliner. I would be asleep in moments. Sometimes I would sleep for a few minutes. Other times, it was for hours.\n\nThe thing was, I didn’t feel low. I wasn’t in a “woe is me” mode. I was just sleepy and, on the positive side, so relaxed that I drifted off to sleep.\n\nThere are far worse fates than this, of course. But I wanted the lift of depression symptoms to correspond with a bit more pep. I love to read and when I was in the thick of the major depression episode, I couldn’t concentrate enough to stay with a story for more than a page or two — even a comic book.\n\nAnd my exercise mojo seemed to have evaporated completely. If it weren’t for my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, working on my posture and strengthening my bum right hip and groin, I wouldn’t be moving much at all.\n\nSo, Barlow and I consulted and we decided to halve my sleeping pill and drop my antidepressant down by a quarter.\n\nThis has corresponded with a slight uptick in anxiety.\n\nUnfortunately, TMS treatments don’t address anxiety directly. Anxiety and depression are two heads of the same mood disorder dragon. But the chemicals that cause panic attacks are different than those that cause depression.\n\nSo, I know anxiety is probably always going to be a part of my life. It’s something I’ll have to manage, like high blood pressure or cholesterol.\n\nI am worried that the drop in my antidepressant is contributing to my anxiety. Then again, we’re in a chicken-or-egg argument, aren’t we? Is a lower dose of antidepressant causing more worry or is me worrying about a lower dose of antidepressant causing the worry?\n\nI don’t know. The only thing I can do is stay the course. I show up for my maintenance treatments and meet regularly with Barlow to talk things over and keep the brain juices in a proper cocktail.\n\nHopefully, one day, I’ll stop looking over my shoulder for the bad juju of depression.\n\nBut for now, I try to enjoy the relief, but keep one eye on the rear-view mirror.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 4, 2015\n\nBALANCING ACT\n\nI lean left, but not in the way Register columnists are usually accused of.\n\nInstead of a political sensibility, it is an issue of physical balance.\n\nI favor my left leg. Much of the time I find myself standing with most of my weight on my left leg and my right leg dangling almost like a kickstand.\n\nThe lean may seem harmless enough, but it’s the latest focus of my ongoing effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI reinjured my back by taking on aggressive workouts at my gym. The setback frustrated my efforts to lose more weight, leaving me stalled for more than a month.\n\nFurther, it brought back the same pain – though not at the same level – that led me to seek treatment for the health issue in March.\n\nI was happy to be working with my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, again. But I was annoyed that I wasn’t able to keep healthy.\n\nStefanie, as she usually does, saw the problem right away: my butt.\n\nSpecifically, the gluteus muscles weren’t firing when I was climbing stairs or walking.\n\nThis was likely caused by bad posture I assumed when I weighed more than 530 pounds.\n\nThese are the small, harmful changes in your body that you don’t realize occur when you’re obese. You can see the fat. You mop up the flop sweat. You know your endurance is low.\n\nOne of the many things I really didn’t understand about my condition was how much damage the extreme weight was and continues to do to my physical structure.\n\nMorbidly obese people make all sorts of adjustments to their posture and movement. They’re slight and almost imperceptible, but over time there are terrible consequences.\n\nMy bulging belly forced me to carry myself in a poor posture, which in turn changed my gait.\n\nThis wasn’t a problem when I was content to wheeze a few hundred feet to the car or mailbox and be done with movement for the day.\n\nBut when I started doing more walking outside and on the elliptical machine at the gym, the out-of-whack walking style caused my back to break down on me again.\n\nThe weight loss also has one negative side effect: My center of gravity changes with each handful of pounds that come off. That means my body is relearning balance on a regular basis.\n\nStefanie has me working on a variety of posture-improving techniques, strengthening my gluteus muscles and my hip flexors.\n\nSince I’ve been so large for so long, one of the bad habits I’ve picked up is sitting with my hips splayed wide open. This is particularly acute when I’m driving my car.\n\nStefanie tells me the body has something called a neutral position, similar to a car transmission. However, my neutral positions are out of alignment with the center of my body.\n\nMy right hip – which I used to work the pedals in my car – is especially open.\n\nThis might all sound rather technical, but what it boils down to is that when you don’t stand and move the way the body was designed, you injure yourself.\n\nThis round of physical therapy with Stefanie is a lot different than my first. I was much more passive then. I just did what my physical therapist told me. I was happy to get any movement.\n\nNow I’m trying to move the right way. It’s the difference between throwing a baseball casually with a buddy in the park and throwing nine innings for a major-league club.\n\nI ask a lot of questions. And the physical therapy sessions are less sweaty endurance tests and more about the right form, concentrating on making sure the right muscles are firing at the right time.\n\nI have a lot of problems with my hips. They dip and sway in the wrong way. Some days it feels like Stefanie is one of the censors on the old “Ed Sullivan Show” and I’m Elvis Presley trying to break all the rules.\n\nStill, the constant correction is helpful. It feels awkward to concentrate on every step.\n\nI have a list of things I’m supposed to do just when I walk. Tighten my abdominal muscles. Make sure my shoulders are back. Tighten the glutes, especially when I’m climbing stairs. Unlock the knees. Point my toes forward and force my hips to move in the proper direction.\n\nI bet I look pretty silly watching my feet when I make a stride just to see if my toes are in the right place.\n\nI don’t remember how old I was when I learned to walk, but I’ll likely always remember that at 40, I had to learn to walk all over again.\n\nTUESDAY, NOV. 24, 2015\n\nBRAIN BUILDING\n\nI wrote a column earlier this month about how transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, helped ease my chronic depression symptoms.\n\nBut I want to make an important clarification: I am not cured of depression.\n\nI’m not even in remission, which by definition is the absence of symptoms over a sustained period.\n\nI feel fine, better than I have in a long time, but I’m not free of depression or anxiety. In fact, I still have quite a bit of anxiety in crowds and in social situations.\n\nTMS is not meant to be a cure. It is, like prescription medications, a tool in helping rein in a sometimes debilitating health problem.\n\nDepression and anxiety are controlled on two fronts. The first is medicine and treatments such as TMS.\n\nThose treatments address brain chemistry. Severe depression occurs when the brain is deprived of serotonin — the brain’s mood-regulating hormone.\n\nA plethora of medicines exists to try to regulate this. Many of them are very effective. But my depression was treatment-resistant and my psychiatrist, Dr. Eric Barlow, suggested TMS.\n\nTMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate neurons in my brain, making them more receptive to natural levels of serotonin and other mood hormones.\n\nAnd, so far, that feels pretty good.\n\nWhat it did not do, however, was change my thinking patterns. As we grow up, our brain develops ways of dealing with the world. These are called schema.\n\nA simple example of a schema is learning about a hot stove. At some point in your childhood, you probably touched the burner of a stove despite the warnings of your parents. The pain that resulted led your young brain to build a schema that said, simply, “Don’t touch hot stoves.”\n\nBut I had a chaotic childhood. Along with the more common “hot stove schema,” I developed some schemata to deal with the struggles associated with a mother who was addicted to prescription pain killers, suffered violent mood swings and memory loss, and had other boundary issues that I choose to keep private.\n\nI developed schema to survive these situations.\n\nFor example, if I recognized my mom was lashing out angrily, saying cruel things, I learned to keep quiet and make myself scarce, but a part of me believed my mother’s erratic behavior was triggered by me being a bad little boy.\n\nThis is a reasonable response to what seemed like a threatening situation as a boy. But as an adult, I have a job that often leads me into conflict with people.\n\nHonorable people disagree, but sometimes, especially behind the veil of social media, unkind things are said and feelings are hurt. My reaction is often to either withdraw or lash out.\n\nAnd always there is a rush of self-loathing, assuming that I am still a bad person because of the flawed schema I developed under a now outdated set of circumstances.\n\nSuch self deprecation is not particularly helpful in fostering productive, civil dialogue.\n\nSo while I hope TMS has given me a long-term break from major depression, I still have plenty of mental health work to do with my talk therapist.\n\nFor example, when I was a boy, I often felt uneasy or nervous. My parents quelled this disquiet by giving me toys or taking me out to dinner at a fast food restaurant.\n\nSo the schema my brain built included thinking that the way to feel safe and loved is to buy things and eat. And, to a degree, that still works in that I get a serotonin rush from a buying spree or a food binge.\n\nBut it is not a particularly effective way to live as an adult because it drains my bank account and expands my waistline.\n\nThe work I’m doing with my talk therapist now is focused on building new schema. My therapist said you can’t remove an old schema. You can only create new ones.\n\nThis all seems rather technical, but the brain is a complicated organ. And I like that my medical team explains the science to me.\n\nKnowledge is power. I like the idea that I can take more control of how I think by understanding why I think that way.\n\nThere are still bad days. An incident arose just the other evening that had me on the phone with my therapist for a half hour.\n\nI was in a loop thinking I was a bad person. The truth was, I had run into an old thinking pattern triggered by a current conflict.\n\nI was somewhat downtrodden that I was still struggling with these same kinds of thinking errors, but my therapist reminded me that I’m getting better at catching these moments when thoughts start with a relatively minor incident and then increase in awfulness until I’m nearly panicked.\n\nAnd he reminded me that now that my brain chemistry is under better control, I can more freely work on better thinking.\n\nThat is very good news … I think.\n\nFRIDAY, NOV. 20, 2015\n\nGIVING THANKS\n\nThanksgiving is associated with overeating more than any other holiday.\n\nAnd why not? Such a bounty of delights: turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, scalloped potatoes, sweet potatoes, cranberry sauce, green bean casseroles, pumpkin pies, pecan pies and, for the sadistic, mincemeat pies, and, of course, delicious gravy.\n\nMy mouth waters at the thought of a heaping plate with heavy dollops of everything and then some.\n\nBut I’m fighting morbid obesity. I’ve lost nearly 82 pounds since March. Nothing I could eat on Thanksgiving could undo all that work.\n\nStill, my journey is long. I have 220 pounds to go before I’m outside the obese range. Thanksgiving poses a challenge for which I have no good answer.\n\nI could attend a family event Wednesday night at my aunt and uncle’s Bondurant home. I could, as I did at my family’s annual July 4 celebration, map out what I was going to eat in advance and limit myself to that.\n\nI could stick to the green veggies and salad and skip the pie altogether. My family would understand. They’re a good family like that.\n\nI needn’t worry about them being uncomfortable at the chow line while I poke at a few slices of turkey, green beans and salad.\n\nNo, the problem is with me. I want to eat big and bad. And I don’t trust myself at the event. My family might remind me of my goals if I forget in a frenzy of pie, but I don’t want them to have to do that, either.\n\nWhat I want to do is feel confident enough to eat sensibly at Thanksgiving or any other day. And the truth is I just don’t right now.\n\nMy weight-loss efforts have been stagnant since fall began. Plateaus are commonplace in weight loss. This one seems too long to me.\n\nI have to admit my culpability in that. I eat out too often. Wings, which is fried food, are my kryptonite. I’ve indulged too often.\n\nMeanwhile, injuries and a general malaise have stymied my exercise efforts. I’ve lost my workout mojo. Some of it is just plain laziness. Some of it is a cramped schedule the past six weeks while I went through an intense new treatment for my chronic depression and anxiety issues.\n\nRegardless, I’m moving less and while I’m not necessarily eating more, I’m definitely not eating as well as I should be.\n\nSo this Thanksgiving, I’m taking a knee. I’m sitting it out. Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after Parents 1.0 died, and I will have a quiet dinner together Thanksgiving Day. My apologies to Uncle Larry and Aunt Sharon, but this year I’m won’t be at the table.\n\nThey’ll understand and I’m thankful for that.\n\nIn fact, despite recent foibles and the occasional unkind gripe from disgruntled rea", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/05/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/football/qatar-2022-world-cup-migrant-workers-human-rights-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Migrant workers helped build Qatar's World Cup tournament, now ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nKamal was standing outside a shop with other migrant workers, having finished yet another grueling working day, when he and – he says – a few others were arrested this August. Without explanation, the 24-year-old says he was put into a vehicle and, for the next week, kept in a Qatari jail, the location and name of which he does not know.\n\n“When they arrested me, I couldn’t say anything, not a single word, as I was so scared,” he told CNN Sport, speaking at home in southern Nepal where he has been working on a farm since being deported three months ago.\n\nKamal – CNN has changed the names of the Nepali workers to protect them from retaliation – is one of many migrant workers wanting to tell the world of their experiences in Qatar, a country that will this month host one of sport’s greatest, most lucrative, spectacles – the World Cup, a tournament which usually unites the world as millions watch the spectacular goals and carefully-choreographed celebrations.\n\nIt will be a historic event, the first World Cup to be held in the Middle East, but one also mired in controversy. Much of the build-up to this tournament has been on more sober matters, that of human rights, from the deaths of migrant workers and the conditions many have endured in Qatar, to LGBTQ and women’s rights.\n\nKamal says he has yet to be paid the 7,000 Qatari Riyal bonus (around $1,922) he says he is entitled to from his previous employers, nor 7,000 Riyal in insurance for injuring two fingers at work.\n\n“I wasn’t told why I was being arrested. People are just standing there … some are walking with their grocery [sic], some are just sitting there consuming tobacco products … they just arrest you,” he adds, before explaining he could not ask questions as he does not speak Arabic.\n\nA worker is seen inside the Lusail Stadium during a stadium tour on December 20, 2019, in Doha, Qatar. Francois Nel/Getty Images\n\nDescribing the conditions in the cell he shared with 24 other Nepali migrant workers, he says he was provided with a blanket and a pillow, but the mattress on the floor he had to sleep on was riddled with bed bugs.\n\n“Inside the jail, there were people from Sri Lanka, Kerala (India), Pakistan, Sudan, Nepal, African, Philippines. There were around 14-15 units. In one jail, there were around 250-300 people. Around 24-25 people per room,” he says.\n\n“When they take you to the jail, they don’t give you a room right away. They keep you in a veranda. After a day or two, once a room is empty, they keep people from one country in one room.”\n\nUsing a smuggled phone, he spoke to friends, one of whom, he says, brought his belongings – including his passport – to the jail, though he says he was sent home after the Nepali embassy had sent a paper copy of his passport to the jail. CNN has reached out to the embassy but has yet to receive a response.\n\n“When they put me on the flight, I started thinking: ‘Why are they sending workers back all of a sudden? It’s not one, two, 10 people … they are sending 150, 200, 300 workers on one flight,’” he says.\n\n“Some workers who were just roaming outside wearing (work) dress were sent back. They don’t even allow you to collect your clothes. They just send you back in the cloth you are wearing.”\n\nKamal believes he was arrested because he had a second job, which is illegal under Qatar’s 2004 Labour Law and allows authorities to cancel a worker’s work permit. He says he worked an extra two to four hours a day to supplement his income as he was not making enough money working six eight-hour days a week.\n\nQatar has a 90-day grace period in which a worker can remain in the country legally without another sponsor, but if they have not had their permit renewed or reactivated in that time they risk being arrested or deported for being undocumented.\n\nHe says he received paperwork upon his arrest, which Amnesty International says would likely have explained why he was being detained, but as it was in Arabic he did not know what it said and no translator was provided.\n\nLaborers rest in green space along the corniche in Doha, Qatar, on June 23. Christopher Pike/Bloomberg/Getty Images/FILE\n\nA Qatari government official told CNN in a statement: “Any claims that workers are being jailed or deported without explanation are untrue. Action is only taken in very specific cases, such as if an individual participates in violence.”\n\nThe official added that 97% of all eligible workers were covered by Qatar’s Wage Protection System, established in 2018, “which ensures wages are paid in full and on time.” Further work was being done to strengthen the system, the official said.\n\nSome workers never returned home\n\nWith the opening match just days away, on-the-pitch matters are a mere footnote because this tournament has come at a cost to workers who left their families in the belief that they would reap financial rewards in one of the world’s richest countries per capita. Some would never return home. None of the three Nepali workers CNN spoke to were richer for their experience. Indeed, they are in debt and full of melancholy.\n\nThe Guardian reported last year that 6,500 South Asian migrant workers have died in Qatar since the country was awarded the World Cup in 2010, most of whom were involved in low-wage, dangerous labor, often undertaken in extreme heat.\n\nThe report did not connect all 6,500 deaths with World Cup infrastructure projects and has not been independently verified by CNN.\n\nHassan Al Thawadi – the man in charge of leading Qatar’s preparations – told CNN’s Becky Anderson that the Guardian’s 6,500 figure was a “sensational headline” that was misleading and that the report lacked context.\n\nA government official told CNN there had been three work-related deaths on stadiums and 37 non-work-related deaths. In a statement, the official said the Guardian’s figures were “inaccurate” and “wildly misleading.”\n\n“The 6,500 figure takes the number of all foreign worker deaths in the country over a 10-year period and attributes it to the World Cup,” the official said. “This is not true and neglects all other causes of death including illness, old age and traffic accidents. It also fails to recognize that only 20% of foreign workers in Qatar are employed on construction sites.”\n\nIt has been widely reported that Qatar has spent $220 billion leading up to the tournament, which would make it the most expensive World Cup in history, though this likely includes infrastructure not directly associated with stadium construction. A spokesperson for the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) which, since its formation in 2011, has been responsible for overseeing the infrastructure projects and planning for the World Cup, told CNN that the tournament budget was $6.5 billion, without expanding on what that cost covered.\n\nEight new stadiums rose from the desert, and the Gulf state expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, rail and highways. All would have been constructed by migrant workers, who – according to Amnesty International – account for 90% of the workforce in a near-three million population.\n\nAn aerial view of Al Janoub stadium at sunrise on June 21 in Al Wakrah, Qatar. David Ramos/Getty Images\n\nSince 2010, migrant workers have faced delayed or unpaid wages, forced labor, long hours in hot weather, employer intimidation and an inability to leave their jobs because of the country’s sponsorship system, human rights organizations have found.\n\nHowever, the health, safety and dignity of “all workers employed on our projects has remained steadfast,” a statement from the SC read.\n\n“Our efforts have resulted in significant improvements in accommodation standards, health and safety regulations, grievance mechanisms, healthcare provision and reimbursements of illegal recruitment fees to workers.\n\n“While the journey is on-going, we are committed to delivering the legacy we promised. A legacy that improves lives and lays the foundation for fair, sustainable and lasting labour reforms.”\n\nLast year, in an interview with CNN Sport anchor Amanda Davies, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said that while “more needs to be done,” progress had been made.\n\n“I’ve seen the great evolution that has happened in Qatar, which was recognized – I mean not by FIFA – but by labor unions around the world, by international organizations,” said Infantino.\n\n‘It was difficult to breathe’\n\nWe are, unusually, writing about a World Cup in November because the competition had to be moved from its usual June-July slot to Qatar’s winter as the heat is so extreme in the country’s summer months – temperatures can reach around 43 degrees Celsius (109 degrees Fahrenheit) in June – that playing in such conditions could have posed a health risk to players.\n\nHari is 27 years old and, like many of his compatriots, left Nepal for Qatar as his family – he was one of five siblings with just his father at home – desperately needed money, primarily to eat. Since 2013, Nepal’s government-mandated minimum wage has been set at $74 a month, according to minimum-wage.org. He says that his monthly wage in Qatar was 700 Rial a month ($192).\n\nAfter moving to Qatar in 2014, he worked in four places during his four-year stay: at a supermarket, a hotel and airport, but the most difficult job, he says, was in construction when he had to carry tiles up buildings “six to seven stories above” in overbearing heat, plus lay pipelines in deep pits.\n\n“It was too hot,” he tells CNN. “The foreman was very demanding and used to complain a lot. The foreman used to threaten to reduce our salaries and overtime pay.\n\n“I had to carry tiles on my shoulder to the top. It was very difficult going up through the scaffolding. In the pipeline work, there were 5-7 meters deep pits, we had to lay the stones and concrete, it was difficult due to the heat. It was difficult to breathe. We had to come upstairs using a ladder to drink water.\n\n“It never happened to me, but I saw some workers fainting at work. I saw one Bengali, one Nepali … two to three people faint while working. They took the Bengali to medical services. I’m not sure what happened to him.”\n\nDuring his time in Qatar, government regulations generally prohibited workers from working outdoors between 11:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. from June 15 to August 31. He said one company he worked for followed these rules.\n\nHe added: “At some places, they didn’t have water. Some places, they didn’t provide us water on time. At some places, we used to go to houses nearby asking for water.”\n\nIn this photo taken in May 2015 during a government organized media tour, workers use heavy machinery at the Al-Wakra Stadium being built for the 2022 World Cup. Maya Alleruzzo/AP/FILE\n\nWorking long hours in extreme heat has, some non-governmental organizations believe, caused a number of deaths and put lives at risk in Qatar.\n\nIn 2019, research published in the Cardiology Journal, exploring the relationship between the deaths of more than 1,300 Nepali workers between 2009 and 2017 and heat exposure, found a “strong correlation” between heat stress and young workers dying of cardiovascular problems in the summer months.\n\nThe government official told CNN that there had been a “consistent decline” in the mortality rate of migrant workers, including a decline in heat stress disorders, “thanks in large part to our comprehensive heat stress legislation.”\n\n“Qatar has always acknowledged that work remains to be done, notably to hold unscrupulous employers to account,” the government official added. “Systemic reform does not happen overnight and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.”\n\n‘Heat does not typically injure on its own’\n\nNatasha Iskander, Professor of Urban Planning and Public Service at New York University, tells CNN that heat can kill “in ways that are confusing and unclear.”\n\n“Fatal heat stroke can look like a heart attack or a seizure. Sometimes, heat kills through the body, amplifying manageable and often silent conditions, like diabetes and hypertension, and turning them into sudden killers,” she explains.\n\n“As a result, Qatar, in the death certificates that it has issued after migrant construction workers have collapsed, has been able to push back against the correlation between heat stress and deaths and claim instead that the deaths are due to natural causes, even though the more proximate cause is work in the heat.”\n\nDetermining the number of workers injured by heat is even harder, she says, because many injuries may not become apparent until years later, when migrants have returned home and young men “find that their kidneys no longer function, that they suffer from chronic kidney disease, or that their hearts have begun to fail, displaying levels of cardiac weakness that are debilitating.”\n\n“Heat does not typically injure on its own,” she adds. “Workers are exposed to heat and heat dangers through the labor relations on Qatari worksites. The long hours, physically intense work, the forced overtime, the abusive conditions, the bullying on site all shape how exposed workers are to heat. Additionally, conditions beyond the worksite also augmented heat’s power to harm – things like poor sleep, insufficient nutrition or a room that was not cool enough to allow the body to reset after a day in the heat. In Qatar, the employer housed workers in labor camps, and workers as a matter of policy were segregated to industrial areas, where living accommodations were terrible.”\n\nForeign laborers working on the construction site of the Al-Wakrah football stadium, one of Qatar's 2022 World Cup stadiums, walk back to their accomodation at the Ezdan 40 compound after finishing work on May 4, 2015, in Doha's Al-Wakrah southern suburbs. Marwan Naamani/AFP/Getty Images/FILE\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, Qatari authorities have not investigated “thousands” of deaths of migrant workers over the past decade “despite evidence of links between premature deaths and unsafe working conditions.” That these deaths are not being recorded as work-related prevents families from receiving compensation, the advocacy group states.\n\nIn its statement, the SC said that its commitment to publicly disclose non-work-related deaths went beyond the requirements of the UK’s Health and Safety Executive Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences regulations (RIDDOR), which defines and provides classification for how to document work-related and non-work-related incidents.\n\nThe statement added: “The SC investigates all non-work-related deaths and work-related fatalities in line with our Incident Investigation Procedure to identify contributory factors and establish how they could have been prevented. This process involves evidence collection and analysis and witness interviews to establish the facts of the incident.”\n\nAmnesty International’s Ella Knight told CNN Sport that her organization would continue to push Qatar to “thoroughly investigate” deaths of migrant workers, including past deaths, to “ensure the families of the deceased have the opportunity to rebuild their lives.”\n\nBarun Ghimire is a human rights lawyer based in Kathmandu whose work focuses on the exploitation of Nepali migrants working abroad. He tells CNN that the families he advocates for have not received satisfactory information on their loved ones’ deaths. “Families send out healthy, young family member to work and they receive news that the family member died when they were sleeping,” he says. In a separate interview, he told CNN last year: “The Qatar World Cup is really the bloody cup – the blood of migrant workers.”\n\nLast year, Qatari legislation was strengthened regarding outdoor working conditions, expanding summertime working hours during which outdoor work is prohibited – replacing legislation introduced in 2007 – and additionally putting into law that “all work must stop if the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) raises beyond 32.1C (89.8F) in a particular workplace.” The regulations also mandate annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments.\n\n“We recognize that heat stress is a particular issue in the summer months in Qatar,” a Qatari government official said. “In May 2021, Qatar introduced a requirement for companies to conduct annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments to mitigate the dangers of heat stress. Companies are expected to adopt flexible, self-monitored working hours where possible, adjust shift rotations, enforce regular breaks, provide free cold drinking water and shaded workspaces, and adhere to all other guidelines with respect to heat stress outlined by the Ministry of Labour.\n\n“Every summer, Qatar’s labor inspectors carry out thousands of unannounced visits to work sites across the country to ensure that heat stress rules are being followed,” the official added. “Between June and September 2022, 382 work sites were ordered to close for violating the rules.”\n\nWorkers walk to the Lusail Stadium -- one of the 2022 Qatar World Cup stadiums -- in Lusail on December 20, 2019. Hassan Ammar/AP\n\nIskander said a heat point of 32.1C WBGT was “already dangerous.”\n\n“Working at the physical intensity that construction workers do in Qatar for any amount of time at that temperature is damaging to the body,” she explained.\n\n“The regulation relied on the assumption that workers would be able to self-pace and rest as needed whenever they experienced heat stress. Anyone who has ever spent any amount of time on a Qatari construction site knows that workers have no ability to self-pace.”\n\nKnight adds: “The fact investigations into migrant workers deaths are often not happening precludes the possibility of greater protections being implemented because if you don’t know what is really happening to these people how can you then implement and enforce effective measures to increase their protection?”\n\nFor the majority of his time in Qatar, Hari said he felt sad. He would watch planes take off during his six months tending the airport gardens and question why he was in the country. But he had paid 90,000 Nepali rupees ($685) to a Nepali recruitment company that facilitated his move. He was also told, he says, by the company he had joined that he would have had to pay 2,000 to 3,000 Riyal ($549-$823) to buy himself out of his contract.\n\nHis friends, he said, counseled him as he continued to work long, lonely days for, Hari says, not enough money to live and save for his family. Amnesty International says many migrants pay high fees to “unscrupulous recruitment agents in their home country” which make the workers scared to leave their jobs when they get to Qatar.\n\nNow, he is a father-of-two, and work is plowing fields in Nepal as a tractor driver, but Hari hopes one day to work abroad again, his heart set on Malaysia. “I don’t want my children to go through what I did. I want to build a house, buy some land. That’s what I am thinking. But let’s see what God has planned,” he says.\n\n‘Our dreams never came true’\n\nSunit has been back in Nepal since August after working just eight months in Qatar. He had expected to be there for two years, but the collapse of the construction company he worked for meant he and many others returned with money still owed to them, he says. He struggles to find work in Nepal, meaning feeding his two children and paying school fees is difficult.\n\nHe had dreamed of watching World Cup matches from the rooftop of the hotel he had helped build. One of the stadiums – the name of which he does not know – was a 10-minute walk from the hotel. “We used to talk about it,” he says of the World Cup. “But we had to return, and our dreams never came true. The stadium activities were visible from the hotel. We could see the stadium from the hotel rooftop.”\n\nIn helping construct the city center hotel, the name of which he doesn’t remember, he would carry bags of plaster mix and cement, weighing from 30 to 50 kilos, on his shoulders up to 10 to 12 floors, he says.\n\n“The lift was rarely functional. Some people couldn’t carry it and dropped it halfway. If you don’t finish your job, you were threatened saying the salary would be deducted for that day,” he says. “The foreman used to complain that we were taking water breaks as soon as we got to work. They used to threaten us saying: ‘We will not pay you for the day.’ We said: ‘Go ahead. We are humans, we need to drink water.’\n\n“It was very hot. It used to take 1.5 to two hours to get to the top. I used to get tired. I used to stop on the way. Then proceed again slowly. Yes, the supervisors used to yell at us. But what could we do?”\n\nHe says he had paid an agent in Nepal 240,000 Nepali rupees (around $1,840) before leaving for Qatar. He says he has filed a case with the police about the agent as he had been unable to fulfill his two-year contract, but there have been no developments. He says the owners of the company he worked for in Qatar were arrested because they did not pay laborers. The company did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment, neither did it respond to questions from the Business & Human Rights Centre, an advocacy group, about protests over unpaid wages.\n\nQatar has expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, and rail and highways over the last decade. Britta Pedersen/picture alliance/Getty Images\n\nFor a month, he says, he was in his accommodation with no work or money to buy food – he borrowed to eat – so he and his fellow workers called the police, who brought food with them.\n\n“The police came again after 10-15 days and said we have arrested the company people. (The police) distributed food again,” he says. “They told us the company has collapsed and the government will send all the workers back home.”\n\n“I’m extremely sad,” he adds. “I mean, it is what it is. Nothing would change by regretting it. I get mad (at the company) but what can I do? Even if I had tried to fight back, it would have been my loss.”\n\nThe SC said it has established what it claims is a “first-of-its-kind” Workers’ Welfare Forum, which it said allowed workers to elect a representative on their behalf and, when companies failed to comply with the WWF, it steps in, demands better and alerts the authorities.\n\nSince 2016, the SC said 69 contractors had been demobilized, 235 contractors placed on a watch list and a further seven blacklisted. “We understand there is always room for improvement,” the statement added.\n\n‘Expertise and heroism’\n\nQatar, a peninsula smaller than Connecticut and the smallest World Cup host in history, is set to host an estimated 1.5 million fans over the month-long tournament, which begins on November 20. There are already reports of accommodation concerns for such a vast number of visitors.\n\nThe spotlight is no doubt on this Gulf state, as has progressively been the case since it was controversially awarded the tournament over a decade ago – though Qatari officials have previously “strongly denied” to CNN the allegations of bribery which has surrounded its bid.\n\nSuch attention has brought about reforms, significantly dismantling the Kafala system which gives companies and private citizens control over migrant workers’ employment and immigration status.\n\nIn Qatar, migrant workers can now change jobs freely without permission from their employer. But Knight adds: “Another aspect of the Kafala system, the criminal charge of absconding still exists, and this, along with other tools that are still available to employers, means that, fundamentally, the power balance between workers and employers, the imbalance remains great.”\n\nKnight says unpaid wages is still an issue as the wage protection system “lacks enforcement mechanisms,” while she also says employers can cancel a worker’s ID at a “push of a button,” meaning they risk arrest and deportation. Additionally, labor committees intended to help workers are under-resourced and “lack the capacity to deal with the number of cases that are coming to them.”\n\nMigrant laborers work at a construction site at the Aspire Zone in Doha on March 26, 2016. Naseem Zeitoon/Reuters/FILE\n\nGhimire agrees that there have been a few positive changes to employment laws but adds that it is “more show and tell.”\n\n“Many workers who work in construction are untouched, so there’s still exploitation going on,” he tells CNN.\n\nQatar’s government official told CNN work remained to be done but that “systemic reform does not happen overnight, and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.\n\n“Over the last decade, Qatar has done more than any other country in the region to strengthen the rights of foreign workers, and we will continue to work in close consultation with international partners to strengthen reforms and enforcement.”\n\nHuman Rights Watch’s #PayUpFIFA campaign wants Qatar and FIFA to pay at least $440 million – an amount equal to the prize money being awarded at the World Cup – to the families of migrant workers who have been harmed or killed in preparation for the tournament.\n\nFamilies of workers who have died face uncertain futures, HRW says, especially children. Those who survived and returned home, cheated of wages or injured, remain trapped in debt, it says, “with dire consequences for their families.”\n\nGhimire says compensation is key, but so too is making the world aware of what has taken place to make this tournament happen.\n\n“People are concerned about clothing brands, and the meat they eat, but what about mega events? Isn’t it time we ask how this was possible?” he asks.\n\n“Everyone who will watch should know at what cost this was even possible and how workers were treated. Players should know, sponsors should know.\n\n“Would it be the same situation if it was European workers dying in Qatar? If it was Argentinean workers, would Argentina be concerned about playing?\n\n“Because it’s migrant workers from poor south Asian countries, they’re invisible people. Forced labor, death of workers, while making a World Cup is unacceptable. As a football fan, it makes me sad; as a lawyer, it makes me really disappointed.”\n\nEarlier this month, Qatar’s Labor Minister Ali bin Samikh Al Marri rejected the prospect of a remedy fund.\n\nA Qatar government official said the country’s Workers’ Support and Insurance Fund was “effective in providing compensation for workers and their families” with the fund reimbursing workers with more than $350 million so far this year.\n\nIn terms of the SC’s efforts to ensure repayment of recruitment fees, as of December 2021, workers have received $22.6 million, with an additional $5.7 million committed by contractors, according to FIFA.\n\nLast month, FIFA’s Deputy Secretary General Alasdair Bell said “compensation is certainly something that we’re interested in progressing.”\n\nA general view shows the exterior of the Al-Thumama Stadium in Doha -- one of eight stadiums that will host World Cup matches KARIM JAAFAR/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIt has been widely reported that FIFA has urged nations participating in the World Cup to focus on football when the tournament kicks off.\n\nFIFA confirmed to CNN that a letter signed by FIFA President Gianni Infantino and the governing body’s secretary general Fatma Samoura was sent out on November 3 to the 32 nations participating in the global showpiece but would not divulge the contents. However, a number of European federations have issued a joint statement saying they would campaign at the tournament on human rights and for a migrant workers center and a compensation fund for migrant workers.\n\nThe motto for Qatar’s bid team in 2010 was ‘Expect Amazing.’ In many ways, this year’s World Cup has replicated that maxim.\n\nAs NYU’s Iskander says: “One of the things that is not really covered in the coverage of the World Cup and the coverage of this enormous construction boom is the expertise and heroism of the workers who built it.\n\n“They built buildings that were unimaginable to everyone, including the engineers and designers, until they were built. They performed acts of bravery that are unsung. They operated at levels of technical complexity and sophistication that are unparalleled. And yet their contribution to building the World Cup is really rarely featured, downplayed.\n\n“They are represented, generally speaking, as exploited and oppressed. And it’s true that they have been exploited and oppressed, but they are also the master craftsmen that built this Cup, and they are enormously proud of what they have built.”\n\nHosting this tournament has undoubtedly put Qatar under the global spotlight. The question is whether the world can enjoy watching what the migrant workers built, knowing the true cost of this billion-dollar extravaganza.", "authors": ["Aimee Lewis Pramod Acharya Sugam Pokharel", "Aimee Lewis", "Pramod Acharya", "Sugam Pokharel"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}]}

It was open to the public — a last ditch effort to encourage voters to caucus for the third party.\n\nIowa Libertarians earned enough support in 2022 to qualify as an official state political party for the 2024 election. Their candidate for president must take home at least 2% in the general election for the state party to keep its status. The Libertarian Party of Iowa will hold caucuses across the state at 6:30 p.m. Monday.\n\n\"Stop wasting your vote. If you are voting for someone that does not represent your principles and your ethics and your values, you are wasting your vote,\" ter Maat said to the near-empty pizzeria.\n\n\"I don't want to hear anybody tell me, 'Hey, these Republicans care about out liberties,'\" Smith said. \"No they don't. They are not our friends. They don't care about our values or morals. They don't care about the individual sovereignty of your own body. All they care about is money.\"\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nBut the wiggle-room that the candidates searched for in undecided voters doesn't seem to be there in this caucus cycle. A new Des Moines Register/NBC News/Mediacom Iowa Poll shows that most Iowa Republican caucusgoers decided on a candidate and stuck with their choice, even as the field has shifted and narrowed.\n\nOnly 2% of likely Republican caucusgoers indicated that none of their party's frontrunners would be their first choice for president. Five percent were unsure.\n\nBut if former President Donald Trump were to become the Republican nominee in November, 8% of likely Republican caucusgoers said they would vote for a third-party candidate other than Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is running as an Independent. Three percent were not sure who they'd vote for.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Donald Trump is not the savior of this nation,\" Oliver said. \"Who else do you have on the stage? You have Nikki Haley, Dick Cheney in a dress. Vivek? Vi-fake. He's not a really a Libertarian.\"\n\nStill, it was the first time that many Iowans could've heard the candidates speak in person before the caucus. Of the candidates, only Oliver spoke at the Des Moines Register's Soapbox in August. ter Maat's campaign website hasn't listed him visiting the state since he gave a speech at the Iowa Libertarians' annual convention in April, and Mapstead told the Register that the debate was his first appearance in Iowa. Smith, a resident of Iowa, has only made three appearances leading up to caucus night, according to his campaign's site — none in Iowa.\n\nMore:Here's when the Iowa Caucuses start, how they work, who can participate, where to go\n\nCandidates united on shutdowns, vaccines\n\nEach candidate took the opportunity to decry COVID lockdowns and the various stay-at-home orders that were enacted over the course of the pandemic. Smith argued that everyone who initiated shutdowns should be tried for crimes against humanity.\n\nter Maat echoed Smith, but focused on his issue with the COVID vaccine. He asked the audience to imagine a perfect vaccine, one that has a 100% survival rate if taken and a 100% mortality rate if not.\n\n\"In such an example, would the government have the right to tell you you have to take this vaccine? Absolutely not,\" he said. \"I don't give a damn how good their science might ever be. We need a complete separation of science from the state in this country.\"\n\nUnited States' military presence should be lessened, candidates say\n\nWhen asked about how the next administration should respond to foreign policy and security issues, Oliver took stance against selling arms to other countries and offering aid. He suggested the United States offer refuge to peaceful Ukrainians instead of weapons.\n\nMapstead also spoke against inserting the United States military in outside conflicts, stating that it should only be used for America's defense.\n\n\"We don't like when our government puts their authority onto us. Imagine how other countries feel when America projects its authority onto them,\" Mapstead said.\n\nFarmers are better off without incentives, candidates say\n\nOliver called for taking taxpayer money out of agriculture and rolling back subsidies for farmers, arguing that a free market will bring more stability to the marketplace.\n\n\"You should be able to grow what's going to provide you money and provide prosperity, not government handouts,\" he said.\n\nJoshua joined him, adding that farmers would have more luck without government oversight.\n\n\"The truth is, the farmers in Iowa would be a lot better off if the government would step out of the way and let them sell their products like they would at a Saturday farmers' market,\" he said. \"The government should not have a hand in the farming industry in the United States, period.\"\n\nAddison Lathers covers growth and development for the Des Moines metro.

Another 39.4% plan to vote in person on Election Day (vs. 33.4% in 2016), and 37.6% plan to vote in-person during the early voting period (vs. 61.8% in 2016).\n\nThe survey shows relatively strong support for minor party candidates that could decide who wins the races for U.S. Senate and president in this state, said David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center. These candidates take votes that otherwise might go to the Democratic and Republican candidates.\n\n“Libertarian is the key choice, that was the other takeaway from the poll,” Paleologos said, noting that the Libertarian Party’s U.S. Senate candidate was chosen by nearly 6% of the voters surveyed. More than 5% of those surveyed picked third-party candidates for president.\n\nLibertarian and other minor-party candidates kept the winners below 50% in North Carolina in 2014’s U.S. Senate race and in the state’s elections for president and governor in 2016.\n\nFor example, in 2014 Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis won his first Senate election with 48.82% of the vote while Libertarian Sean Haugh was marked on 3.74% of the ballots. Minor party candidates received 4% of North Carolina’s votes for president in 2016.\n\nMore:NC is ‘Ground zero’ in 2020 election: Breaking down state's top races\n\nCOVID vaccine\n\nThe survey found mixed opinions about a vaccine for the coronavirus.\n\nIt says 71.6% would take it — 20.6% as soon as they could, and 51% after other people took it first. Meanwhile, 24% said they would not get the vaccine, and 4.4% were undecided.\n\nThe numbers change if the government would require people to take the drug.\n\nIn that case, 48.8% said they would, 42.2% said they would not. The rest were undecided or refused to say.\n\nMost of the four-day survey was conducted prior to Democratic candidate Cal Cunningham’s comment on Monday evening that he would be hesitant to take the vaccine. Cunningham said because he fears political corruption in Washington could affect whether the vaccine is approved before it’s proven to be safe and effective.\n\nHis opponent, Republican incumbent Sen. Thom Tillis, said he trusts the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) vetting process and he would take the vaccine after people who need it more than he does, such as medical care personnel and people with underlying health conditions, get it first.\n\nMore:As Trump crisscrosses North Carolina, where are the Democrats?\n\nPresidential race\n\nThe survey has Biden ahead in North Carolina, but his lead is within the poll's 4.4% margin of error, Paleologos said.\n\nBiden led Trump 46.2% to 42.80%. Libertarian Jo Jorgensen drew 4.8%. Other candidates attracted 0.6%.\n\nAnother 4.2% of the voters were undecided and 1.4% wouldn’t say who they plan to vote for.\n\nWhen asked about Trump’s performance as president, 42.8% of the voters said they approve, while 53.4% disapproved. The voters’ assessment of Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic was 37% positive, 61.6% negative.\n\nBiden’s favorability rating was 48% favorable, 45.8% unfavorable. Trump’s was 40.8% favorable, 54.2% unfavorable.\n\nU.S. Senate race\n\nDemocrat Cunningham was ahead of Republican Tillis but 11% of the voters remain undecided, Paleologos said.\n\nThe findings: 41.6% picked Cunningham, 37.8% picked Tillis, 5.8% picked Libertarian Shannon Bray, 1.6% picked Constitution Party candidate Kevin E. Hayes, and 1.8% picked someone else.\n\nGovernor\n\nDemocratic Gov. Roy Cooper is so far ahead of Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Forest in the governor’s race that he is most likely to win, Paleologos said.\n\nCooper led Forest 50.40% to 38%. Libertarian Stephen DiFiore II drew 4.6% and Constitution Party candidate Al Pisano attracted 0.6%.\n\nAnother 5.80% said they were undecided, and 0.20% picked someone else.\n\nVoter excitement\n\nThirty-eight percent of those surveyed said they are excited about voting this year, while 44.4% said they are voting because they are alarmed.\n\nThe survey suggests that a person’s political party may correlate to how they feel about voting, with 35% of Democrats saying they are excited about voting, while 53% feel alarmed. Meanwhile, 50% of Republicans said they were excited, and 34% said they were alarmed.\n\nAmong voters picking Trump for president, 49% reported being excited, while 34% were alarmed. At the same time, 33% of Biden supporters said they are excited, while 53% said they are alarmed.\n\nBiden has a challenge, Paleologos said, in getting voters energized to vote for him vs. voting because they don’t like the president.\n\nKey issues\n\nRepublicans prioritized jobs and the economy (33%) over COVID-19 (7%), while Democrats prioritized COVID-19 (32%) over the economy (10%).\n\nOther findings:\n\n60.2%, said the country is on the wrong track; 27.6% said it’s on the right track.\n\n38.2% said the North Carolina economy is in good to excellent condition, while 60.4% said it’s in fair to poor shape.\n\n52.8% of the voters said they are better off than they were four years ago, while 28.4% said they were worse off and 17.4% said they saw no difference.\n\nPaul Woolverton can be reached at pwoolverton@fayobserver.com or 910-261-4710.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/09/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/03/04/super-tuesday-what-to-know-about-the-california-primary-election/72808425007/", "title": "Super Tuesday: What to know about the California primary election", "text": "Tuesday is the last chance California voters have to cast ballots in the presidential primary as they help choose local, state and national leaders.\n\nThe Golden State and 14 others will hold their primaries and caucuses on Super Tuesday, the day millions of Americans vote to decide who will face off in November for the nation's top office. This year, former President Donald Trump is the front-runner in the Republican race. Incumbent President Joe Biden is expected to be the Democratic nominee.\n\nBut other local, state and federal races have crowded fields. In some, voters also will pick who goes on to the general election. In others, they could choose a final winner. Here's what to know about Super Tuesday in Ventura County.\n\n1. How 'no party preference’ voters can cast a ballot in presidential primaries\n\nIn California, the Democratic, American Independent and Libertarian parties allow people registered as “no party preference” to vote for a presidential candidate. But they need to request a ballot from one of those parties to do so.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nTo cast a ballot for Republican, Green or Peace and Freedom presidential candidates, they have to re-register.\n\nEligible voters can fill out a registration form and a ballot at the same time in person. The conditional voter's ballot is placed in a different envelope, allowing staff to review the information to make sure the person is eligible to vote before it is counted.\n\n2. Senate race may draw voters\n\nVoters will be asked to choose a candidate to fill the late-Dianne Feinstein's seat in the U.S. Senate. Feinstein held the seat for 30 years until her death in September at the age of 90.\n\nVoters will be asked to vote on two Senate race options on their March primary ballots — one for the remainder of Feinstein's term ending Jan. 3, 2025, and the other for a full six-year term ending 2031.\n\nThe top four candidates in the primary are Democratic Reps. Adam Schiff, Barbara Lee and Katie Porter, and Republican former baseball star Steve Garvey.\n\n3. County races could be decided\n\nThree candidates will face off in each of two competitive races for a seat on the Ventura County Board of Supervisors.\n\nIncumbent Kelly Long faces challengers Kim Marra Stephenson and Heather Schmidt in District 3. Incumbent Matt LaVere faces challengers Philip Fields and Jeff Ketelsen in District 1. If no candidate captures more than 50% of the vote, the seats will go to a runoff in November.\n\nSupervisor Vianey Lopez is running unopposed in District 5.\n\n4. How to vote\n\nHere's how to cast a ballot on Tuesday in Ventura County.\n\nIn person at one of the county's 52 voting centers. They will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.\n\nBy mail as long as it is postmarked by Tuesday.\n\nDrop it off by 8 p.m. Tuesday at an official drop box.\n\nDrop it off at in-person at a voting center.\n\nVoters can track their ballot to see when it is received and counted by signing up at california.ballottrax.net/voter.\n\n5. When and where to find primary election results\n\nInitial results are expected to be released shortly after the polls close at 8 p.m. Tuesday, according to the county elections division.\n\nThat first batch of votes likely will include ballots cast in person, picked up from county drop boxes or returned by mail through the weekend.\n\nOn election night, staff will count ballots cast in person on Tuesday. After the initial results, updates are expected roughly every hour starting around 10 p.m. until those in-person votes are completed. Then, the next update is expected on Thursday, officials said.\n\nMore information is available at venturavote.org.

It's ...", "text": "Thomas Knapp\n\nPalm Beach Post\n\nIn presidential election years, the Libertarian Party holds its national convention over Memorial Day Weekend. I returned home from my ninth such convention yesterday.\n\nDonald Trump and RFK Jr. spoke at our convention. You've probably heard about that.\n\nWe chose a presidential ticket: Chase Oliver and Mike ter Maat. You may have heard about that as well.\n\nUnless you were actually there, or watched and paid very close attention on C-SPAN, though, you probably didn't notice some of the ways in which a Libertarian National Convention differs from the way the \"Big Two\" parties do business.\n\nThe \"Big Two\" conventions aren't really conventions. They're campaign commercials.\n\nDemocratic and Republican delegates know who their presidential candidate is long before they arrive, because they are (for the most part) \"bound\" delegates. They're required to vote for the candidate who won their states' primaries and caucuses.\n\nDemocratic and Republican delegates know who their vice-presidential candidate is because their presidential candidate tells them who he or she wants. They then cast a ceremonial vote to approve.\n\nPreviously from Thomas Knapp:In Ukraine, don't look to pols for peace\n\nDemocratic and Republican delegates generally ratify the platform and bylaws presented to them by insider-dominated party committees. They don't HAVE to agree, but once again it's pretty much just ritual.\n\nLibertarian Party convention delegates — around a thousand of them, plus alternates — sit in a crowded room for several days actually making decisions. On Sunday, business commenced at 9 a.m. and wrapped up well after midnight.\n\nOur delegates are \"unbound\" and free to vote for the presidential and vice-presidential candidates we find most persuasive. Many of us arrive at the convention undecided and choose a candidate who's actually talked not just TO us but WITH us. It often takes several rounds of balloting to choose. This year, we voted seven times, eliminating candidates with the fewest votes, before Chase Oliver received a majority vote for president. It took two ballots to choose Mike ter Maat for the veep slot.\n\nMore from Thomas Knapp:Elizabeth Warren needs to get her government fingers out of my sandwich\n\nWe also choose our chair, other officers, and national committee at the convention. Those races are also often as hotly contested as the presidential race.\n\nAnd we actually debate our platform and bylaws changes.\n\nOur convention is fun, but it's neither a campaign commercial nor a series of cocktail parties and bar crawls. It's work. It's HARD work. It's IMPORTANT work. For some, it's heartbreaking work, followed by a difficult process of trying to hug it out and move on.\n\nWhy bother? Because every person in that room loves freedom, hates tyranny, and wants to offer Americans — including you — a chance to enthusiastically vote for what they love most, maybe for the first time, instead of reluctantly voting, yet again, against whomever they fear most.\n\nThat's what we accomplished.\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nThomas L.

He beat out independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and former President Donald Trump, who had both vied for the nomination. The nomination came late Sunday after a riotous convention that saw delegates swearing at one another and throwing punches, according to POLITICO. It took days of infighting and seven rounds of voting to nominate Oliver, who garnered more than 60% of the delegates’ votes.\n\nRFK Jr. was knocked out during the first round after receiving 2% of the vote, likely a surprise for the name brand politician who built much of his 2024 campaign with libertarian ideals in mind. Trump didn’t fare much better. He faced a jeering crowd at the convention on Saturday when he made his pitch for their nomination.Oliver emerged unscathed by comparison, urging party members after the vote to “unify and move forward for liberty.”\n\nWhat issues matter to you?Here's what Georgia Republicans and Democrats think you should care about\n\nOliver’s political experience\n\nThe 38-year-old, who was born in Nashville, Tennessee, has been involved with Georgia politics for several years. On his campaign site, he credits his opposition to the Iraq War with inspiring his political activism. He left the Democratic Party and became a Libertarian in 2010, after feeling disillusioned with former President Barack Obama’s decision to continue the Iraq War.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nIn 2020, he made an unsuccessful bid for Congress in Georgia’s 5th district to finish the late Sen. John Lewis’ term.\n\nBut he is perhaps best known for his 2022 campaign for U.S. Senate. After securing the Libertarian nomination, Oliver ran against incumbent Democrat Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker in a hotly-contested race.\n\nOliver received 2% of the vote on election day. Since neither Warnock or Walker secured 50% of the vote, Oliver’s critics accused him of being a spoiler vote and causing the lengthy run-off between the Democrat and Republican. He denied being a spoiler on the Politically Georgia podcast, saying of the two-party system, “You can’t spoil something that’s already rotten.”\n\nLater that month, Rolling Stone magazine would name him “the most influential Libertarian in America.”\n\nOliver’s platform\n\nIn an interview with The Gazette, Oliver described himself as a “pro-gun, pro-police reform, pro-choice Libertarian” who is “armed and gay.”\n\nHis campaign lists immigration reform, ending police immunity and the war on drugs, and abolishing the death penalty as top priorities. He also wants to end military support of Israel and Ukraine.\n\nAmong his more controversial positions: abolishing the Department of Education.\n\nOliver said, “At the federal level, the best policy on education is to remove the federal government’s involvement in education. I support abolishing the Department of Education and block granting those funds back to states to be returned to taxpayers.”\n\nHis position on abortion echoes that of the official Libertarian Party platform, calling the issue complex and asserting that there can be “good faith positions on both sides of the abortion debate.”\n\nHe plans to “work to encourage states to decriminalize abortions, as these decisions should rest in the hands of individuals and their doctors.”\n\nOliver would nevertheless encourage the passing of the Hyde Amendment, which would prevent any federal dollars going toward abortion clinics and their wide-ranging services. He says he would also encourage states to incentivize adoption by decreasing the overall cost, which he claims can range between $25,000 to $45,000 per state.\n\nPresidential debate:The first Biden-Trump debate will be in Atlanta, a city rich with political drama\n\nWhat has Oliver said about Trump and Biden?\n\nOliver hasn’t been shy about attacking his Republican and Democratic opponents.\n\nIn previous interviews, he called Biden and Trump \"two 80-year-old decrepit, old-party machine people, who are going to be spouting the same lines and the same mudslinging that they do every four years.”\n\nHe got into more specifics during an interview on The Unknowns podcast. Oliver said Trump’s weakest point was that he “initiated the COVID spending, the COVID lockdowns, these kinds of draconian policies that eliminated millions of small businesses in this country that have not come back. And while doing that, blew up the debt and deficit.”He also pointed to Trump’s immigration policy, saying that it “led to the human rights abuses that we're still seeing south of the border.”\n\nOliver’s criticism of Biden primarily hinged on unfulfilled campaign promises: “It's the fact that he ran against all of these policies of Donald Trump, his protectionist policies, where [Biden has] literally doubled and tripled down... .”\n\nHe highlighted Biden’s increase of Chinese tariffs, government spending, and continued use of Trump’s immigration policies through his presidency.\n\nOliver will be making his longshot bid for the White House alongside his running mate, former Florida police officer Mike ter Maat.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/05/26/donald-trump-libertarians-booed-convention/73844041007/", "title": "Donald Trump asked Libertarian voters for their support. He was ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – Former President Donald Trump spent his weekend proposing \"a partnership\" with the Libertarian Party, but early indications suggest it won't be a close friendship.\n\nLibertarians attending their convention in Washington booed and hooted at Trump, even as he pledged to pursue policies limiting the federal government and argued that supporting third parties could undermine common efforts to unseat President Joe Biden.\n\n\"Combine with us - you have to combine with us,\" Trump said at one point, drawing objections from many of the 1,500 Libertarians gathered in a hotel ballroom in the nation's capital.\n\n'Maybe you don't want to win'\n\nAs friction built, Trump during his speech taunted the party about its low totals and said they only way they can accomplish anything is by supporting him.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n\"Only if you want to win,\" Trump said at one point, as large segments of the crowd booed. \"Maybe you don't want to win.\"\n\nFour years ago, Libertarian presidential nominee Jo Jorgensen took only 1.2% of the vote against Trump and Biden. But even that small a percentage could make the difference in closely contested battleground states that are likely to determine the outcome of the 2024 race for the White House. That's why Trump is seeking support from the party as the campaign heats up.\n\nBut the former president, who sometimes speaks more than 90 minutes at his political rallies, wrapped up his remarks before the Libertarian conference in 35 minutes as he received criticism from the crowd.\n\nSome speakers at the Libertarian convention urged delegates to be respectful of Trump, although most took shots at the former president.\n\n\"We have a lot to teach Donald Trump,\" Michael Rectenwald, who is seeking the Libertarian Party presidential nomination. \"We don't know if he has any capacity to learn.\"\n\nDonald Trump promises pardons\n\nBut how did Trump try to court these third-party voters? In seeking support, Trump pledged to appoint a Libertarian Party member to his next Cabinet, and name other Libertarians to high government posts.\n\nHe also promised to commute the lifetime prison sentence of entrepreneur Ross Ulbricht. He created the website Silk Road, which facilitated sales of narcotics and other substances that Libertarians believe shouldn't be illegal in the first place.\n\nTrump also played to the crowd by again pledging to pardon defendants involved in the insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nHowever, delegates at the convention, many of whom waved blue signs saying \"Free Ross,\" noted that Trump said nothing about pardons for two others: Wikileaks founder Julian Assange and classified information leaker Edward Snowden.\n\nNot committed enough?\n\nTrump's raucous speech capped a noisy weekend in which Libertarian Party conventioneers repeatedly expressed disdain for the ex-president.\n\nStill, the presumptive nominee asked the Libertarians for their endorsement, a \"partnership,\" or at least \"a lot of your votes.\"\n\nLibertarian Party members later indicated that they will stick with their own nominee, who is scheduled to be selected on Sunday.\n\nMany voters at the convention told USA TODAY Trump's promises simply didn't win them over. Some pointed out that while Trump pledged to restrict government, he did not respond to long-time Libertarian calls for outright elimination of the Federal Reserve, foreign aid and the income tax.\n\n\"He has some libertarian leanings,\" said Charlie Larkin, 48, a self-employed worker from Aphol, Massachusetts. \"But I don't feel he's committed enough to the ideals of liberty.\"\n\nBefore and after his speech, libertarians also criticized Trump on issues ranging from tariffs to his indictments in four major criminal cases.\n\nSome delegates said they were offended when Trump – who claimed without evidence that prosecutors are politically motivated – said he should be something of an honorary Libertarian because of his indictments.\n\nThe former president spoke ahead of a week that may see the end of his hush money trial in New York City. Prosecutors and defense attorneys are expected to make final arguments on Tuesday, and the jury could decide the case later in the week.\n\nBut Trump's effort to tie his criminal charges to Libertarians' treatment of the federal government didn't necessarily curry favor with convention attendees over the weekend.\n\nTension in the hall\n\nThe tensions surrounding Trump's speech were even apparent beforehand.\n\nOn Friday night, a Libertarian delegate made a formal motion insulting the former president. Members of the crowd cheered, though the resolution wasn't allowed.\n\nDelegates also booed businessman Vivek Ramaswamy as he tried to defend Trump. But the strife didn't end there.\n\nHours before Trump's speech, groups of his Republican supporters from the Washington area showed up and took some of close-in seats that had been reserved for libertarian delegates,\n\nAngela McArdle, the newly reelected chair of the Libertarian Party, asked the Trump supporters to move farther back and give the delegates their chairs; she also urged the factions to exhibit \"camaraderie,\" and said \"we should focus on our areas of agreement.\"\n\nBut at times, the Trump people and the libertarians engaged in dueling chants.\n\nLibertarians and Trump\n\nThe party's website says that \"libertarians strongly oppose any government interference into their personal, family, and business decisions. Essentially, we believe all Americans should be free to live their lives and pursue their interests as they see fit as long as they do no harm to another.\"\n\nOutside the convention ballroom, vendors hawked posters, books and knick-knacks extolling various libertarian causes, from attacks on COVID vaccines to free trade to eliminating the Federal Reserve. Libertarian voters also told USA TODAY they oppose many of Trump's policies, including tariffs on foreign imports, increased spending and his previous comments about to using power to investigate opponents.\n\nIn his speech, Trump said their common desire to defeat Biden should outweigh their differences. \"The fact is we should not be fighting each other,\" Trump said.\n\nAmanda Gibbs, 40, a Libertarian Party member from the Houston area, said she is a former Republican who could not abide his \"government overreach\" and \"how he treated women,\" among other issues.\n\n\"He is what drove me out of the GOP,\" she said. \"That's how I found the Libertarian Party.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/frank-daniels/2016/10/21/libertarian-johnson-offers-best-hope-americas-future/92440480/", "title": "Libertarian Johnson offers best hope for America's future", "text": "Frank Daniels III\n\nfdanielsiii@tennessean.com\n\n“If you always do what you’ve always done, what makes you think that you are going to get something different from what you’ve always gotten.”\n\nThe 2016 presidential election is the ultimate posing of this rhetorical question.\n\nLibertarian Party presidential nominee Gary Johnson is the choice for Americans who want to make our government work for us, and not for the political class. He is the best choice to get something different from what we’ve been getting, and give America’s government back to the people.\n\nJohnson’s rhetoric is far more measured than the other two candidates who appear on every presidential ballot in the United States, Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump, and has consequently gotten little national media interest.\n\nExperience\n\nBut Johnson, the former governor of New Mexico, is the epitome of a man who lets his actions speak, not his boasts.\n\n“Fixing America is not an insurmountable task. It's actually about putting people first rather than politics. I wouldn't be involved in this if I didn't think that we can make a difference, and that it is easy, it's really easy to be principled and put the issues first and politics last.”\n\nUnlike Clinton or Trump, Johnson has run the executive branch of government, and did it well enough to win re-election by a substantial margin. He did it as a Republican governor in a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than a 2-1 margin.\n\nHe was elected on a campaign of “a common sense business approach” to government, with promises to cut the growth of government spending, reduce taxes, increase jobs, and, of course, law and order.\n\nOnce he was elected, Johnson executed his promises by using his veto power – he vetoed 47 percent of the bills that reached his desk, and exercised line-item veto power on almost every bill he signed.\n\n“I may have vetoed more legislation than the other forty-nine governors in the country combined,” Johnson said in 2011. “And it wasn't just saying, \"no,\" it was really looking at what we were spending our money on and what we were getting for the money we were spending.\n\n“I really do believe in smaller government, I really believe that there are consequences of legislation that gets passed and maybe it isn't in our best interest to pass all the legislation that we pass, that it layers bureaucracy on transactions that aren't made any safer...”\n\nBuilding a business\n\nWhile he was student at the University of New Mexico, he worked as a self-employed handyman, going door-to-door looking for jobs. He graduated with a degree in political science in 1975, and launched his construction company, Big J Enterprises. He was the sole employee.\n\nIt did not remain a one-man operation, eventually employing as many as 1,000 workers. He sold it in 1999.\n\nPersonal toughness\n\nWatching Johnson give an interview, or talking with him on the phone, you are likely struck by how unassuming he is. He looks goofy, and does not attempt to dominate a room with bluster, haughty demeanor, or bullying postures.\n\nBut do not mistake his modest behavior for a lack of toughness.\n\nNo candidate in this race, perhaps in any previous races, can match his physical and mental toughness.\n\nOn Dec. 16, 2014, when he was 61, Johnson became just the 396th person to climb the “Seven Summits:” Mount Everest, Mount Elbrus, Denali, Mount Kilimanjaro, Aconcagua, Mount Vinson, and Carstensz Pyramid—the tallest peaks in Asia, Europe, North America, Africa, South America, Antarctica, and Oceania respectively.\n\nHe was invited three times to compete in the World Ironman Championship in Hawaii, one of the most grueling competitions in sport.\n\nFiscal conservative, social liberal\n\nIf Johnson and his running mate Bill Weld, former governor of Massachusetts, were elected, they have said that their first task would be to present a balanced budget to Congress.\n\n“My entire life I watched government spend more money than what it takes in and I just always thought that there would be a day of reckoning with regard to that spending…\n\n“Listen,” Johnson said in a September telephone interview, “we are heading to a fiscal cliff, and we have to address it.”\n\nThe balanced budget plan would address spending on social security, Medicare and Medicaid, as well as military spending, with an emphasis on the costs of the current strategy of “regime change” in areas around the world.\n\nHe said that the best way to address Medicaid spending challenges would be to make block grants to the states.\n\nJohnson thinks one of our greatest governmental failures is the “war on drugs,” and favors legalizing marijuana.\n\nHe supports a woman’s right to choose.\n\nBut he also fully supports the Second Amendment of the constitution.\n\nHe is opposed to the policy of American military interventionism that, he says, makes America less safe.\n\nHe is in favor of free trade, and immigration that is focused on bringing people into the country who want to work and participate in the American economic dream.\n\nIn short, Johnson is not what we’ve always done.\n\nHe is a man of experience, toughness, character, and humility.\n\nWashington, and all of America, would benefit from the kind of change he would bring.\n\nReach Frank Daniels III:fdanielsiii@tennessean.com, 615-881-7039, or on Twitter @fdanielsiii\n\nEditor's note: This column is part of a series of articles commissioned by The Tennessean making thoughtful cases for 2016 presidential candidates:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/10/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/08/libertarian-nominee-jo-jorgensen-wants-presidential-debate-stage/3629409001/", "title": "Libertarian nominee Jo Jorgensen wants in on presidential debate ...", "text": "When the time comes to place your vote for president, there likely will be several unfamiliar names to choose from, some that may only be on the ballot in your state.\n\nBut there are only three presidential candidates on the ballot in all 50 states: Donald Trump, Joe Biden and Jo Jorgensen.\n\nJo who?\n\n\"We are the only party that has been on the ballot in 50 states back-to-back presidential elections, and we've done that a number of times,\" said Joanne \"Jo\" Jorgensen, a 1996 a Libertarian vice-presidential candidate who claimed the party nomination for president in 2020.\n\nHow hard is it to make 50 state ballots?\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n\"Well, you can ask Kanye West,\" Jorgensen said of the mercurial celebrity musician whose ill-fated campaign stalled over the summer. \"He thought, no problem. I'm famous, I'm rich. He found out it's more than just money. There were a number of states where he tried and failed.\"\n\nWhile the Kanye train derailed, Jorgensen's campaign bus has been crossing the continuous 48 states, including a recent northeast tour that brought her to Jersey City and Zucotti Park in New York. Both of those stops let her spread the Libertarian message with the Statue of Liberty as a backdrop.\n\n\"Liberty works,\" Jorgensen said, rendering the Libertarian platform down to two words.\n\nAlong the way, Jorgensen spoke to the USA Today Network about her campaign, Biden, Trump and her argument that Libertarians deserve to be recognized as a major political party in the U.S.\n\n\"We do have major-party status now, which is why I think we've proven why we should be in the debates,\" she said.\n\nQuestion: How has the campaign been so far? What are you hearing from the public?\n\nJorgensen: They like what they are hearing. I've had so many people say, 'I've voted Republican all my life, or Democrat.' Especially after the debate, they are saying this has got to end.\n\nQ: What \"this\" is that?\n\nA: First of all, I should have been there on that [debate] stage. We keep hearing the media and others say its a choice between two old rich white guys. I say that's not a choice at all. Neither one wants you to make your decisions. Both of them want to spend your money. Neither one of them has an answer to the crushing healthcare costs, and neither one wants to bring the troops home. We've got two people up there creating a lot of drama, but they both want to do the same thing. They both want to make decisions for us.\n\nQ: Polls do not indicate your campaign has significant support. Why should you be included in the debates?\n\nA: This year, I wasn't even included in the polls. A lot of people don't realize the debate commission is a private entity, and it's basically half Democrats and half Republicans. [2016 Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson] got 13.6% in the polls. What they did was say, 'What [polling] number can we come up with that it sounds reasonable to the average person, but so high that nobody could ever attain it? And they come up with 15%. That might sound pretty low, but when you look at how people are registered, pretty much between Democrats and Republicans, it comes out to 78% percent total. So you have to grab everybody left over, to all get them all under one banner, and it's not happening.\n\nQ: What would you tell voters if you were on that debate stage with Trump and Biden?\n\nA: Neither one of them believe we are capable of making our own decisions. They both want government to be in charge of almost anything. What I've been telling people is, you know better than any politician or bureaucrat how to spend your money. You know what's best for you and your family. We can't be making all of these decisions from Washington like we've been doing.\n\nQ: Debates cover the issues, like the COVID pandemic. How would you have handled that as president?\n\nA: The first thing I would have done differently than Trump is I would have gotten the FDA and CDC out of testing. We had our first case of COVID within about a day of South Korea. They did massive testing and were able to quickly contain the spread. Meanwhile, cases in U.S. skyrocketed, and the reason was there were dozens of testing kits that we could have used. But in the beginning, the FDA and CDC blocked all of them except two. Instead, they just shut everybody at home. We're basically under house arrest and have lost tens of millions of jobs we may never get back.\n\nElection:Morris County Clerk answers election questions on everyone's mind\n\nVoting:North Jersey town tells state it wants 'in-person outdoor' voting\n\nQ: What about the economics of the pandemic? How would you have handled the shutdown?\n\nA: Under my administration, we would have had shopping centers open if they chose. We would have had restaurants open if they chose. And people could have gone to work. We wouldn't have lost tens of millions of jobs because the people who wanted to go to work out to work, and vulnerable people most at risk could stay home, as my mother did, and have people bring their groceries instead of going out and getting exposed\n\nQ: That seems to contradict conventional wisdom that urges everyone to practice social distancing, avoid indoor gatherings in favor of outdoors, etc.\n\nA: In Sweden, they even kept their schools open along with restaurants and retail. Everybody kept saying just wait they're going to be decimated by COVID. Their numbers are still pretty good. Yet you look at other places like India where they shut down, and the numbers aren't so good.\n\nQ: Given the current circumstances, would you be in favor of another economic stimulus package?\n\nA: Under my administration, we wouldn't have needed this package, and our economy would be in such a better position right now. A lot of people were pretty happy to see a $1,200 check, but where's that money coming from? Normally I would say we are giving money to Washington and they are turning around and giving it back to us. But we're so far in debt, the money is not coming from us. It's coming from who knows how many years later? Even worse, that money is going to a lot of corporations.\n\nQ: Many Americans are protesting what they see as systemic racism in the U.S. The president sees it as a law-and-order issue. What's your take?\n\nA: We believe crime is a local issue and the local police, and the mayors and city council, should decide how to handle their own police departments. We've had the federal government give military equipment, including tanks tear gas and other things, to 8,000 federal state and local police departments. Having all that equipment there only escalates the situation faster. Maybe if we didn't have all that military equipment to begin with, then maybe we wouldn't have it escalate to that point.\n\nQ: But it did escalate, and many of the protests included a violent element.\n\nA: Had I been present, we would have had that fixed by now, because many people out there protesting or rioting are saying we need to get rid of no-knock raids. We need to get rid of qualified immunity. We need to get rid of this racist war on drugs. Had I been president, people wouldn't be saying that, because that would be fixed.\n\nQ: All these issues have not only divided the nation, but the individual parties to a degree. Is the Libertarian party united?\n\nA: Oh, we are. Basically had the support of both sides, which just shows you can present a Libertarian message in a practical way that makes sense to people because liberty works and liberty is just right.\n\nQ: How about the independents and undecided voters you will need to make an impact on the election?\n\nA: Pretty much right from the start, about 75 percent of our volunteers have been from outside the party. That shows people are looking for something new.\n\nWilliam Westhoven is a local reporter for DailyRecord.com.

The total eclipse of the sun then traced a path from southern Texas to northern Maine, where it exited into Canada and the ocean beyond.\n\nThe rare event was an astronomical experience like no other. Monday's eclipse was unusually accessible to millions of people. It was widely anticipated not only for its remarkable period of darkness, but for its rare timing: No total solar eclipse would be visible from the contiguous United States again until 2044. While millions of Americans may have seen today’s eclipse, a small group in Texas was among the very first.\n\nEdge of eclipse shadow began in south Texas\n\nAlejandra Martinez, a seventh-grade science teacher from the south Texas border city of Eagle Pass, peered up at the gray, gauzy sky, anxiously awaiting the solar eclipse’s entrance into the USA.\n\nSitting with a telescope under a camping canopy in a corner of the county airport, Martinez, 42, and two other science enthusiasts had been recruited by NASA to participate in an effort called Citizen CATE 2024, where more than 30 teams perched in the eclipse’s path will record the shadowy trek across the country.\n\nIn this spot, less than five miles from the U.S.-Mexico border, she and her team would be among the first people in the U.S. to witness the phenomenon. Eagle Pass sits near the very beginning of the eclipse’s track from southwest to northeast across the country. It also sits very near dead-center of it, where the period of “totality” will be the longest. That total shadow was still more than an hour away when the edge of the shadow began to darken the sky.\n\nMartinez, dressed in a “This Totality Rocks” T-shirt and eclipse-themed skirt, watched as the penumbra crept across the airfield, about 10 minutes past noon local time. She put on her eclipse glasses and peered up at the sky. The gauzy clouds parted. “There it is! There it is!” she yelled. “First contact. It’s begun!”\n\nClouds came and went as the shadow grew for the next hour. As totality approached Eagle Pass, the sky shaded a dull gray then a heavy brown and the temperature dropped a few degrees. Only a sliver of the sun remained.\n\nA few seconds before 1:27 p.m. CT, the crowd counted down, “3..2..1…” The sun was gone, completely covered by the moon. Darkness spread over the small airport grounds. “Oh my god,” Martinez said, a hand covering her heart. “This is so cool!”\n\nHow to tell if you have eye damage from looking at a partial eclipse?\n\nFor those who took a chance and looked at the sun without protective eyewear during the eclipse, concerns may arise if their vision starts to seem impaired. Have they suffered eclipse blindness?\n\nLooking directly at the sun even briefly without the proper safety glasses can result in eye damage, either temporary or permanent. The body's natural squinting reaction in normal circumstances prevents people from staring directly at the sun, but that reflex may not be activated during partial eclipses, even though a partly shielded sun can still burn the retina.\n\nThe American Academy of Ophthalmology says pain won't be an indication of damaged eyes because the retina lacks pain nerves. Worrisome signs are instead blurry vision, headaches, light sensitivity, blind spots in the central vision, distorted vision and changes in color perception. Anyone experiencing those symptoms should see an ophthalmologist, the AAO says.\n\nWhat was the timeline of the 2024 solar eclipse?\n\nThe total eclipse began in Mexico at about 11:07 a.m. PDT, Monday before crossing into Texas at 1:27 p.m. CDT. It ended in Maine at 3:35 p.m. EDT. Even those who weren't in the path of totality could see a percentage of the eclipse.\n\nTo find out exactly when the eclipse occurred in your area, you can search by USA TODAY's database by ZIP code for a viewing guide.\n\nStudents in Washington get hands-on learning\n\nDozens of students spilled out of Ida B. Wells Middle School in Washington, D.C., gripping cardboard solar eclipse glasses and chatting with excitement. “Why is the sun shaped as a moon?” one student asked after looking toward the sun. “Why is it not getting dark?’’ asked another.\n\nTeacher Troy Mangum, who the students called “Mr. Mango,’’ slowly explained the science behind the experience as he cautioned others to put on their glasses. Students at the school in northwest D.C. had had lessons about the eclipse leading up the day’s teaching outside the classroom.\n\n“Anytime we can get hands on or dynamic learning … it’s invaluable,’’ said Mangum, a social emotional learning coach. “We talked about it so much. It’s nice to see them get excited about qeeky Mr. Mango type of stuff.”\n\nSkylar Cruel, 12, had come outside with her science class. “I just really wanted to see it,’’ she said. “You get to see it turn from light to dark.”\n\nSteps away at Whittier Elementary School, which focuses on science, technology, engineering and math (STEM), younger students put on their glasses and tilted their heads up toward the sun behind their school.\n\nMichael Haile joined his daughter, Markan Worku, 9, a student at Whittier, and brought along his 5-year-old son, Keab. He called it a memorable experience for his children. Markan, who had been learning about solar eclipses in her third-grade class, simply said, “This is cool!’’\n\n− Deborah Berry\n\nIn Michigan, a bonding experience for a mother and her three kids\n\nIn Michigan, eclipse enthusiasts packed a watch party along the Detroit Riverwalk near Cullen Plaza. They sat on the grass, on benches and berms. For Janelle Ikonen of Waterford, it was a chance to bond with her three children − Hannah, 9; Elim, 12; and Isaac, 14 − whom she took out of school for the day.\n\n“I wanted to experience a unique event with them,” said Ikonen, 47. “It’s one of my big deals to me, to experience things with my kids. … I hope they’ll remember spending time with me.”\n\nIn Grand Rapids, where 94% coverage of the sun was expected, viewers gathered on the city's “Blue Bridge,” which offered a view of the eclipse over the Grand River. With no cloud cover over the city, visitors had an unobstructed scene. The Grand Rapids Public Museum set up a series of solar telescopes.\n\nJill and Wes Johnson, 50 and 14, were among those awaiting max coverage. They’d considered traveling from Grand Rapids to a place with total coverage, but decided 94% coverage was worthwhile enough to stay home.\n\n“I think people are excited to see something unique,” Jill Johnson said.\n\n− Georgea Kovanis and Arpan Lobo, Detroit Free Press\n\nUS women's soccer team takes in eclipse ahead of title game\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio − The U.S. women’s national soccer team took a break from SheBelieves Cup preparation to watch the eclipse.\n\nSeveral team members, including World Cup veterans Crystal Dunn, Alyssa Naeher, Naomi Girma and Trinity Rodman, coaches and staff members donned eclipse glasses and went outside their hotel to see the rare event.\n\nAs the sky darkened and the moon moved in front of the sun, someone yelled, “Come on, keep going!” Columbus is just outside the path of totality, so all but a sliver of the sun wound up being covered.\n\nThe USWNT is in Columbus for the final of the SheBelieves Cup on Tuesday night against Canada.\n\n− Nancy Armour\n\nWitnessing the first total eclipse from a cruise ship\n\nPassengers aboard Holland America's Koningsdam cruise ship eagerly gathered on the top decks at 10 a.m. local time to watch the spectacle of a solar eclipse.\n\nPositioned off the coast of Mazatlan, Mexico − the first city in North America to witness the total eclipse − the ship provided an ideal vantage point for viewing the celestial event. Accompanied by an astronomer, the captain meticulously adjusted the ship's position to ensure the best possible view.\n\nDan Fueller, an experienced eclipse observer who had previously seen similar phenomena from ships in 1991 and 1998, emphasized the advantages of viewing the eclipse from a cruise ship. He noted the flexibility of the ship's mobility allowed for optimal positioning along the eclipse's path, ensuring unobstructed views.\n\n\"You're on a cruise ship and (the best view) is a little bit farther to the west or a little bit farther to the east − along the path, there's a clear sky − the ship can move. If you're on land and there's not a road there, you better have a tank.\"\n\n− Joshuan Rivera\n\nPartial eclipse 'like a little Pac-Man taking a bite out of the sun'\n\nIn Parthenon, Arkansas, the eclipse began near the Buffalo National River. Five friends traveled from Florida to be on a rock outcropping to witness the celestial event.\n\n“Yes! I see it!” Angie Printiss exclaimed.\n\n“Oh ya! You can see it,” said Kate Estes. “It’s like a little Pac-Man taking a bite out of the sun.”\n\nAt 20 minutes before totality, the sky got noticeably darker. The shadow of crescent sun shapes played off the limestone rocks.\n\n“It looks like water − like fish scales,” Estes said. “That is so weird, when the trees move you can really see it.”\n\n− Jennifer Portman\n\nNew Englanders travel for better view of the eclipse\n\nCrowds ballooned into the thousands midday Monday in the center of St. Johnsbury, Vermont, as the nearly cloudless sky and warm sun boosted temperatures to an unseasonably 60 degrees.\n\nJim and Kim Cooper drove over from New Hampton, New Hampshire, their first time doing more than just passing through the town locals call St. Jays. Their son had proposed to his girlfriend in Tennessee during the 2017 eclipse and then had an eclipse-themed wedding, but the Coopers had never seen a total eclipse for themselves, so they decided to come to the closest place where they could be assured of a good view.\n\nJeffrey Breau had seen that 2017 eclipse for himself and was so impressed that he convinced family members to join him this time. Breau’s girlfriend, Nell Hawley, came up with him from Cambridge, Massachusetts, while his brother Alex and his girlfriend Diana Ventura drove up from New York City. The Breau brothers' father, Walter, joined them in taking in their first eclipse.\n\n“I would have been OK watching it in the yard,” Walter said, though he would only have seen a partial eclipse from there. “That’s what you think now,” Jeffrey said quickly. “Talk to me in two hours.”\n\n− Karen Weintraub\n\nKids bring homemade eclipse viewers to National Mall\n\nLucas and Lucy Porto Banco didn’t need to buy fancy eclipse glasses – the 7- and 10-year-old siblings made their own eclipse viewers from two cardboard shoe boxes left over from a couple of their mom’s recent shoe purchases.With the help of a YouTube tutorial video, they made two holes in each box with a whittling knife and taped tin foil over. Then they used dry spaghetti to poke holes in the tin foil for the sun’s light to pass through and project onto the dark inside of the box.The kids put together the viewer in little more than five minutes, Lucy said. “Maybe 15, with covering all the gaps in the shoe box,” she said.Even with his own eclipse-viewing creation, Lucas said he may still take advantage of his eclipse glasses. “I’m going to do both,” he said.\n\n− Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nWhat is an 'umbra?' − and other eclipse words\n\nAstronomers and eclipse enthusiasts used a bunch of specialized words Monday as the nation experienced its first solar eclipse since 2017 and the last one for until 2044. Here are a few of those terms and what they mean, according to the American Astronomical Society.\n\nBaily's Beads – This refers to the beaded appearance of the moon's edge as the eclipse nears totality. Shafts of sunlight shine through deep valleys on the moon's surface, which causes the effect known to observers as Bailey's Beads.\n\nUmbra – The darkest part of the moon’s shadow, within which the entirety of the sun's bright face is blocked. An observer standing in the umbra sees a total solar eclipse.\n\nPenumbra: The lighter part of the moon's shadow, making up its outer portion, where light can reach.\n\nCorona – The sun’s upper atmosphere, visible as a pearly glow around the eclipsed sun during totality.\n\nTotality – The maximum phase of a total solar eclipse, during which the moon’s disk completely covers the sun's bright face. It can last from a fraction of a second to a maximum of 7 minutes, 31 seconds, depending on viewing location and other factors.\n\n− Dale Denwalt, The Oklahoman\n\nA last-minute search for glasses for 'a perfect spot'\n\nPatsy Faoro walked toward a half dozen people gathered at the gate of Turner Farm Park in Great Falls, Virginia. The people were awaiting the opening of an eclipse viewing event complete with telescopes and educational presentations.\n\nFaoro, who lives near the park in this upscale Northern Virginia neighborhood, just wanted glasses to safely view the eclipse.\n\nShe visited CVS, Safeway and a 7/11 convenience store, all of which had advertised the availability of glasses to view the eclipse. None of the retailers had any glasses remaining when Faoro checked this morning.\n\n“We have this great big open space that’s a perfect spot,” said Faoro, who viewed her first eclipse in the 1970s. “We just need some glasses.”\n\n− Ken Alltucker\n\nIndianapolis Motor Speedway event draws tens of thousands\n\nTory Patrick, 41, is hoping to give her four children a once-in-a-lifetime learning opportunity. Patrick and her family traveled 160 miles to Indianapolis Motor Speedway from their home in Granger, Indiana. They were expected to have 97% totality at home, but it’s not the same as total coverage, she said.\n\n“They will be getting the full experience that they can’t read about in textbooks,” Patrick said.\n\nPatrick and her sister Cally Gannon, 39, from Cincinnati, met in Indianapolis to view the eclipse from the speedway. They camped outside IMS over the weekend ahead of the event and on Sunday afternoon saw a double rainbow over the speedway’s iconic pagoda. An estimated 50,000 tickets were sold for the day’s festivities, presented in partnership with NASA and Purdue University.\n\nElsewhere in the stands, Ryan Harper, 30, knows today is special.\n\n“We’re right in totality,” he said. “This sometimes doesn’t happen in people’s lifetimes.\n\n— Sarah Bowman and Jade Thomas\n\nFamily travels from Baltimore to Rochester, N.Y., to view the eclipse\n\nWhen Maze Pelham of Baltimore was a fifth-grader, he watched news of the 2017 solar eclipse and vowed to witness the next notable solar eclipse. That eclipse, and that day, has come. And this is why he and his parents, Janice and Sonney Pelham, left Maryland around 1 a.m. on Monday and drove nearly seven hours to Rochester, New York.\n\n“I said to myself I would go to the next one,” Maze Pelham said while seated with his parents on lawn chairs at downtown Rochester’s Parcel 5 park, where he and hundreds of others are awaiting a view of the full eclipse. “It’s a promise I made to myself.”\n\n– Democrat and Chronicle, part of the USA TODAY Network\n\nIn Brooklyn: Eclipses glasses, check. Lawn chair, check.\n\nRalph Emerson held a pair of paper sunglasses in his hands while riding the subway to Brooklyn's sprawling Prospect Park on Monday. He exited the train with a folded lawn chair strapped across his shoulder, and said he felt energized and full of anticipation.\n\n\"This is special,\" Emerson, 61, said. \"I haven't woken up with this much excitement since the Super Bowl.\"\n\nWalking to the park's botanic garden, Emerson said appreciating natural phenomena makes it easier to manage the stresses that come with living in a big city. Also like a big sports game, the eclipse will draw lots of people together to experience something much larger than themselves, in community, he said.\n\n\"A lot of times it's tragedies that bring us together, but sometimes things like this do,\" he said.\n\n− Claire Thornton\n\nTexas Eclipse Festival cut short by weather\n\nThe Texas Eclipse Festival was canceled Monday in Burnet County, 50 miles northwest of Austin, because of weather concerns. The festival, which included bands and other events, began Sunday and was supposed to wrap up Tuesday.\n\n\"We regret to inform you of the severe weather forecast, including risks of high winds, tornadic activity, large hail, and thunderstorms for later today, including during the eclipse, Tuesday, and Wednesday,\" festival organizers said on their website. \"Your safety is our top priority.\"\n\nFestivalgoers were urged to leave early for safety and to beat traffic. Guests, however, were allowed to stay \"provided they pack and are prepared to depart after totality.\"\n\nTraffic jams, collisions mar eclipse watchers' travel\n\nTraffic crashes and road delays were reported across the nation as Americans flocked to prime locations to gaze up at the rare solar eclipse. Local roads and highways in states including Texas, Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Vermont and New Hampshire were overwhelmed with eclipse chasers, many of whom were from out of state. The most intense bottlenecks appeared to be in the path of totality, where spectators will be able to view the full eclipse.\n\nIn Oklahoma, a crash around 7:30 a.m. local time narrowed eastbound lanes on I-40, a major transcontinental highway that runs from California to North Carolina. The crash occurred not far from several state parks that were hosting eclipse events, and it's also within driving distance of the full eclipse path, which includes parts of southeastern Oklahoma and Arkansas.\n\nMultiple crashes were reported on an interstate in Waco, Texas, a city in the path of totality, where several festivities and eclipse viewing events were scheduled. The crashes all occurred on I-35, which runs from southern Texas to Minnesota.\n\n\"Expect major traffic delays in this area,\" the Texas Department of Transportation said in a statement.\n\n− Christopher Cann\n\nAirport draws a crowd of jets for eclipse\n\nEAGLE PASS, Texas − Maverick County International Airport in Eagle Pass, Texas, usually sees maybe three private planes a day. By 10 a.m. CT on Monday, more than 10 planes crowded the tarmac, including Cessnas, Pipers and at least one corporate jet − all there to catch an early glimpse of the total solar eclipse. Eagle Pass will be one of the first American cities to witness the phenomenon. Some watchers, like Brandon Beck, 43, flew in Sunday night from San Diego and spent the night in a sleeping bag on the tarmac next to his friend’s Mooney single-prop piston four-seater.“We’re so lucky to be on a planet where the sun is the perfect size and perfect distance to create that effect,” he said. “It’s obligatory. We have to see it.”\n\nFirst the Cherry Blossoms, then the eclipse\n\nWASHINGTON − The Cherry Blossoms brought Ali and Aurore Youssouf to the city all the way from Paris, but the pair were delighted to learn that their trip would overlap with the eclipse. The day is extra special for Aurore Youssouf, 43, who has never seen an eclipse before. On Monday morning, the couple arrived by chance at the National Mall early enough to snag a few pairs of free eclipse glasses distributed by the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum for the occasion.“We didn’t even know. We just ended up here and found out that they were giving away some glasses,” said Ali Youssouf, 46.\n\n− Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nAwaiting eclipse − and hail − in Texas\n\nKERRVILLE, Texas − Forecasts called for considerable cloudiness, rain and possible hail, but retired NASA engineer Jeff Stone stayed positive as he and his wife prepared to host more than a dozen people for a watch party at their hilltop home in Texas Hill Country. Stone, an eclipse enthusiast who had met family in Missouri to watch the solar eclipse of 2017, said he recently reviewed video footage of that event and said current conditions weren’t that much different than they were back then.\n\n“I’m outside and seeing patches of blue among scattered clouds, so we’re remaining hopeful,” he said.\n\nAbout 150 miles to the northeast in Gatesville, lead pastor Eric Moffett of Coryell Community Church said a similar forecast did little to deter an expected gathering of about 800 visitors for the church’s family-oriented “Eclipse at the Crosses” event. Many, if not most, were from out of town or even out of country − Canada, Wales, France, Italy. Many locals were staying home to avoid the crowd, he said.\n\n“It’s partly cloudy, but the sun is shining on me right now,” he said. “We are praying that it stays that way.”\n\n− Marc Ramirez\n\nWhat is the difference between a solar eclipse and a lunar eclipse?\n\nA total solar eclipse occurs when the moon comes in between the Earth and the sun, blocking its light from reaching our planet, leading to a period of darkness lasting several minutes. A total lunar eclipse occurs when the moon and the sun are on exact opposite sides of Earth. The Earth blocks the sunlight that normally reaches the moon. Instead of that sunlight hitting the moon’s surface, Earth's shadow falls on it.\n\nA lunar eclipse can last for a few hours, while a solar eclipse lasts only a few minutes. Solar eclipses also rarely occur, while lunar eclipses are comparatively more frequent. While at least two partial lunar eclipses happen every year, total lunar eclipses are still rare, NASA says. Another major difference: No special glasses or gizmos are needed to view the a lunar eclipse, and people can directly stare at the moon.\n\n− Saman Shafiq\n\nSolar eclipse, lunar eclipse:What is the difference?\n\nCan you drive during the solar eclipse?\n\nThe 2024 solar eclipse will shroud much of the United States in darkness on Monday, leaving many people to wonder: Is it safe to drive during the solar eclipse?\n\nIt is safe to drive during an eclipse as long as you don't look up at the sky. AAA is telling drivers to be focused on the road if they are operating a car during the total solar eclipse. But the automobile insurance company is advising Americans who want to safely view the total eclipse to \"find a safe place to park (not on the side of a road or highway) away from other traffic and then wear your eclipse glasses,\" said Aixa Diaz, a spokeswoman from AAA.\n\n\"Pack your patience, whether traveling a great distance or locally,\" Diaz said. \"People will be out and about to catch a glimpse of the eclipse.\"\n\nA similar scenario played out in 2017 during the nation's last total solar eclipse: Congestion in some areas lasted for up to 13 hours after totality, according to Transportation Research News, a National Research Council publication. An analysis of traffic patterns from that year suggests the worst of the traffic – on interstates and rural back roads alike – will kick off after the eclipse ends and everyone tries to leave all at once.\n\n− Kayla Jimenez\n\nWhen will the next solar eclipse happen?\n\nIt will be 20 years before there's a chance to witness a total solar eclipse in the United States again. According to NASA, after Monday's total solar eclipse, the next one viewable from the contiguous U.S. will be on Aug. 23, 2044.\n\nUnfortunately, the 2044 total solar eclipse won't have the broad reach across the U.S. as the 2024 eclipse. The path of totality during the 2044 eclipse will only touch three states, according to the Planetary Society, a nonprofit involved in research, public outreach and political space advocacy. The eclipse will begin in Greenland, sweep through Canada and end around sunset in Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota.\n\nBut another eclipse scheduledfor Saturday, Aug. 12, 2045, will trace a path of totality over California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, Arkansas, Missouri, Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Florida and Georgia.\n\n− Mary Walrath-Holdridge, Gabe Hauari and Eric Lagatta\n\nEclipse and pets: It's not the sky that's the problem\n\nAn eclipse itself isn't dangerous for domestic animals such as dogs and cats, but experts say it's probably best to not bring pets to experience the April 2024 total solar eclipse. Experts' biggest concern is not what’s happening in the sky but on the ground as crowds of excited and eager people gather, said Dr. Rena Carlson, president of the American Veterinary Medical Association. Dogs especially will take their cues from their owners rather than the celestial event.\n\n“Rather than the effects of the eclipse, I would be more worried about the excitement and all of the people,” Carlson said.\n\n− Elizabeth Weise\n\nA guide to the solar eclipse for kids\n\nHere's an easy-to read, illustrated guide to help kids understand what the April 8 total solar eclipse means, where it will be visible and how you can watch it safely. It also shows them how an ordinary kitchen colander can easily be used to view a solar eclipse − the colander's holes can project crescent images of the sun onto the ground. There are even pages that can be downloaded and colored.\n\nTrump's eclipse experience lit up internet in 2017\n\nSeven years ago, when the last total solar eclipse crossed over North America, a photo of then-President Donald Trump seemingly gazing at the sun with his naked eyes set the internet ablaze. During the afternoon of Aug. 21, 2017, Trump, who was president at the time, was joined by then first lady Melania Trump and their son Barron to watch the rare phenomenon from the Truman Balcony at the White House. Photos taken by members of the media captured all three donning eclipse glasses while looking at the eclipse.\n\nBut at one point during the viewing, the former president was captured in photos and videos without proper eye protection, seemingly gazing directly at the sun. Looking at an eclipse before or after the brief phase of totality without proper eyewear can lead to eye damage.\n\n− Natalie Neysa Alund\n\nWhen is the next total solar eclipse?What to know about the next eclipse's path, timing\n\nHow to make a solar eclipse viewer\n\nPeople who didn't manage to get their hands on glasses are not completely down and out. There are other safe ways to view the eclipse, say experts, and a lot of them only require a little bit of craftiness and items you can find lying around the house.\n\nSteps to make the cereal box eclipse viewer (And here is a video aid):\n\nGet an empty, clean cereal box.\n\nCut a white piece of cardboard that will fit snuggly in the bottom of the box, or secure it permanently by gluing it in place.\n\nCut the top of the cereal box, removing both ends and leaving the center intact.\n\nPut a piece of tape across the center of the top to securely hold it closed.\n\nTape a piece of heavy-duty foil or double a single layer for additional strength, covering one of the openings at the top of the cereal box. The other opening will remain open for viewing.\n\nUsing a small nail (approximately 3mm in diameter) push a hole in the foil.\n\nCover the entire box with construction paper, leaving the single-viewing opening and the foil uncovered.\n\nThe finished box should be held with the pin-hole side facing the sun. It may take a little practice pointing the box. With your back facing the sun, look through the viewing opening. A small image of the sun, about ½ cm in diameter, can be seen projected on the white paper inside the box.\n\n− Mary Walrath-Holdrid\n\nWhat is the path of the solar eclipse called?\n\nThose in the direct line of the eclipse will be treated to an incredible sight as the moon completely blots out the sun's disk, ushering in uncharacteristic darkness and revealing the sun's elusive outermost layer called the corona. That moment is called \"totality\" and this year the path of totality crosses through 13 U.S. states.\n\nThe last total solar eclipse to cut through North America was in August 2017.\n\nHow to look at eclipse without glasses\n\nA total solar eclipse offers skygazers the rare opportunity to witness the eclipse with the naked eye. However, solar eclipse glasses are still needed until totality is reached.\n\nCertified solar eclipse glasses are crucial for spectators to avoid the sun's retina-damaging rays. But when the moon moves completely in front of the sun and blocks its light, you'll know it's safe to remove the glasses for a short period of time.\n\nHow fast does an eclipse shadow travel?\n\nAccording to a post from the National Weather Service in Indianapolis on X, an eclipse shadow travels at speeds from 1,100 to 5,000 mph. Near the equator, it travels at around 1,100 mph and increases in speed as it approaches the poles.\n\nThe eclipse party is over? Time to recycle those glasses!\n\nAstronomers Without Borders, or AWB, a non-profit organization running its second nationwide eclipse glasses recycling drive. Her business will join over 300 schools, museums, city governments, commercial businesses, community organizations and local libraries that will collect and ship an estimated millions of glasses to be repurposed for use by underserved communities around the world in future solar eclipses.\n\nAWB launched its first run of the program after the last solar eclipse in 2017 when volunteer centers across the country collected millions of the glass. After vetting them for reuse, more than half a million glasses were distributed to Africa, Asia and South America.\n\nPeople can visit AWB's website to find their nearest participating collection center and learn more about recycling the glasses, said Andrew Fazekas, the organization's communication manager.\n\n\"We figure there's probably going to be tens of millions of glasses out there at the very least,\" he said. \"And most of them are probably very gently used.\"\n\n− Cybele Mayes-Osterman", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/community/2015/12/04/anti-violence-facility-opens-selma/76794718/", "title": "Anti-violence facility opens in Selma", "text": "Alvin Benn\n\nSpecial to the Advertiser\n\nSELMA – A civil rights group with an eye on the future opened a “non-violence” training center Friday – one within sight of a structure where one of America’s most violent incidents occurred.\n\nState Sen. Hank Sanders said the location couldn’t have been more appropriate because of what the bridge represents and how it played a key role in passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n\nHe referred to the Edmund Pettus Bridge where, on March 7, 1965, a large group peaceful black protesters were routed by Alabama State Troopers using clubs and tear gas to drive them back into Selma.\n\n“Selma is a symbol of non-violence overcoming violence,” said Sanders, who called the bridge crossing the Alabama River “very striking.”\n\nNationally known civil rights leaders took part in the opening ceremony of a facility that once housed two restaurants in recent years. Both eventually closed.\n\n“What we have here today is not a business like the restaurants,” said Sanders. “What we have is an institution that will teach reconciliation and conflict resolution methods.”\n\nThe Rev. Bernard Lafayette, who was beaten and nearly killed as he tried to personally register black voters in Selma two years before the Southern Christian Leadership Conference arrived to lead demonstrations, spoke at the ceremony at the Selma Center for Nonviolence, Truth and Reconciliation.\n\n“This is a very special occasion,” Lafayette said prior to cutting a ribbon that opened the facility’s grand opening. “We’re going global. We have to be an example for others.”\n\nA week-long series of events that focused on increased violence in America were held throughout the week. On Friday, one was held inside the former restaurant that has been transformed from an eating establishment to one that teaches ways to avoid or stop violent actions.\n\nAmong those who took part in the program was a former gang leader who spent time in prison and now goes by the name “Silky Slim.”\n\n“This has been a very good event,” said Arthur Reed. “I’m sure those who come here to learn about non-violence will benefit.”\n\nLafayette said Selma’s role in the voting rights movement wasn’t one to be taken lightly today since “many people don’t realize the impact that Selma had on South Africa and the changes that took place there.”\n\nHe said a special focus has been placed on “young leadership.” After late morning refreshments, Lafayette sat on a couch next to teenagers as he explained events of the past and hopes for the future.\n\n“All we have to do today is look at the violence taking place all around us and throughout the world,” he said. “If we do, we can see that our job is not yet done.”\n\nMelvin Barnes Sr. spoke about his dealings with a teenager who pointed a .45-caliber pistol at his head. He said he was able to talk him out of the weapon by giving him $8 in food stamps.\n\n“That’s all I had left,” said Barnes, who said both he and the young assailant were homeless at the time. “The young man told me he was hungry and he didn’t want to hurt me. I think we became friends after I got the gun from him.”\n\nJoining Lafayette and other civil rights leaders was Bruce Boynton whose arrest at a segregated waiting room in Richmond, Va. more than 50 years ago became a test case that reached all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nOther programs during the week were led by Ted Quant, a conflict resolution specialist and Eric Butler, who spoke about “Restorative Justice.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/12/04"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/environment/960113/the-worlds-most-extreme-weather-events-in-2023", "title": "The world's most extreme weather events in 2023 | The Week UK", "text": "Wildfires, floods and heatwaves have continued to make headlines as communities across the world have had their homes and lives threatened by deadly weather conditions.\n\nThis year already \"seems destined to be remembered as the year that extreme weather events left the Northern Hemisphere reeling\", said National Geographic.

Cyclone, Africa\n\nCyclone Batsirai displaced more than 60,000 people (Image credit: Rijasolo/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nWithin weeks of Storm Ana, Cyclone Batsirai then “barrelled towards” Madagascar, said Reuters. The tropical storm also hit Mauritius, bringing life “to a standstill, with public transport cancelled, shops and banks shut, and air and sea travel halted”, said Africa News.\n\nIn Madagascar, the death toll reached 120 and 124,000 people had their homes damaged or destroyed. The island had already been “struggling with food shortages in the south”, said Al Jazeera, “a consequence of a severe and prolonged drought”.\n\n3. Floods, Pakistan\n\nA third of Pakistan was under water in September (Image credit: Shahid Saeed Mirza/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nIt was estimated that more than 33 million people were impacted by the deadly floods that swept across Pakistan from June to September this year. “Logistically the country was hardly prepared”, said The Diplomat. When the government announced a “national emergency” in August, “it was already too late”.\n\nA UN report published in December warned that 240,000 people remain displaced as a result of the flooding, while an estimated eight million are still potentially exposed to the floodwaters.\n\nThousands of kilometres of road were washed away. By September, a third of the country was underwater, with water-borne diseases “now making the situation even worse”, the site continued. It remains “hard to predict if Pakistan will be able to rebuild its lost infrastructure in this decade”.\n\n4. Lightning strikes, India\n\nLightning strikes Kolkata in May (Image credit: Indranil Aditya/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nIndia experienced “a big jump in extreme weather events” this year, said the World Economic Forum (WEF). Almost 50 people in Uttar Pradesh were killed by lightning strikes during the monsoon season. The state’s chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, called for an early warning system for thunder and lightning storms as a result.\n\nA significant number of people die each year in India due to lightning, said The Independent, “A large number of people work outdoors” and there is “poor awareness and education about the dangers” of strikes. According to government figures, lightning increased by 111 times this year and 907 people were killed by strikes in 2022.\n\n5. Heatwave, UK\n\nTemperatures in England hit new highs in 2022 (Image credit: Carlos Jasso/AFP via Getty Images)\n\n“For three months, heat was a regular curse, not an occasional blessing” in the UK, said the Financial Times. A record-breaking temperature of 40.3 degrees was recorded on 28 July, and a series of fires broke out across the country.\n\nA drought was officially declared in parts of England in August, with a hosepipe ban imposed in some areas as reservoir levels sunk. Analysis by the UK Health Security Agency published in October, found that 2,800 more people aged 65 and over died during the periods of high temperatures than would normally be expected.\n\n6. Wildfires, Europe\n\nThe Bordeaux region suffered devastating wildfires (Image credit: Thibaud Moritz/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nBy mid-August this year, wildfires had burned an area equivalent to the size of Azerbaijan, according to Euronews. Portugal, Italy and Romania were among the countries affected by blazes, and “wildfire carbon emissions broke all records in France and Spain”, said The Guardian.\n\n“Fire weather” – a mix of heat, dry conditions and wind – “is not new to the Mediterranean”, said Euractiv. But rising global temperatures are “creating more intense, less controllable fires, and driving these conditions” further across the continent.\n\n7. Heatwave, US\n\nCalifornia hit a record 116F in September (Image credit: Allen J. Schaben/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)\n\nCalifornia experienced its most extreme heat ever in September, “an epic grilling that disabled one of Twitter’s main data centers, pushed the power grid to its limit and triggered a succession of weather and safety alerts”, said the Los Angeles Times.\n\nTemperatures “sizzled” across the state as mercury readings soared above 100F, said CNN. “Such extreme heat events are being pushed into unprecedented territory”, scientists warned.\n\n8. Typhoon, Japan\n\nTyphoon Nanmadol hit southern Japan in September (Image credit: Yuichi Yamazaki/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nTyphoon Nanmadol was “one of the most powerful” storms that Japan had ever seen, said The Japan Times. Local authorities ordered the four million people living on Kyushu island to evacuate their homes in September.\n\nDespite “dumping heavy rain, paralysing traffic and leaving tens of thousands of homes without power”, said The Guardian, the Japan Meteorological Agency said that damage “appeared relatively limited”.\n\n9. Hurricane, US\n\nHurricane Ian caused havoc across Florida and the Carolinas (Image credit: Sean Rayford/Getty Images)\n\n“One of the strongest storms ever to hit the US mainland”, according to Reuters, made landfall on 28 September.\n\n“After pummeling Cuba”, said The Washington Post, Hurricane Ian “came ashore on the western coast of Florida with an unforgiving storm surge that gutted the first floors of buildings and winds that knocked out about a quarter of Florida’s power”. It then moved up the Atlantic coast, hitting North and South Carolina.\n\nMore than 100 people died in Florida as a result of the storm’s devastation, said The New York Times, more “than any hurricane in almost 90 years”.\n\n10. Typhoon, Philippines\n\nVillagers are rescued in Bulacan, Philippines (Image credit: Dante Diosina Jr/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n\nPhilippine residents are “accustomed to severe weather”, said CNN; the country experiences around 20 tropical storms a year. But locals living on the island of Polillo were “stunned by the intensity of Typhoon Noru” in September, with “ferocious winds that lifted waves and lashed properties on the shoreline”.\n\nNoru was initially expected to be a category one hurricane, but that was quickly escalated to a category five. It’s estimated that more than 100,000 people who rely on agriculture and fishing for their livelihoods were affected.\n\n11. Flooding, Australia\n\nSandbags are delivered in Forbes, NSW, in November (Image credit: Brendon Thorne/Getty Images)\n\nAustralia has been hit by a series of extreme floods this year “due to a multi-year La Nina weather phenomenon”, said Reuters, which increases the likelihood of higher average rainfall. Floods have “left thousands homeless and damaged agricultural industries”.\n\nCentral west New South Wales is right now braced for “its worst flooding in 70 years”, said The Guardian. Many people have been evacuated from their homes, as farmers “struggle to recover from repeated bouts of destruction to crops and livestock losses”.\n\n12. Snowstorm, US\n\nSeveral feet of snow fell on western New York in November (Image credit: John Normile/Getty Images)\n\nA “historic lake-effect snowstorm” that swept across western New York in November “buried” much of the region, “dropping over 80 inches of snow in four days”, said Fox Weather. At least four people were known to have died as a result of the intense snowfall.\n\nSchools and highways were shut as crews cleared away several feet of snow, and President Joe Biden ordered federal aid to help local authorities.\n\n13. Flooding, Democratic Republic of Congo\n\n‘Months’ of rain fell on the capital city of Kinshasa in December (Image credit: Augustin Wamenya/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n\nIn mid-December, “a ‘biblical’ downpour submerged swathes” of Kinshasa, central Africa’s “largest megacity”, said The Times. “Months of rain” caused landslides and floods in the Democratic Republic of Congo capital, with at least 120 people known to have died.\n\nPictures from the area showed “just the tops of buses visible on deluged roads” as people clung to passing debris. With a population of 17 million, Kinshasa’s “rapid development and poor planning regulation have made the city’s population vulnerable to extreme weather events”.", "authors": ["Julia O'Driscoll", "The Week Uk", "Last Updated", "Rebecca Messina", "Devika Rao", "The Week Us", "Joel Mathis", "Peter Weber", "Harriet Marsden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2014/10/01/pokin-around-african-queen-mystery-lone-pine/16525499/", "title": "Pokin Around: 'The African Queen' mystery on Lone Pine", "text": "Steve Pokin\n\nSPOKIN@NEWS-LEADER.COM\n\nI pull off South Lone Pine Avenue onto a gravel apron near a wrought-iron gate. Stone pillars flank the gate. Each pillar is topped with an elephant head.\n\nNot real elephant heads. Statues.\n\nMy plan, if you can call it that, is to knock on the door and ask whoever answers what's going on with this house.\n\nI drive by often en route to the recycling center just south of Lone Pine and Battlefield. The house's address is 2829 S. Lone Pine Ave. The place has an African theme. And it looks like money.\n\nI noticed when a wooden fence recently went up. The poles in the fence are joined with thick rope and have tips like sharpened pencils — tips that make me think of Africa and impalement.\n\nI was also curious because Wes Johnson, the News-Leader outdoors writer, had received an email complaint that the fence was dangerously sharp. Wes had written about deer impalement on metal fences with spikes.\n\nI'm lucky. A man in a black Porsche has pulled up; he punches in the code to open the gate. I introduce myself. It's the owner. His name is Michael Willhoit.\n\n\"I have been wanting this place for 10 years,\" he tells me.\n\nBut here's where things get weird. He tells me he can't talk to me in detail. But it's clear that he can't stop talking to me, although he remains frustratingly vague.\n\nHe tells me exactly how to phrase his unwillingness to converse with me.\n\n\"Tell them you were spying around and you got only a few words from the owner who was passing by. But he wanted it to be secret. And that the owner turned around and abruptly walked away.\"\n\n\"But you didn't walk away,\" I tell him. \"So I can't write that.\"\n\nHe says he must keep things hush-hush because of some big event involving the house and grounds scheduled for next summer. He calls it a \"deal.\"\n\n\"We are going to have that deal here.\"\n\nWhat's the \"deal\"?\n\n\"I can't tell you.\"\n\nHow much did you pay for the house?\n\n\"I can't tell you.\"\n\nHe and his wife Lisa bought the house and property in September, he says.\n\nWillhoit, 61, is about 5 foot 6 with a deep tan. He has sold exotic cars in Springfield since 1976. He owns Willhoit Enterprises at 1950 E. Chestnut Expressway and once, according to a 1999 News-Leader story, owned a custom-made Harley-Davidson Fat Boy motorcycle worth $70,000.\n\nHe plans to move in in May or June. All told, he says, he will put just under $2 million into upgrading the place. This includes landscaping and furnishing it in a mostly African motif.\n\nHe has named the place \"The African Queen.\" He's a fan of the 1951 movie starring Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn. Also, he just likes Africa.\n\n\"I have always been a wild Africa kind of guy.\"\n\nHe keeps talking so I keep asking questions. We mosey beyond the gate and move 10 to 20 feet up the drive. We're still a good 80 yards from the house.\n\nThe house has a creek running under it, he says.\n\n\"It was always rumored that it had a glass floor,\" he tells me. \"But it doesn't. I'm putting one in.\"\n\nI ask if I can go inside. He says no.\n\nI ask if I can take his picture. He says no, because it would give the impression he consented to an interview. He does not want anyone to think that.\n\nHe will furnish the house with African art from around the world, he says, including an elephant statue that is 8 feet tall and 10 feet long, as well as a bronze rhinoceros, a stuffed baboon and a 650-pound stuffed lion.\n\nI ask if he has hunted big game in Africa. He says yes, but adds that he's never killed anything.\n\n\"So you're an unsuccessful hunter?\" I ask.\n\nYes, he says.\n\n\"We are making this a work of art. A museum. We are going to spend about two years making it the way we want it.\"\n\nWillhoit slips away to talk on his phone. I hear him speaking softly: \"Hey Donnie, a gentleman is here from the newspaper talking about the fence.\"\n\nWillhoit finishes his call and tells me that city inspectors came out to look at the fence after receiving a complaint it was dangerous.\n\nThe fence is legally constructed, he says, and the inspectors told him so. It is 3½-feet high.\n\n\"I have personally seen deer jump the fence. ... If a deer can't jump a 3½-foot fence it doesn't deserve to be alive anyway.\"\n\nLater, I contact city officials and they confirm what Willhoit told me. Two complaints were made — one in March and one in April — and the conclusion was: \"The fence is not a violation of Section 26-62 of the City Code. Fence is under 4 feet and spaced properly. There is no ROW (right of way) or sidewalks close to the fence. It is well on the owner's property.\"\n\nIn 2001, Willhoit was a bachelor and his \"bachelor's home,\" with \"an African safari theme,\" was featured as the News-Leader's home of the week. The house is in the Millwood neighborhood in Springfield.\n\nAccording to that story, \"The safari and jungle theme gives the place a masculine feel. Elephant tusks, zebra stripes, fur rugs and green plants abound.\"\n\nWillhoit again tells me how to word my story — the one you're reading right now.\n\n\"You might title it: You get to go inside the African Queen in July.\n\nThen he says, \"Tell them that the owner never let you past the gate.\"\n\n\"But you did let me past the gate!\" I say.\n\n\"Tell them that the owner only let you a little bit past the gate.\"\n\nI make a suggestion: \"How about I just tell them I pistol-whipped you into talking to me?\"\n\n\"I like that,\" he says, slapping me on the shoulder.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/10/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2022/10/07/nj-new-black-heritage-trail-will-boost-pride-and-tourism/69543756007/", "title": "NJ's new Black Heritage Trail will boost pride and tourism. Here's how", "text": "Jay Watson\n\nSpecial to the USA TODAY Network\n\nFor four centuries, the Black community in New Jersey has been helping shape the state’s history, culture, arts, sciences, government, educational and religious institutions and business and industry. For just as long, Black residents have been seeking equality, justice and an end to racism.\n\nFrom north to south, this state we’re in is filled with places where significant events in Black history took place. Some are well known, like the museum in Cape May honoring abolitionist Harriet Tubman, and the stadium in Paterson that housed the first professional Black baseball leagues. But many are obscure, known to few outside their immediate area.\n\nThanks to a bill recently signed into law by Governor Phil Murphy, it will soon be easier to visit places that can help illuminate stories of the Black experience that have gone largely untold. The bill creates the Black Heritage Trail, which will lead visitors on a winding journey throughout the state, using historic markers to describe the contributions of notable Black residents and institutions.\n\nThe bipartisan bill was proposed by Cape May County Assemblyman Antwan McClellan and passed unanimously in both chambers of the state Legislature. It enables the creation of a Black Heritage Trail Commission, which will be given a $1 million budget to choose the sites, design and place the markers, and promote the trail.\n\n“This trail will highlight Black abolitionists, veterans, artists, entertainers and other leaders who have made their indelible marks on New Jersey’s history and deserve to be recognized and celebrated,” said McClellan in a statement.\n\nBelieved to be the first of its kind in the nation, the Black Heritage Trail is expected to boost tourism and provide an unparalleled educational resource. Visitors will be able to download itineraries and maps for a trip of up to three days to tour a multitude of landmarks, heritage sites, museums, and attractions.\n\nHere are a few must-see places:\n\nCape May: The Harriet Tubman Museum opened in 2021 to honor the civil rights icon who escaped slavery and helped bring dozens of other enslaved people to freedom on the Underground Railroad. Tubman lived and worked in Cape May for a period of time to raise funds to support her missions.\n\nThe Harriet Tubman Museum opened in 2021 to honor the civil rights icon who escaped slavery and helped bring dozens of other enslaved people to freedom on the Underground Railroad.

Paterson: Hinchliffe Stadium, currently undergoing renovations, is one of the last surviving Negro League venues from the early 1900s. It’s where Larry Doby, a city native and baseball Hall of Famer, spent his formative years before becoming the first Black player in the American League in 1947.\n\nHinchliffe Stadium, currently undergoing renovations, is one of the last surviving Negro League venues from the early 1900s.

There’s now a thriving performing arts center named in his honor. Atlantic City: The city best known for casinos and nightlife has a long Black history. In the era of segregation, Black families who wanted to swim in the ocean had to go to “Chicken Bone Beach,” now a famed location. Today, Atlantic City also has a Civil Rights Garden and an African American Heritage Museum.\n\nThese are only a fraction of the state’s significant — and fascinating — Black heritage sites.\n\nThere’s also the Afro-American Historical Society Museum in Jersey City, the African Art Museum of the SMA Fathers in Tenafly, the Macedonian African Methodist Episcopal Church and Butler Cemetery in Camden, the Perth Amboy gravesite of Thomas Mundy Peterson, the first Black man in American to vote in an election; and the Shady Rest Golf and Country Club in Scotch Plains, the first Black-owned golf and country club in the United States.\n\nA few lesser-known Black heritage sites that should be part of the trail include the Stoutsburg Sourland African American Museum in Montgomery Township; Marshalltown, a settlement in Mannington Township where free landowning African-Americans prospered throughout the 19th century; Timbuctoo in Westampton Township, a 19th century settlement believed to have been founded by escaped slaves; and the Medford Township office of Dr. James Still, a renowned herbalist and homeopathic healer known as “The Black Doctor of the Pines.”\n\n“The inclusion of the Stoutsburg Sourland African American Museum (SSAAM) in New Jersey's Black Heritage Trail represents an important acknowledgement of the history of African American communities in the Sourland region, spanning from times of enslavement to the present, and their substantial contributions to the cultural and economic development of Central New Jersey,” said Donnetta Johnson, the museum’s executive director.\n\n“Including the Dr. James Still Historic Office Site to the Black Heritage Trail would be awesome and much deserved,” said historian Samuel Still, a descendant of James Still, noting that it's the only historic site in the state park system named after an African American.\n\nOther candidates include the Red Bank home of T. Thomas Fortune, a leading African-American journalist and civil rights advocate in the early 1900s; the school in Trenton at the center of a 1940s New Jersey Supreme Court decision ending segregation, and a Bordentown school for Blacks once known as the “Tuskegee of the North.”\n\nThis legislation and funding are a great start for highlighting and connecting these places, but we must also continue to seek ways and means to protect, restore and manage these important places that have contributed to who we are as a state and nation.\n\nNew Jersey is one of America’s most diverse states, and the Black Heritage Trail will spotlight the Black community’s achievements and contributions, as well as its trials and tribulations. In the state’s quest for equity, unity and inclusion, this type of educational tourism is needed and welcomed!\n\nMuch of the groundwork for the Black Heritage Trail has already been laid. Last year, the state Division of Travel and Tourism created a website with a preliminary list of sites; see them at https://visitnj.org/Black-Heritage.\n\nAnd for information about preserving New Jersey’s land and natural resources, visit the New Jersey Conservation Foundation website at www.njconservation.org or contact me at info@njconservation.org.\n\nJay Watson is co-executive director of the New Jersey Conservation Foundation.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/07"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/sport/958323/23-biggest-sporting-events-2023", "title": "23 of the biggest sporting events in 2023 | The Week", "text": "1.

Seven of them were arrested in Zurich ahead of the FIFA congress and are awaiting extradition.\n\nIn a separate investigation, Swiss authorities are looking into the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bidding process.\n\nThe crisis, the worst in FIFA's 111-year history, has led to the resignation of President Sepp Blatter, who had won a fifth, four-year term two days after the arrests. The 79-year-old Blatter has not yet been officially implicated in either investigation.\n\nRussia won the right to host the 2018 World Cup and Qatar was awarded the 2022 tournament. Australia, one of the losing bidders for the 2022 World Cup, launched its own investigation Thursday into corruption claims surrounding its failed bid.\n\nIn Pretoria, documents were being handed over to the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation unit and needed to be investigated fully, Alberts said.\n\n\"The information is quite raw,\" the lawmaker said, adding people were \"coming out of the woodwork\" with information now that a wider U.S. Department of Justice probe into corruption at FIFA was underway.\n\nThe South African crime unit's spokesman, Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi, told The Associated Press that a file had been opened and the unit would decide whether the documents provided by the Freedom Front Plus called for a full investigation.\n\n\"There are investigators looking into the matter,\" Mulaudzi said.\n\nMulaudzi would not describe the contents of the documents. In a statement, his unit said they concerned \"the FIFA issues.\"\n\nIn the Justice Department's indictment, senior South African bid officials and the government were accused of channeling $10 million through FIFA to some of its top executives as bribes for them backing the country's bid to host the 2010 World Cup, the first in Africa.\n\nOne of the FIFA officials, Chuck Blazer, admitted in court documents unsealed on Wednesday in the U.S. to receiving bribes around the vote that gave the World Cup to South Africa.\n\nSouth Africa won the 2004 vote 14-10 over Morocco, which was also accused of trying to bribe voters.\n\nThe South African government has denied involvement in any bribes, and said the $10 million was an \"above-board payment\" given to former FIFA vice president Jack Warner to help soccer development in his Caribbean region.\n\nInstead, Warner and Blazer, both former FIFA executive committee members, shared the money, the Justice Department says. Another FIFA official from South America is also implicated in bribes for voting for South Africa.\n\nWarner is one of the 14 indicted officials in the U.S. investigation, which appears to stem from Blazer's guilty plea in 2013 to racketeering and other charges.\n\nFormer South African president Thabo Mbeki also denied any knowledge of any bribes when he was in office during the bid process.\n\nAlberts said he also had information on other supposed improper payments connected to South Africa's World Cup bid \"above and beyond\" the $10 million that went to Warner and Blazer.\n\nSo far there has been no contact between South Africa's crime unit, known as the Hawks, and the FBI, but Mulaudzi said South African investigators were willing to work with the Americans if required.\n\nNo specific officials were yet being investigated, Mulaudzi added, denying reports that current South African soccer head and 2010 World Cup organizer Danny Jordaan was implicated in the bribery allegations.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/06/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/03/27/april-2024-total-eclipse-news/73108826007/", "title": "Solar eclipse on April 8, 2024: Eclipse glasses, forecast and time", "text": "Editor's note: An updated cloud forecast for the April 2024 total solar eclipse is in. Read the latest eclipse forecast and news as of Wednesday, April 3.\n\nWe're less than two weeks away from the astronomical event of the decade: A total eclipse of the sun, which will grace the nation's skies from Texas to Maine on the afternoon of Monday, April 8.\n\nMillions of people are expected to travel to see the spectacle, which will also attract scientists from across the country to study its unique effects on the Earth and its atmosphere. (Meanwhile, brands such as Burger King, Pizza Hut, Applebee's and Sonic are getting in on the eclipse excitement too.)\n\nThe full total solar eclipse experience will plunge people along a narrow path into darkness midday, but people outside the path of totality could still use eclipse glasses to see the moon pass in front of the sun. It's an awesome and confusing sight on the ground and in the sky.\n\nIt should go without saying:Don't drive while wearing eclipse glasses\n\nOne task to do now is to get yourself a pair of special eclipse glasses (and luckily there's still time to score a free pair of eclipse glasses). They're important eyewear during an eclipse because they will block out the sun's harmful rays, which could damage your eyes when you're looking at the sun — even if it's partially blocked.\n\nSolar eclipse glasses are still readily available from plenty of vendors across the internet as of Thursday, March 28. But be wary of counterfeit or fake glasses, experts warned.\n\nThe other big factor everyone's anxiously awaiting is the weather forecast, which most experts say is still a bit far away for a specific forecast. But more detailed, realistic forecasts will start to roll in over the next few days.\n\nOf particular interest will be the cloud forecast, as a deck of thick, low clouds would likely ruin the entire event. But if the clouds are higher up in the atmosphere, such as thin, wispy cirrus, they'd act to diffuse but not ruin the eclipse.\n\nUSA TODAY 10Best:10 solar eclipse fun facts to share with your friends\n\nThere's plenty to know before the big day, which won't happen again for about two decades. Read on for answers for all your eclipse questions, including how to watch the eclipse, understand the eclipse and use eclipse glasses to stay safe.\n\nHow do I watch the 2024 solar eclipse?\n\nThere are a few ways of watching the eclipse:\n\nGet the full experience in person : If you're in a narrow band of U.S. land that spans from Texas to Maine, you could see the moon block the sun and its shadow cast a night-like darkness over Earth for a few minutes. You'll briefly be able to look up without eye protection and see the moon block the sun.\n\n: If you're in a narrow band of U.S. land that spans from Texas to Maine, you could see the moon block the sun and its shadow cast a night-like darkness over Earth for a few minutes. You'll briefly be able to look up without eye protection and see the moon block the sun. Watch from outside the path of totality : Much of the U.S. is set to get a partial view of the eclipse that isn't nearly as impressive as being in the path of totality. Earth won't be plunged into complete darkness and you'll have to wear protective eyewear to see the moon partially block the sun.\n\n: Much of the U.S. is set to get a partial view of the eclipse that isn't nearly as impressive as being in the path of totality. Earth won't be plunged into complete darkness and you'll have to wear protective eyewear to see the moon partially block the sun. Watch a livestream: Check back on April 8 for a video feed from the path of totality. It's not the same as being there in person, but hey, at least you won't have to sit in traffic.\n\nTotality explained:The real April 2024 total solar eclipse happens inside the path of totality\n\nWhat time is the solar eclipse on April 8?\n\nThe eclipse will begin in Texas at 1:27 p.m. CDT and end in Maine at 3:35 p.m. EDT, but the exact time of the eclipse varies by where you are in its path.\n\nYou can search by zip code to find the exact time for your location.\n\nWhere will the April eclipse be visible?\n\nAll of the lower 48 U.S. states will see the moon at least clip the sun, but that sight is a trifle compared to being in the path of totality.\n\nBecause the narrow path includes or is near some of the nation's largest cities, expect millions of people to crowd into a band of land a little over 100 miles wide that spans from the Texas/Mexico border to the Maine/Canada border.\n\nHere are the major cities in each state where you can expect to experience totality (note that the included times do not account for when the partial eclipse begins and ends):\n\nDallas, Texas: 1:40-1:44 p.m. CDT\n\nIdabel, Oklahoma: 1:45-1:49 p.m. CDT\n\nLittle Rock, Arkansas: 1:51-1:54 p.m. CDT\n\nPoplar Bluff, Missouri: 1:56-2:00 p.m. CDT\n\nPaducah, Kentucky: 2-2:02 p.m. CDT\n\nCarbondale, Illinois: 1:59-2:03 p.m. CDT\n\nEvansville, Indiana: 2:02-2:05 p.m. CDT\n\nCleveland, Ohio: 3:13-3:17 p.m. EDT\n\nErie, Pennsylvania: 3:16-3:20 p.m. EDT\n\nBuffalo, New York: 3:18-3:22 p.m. EDT\n\nBurlington, Vermont: 3:26-3:29 p.m. EDT\n\nLancaster, New Hampshire: 3:27-3:30 p.m. EDT\n\nCaribou, Maine: 3:32-3:34 p.m. EDT\n\nWill clouds block the April 2024 eclipse?\n\nIt's too soon to say for sure, but history offers some clues.\n\nChances of cloudy skies are pretty high along much of the eclipse's northern path, and some areas such as Buffalo have about a 1-in-3 chance of clear skies in early April.\n\nSkies are usually more clear to the south. Right along the Texas/Mexico border, chances of a clear sky can be nearly 75%.\n\nHowever, early forecasts tell a different story — although forecaster caution it's too early for truly accurate forecasts.\n\nKeep in mind that clouds don't always ruin an eclipse. High, wispy clouds won't spoil the show in the same way that low thick clouds would. In that case, you wouldn't be able to see the moon pass in front of the sun, but you would still notice a sudden darkness in the path of totality.\n\nWhat dangers are associated with the eclipse?\n\nThe eclipse, as exciting and fun as it promises to be, comes with a growing number of safety warnings — both for what will happen in the sky and what will happen on the ground.\n\nIn addition to the dangers of looking at the eclipse without proper eyewear, we've heard warnings about potentially dangerous fake eclipse glasses, the possibility for increased car crashes around the time of the eclipse — and possible air travel headaches due to delayed or cancelled flights.\n\nWhere is the best place to watch the eclipse?\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the eclipse, Texas was considered the best state for eclipse viewing. Historically, there's a good chance the skies will be clear and its location along the southern path of the eclipse means totality will last a little longer. That could change as the forecast evolves.\n\nA few lucky travelers will also have a front-row seat with unobstructed views — from a plane.\n\nWill traffic be bad?\n\nMost likely, yes — especially after the eclipse ends. Millions of people will crowd into the narrow path of totality, then many will attempt to leave all at once as soon as the eclipse is over.\n\nWhen a total solar eclipse passed over the U.S. in 2017, reports say some traffic jams didn't fully clear for more than 12 hours. Even worse, a recent study reported that the 2017 eclipse \"was associated with increased risks of a fatal traffic crash\" – potentially as much as a 31% increase, the study said.\n\nAlso worth noting: The eclipse is expected to have impacts for air travel as well.\n\nCities across the eclipse's path of totality are also bracing for an influx of visitors who are already booking up hotels and short-term vacation rentals, officials have told USA TODAY. \"Hotels are almost sold out,\" said Shalissa Perry, the chief marketing officer for Downtown Dallas.\n\nWhy are schools closing for the eclipse?\n\nPrimarily out of a concern for students' safety, schools across the country have given students the day of the eclipse, April 8, as a day off, a half day or a chance for e-learning. In Tennessee, for example, officials also say it gives students a chance to experience the eclipse with their family and friends.\n\nWhat's it like to watch a solar eclipse from space?\n\nEver wondered what it is like see the solar eclipse from space? NASA scientist and veteran astronaut Terry Virts has witnessed the spectacle in space.\n\n\"When I was in space in 2015, we saw an eclipse over the North Atlantic,\" Virts told USA TODAY this week. \"It was an eclipse that very few humans saw I think, but it was a really unique experience to look down and just see this big black circle kind of moving across the planet.\"\n\n\"It was unlike anything I've ever seen,\" Virts adds. \"I joke I'm glad they told us there was an eclipse because it would have been unsettling to look down at Earth and see this black spot moving across. It was really cool.\"\n\nVirts, who is the face of Sonic's eclipse-themed Blackout Slush Float, said that though he's seen one eclipse from space and many from Earth, he is super excited about the upcoming one on April 8.\n\nWhat is a solar eclipse? Definition explained.\n\nA total solar eclipse happens when three celestial spheres — the sun, moon and Earth — line up in a specific way in space.\n\nAccording to NASA, a solar eclipse happens when the moon passes between the sun and Earth. That alignment casts a moving shadow on Earth that either fully or partially blocks the sun's light in some areas. This leads to a period of partial or full darkness on a narrow stretch of Earth.\n\nThe path is so narrow because of the huge distance and size of the sun — as well as the moon's distance from Earth. That focuses the moon's shadow on an area of land much smaller than the moon itself. The movement of the shadow across the land happens as the Earth's rotation interacts with the orbit of the moon.\n\nA total eclipse only happens occasionally because the moon doesn't orbit in the exact same plane as the sun and Earth do. In addition, a solar eclipse can only happen during a new moon.\n\nWhat's special about a total solar eclipse?\n\nThe total solar eclipse on April 8 is causing such a stir because the rare event is an astronomical experience like no other that will be unusually accessible to millions of people.\n\nApril's total solar eclipse will fall over more places in the U.S. than the total eclipse before and after it. And the broad length of the path of totality – where Americans have the best shot of getting a clear view – is \"much wider\" than it was for the eclipse in 2017, according to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\nA total solar eclipse is also far more impressive than a lunar or an annular solar eclipse. During an annular eclipse, the moon covers the Sun but leaves an outside ring some call a \"ring of fire\" — it darkens the sky instead of plunging Earth into a night-like darkness, which is what happens during a total solar eclipse. And a lunar eclipse – the appearance of a red moon – happens when the moon passes into the Earth's shadow, according to NASA.\n\nTotal solar eclipses can have spiritual significance, too. Ancient cultures viewed as a sign of the gods' anger or impending departure. Some religions today are hosting eclipse viewings and services.\n\nHistorically, eclipses have left major marks on religious and spiritual civilizations. In Christianity, an eclipse has been associated with the darkness that accompanied Jesus' crucifixion and in Islam, the passing of the Prophet Muhammad's son Ibrahim.\n\nWhen was the last solar eclipse?\n\nThe USA's most recent total solar eclipse was on August 21, 2017, and stretched from Oregon to South Carolina.\n\nWhen will the next solar eclipse happen?\n\nThe next visible total solar eclipse to cross over the U.S. after April will come in more than two decades on Aug. 23, 2044, according to NASA.\n\nAnd that eclipse won't be as accessible as the 2024 one: The path of totality in 2044 will only touch the states of Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota, according to the Planetary Society, a nonprofit involved in research, public outreach and political space advocacy. Another total eclipse will pass over the U.S. in 2045 that will be more accessible to Americans, including for people who live in California, Florida and Nevada.\n\nWhat are eclipse glasses and why are they needed for the eclipse?\n\nGazing at the bright rays from the eclipse without protective eyewear can seriously damage your eye, so wearing a pair of protective glasses is important.\n\nThere's a technical standard for eclipse glasses, which are designed to block out most light and let you safely see the moon pass in front of the sun: It's called ISO 12312-2 after the International Organization of Standardization.\n\nWhile there's concerns that not all glasses marketed as eclipse glasses live up to that standard, experts say in the past, the shortcomings haven't been significant.\n\nBut as the 2024 eclipse approaches, the American Astronomical Society has warned that there are some counterfeit and fake eclipse glasses being sold from unverified vendors that would be unsafe to use during the eclipse. They recommend buying from a vetted vendor and testing the glasses before the eclipse.\n\nHow do I get solar eclipse glasses?\n\nYou should buy from a reputable source who can ship the glasses to you in time for April 8. A guide to last-minute eclipse glasses explains more.\n\nHeads up: The online marketplace is flooded with retailers selling solar eclipse glasses they claim have the NASA seal of approval. Consider that a red flag to look elsewhere.\n\nHow can you test eclipse glasses?\n\nNASA shared an easy method to check eclipse glasses at home.\n\nBuyers should put on their glasses and look at a bright light, like a flashlight. If the light is \"extremely dim,\" or doesn't appear at all, the glasses are safe, Susannah Darling, of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, said in an instructional video. Viewers should be able to see the filament of the lightbulb, not the glow surrounding the bulb.\n\nCan you really go blind watching a solar eclipse?\n\nYou could severely damage your eyes. Directly staring at the sun before and after the total eclipse, or watching a partial eclipse outside the path of totality without proper eye protection, can result in permanent damage including blurred and altered vision.\n\nWhile rare, eye damage from watching a partial eclipse happens in part because a person's natural response to squint when looking at sunlight does not get triggered. In the lead-up to the April 8 solar eclipse, doctors and a rare set of eclipse watchers are warning about watching this planetary event without adequate eclipse glasses or with the naked eye.\n\nIt’s hard for experts to know or even estimate how many people experience eye damage from solar eclipses. Since looking at an eclipse does not cause complete blindness, people with permanent damage may not know they have it or report it to a doctor. The 2017 eclipse, which passed from Oregon to South Carolina, is thought to have caused about 100 cases, according to the American Astronomical Society.\n\nHow can I watch the eclipse without glasses?\n\nIf you don't have access to eclipse glasses do not use regular sunglasses — You need a more creative solution for safe viewing, like a pinhole projector.\n\nWelding glasses are not recommended for eclipse viewing.\n\nShould I take dogs or cats to see the eclipse? Is it safe for pets?\n\nAn eclipse itself isn't dangerous for domestic animals such as dogs and cats, but experts say it's probably best to not bring pets.\n\nExperts' biggest concern is not what’s happening in the sky but on the ground as crowds of excited and anxious people gather, said Dr. Rena Carlson, president of the American Veterinary Medical Association.\n\n“Rather than the effects of the eclipse, I would be more worried about the excitement and all of the people,” she said.\n\nAnother fun way to experience the eclipse: disco balls\n\nDon't just reach for the solar glasses; a disco ball might be a fun and safe way to enhance the total solar eclipse experience.\n\nInspired by a research paper from European scientists, the Round Rock Public Library in Round Rock, Texas, near Austin, used disco balls during the annular eclipse in October and recommends people do the same for the April 8 eclipse. Officials said the use of a disco ball creates a \"party-like atmosphere\" to make a solar eclipse event more fun.\n\nThe mirrored ball can be placed outside where it can catch the sunlight and reflect it on a shaded wall at least several feet away, or it can be inside near a window to cast reflections of the sun around the room. Youth Services Librarian Andrea Warkentin recommends people get disco balls that have smaller mirrors on them as they will create bigger and better images.\n\n\"It's a way to make it really memorable and fun for little kids who may not really understand what's going on in the sky,\" Warkentin said.\n\n-Fernanda Figueroa, Austin American-Statesman\n\nContributing: Ramon Padilla, Karina Zaiets and Janet Loehrke", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/03/09/why-is-the-april-2024-total-eclipse-a-big-deal/72853143007/", "title": "Why is the solar eclipse such a big deal?

And those places will attract sky gazers from all over the country.\n\nSearches for short-term Airbnb rentals around those areas have surged.

But on Wednesday morning, zoo visitors learned they have something big (and furry) to look forward to again.\n\nThe zoo said Wednesday that it's set to receive male panda Bao Li and female panda Qing Bao, both 2 years old, from China sometime in 2024.\n\nThe news comes after Mei Xiang and Tian Tian − who had been in the U.S. for 23 years − and Xiao Qi Ji, who was born in August 2020, returned to China in November following a bittersweet farewell in Washington.\n\nZoo staff put up new banners Wednesday letting visitors know, \"the pandas are coming.\"\n\nFlanked by stalks of bamboo on the zoo’s Asia Trail, local graduate student Summer Zhou said the environment felt ready for the panda’s return.\n\n“I just feel like their spirit is still here,” she said. “They never left my heart.”\n\nFamilies rolled strollers beneath the decorations as they walked through the zoo's entrance. Teresa Willibey, 30, was among them with her 4-year-old son and 5-year-old daughter, visiting from Buffalo, New York.\n\n“It’s exciting for my kids to get to see them so they can learn more about other animals,” said the former Washington resident.\n\nThe two new giant pandas will replace the trio that came before them beginning sometime before the end of 2024, said Lonnie Bunch, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, in a social media video announcing the news.\n\n\"I'm thrilled to announce that within this year we'll once again welcome a new pair of giant pandas,\" Bunch said.\n\nOne of the new pandas is closely related to the pair that just left the zoo, officials said Wednesday.\n\nPANDA MASCOT:The National Zoo pandas are gone. Among those hardest hit is 'Pantwon.'\n\nWho are Bao Li and Qing Bao, the new pandas?\n\nBao Li is the grandson of Tian Tian and Mei Xiang, the pandas who returned to China in November. Bao Li's mother is Bao Bao, the pair's second offspring, born in 2013 at the National Zoo.\n\nBao Li means \"treasure\" and \"energetic\" in Mandarin Chinese, according to the zoo.\n\nQing Bao means \"green\" and \"treasure,\" the zoo said Wednesday in a statement.\n\nThe zoo also said a new 10-year research and breeding agreement has been signed with China.\n\nHow long have pandas been at the National Zoo?\n\nThe first panda came to the U.S. from China in 1972, and the fluffy animals have been a staple of Washington's Smithsonian National Zoo ever since.\n\nThe zoo's previous pandas Mei Xiang, Tian Tian and Xiao Qi Ji returned to China last year after attempts to renew the Smithsonian's 3-year agreement with the China Wildlife Conservation Association failed.\n\nWednesday's announcement follows increased engagement between Washington and Beijing which has put ties on a steadier footing since relations hit historic lows last year.\n\nChina's ambassador to the United States Xie Feng said the new panda cooperation agreement was “a very good sign” for U.S.-China relations.\n\n\"To deepen the friendly ties between our two peoples, today I am very glad to share with you some good news,\" he said during remarks at the zoo.\n\nWashington is not the only city that will soon be home to the pandas.\n\nZoos in California announced earlier this year they would also continue to benefit from the more than 50 years of diplomacy surrounding the giant pandas.\n\nIn February, the San Diego Zoo announced it will be getting a new pair of pandas, Xin Bao and Yun Chuan. In April, the San Francisco Zoo said it will host pandas again for the first time since 1985. Timelines for both zoos have not yet been announced.\n\nThe latest example of 'panda diplomacy'\n\nIn 1972, China gifted the first panda to the U.S. after President Richard Nixon formalized normal relations with China. Since then China has loaned pandas to other foreign zoos in hopes that it will build ties with those countries.\n\nThe practice has been dubbed \"panda diplomacy.\"\n\nBarbara Bodine, director of the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy at Georgetown University and a former U.S. ambassador to Yemen with more than 30 years’ experience in U.S. foreign service, said the the bears are “probably the most successful soft diplomacy animals any nation has ever come up with.\"\n\nBodine doesn't think the panda moves reveal too much about the current relationship between the U.S. and China, which is certainly strained. But the attention does show how effective the bears are at generating a “warm, fuzzy feeling.\"\n\nBodine hopes the pandas are greeted with this optimistic spirit: “The children of America thank you, and the pandas are a wonderful representation of the Chinese people and their culture.”\n\nNews of pandas' arrival sparks excitement in Washington\n\nChildren, filled with excitement, shouted the names of their favorite animals as they ventured through the zoo's entrance on Wednesday morning.\n\n“Can I see the panda?” one young visitor asked her parents.\n\nEven though Willibey's family had already left the Washington area, they were still sad to see the black and white bears go last year.\n\n“It worked out that we weren't affected too much, but we were bummed that it was happening in general,” she said.\n\nAlthough her kids shouted in excitement about the pandas, Willibey expressed a note of concern. “I feel kind of mixed,” she said. “It's exciting that it's coming back… but at the same time, maybe it should be growing up where it's supposed to come from.”\n\nTo Eric Williams, a longtime Washington resident, and his 7-year-old daughter, the loss of the pandas deprived the zoo of one of its main attractions.\n\n“It kind of took away from a big part of coming here,” Williams, 50, said as he shepherded his daughter and her first grade classmates past the otter exhibit. “My kids have always enjoyed seeing them.”\n\nWilliams isn’t a frequent zoo visitor, but he returned on Wednesday morning to accompany the class on a school field trip.\n\nGRAPHICSTrace more than 50 years of panda diplomacy between the US, China\n\nThe kids also had the pandas on their minds. “Actually, on the ride here, they were asking about them,” Williams said. “Whether they were going to get the opportunity to see the pandas.”\n\nWilliams’ message about the return of the pandas – the more, the merrier.\n\n“Probably need a little more,” he said. “I’d say minimum, five or six. Give everybody an opportunity to see them.”\n\nGrad student Zhou said she can hardly wait for the pandas to return – the zoo just isn’t the same to her without them.\n\n“It definitely feels like a missing component of the zoo,” said Zhou, a 25-year-old graduate student studying sustainability at American University in Washington's Tenleytown neighborhood, just north of the zoo.\n\nZhou, originally from Texas, traveled the short distance from her home with a fellow grad student on Wednesday morning to get up close with the animals.\n\nVideos she captured of the pandas last summer are more than just a memento to Zhou – they’re a life lesson.\n\n“When I watch them, I get relaxed too,” she said. “They’re like these big, fluffy animals who know how to enjoy life.”\n\nContributing: Julia Gomez, Saman Shafiq, USA TODAY; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/09/29/panda-bears-leaving-us-return-to-china/71002912007/", "title": "Panda bears leaving the US to return to China: National Zoo loses 3", "text": "There will soon be no pandas in the U.S. for the first time since 1972, after U.S. zoos' agreements with China are set to expire by the end of next year.\n\nThe National Zoo in Washington, D.C. announced that its pandas Tian Tian, Mei Xiang, and Xiao QI Ji will return to China by December.

The adult pandas were supposed to stay for a decade as part of a research and breeding agreement, but the program with China was extended several times.\n\nThe once-endangered species are now designated as \"vulnerable,\" following a population growth of nearly 17% between 2007 and 2017. The International Union for Conservation of Nature upgraded giant Pandas on the global list of species at risk of extinction, according the World Wildlife Fund.

The animal that once numbered somewhere between 40 million and 60 million had dwindled to a few isolated groups.\n\n\"He was duty bound to preserve the record that the bison species ever existed at all,\" Coffman said.\n\nHornaday spent three months in 1886 hunting the uplands northwest of Miles City between the Yellowstone and Missouri rivers and harvested six bison to be taken back to the nation's capitol, taxidermied and placed on display at the Smithsonian.\n\nThe trip was a turning point for not only Hornaday, but also for the American conservation movement and the foundation of a National Zoological Park.\n\n\"The wild buffalo is practically gone forever, and in a few more years, when the whitened bones of the last bleaching skeleton shall have been picked up and shipped East for commercial uses, nothing will remain of him, save his old, well-worn trails along the water-courses, a few museum specimens, and regret for his fate,\" Hornaday wrote is an 1887 report titled \"The Extermination of the American Bison.\"\n\nIt was with that grim prediction that Hornaday pleaded to his superiors at the Smithsonian to allow him to also bring live bison to the museum. Those superiors agreed.\n\n\"He housed them right on the grounds of the Natural History Museum, right on the Mall,\" Coffman said. \"You can imagine that they quickly outgrew their space.\"\n\nNeeding additional space for the large animals, Hornaday went to Congress and lobbied for funding to start a national zoo.\n\nIn 1889, Congress passed an act establishing the National Zoological Park. In 1891, the National Zoo, part of the Smithsonian, opened in its current location in Rock Creek Park inside the District of Columbia.\n\nIn celebration of its 125th anniversary, the National Zoo recently opened a bison exhibit featuring two young bison cows from Montana.\n\nThe bison were donated by the American Prairie Reserve near Malta.\n\n\"They're awesome,\" said Steven Sarro, curator for the National Zoological Park. \"These two girls have been incredible.\"\n\nThe new bison exhibit at the zoo is in the same location where bison originally were housed at the Rock Creek Park facility.\n\nBison have been housed at the zoo as recently as 11 or 12 years ago, Sarro said.\n\n\"The director was interested in bringing bison back to the National Zoo for the 125-year anniversary,\" he said.\n\nThe two bison are genetically pure, meaning they haven't been cross-bred with cattle.\n\n\"Bison can hybridize with domestic cattle,\" Sarro explained.\n\nThe bison are named Zora and Wilma, weigh 550 and 500 pounds respectively, and are expected to grow to up to 1,100 pounds.\n\nHoward University and Gallaudet University, both located in Washington, D.C., and both of which have bison mascots, named the animals. Howard University students chose to name one bison Zora in honor of alumna Zora Neal Hurston, acclaimed author, poet and civil rights activist.\n\nStudents at Gallaudet University selected the name Wilma in honor of alumna Wilma Newhoudt-Druchen, the first deaf woman elected to serve in the Republic of South Africa's parliament.\n\nSarro was concerned about how well the bison would adapt to a pen with crowds watching them, after coming from a large range where they might see one or two people per week. They settled in easily.\n\n\"I've worked with bison before, and these two are incredible,\" he said.\n\nThe new bison exhibit represents more than just two new animals at the National Zoo.\n\n\"They're so iconic for, not only the United States, but for the National Zoo,\" Sarro said. \"There's a huge history, not only for natural history, but for social history that goes along with bison.\"\n\nThe Hornaday bison\n\nThe six bison Hornaday harvested in eastern Montana were on display at the Smithsonian until the mid-1950s.\n\n\"I get the sense that some guy came along, and said I'm not dusting these anymore,\" said Randy Morger, executive director of the River and Plains Society in Fort Benton.\n\nThe decision was made to remove the bison, and while the display was being dismantled, a worker found a note tucked into a metal box hidden in the display.\n\nHornaday had written a note across the top of the title page of an article that appeared in Cosmopolitan Magazine in 1888. The article was titled \"The Passing of the Buffalo,\" by William T. Hornaday.\n\n\"My illustrious successor,\" Hornaday wrote, \"Enclosed, please find a brief and truthful account of the capture of the specimens which compose this group. The Old Bull, the young cow and the yearling calf were killed by yours truly. When I am dust and ashes, I beg you to protect these specimens from deterioration and destruction ...\"\n\n\"That's all written in his own hand,\" Coffman said. \"By the time the message was found in 1957, Hornaday was 20 years in the grave.\"\n\nThe Smithsonian went forward with plans to remove the display and sent the animals to the University of Montana, in Missoula, then called Montana State University.\n\nThey were displayed for a short time at the field house, then moved to storage.\n\n\"From the late 1950s onward ... the specimens just fell into obscurity,\" Coffman said.\n\nCoffman, an independent scholar who has long been interested in bison, in the 1980s did a major review of bison literature and kept coming across references to the famous bison group that stood in the National Museum. What Coffman couldn't find was information on what had happened to the bison specimens.\n\n\"I became curious and started asking around,\" said Coffman, who previously lived in Missoula and now lives in Portland, Ore.\n\nIt took several years, but he eventually tracked down all six animals. Two were in storage at Fort Missoula. Three more were housed in the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman. The large bull had been kept temporarily at the Fish, Wildlife and Parks office in Helena and was moved to the River and Plains Society in Fort Benton in the 1970s.\n\n\"That's where I finally encountered it in '88 or '89.\"\n\nCoffman, along with Jack Lepley, then-director of the River and Plains Society, launched a campaign to reunite all six bison specimens at the River and Plains Society. After a fund drive, the restored animals were returned to Fort Benton in 1992. The drive also raised funds for Museum of the Northern Great Plains to be built, opening in 1996.\n\nThe Hornaday Bison still stand today at the Museum of the Northern Great Plains in Fort Benton, displayed almost exactly as they appeared for nearly 70 years at the Smithsonian.\n\nThe beginning of a movement\n\nThe bison display represents the beginning of wildlife conservation in America.\n\n\"(Hornaday) is generally credited with galvanizing the American conservation movement,\" Coffman said.\n\nHe founded the American Bison Society, where he was co-president with Theodore Roosevelt and also went on the save the Alaskan fur seal, create the Migratory Bird Act and found the New York Zoological Society.\n\nHe waged what is now called the 30-year war for wildlife, and it all started with the bison, Coffman said.\n\nCoffman attended the grand opening of the new bison exhibit in late August.\n\n\"It was a momentous time because of William Hornaday's legacy,\" he said.\n\n\"Our founder William Temple Hornaday envisioned a national zoo where bison and other vanishing species would thrive,\" said Dennis Kelly, director of the National Zoo.\n\nWith the opening of the newest exhibit, bison now thrive at the zoo and in the wild, where they are far from being a vanishing species.\n\nReach Tribune staff writer Erin Madison at 406-791-1466 or emadison@greatfallstribune.com.

For the latest on severe weather, view our updates file for Wednesday, May 8.\n\nFour tornadoes swept through Michigan Tuesday as tens of millions of people across the Central United States braced for severe storms, damaging hail and powerful winds.\n\nA tornado watch – which indicates conditions are ripe for tornadoes to form – was issued by the National Weather Service for much of Indiana, western Ohio and southern Michigan at 5 p.m. The weather service confirmed four tornadoes in Michigan, injuring at least one person and damaging several buildings, including a FedEx facility in Portage that collapsed.\n\n\"A few tornadoes are likely with a couple intense tornadoes possible,\" the Storm Prediction Center warned. The watch will stay in effect until 8:00 p.m. CDT.\n\nOverall, much of the central and eastern United States remains at risk for severe thunderstorms Tuesday from Texas to Wyoming and as far east as Pennsylvania and the Carolinas, according to the Weather Prediction Center. More than 13 million people in Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky were at \"enhanced risk\" of seeing storms capable of unleashing \"very large hail\" and strong tornadoes.\n\nScattered supercell thunderstorms were forecast to spread across southern and eastern Indiana into western Ohio into late Tuesday. Supercells are the least common type of thunderstorm and tend to produce severe weather, including damaging winds, large hail and sometimes tornadoes, according to the weather service.\n\nIn addition to Chicago and Indianapolis, other metro areas at greatest risk for severe weather on Tuesday included Cincinnati, Columbus and Louisville, the Storm Prediction Center said.\n\nTuesday's foul weather comes a day after strong storms battered the Plains region on Monday, spinning up multiple tornadoes that killed at least one person, destroyed buildings and knocked out power to thousands of households.\n\nThe threat of severe weather is forecast to continue across the Ohio Valley and mid-South regions on Wednesday, the Storm Prediction Center said.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ The violent weather outbreak has caused nearly 250 incidents of severe weather since Monday, including more than a dozen tornadoes and large hail, according to AccuWeather.\n\n∎ At 7 p.m., more than 50,000 customers were without electricity across the region that saw storms over the previous 24 hours, the database maintained by USA TODAY. That included nearly 31,000 customers in Michigan and roughly 7,000 each in Missouri and Oklahoma. It did not include another 45,000 customers without electricity in Colorado after winds as high as 80-90 mph on Monday.\n\n∎ Windy conditions and lower humidity could also pose a risk for critical fire weather across southeast Colorado, the Texas/Oklahoma Panhandle region and much of New Mexico.\n\n∎ Two school districts in northeastern Oklahoma, Bartlesville Public Schools and Barnsdall Public Schools, canceled classes on Tuesday citing power outages and road closures. Both communities were ravaged by a powerful tornado on Monday night.\n\n∎ Oklahoma's governor, Kevin Stitt, will travel to Barnsdall Tuesday afternoon to survey the damage to the small town: \"Devastating images coming out of Barnsdall, OK, this morning,\" the governor posted on X. \"First responders spent the night executing search and rescue operations. Resources are being directed to the area to aid in recovery. I will travel to Barnsdall later this afternoon. Hold them in your prayers!\"\n\nTornadoes hit Oklahoma: 1 person dead, 7 injured, dozens of homes damaged\n\nOn Monday, at least 17 tornadoes were spotted across the Plains region, with the most damage occurring in Oklahoma where multiple people were injured and one person in Barnsdall, a small community about 40 miles north of Tulsa, was killed, KOTV reported.\n\nThe northeastern Oklahoma communities of Barnsdall and Bartlesville experienced a damaging tornado that caused injuries, with at least seven people injured in Barnsdall, CBS News Texas reported.\n\nOklahoma Highway Patrol reported around 30 to 40 homes were damaged in the Barnsdall area, which was also hit by a tornado on April 1, according to the state's Department of Emergency Management. Officials also reported a natural gas leak in Barnsdall.\n\nCrews from numerous jurisdictions responded to areas throughout northeast Oklahoma to assist with medical transport, traffic control and search and rescue operations. Other counties reported flash flooding and damaged structures. Oklahoma was hit with tornadoes just last week that devastated some parts of the state, leaving at least four dead and 100 injured.\n\nThe weather service in Tulsa has a crew on the ground doing damage assessments along the track of the Barnsdall tornado and expects to have a report available later Tuesday or Wednesday.\n\nSlew of tornadoes slam southwest Michigan Tuesday\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency in four counties after a slew of tornadoes barreled through the southwestern part of the state and left a trail of damage in its wake.\n\n“My heart goes out to all those impacted by tonight’s severe weather in southwest Michigan,” Whitmer said. “State and local emergency teams are on the ground and working together to assist Michiganders.\"\n\nTwo \"large and extremely dangerous\" tornadoes were confirmed in Michigan shortly after 6 p.m., the weather service said. One hit south of Kalamazoo near Portage, moving east, and the other was near Burlington, about 9 miles northwest of Coldwater moving northeast.\n\nCity officials said Tuesday evening that two tornadoes were believed to have touched down in Portage, causing severe damage to residential and commercial properties. The city said several people were displaced, multiple trees were down on roads, and there were reports of gas leaks.\n\nA woman taking cover from the tornado in Portage was hit by debris as she got out of her car and her leg was broken, according to the weather service. After the first tornado in Portage, a FedEx facility in the area collapsed.\n\n“Our thoughts are with those affected by the tornado in Portage, Michigan, and we are grateful there were no serious injuries resulting from the damage to our facility at 6701 Portage Road,\" FedEx spokesperson Shannon Davis said in an email to USA TODAY. \"We continue to assess the damage, and we are implementing contingency plans to lessen any potential impacts on service.\"\n\nSt. Joseph County Undersheriff Jason Bingaman confirmed multiple places across the southwest Michigan county were damaged Tuesday, the site of another confirmed tornado.\n\n\"At the moment, we are focused on life safety missions using all available resources, then we will begin preliminary damage assessments,\" Bingaman said.\n\nSeven structures, mostly homes, were damaged in Sherwood Township, Branch County Emergency Manager Tim Miner said, adding that there were no deaths or serious injuries.\n\nThe weather service also issued tornado watches for southeast Michigan counties but said the chance of tornadoes slamming that part of the state was unlikely.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has tracked 1,219 tornadoes in Michigan since 1950, killing 248 people and causing more than $1.2 billion in property damage. Eighteen twisters swept through the state in 2023 and caused two deaths, according to the NOAA.\n\nTornadoes hit other Plains states overnight\n\nSeveral states in the Plains region were hit with tornadoes including two each in Iowa, Kansas and South Dakota and one each in Missouri, Nebraska and Tennessee, according to preliminary information from the Storm Prediction Center.\n\nThe storms developed Monday afternoon and through the evening after the National Weather Service Storm Prediction Center issued a series of dire warnings for severe weather in an area that stretched from Texas to the Dakotas.\n\nHow to be safe during a tornado warning\n\nWhile there's no such thing as guaranteed safety, the weather service says there are things people can do to increase their chances of surviving a deadly tornado.\n\nProtect yourself from flying or falling debris, the single biggest life-threatening hazard.\n\nSeek shelter in the closest, safest interior or underground room.\n\nAlways avoid windows. Don’t go to the windows or doors to look outside.\n\nCover yourself with thick protective coverings, such as a mattress, sleeping bags and thick blankets or other protective coverings.\n\nWear a helmet, if you have one, to protect your head from debris.\n\nUS weather watches and warnings\n\nNational weather radar\n\nContributing: Jana Hayes, Dale Denwalt and Cheyenne Derksen, The Oklahoman, Kylie Martin, Detroit Free Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/05/27/kentucky-power-outage-mdw-storms/73868544007/", "title": "Kentucky power outage: See map after tornado, storms MDW", "text": "Memorial Day Weekend storms ripped through the South and Midwest leaving more than 700,000 power outages nationwide Monday.\n\nAt least 21 are dead and many more injured after tornadoes hit several states.

More than 22 million people had been under a tornado watch Wednesday evening in portions of eight states: Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, and Tennessee.\n\nThe National Weather Service issued dozens of tornado warnings across the states, including in Tennessee where at least two tornadoes and two deaths were reported. The tornadoes are part of a multi-state outbreak that began May 6, that has spawned dozens of tornado reports.\n\nThe weather service also confirmed two tornadoes near Huntsville, Alabama, including one east of Huntsville in DeKalb County on Wednesday night, after issuing multiple tornado warnings and a tornado emergency.\n\n\"A very strong deadly tornado is moving east through DeKalb County,\" the weather service in Huntsville, Alabama, said on X, formerly Twitter. \"If in the warning, TAKE SHELTER NOW!\"\n\nFurther to the east, at 12:26 a.m. Thursday, the weather service office in Peachtree City, Georgia warned that a \"large and extremely dangerous tornado\" was over Hammondville, Alabama, north of Fort Payne.\n\nAt 2 a.m. Thursday, nearly 200,000 customers remained without electricity in Alabama, Georgia, Missouri, Tennessee and the Carolinas, according to USA TODAY'S power outage tracker.

Supercells are the least common type of thunderstorm and tend to produce hazardous weather.\n\nRare tornado emergency issued in Middle Tennessee\n\nA rare tornado emergency was issued for several communities south of Nashville, Tennessee. After a storm moved through Columbia, about 46 miles southwest of Nashville, the National Weather Service confirmed that a \"large and destructive tornado” had touched down in the area.\n\nThe Maury County Office of Emergency Management confirmed the tornado swept through eastern Columbia, killing one person and injuring four others. Authorities also reported seeing trees down, blocked roads, and scattered debris.\n\n\"We are currently assessing the damage caused by recent storms in our area.

Around 176 properties were damaged, 17 of which were completely destroyed, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller in a video posted on Facebook.\n\n\"We found homes in the roadway, we found homes in neighbor's homes,\" said Fuller, urging residents to stay home as officials continue to search for people and survey the damage across the county.\n\nIn southern Ohio, officials were surveying damage after two suspected tornadoes destroyed homes, toppled trees and snapped utility poles. Storms flooded some local areas, and emergency response personnel conducted multiple rescues. Tornadoes were also reported in Arkansas, Indiana and West Virginia.\n\nTornadoes, hail, damaging wind forecast for parts of Central US\n\nNearly 20 million people from northeastern Texas to Missouri and Kentucky were at enhanced or moderate risk of severe storms on Wednesday, according to the Storm Predication Center. The powerful thunderstorms were expected to bring tornadoes, giant hail and damaging winds, with the highest risk throughout Missouri, Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky and Tennessee, the prediction center said.\n\nThe cities facing potentially the worst impacts include Nashville, Memphis, St. Louis, Louisville and Little Rock, according to the weather service.

About 40,000 utility customers in Tennessee also reported outages.\n\nThe looming storm system spun up at least eight tornadoes in Michigan; others were reported in Arkansas, Ohio and West Virginia, according to the National Weather Service. Powerful storms pummeled the Plains region on Monday, spinning up multiple tornadoes that killed at least one person in Oklahoma, flattened homes in multiple states and caused widespread power outages.\n\nTornado warning safety tips\n\nWhile there's no such thing as guaranteed safety, the weather service says there are things people can do to increase their chances of surviving a deadly tornado:\n\n∎ Protect yourself from flying or falling debris, the single biggest life-threatening hazard.\n\n∎ Seek shelter in the closest, safest interior or underground room.\n\n∎ Always avoid windows. Don’t go to the windows or doors to look outside.\n\n∎ Cover yourself with thick protective coverings, such as a mattress, sleeping bags and thick blankets or other protective coverings.\n\n∎ Wear a helmet, if you have one, to protect your head from debris.\n\nNational weather radar\n\nContributing: Thao Nguyen USA TODAY; Kylie Martin, Frank Witsil, Detroit Free Press; Cheryl Vari, Haadiza Ogwude, Cincinnati Enquirer; Kirsten Fiscus, Diana Leyva, Andy Humbles, Tennessean", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2020/05/04/middle-tennessee-storm-causes-nashville-widespread-power-outage/3076739001/", "title": "Middle Tennessee storm causes widespread power outage in ...", "text": "It could take up to two weeks to restore all power knocked out by Sunday’s damaging wind storm that killed at least one person.\n\nDecosta Jenkins, the president and CEO of Nashville Electric Service, asked for patience as he laid out the restoration timeline Monday morning during the city of Nashville’s daily COVID-19 briefing. The power outage brought on by hurricane force winds is considered one of the largest in the city’s history.\n\n“Severe storms hit Middle Tennessee yesterday fast and furious and caused the largest number of power outages in my 29-year career at NES,” Jenkins said. “Straight line winds as high as 60 to 70 miles per hour knocked out power lines, downed trees and interrupted power to more than 130,000 customers.”\n\nThe storm walloped Middle Tennessee on Sunday evening, but the region is not in the clear. Another round of bad weather was expected to roll through Monday night into Tuesday morning.\n\nAnd the severe wind event is just the latest crisis to blow into the region.\n\nCommunities are still grappling with the growing coronavirus outbreak in the state, and Sunday’s storm hit two months after devastating tornadoes killed more than two dozen people and damaged hundreds of buildings. The Sunday evening storm also came on the heels of the 10th anniversary of the deadly 2010 flood.\n\nNashville affected by massive power outage\n\nBecause the current outage is so massive, Jenkins said customers should brace for at least a week without electricity if not more. He explained the scope of work that lay ahead by comparing it to the March 3 tornadoes. The violent twisters knocked out power to 50,000 customers and it took eight days to bring everyone back on line, Jenkins said.\n\n“The outage is widespread and large scale, and will take some time to get all power restored,\" Jenkins said. \"I can't prioritize one section of town or the other.”\n\nThe storm broke 51 NES utility poles, but progress has been made. Power was restored to about 30,000 customers on Sunday night and the utility hoped to turn the lights back on for 30,000 to 60,000 more by the end of Monday, Jenkins said.\n\nNES crews and contractors are facing additional hurdles as they restore power during the contagious coronavirus outbreak. They are practicing social distancing when possible, including limiting vehicles to just two people. The expected Monday night storms could also further complicate the restoration.\n\nOn Monday, crews from Middle Tennessee Electric Membership Corporation were working to restore power to nearly 5,000 customers. The majority of the outages were in Williamson and Wilson counties.\n\nFirefighter dies as a result of Sunday storm\n\nBut the biggest loss on Sunday happened in Maury County.\n\nSpring Hill firefighter Mitchell Earwood, 34, died in a weather-related incident at his home, the Spring Hill Police Department said.\n\nHe was off duty at the time, but has served as a volunteer firefighter with the Maury County Fire Department since 2009 and also was a member of the Williamson County Rescue Squad.\n\n\"Please keep this family in your prayers along with Mitchell’s close brothers at the Spring Hill Fire Department and Williamson County Rescue Squad,\" MCFD said in a statement shared Monday morning. \"We have lost one of the 'good ones' who had us in tears from the jokes or stories he was always telling. We will truly miss you buddy.\"\n\nStorm creates mess across Middle Tennessee\n\nThe storm also left a mess for residents and emergency workers to clean up. In Maury County, severe weather knocked out power, took down trees and scattered outdoor furniture.\n\nIn Nashville, flipped boats and scattered gear could be seen from the docks at Four Corners Yacht Club. The storm destroyed a 200-year-old oak tree in front of J.T. Moore Middle School.\n\n\"There are obviously many roads across the county with tree issues and line down issues where the lines pose a hazard,\" Don Aaron, spokesman for the Metro Nashville Police Department, said. \"Officers are there. If trees are blocking roads, officers have either put up yellow tape or there is some sort of barricade.\"\n\nThe storm blew over tents at Nashville's COVID-19 assessment centers, delaying their opening Monday, said Joseph Pleasant, spokesman for the city's Office of Emergency Management. The coronavirus hotline was closed, too, because the health department had lost power.\n\nIn Mt. Juliet, residents could be seen clearing large tree limbs from their properties. Some homes also sustained significant damage there.\n\n\"We have a little bit of roof damage, some shingles and then we have some siding that blew loose, and then mostly just trees down,\" said Van Stewart as he cleaned up tree limbs Monday morning in the Moreland Farms neighborhood on Gleaves Glen Road in Mt. Juliet. \"But it came on very, very quickly. I thought at first it might have been a tornado.\"\n\nIn Rutherford County, the storm tore off more than half of the roof of the main Kittrell fire station.\n\n\"The emergency came to us. We didn’t have to go to it,\" Kittrell Assistant Fire Chief Randy Grogan said.\n\nSix of the Kittrell firefighters were at the station when the storm hit. No one was injured.\n\n\"They said it sounded like a freight train going through,\" Grogan said. \"We actually ran six calls in two hours after the storm, and we didn't have a delay in response at all.\"\n\nJames Bennett, Scott Broden, Mike Christen and Andy Humbles contributed to this report.\n\nReach Holly Meyer at hmeyer@tennessean.com or 615-232-4714 and on Twitter @HollyAMeyer.\n\nReach Natalie Neysa Alund at nalund@tennessean.com and follow her on Twitter @nataliealund.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/05/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/06/16/tornadoes-texas-florida-fatalities-severe-weather/70328859007/", "title": "5 dead after storms in Texas, Florida, Mississippi; high heat in South", "text": "Hundreds of thousands of residents in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi remained without power Friday following severe weather Thursday afternoon and deadly tornadoes in north Texas.\n\nA tornado tore through the Texas Panhandle town of Perryton, killing three people, injuring dozens more and causing widespread damage as another series of fierce storms carved its way through Southern states.

Local officials added two people were missing as of Thursday night.\n\nIn Escambia County, Florida, one person was killed Thursday when a tornado caused a tree to fall on a home, county spokesperson Andie Gibson told the Pensacola News Journal, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nA man in Canton, Mississippi, died after a tree fell on him during stormy weather early Friday. Canton Police Chief Otha Brown told WLBT-TV the man was killed after high winds toppled a tree onto his carport as he was entering his car.\n\nIn Perryton, Texas, mobile homes were ripped apart and pickup trucks with shattered windshields were slammed against mounds of rubble in residential areas.\n\nPerryton’s downtown was also walloped. About two blocks of businesses were heavily damaged, including an office supply store, a floral shop and a hair salon along the town's Main Street. A minivan was shoved into the outer wall of a theater.\n\nThe roof of a bank in Lavon, Texas, collapsed after storms rolled through the area on Thursday evening, according to footage shared on social media. The town is over 400 miles away from Perryton, near Dallas. ABC News journalist Mike Forbes posted a video to Twitter of a branch of Independent Financial bank that was decimated by the storm.\n\nIn the video, the roof of a large wing of the bank building can be seen lying on the ground.\n\nDangerously high temps in the South\n\nMuch of southern Texas, including Corpus Christi, Laredo and Victoria, are under excessive heat warnings from noon until 8 p.m.\n\nThe National Weather Service predicts the heat index there could reach 115 degrees Fahrenheit or higher.\n\nSoutheastern Louisiana is also on alert for dangerously high temperatures Friday, with New Orleans, Baton Rouge and Lafayette expected to experience a heat index of up to 110 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nThe weather service Friday strongly urged people to \"drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out of the sun and check up on relatives and neighbors.\"\n\n\"Young children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles under any circumstances,\" the weather service said.\n\nContributing: Jim Little, Pensacola News Journal; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/severe/2023/07/03/nearly-10000-still-without-power-in-springfield-area-following-storms/70378977007/", "title": "Thousands still without power four days after storms hit Springfield ...", "text": "Springfield Mayor Misty Buscher on Monday compared the damage done by last week's storms to the 1978 Easter weekend ice storm, which also toppled power lines and caused massive power outages.\n\n\"It isn't like a tornado that hits one particular area,\" said Buscher at a press conference in city council chambers. \"It's city-wide.\"\n\nCity officials had the chance to speak to the public Monday, as the city continues under a state of emergency following the storms that caused significant damage county-wide.\n\nMore:'Just have to keep the faith.' Volunteers help out Springfield neighbors with giveaways\n\nThe combined message from Buscher, City Water, Light & Power Chief Utility Engineer Doug Brown, Public Works Director Dave Fuchs, Fire Chief Ed Canny and Assistant Police Chief Don Mumaw: remain patient as recovery continues.\n\nOver 14% of CWLP customers remain without electricity Monday, with 9,787 customers still without power as of 4:30 p.m., higher than comparable totals Sunday when only 8,426 customers were still in the dark. The agency has been asking customers to self-report outages since 6 p.m. Sunday, which has contributed to the increase in reported power loss as a result of the storm.\n\nCWLP spokesperson Amber Sabin said that the goal of the self-reporting was to pick up any spots missed during the initial reporting stage. She said that the response was overwhelming enough that there were cases of over-reporting of outages as a result.\n\n\"I think we're good right now (on reporting),\" Sabin said. \"Our outage counts might be a touch high right now because people are calling in multiple times. Some outages might be double-counted. We don't need the full-court press on that.\"\n\nMore than 40,000 customers were without power at the storm's peak last Thursday, which brought down hundreds of power lines and power poles while also damaging transformers and other electrical equipment. CWLP workers have been doing 17-hour shifts in order to restore power to their customers, though troubleshooters and dispatchers were available 24 hours, Sabin reiterated.\n\nSabin said that the city is now in the second phase of power recovery, focused on fixing lateral lines and individual backyard outages.\n\nAs for the timeline to get the remaining customers back online, Brown estimates that 90% of this group should have their power back by the end of Sunday.\n\nThe repairs depend upon the complexity of the situation and the weather, he added.\n\n\"Disaster is probably an understatement at this point,\" Brown said. \"The damage from the derecho storm is much worse than the 2006 tornadoes. It is widespread. It is devastating. It is impossible to predict each individual repair with miles and miles of damage to our electric grid. We are looking at replacing over 100 power line poles, over 200 cross-arms, over 100 fuses and maybe 1,000 insulators so far, but we are staying ahead on ordering materials.\n\n\"We are now trying to put updates as to where our crews are working, as their work locations might be giving you a better chance of knowing what your status is.\"\n\nAs of Monday afternoon, CWLP was leaning on 81 personnel in 60 trucks to help with restoration with more anticipated later in the week, Brown said.\n\nThe state of emergency imposed by Mayor Misty Buscher in response to the storm was extended Sunday night through the end of Wednesday's city council meeting. The continued lack of power in many areas of the city was the primary reason for the extension of the order, which allows Buscher to take expedited action to deal with the storm without the approval of the council.\n\nAs for the city's continued response to the storm, Fuchs said that while his teams have been working around the clock to clear streets and ensure that people can get to where they need to go, he knows that it will be some time before everything is back to normal in the Capitol City.\n\n\"Every year, there's branch pickup that takes about a month,\" Fuchs said. \"This endeavor is going to take much longer than a month.\"\n\nPublic Works has contracted for additional equipment, primarily end loaders, to assist crews. An Illinois Department of Transportation crew will be with Public Works for several weeks, he said.\n\nFuchs added two 20-yard long dumpsters had been set up for disposal of spoiled food at 600 Rickard Road (Lawrence and Rickard) and at 2121 S. 11th St.\n\n\"This is not for storm debris. This is not for anything that fell off your house or garage,\" Fuchs said.\n\nThe dumpsters will be monitored by the waste haulers and by the city, Fuchs said. It is possible other dumpsters could be added around town.\n\nBuscher said she could empathize with people who may be losing patience with the pace of repairs, as time continues to pass from the storm.\n\n\"We want our citizens to know that we hear you,\" Buscher said. \"We know it's hard. We know you're without power. We're doing our best to restore power as quickly as possible and assess the damage.\"\n\nBuscher said no monetary damage has been attached to the storms so far.\n\n\"It's not a time to put pencil to paper (regarding costs),\" she said. \"Our citizens without power don't want to hear about costs They want to hear about getting their power on.\"\n\nJerome parade to go off as scheduled\n\nAbout 85 homes in the Village of Jerome remain without power, said President Mike Lopez.\n\nTuesday's Fourth of July parade will go as planned at 9 a.m., stepping off from the village hall, 2901 Leonard St.\n\nLopez said there is also a dumpster at city hall for residents to dispose of spoiled food items.\n\nNWS confirms tornadoes in central Illinois\n\nWhile the National Weather Service didn't confirm a tornado had touched down in Sangamon County in the immediate aftermath of the storm, it did confirm Saturday that five tornadoes had touched down during the storm, including one that passed through Chatham at 12:12 p.m. Thursday with winds reaching as high as 120 mph.\n\nTwo tornadoes touched down in Christian County later in the day – one near Sharpsburg at 12:26 p.m. and another near Taylorville at 12:38 p.m. Another tornado hit Logan County north of Lincoln at 12:26 p.m., which blocked off portions of Interstate 55 due to downed power lines near mile marker 133.\n\nMore:National Weather Service confirms five tornadoes in three-county area Thursday\n\nNWS received several reports of storm damage in Springfield as the system moved through, with some being connected to that of a tornado, but no tornado was reported to touch down in the city proper as of Monday.\n\nRed Cross to move shelter to BOS Center\n\nDuring the press conference, Buscher announced that the American Red Cross would be moving their emergency shelter from the Springfield branch of the NAACP to the lower level of the Bank of Springfield (BOS) Center Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThere people can get a hot meal, charge their phones or other electronic devices and spend the night within the air-conditioned confines of the city's main convention center, Buscher said.\n\n\"I was out on Saturday knocking on doors of customers without power,\" Buscher said. \"They told me that they wanted to have a place to go to charge their phones (and) maybe get a bite to eat. Those people want to sleep in their homes overnight, so the idea of the BOS Center opening their doors is that citizens have a place to go and feel safe.\"\n\nTeresa Haley, the president of the Springfield branch of the NAACP and its state director, said she couldn't say exactly how many families and individuals had stayed at the facility because of privacy laws, but said people have been utilizing it.\n\n\"A few people have come from surrounding communities as well,\" said Haley, who has been a volunteer for the Red Cross for over 30 years.\n\nHelp in Chatham\n\nThe village has a small dumpster located in Community Park near the parking lot by diamond #3, near the Dewberry Trail entrance to the park.\n\nThe Chatham Area Public Library, 600 E.

Storms qualify as derechos if they have sustained winds of at least 58 mph and leave a path of damage at least 250 miles long, according to the National Weather Service in Des Moines. They develop in the northern hemisphere, usually during warm weather, and may be accompanied or preceded by violent thunderstorms.\n\nWhile derechos are a lot less common than tornadoes, they occur regularly in the Plains states. Among years before 2020 with notable derechos in Iowa: 1983, 1986, 1991, 1998, 2004, 2011, and 2014.\n\nThough not as destructive as August's storm, a derecho on Dec. 15, 2021— the first December derecho anywhere in the U.S. — spawned more than 60 tornadoes across the state. Derechos were also confirmed in Iowa in May and July.\n\nKnown as a progressive derecho, the August 2020 storm was fueled by a hot and moist environment. Straight-line winds traveled 770 miles from eastern Nebraska and South Dakota through Iowa, Illinois, Ohio, Minnesota and Wisconsin.\n\nThe derecho also produced 26 weak tornadoes in Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Indiana.\n\nIowa was hit hardest by the derecho where more than 400,000 people were left without power. Wind speeds near Cedar Rapids were estimated at 140 mph, the most powerful in the storm.\n\nSome of Cedar Rapids' 132,000 residents were left without power for up to two weeks. Fields of corn and soybeans were leveled by the storm. Crop damage totaled $490.8 million.\n\nIt was the costliest thunderstorm in U.S. history. Damage from the storm reached $11.5 billion last year, up from an initial estimate of $7.5 billion.\n\nTimeline: Aug. 10, 2020 derecho\n\nHere's a timeline of notable moments from the Aug. 10, 2020 derecho, according to a story map report produced by NOAA National Weather Service offices across the Midwest:\n\nOvernight. Scattered, strong thunderstorms first started in south-central South Dakota, feeding off of the warm air over cooler air masses closer to the ground.\n\n8 a.m. Hail, up to about 1 to 2 inches in size, coupled with wind gusts up to 70 mph, is reported approaching Sioux City, Iowa, moving east.\n\nThe Storm Prediction Center (SPC) sends \"enhanced\" severe weather warnings in eastern Iowa and northern Illinois.\n\n10 a.m. Storms cross Big Sioux and Missouri rivers and move into western Iowa. Wind speeds pick up as the storms near Storm Lake, Denison, and Atlantic in west central Iowa.\n\nSome of the strong wind gusts became trapped underneath warm air just above the ground, which helps them to move rapidly to the south and southeast. Numerous downed trees and powerlines are reported in far eastern Nebraska and western Iowa, more than 50 miles away from the main area of storms.\n\nNoon. By this time, a complex of storms has moved into central Iowa with straight-line wind speeds of 80 to 100 mph. The storms push toward Ames and Des Moines, damaging structures and crops.\n\nThe most extreme winds (100 to 120 mph) devastate Iowa within two swaths; the first begins near Jefferson and moves east toward Madrid and Huxley. The second develops northeast of Ames and reaches the Marshalltown area around noon.\n\nThree tornadoes land near Marshalltown. The strongest tornado is rated an EF-1. Des Moines reports damage to trees, power lines, and structures due to 70 to 80 mph gusts.\n\n2 p.m. The area of extreme winds near Marshalltown strengthens as the derecho travels east. More outbuildings, barns, grain bins, homes, mobile homes, apartment buildings, businesses, trees, and power poles are damaged or destroyed\n\nThe most severe and widespread damage happens between the noon to 2 p.m. timeframe from the Marshalltown area, through the Tama, Traer, Belle Plaine, and Vinton areas, before reaching the Cedar Rapids area just before 1 p.m.\n\nCedar Rapids gets the brunt of the damage, with widespread power outages, with some parts without power for two weeks. More than half the trees in the city are lost.\n\n5 p.m. Storms continue to ravage land with wind gusts as they cross the Mississippi River into northern Illinois, though peak wind speeds begin to diminish slightly.\n\nWind gusts of 100 to 110 mph are estimated over a small area near Princeton, Illinois, where a 150-foot communications tower collapses and power poles snap.\n\nMultiple tornados touch down and multiple people are injured as the storm passes through north-central Illinois.\n\n8 p.m. The line of storms moves from Indiana into western Ohio. Wind gusts diminish to 60 to 70 mph, with some stronger winds (up to 80 mph) reported in rural areas south of Gary and north of Lafayette.\n\nStrong winds and \"rapid changes in atmospheric pressure\" move across parts of southern Lake Michigan causing water levels to briefly rise \"substantially.\" Water levels rose about 1.5 feet near St. Joseph, Michigan, with some flooding reported in Lions Park Beach.\n\nRead the National Weather Service in Des Moines' full report on the Aug. 10, 2020, derecho at storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/.\n\nVirginia Barreda is a trending and general assignment reporter for the Des Moines Register.

Strong tornadoes EF2 or higher are also a possibility, he said.\n\nCompared to last week's chances of severe weather, which also included gusty winds and the possibility for tornadoes, there are numerous factors coming together to create widespread severe weather across much of the Midwest, Herold said, including the amount of moisture in the atmosphere.\n\n\"The more moisture there is to work with, typically the more unstable the atmosphere is,\" he said.\n\nThere is an added element of danger with these storms, he said, because of its timing.

The prosecution used \"peremptory strikes\" – a kind of veto – to get the other two excused. One of the excused jurors was a man who said he worked in the real estate industry and knew people who knew former President Donald Trump.\n\nThat makes seven selected jurors. 12 jurors plus several alternates are needed before the case may proceed to opening statements.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nMore juror selection coming this evening?\n\nIt's possible we could have more jurors selected this evening.

The Trump campaign is moving forward with plans to hold political rallies during his hush money trial on days when he doesn't need to be in court.\n\nTrump has a campaign rally scheduled for 7 p.m. Saturday at an airport in Wilmington, N.C.\n\nNorth Carolina is an important state in the fall presidential race between Trump and President Joe Biden.\n\nTrump carried North Carolina by narrow margins in 2016 and 2020, but Biden supporters believe that issues like abortion and Trump's legal problems give them a chance to flip the state this fall.\n\n−David Jackson\n\nTrump to target crime in New York\n\nIn an attempt to clap back at Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, Donald Trump is going to Harlem − Bragg's native neighborhood and political home base − to campaign at a bodega that was the site of a fatal stabbing in 2022.\n\nIn an incident that inflamed critics, the bodega clerk was charged with murder after he stabbed an attacker in self-defense. The charges were later dropped.\n\nTrump, a former New Yorker, is expected to characterize the nation's largest city as crime-ridden, in order to portray Bragg as a left-wing zealot who is misdirecting his energies on Trump's prosecution for 34 counts of falsifying business records, instead of focusing on street crime. Trump has previously attacked Bragg on social media.\n\nAlthough Trump and congressional Republicans have previously argued that New York City suffers from high crime, the murder and violent crime rates in the city are lower than the national average, lower than most other large cities, and well below the rates during the 1990s when Rudy Giuliani was mayor.\n\nTrump's new home state of Florida has a higher murder rate rate than New York, and West Palm Beach, Florida, which neighbors Trump's Mar-a-Lago home in Palm Beach, has the ninth-highest murder rate in the country.\n\n-Ben Adler\n\nPotential juror in real estate industry says he knows people who know Trump\n\nIt's a big city, but a small world: A potential juror who said he has lived on Manhattan's Upper East Side since 2004 said he knows people who know former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe New Yorker's comment didn't come in response to a question. Instead, he brought the indirect connection up after responding to the 42 preliminary questions jurors are being asked before lawyers for the two sides will speak to them.\n\nThe potential juror said he has worked in the real estate development industry since 2010. He also briefly followed Trump when Trump was on Twitter, which is now called X. He added that he read Trump's book, \"Trump: The Art of the Deal,\" a long time ago.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJury selection continues: Multiple potential jurors dismissed as group responds to Judge Juan Merchan's questionnaire\n\nMultiple potential jurors were dismissed late Tuesday as a group of six individuals was brought in to respond to the the list of 42 questions for potential jurors that Judge Juan Merchan decided on before trial.\n\nOne of the individuals was excused over work timing issues. Another was let go after she said she \"deeply\" felt she had concerns, upon being in the courtroom, about her ability to be fair and impartial.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nIs hush money illegal?\n\nHush money is a wide-ranging term used to refer to paying someone to not speak publicly about an issue. It's not necessarily illegal, so why is Donald Trump in court over a hush money case?\n\nThe former president isn’t actually charged with making a $130,000 payment to porn actress Stormy Daniels in exchange for a non-disclosure agreement. Instead, he's accused of falsifying business records to hide the payment.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg described the payments to Daniels and another woman, former Playboy model Karen McDougal, as part of a “catch-and-kill” strategy to prevent the women from telling their stories. But the criminal charges are that Trump falsified his company’s business records to conceal the payments.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nWhy is Trump on trial?\n\nProsecutors claim Donald Trump falsified records to conceal that he was reimbursing his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, for a $130,000 hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels. Daniels has said she had sex with the real estate mogul shortly after his wife, Melania Trump, gave birth to their son, Barron. Trump denies Daniels' claim, and has pleaded not guilty in the case.\n\nThe charges are felonies, as opposed to misdemeanors, because prosecutors claim Trump falsified the records in order to conceal violating federal election laws through a payment that was meant to help his 2016 presidential campaign but exceeded campaign contribution limits.\n\nThe payment was made less than two weeks before the 2016 election. Prosecutors also allege the records were falsified in order to violate New York tax and election laws.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nNew potential jurors told to come back Thursday, but jury questioning continues Tuesday for others\n\nJudge Juan Merchan had several dozen new potential jurors brought into the courtroom and instructed them to return Thursday at 9:30 a.m. ET. A court security officer told one of them, \"Ma'am, ma'am put your cell phone away,\" after the woman saw Trump and tried to take out her phone.\n\n\"I know that you’ve been sitting around all day,\" Merchan told the new group. He said things would start promptly on Thursday.\n\nProceedings aren't over for the day, however. There are six more people from an earlier group of potential jurors still to be questioned.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nSix jurors chosen for Trump's hush money trial\n\nSix jurors have been selected to serve throughout Donald Trump's New York criminal hush money trial. All six were sworn in late Tuesday afternoon.\n\n12 jurors, plus several alternates, are needed in total before the trial can move forward to opening statements.\n\nMerchan instructed the six selected jurors to plan to come back Monday at 9:30 a.m. ET, indicating it's possible opening statements in the trial could happen next week.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge Juan Merchan allows potential juror to continue despite satirical posts\n\nThe judge allowed another potential juror to continue after the Trump team took issue with her previous social media posts. Merchan said the posts were satire, and the prospective juror was fairly open about disagreeing with Trump's political views.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump trial dates: Holidays, Barron Trump's high school graduation and more\n\nWhile Donald Trump's hush money trial is expected to extend six to eight weeks, the former president won't be in the courtroom every day. Judge Juan Merchan said Tuesday that the trial will take a break on Wednesdays for its duration, and there will not be any trial on April 29.\n\nThe judge also said there will not be any trial dates that would conflict with religious observances. That could include Passover, though the courtroom hours could simply be cut short on April 22 and 23.\n\nThe case will also potentially adjourn for the high school graduation of Barron Trump, Donald Trump's youngest son, next month.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nJuror who posted 'I'm dumb as f---' parody video featuring Trump dismissed\n\nJudge Juan Merchan dismissed a potential juror who posted on social media a parody video generated by artificial intelligence that was titled \"I'm dumb as f---\" and featured Trump. The potential juror also posted \"no one is above the law\" about Trump's separate criminal case over his handling of classified documents.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nPotential juror allowed to continue despite Trump's trial team knocking a post from her husband\n\nJudge Juan Merchan allowed another potential juror to continue despite the Trump trial team taking issue with a social media post it uncovered from her husband, which the judge said was from eight years ago.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDonald Trump smirks at potential juror who posted 'lock him up'\n\nDonald Trump craned his neck toward a potential juror and flashed a smirk, after the man said he didn't still believe Trump should be \"locked up.\" The non-verbal expression from Trump came after his trial team uncovered a social media post in which the potential juror celebrated a court striking down a Trump travel ban and then stated, \"Get him out and lock him up.\" The man said he didn't still believe Trump should be behind bars after the man was called in for questioning by Judge Juan Merchan, who ultimately struck him from consideration based on the post.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJuror who posted 'lock him up' about Donald Trump dismissed by judge\n\nJudge Juan Merchan struck a potential juror from consideration after Trump's legal team uncovered a social media post in which the potential juror said \"lock him up\" about Trump.\n\nThe post wasn't shown to reporters, but the judge read it out loud (without detailing what the spelling, capitalization, or spacing looked like, although he described the exclamation points): \"Good news!! Trump lost his court battle on his unlawful travel ban!!!\"\n\nThe post continued by stating about Trump, \"Get him out and lock him up.\"\n\nMerchan said if the post ended before the last phrase, he wouldn't really have a problem. However, the juror expressed a desire for Trump to be locked up.\n\n\"I don't think that I can allow this juror to remain,\" Merchan said.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge Juan Merchan allows juror linked to anti-Trump 'party' video to continue\n\nJudge Juan Merchan allowed a potential juror linked to a video of anti-Trump celebrations to continue being considered for the jury after she acknowledged seeing the gathering outside and maintained she could be fair and impartial.\n\nTrump lawyer Susan Necheles described the video as \"clearly an anti-Trump event that she's out celebrating and partying at.\" Merchan agreed it was an anti-Trump event of some kind (the video wasn't shown to reporters), but said it wasn't clear the potential juror was there. He did allow the juror to be questioned about it.\n\nThe potential juror said she remembered seeing people out in the street celebrating. She maintained she could be fair and impartial in the case, repeating Merchan's explanation to potential jurors on Monday that jurors decide the facts in the case, while the judge decides the law.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge tells Trump lawyer: 'I will not have any jurors intimidated. ... Speak to your client.'\n\nAfter a potential juror was questioned about a video on social media, she left the courtroom and Judge Juan Merchan said he heard Trump audibly making comments, although the judge couldn't hear what Trump said.\n\n\"I will not have any jurors intimidated in this courtroom,\" Merchan told Trump lawyer Todd Blanche. \"Speak to your client,\" Merchan instructed.\n\nBlanche leaned over to Trump and whispered to him. Trump then leaned forward at the defense table.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump lawyer: Video proves juror should be excluded\n\nThe judge just reviewed a video that Trump's legal team says is grounds for the judge to exclude a potential juror from the case. Reporters weren't shown the video, but the legal team indicated they found it through online searches.\n\n\"This is clearly an anti-Trump event that she's out celebrating and partying at,\" said Susan Necheles, a lawyer for Trump.\n\nMerchan agreed it appears to be that kind of event, but it's not clear to the judge the potential juror was there.\n\nThe judge says he is going to allow Trump's team to ask her questions about it. The potential juror has just been brought in.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDonald Trump's lawyer says not all potential jurors gave accurate answers\n\nTrial proceedings have resumed after a break for lunch, although the jury hasn't been brought into the courtroom yet.\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche says a look at the social media activity of potential jurors suggests not everyone was truthful. He wants Judge Juan Merchan to strike multiple potential jurors \"for cause,\" which would mean the judge determines a juror doesn't meet certain qualifications or probably can't be impartial in the case.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhat happened this morning in Trump's hush money trial?\n\nAfter a slight delay for two late potential jurors, more New York residents answered a set of 42 questions Judge Juan Merchan decided on before the trial, such as where they get their news.\n\nAlong the way, a handful of jurors were excused after saying they had now concluded they couldn't guarantee they would be impartial in the case or had conflicts that might prevent them from being present and giving their full attention to the trial.\n\nAnd for the first time since the trial started Monday, attorneys for Trump and the prosecution questioned jurors directly. Trump lawyer Todd Blanche asked several potential jurors what their opinion of Donald Trump was. Some said they disagreed with Trump's policies, others said they didn't have an opinion, while at least a couple said their opinion wasn't relevant in the courtroom.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhen is Trump's Georgia trial?\n\nDonald Trump faces 10 criminal counts in Georgia related to alleged election interference.\n\nHis trial in the Peach State hasn't been scheduled yet, but it will be televised, making it the only of Trump's four criminal cases to be broadcast.\n\nFulton County District Attorney Fani Willis proposed to start the trial Aug. 5, but that would mean the potentially five-month trial would be running on Election Day.\n\n– Bart Jansen & Kinsey Crowley\n\nTodd Blanche and Susan Necheles: Donald Trump's lawyers\n\nThey aren’t household names yet like their universally known client, Donald Trump. But the lawyers trying to keep the former president out of prison in his New York hush money trial − Todd Blanche and Susan Necheles − likely will become minor celebrities once the court battle gets going this week.\n\nA year ago, when a grim-faced Trump made history as the first former president to face criminal charges, Blanche and Necheles sat by his side as he pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records associated with hush money payments to two women.\n\nBlanche, who usually does the talking in court on the hush-money case, told reporters that Trump was determined to fight the charges.\n\n\"He's frustrated, he's upset,\" Blanche said. \"It's not going to stop him.\"\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nJudge will hold Donald Trump contempt hearing on April 23\n\nJudge Juan Merchan on Monday moved the date for a hearing over whether Donald Trump violated a gag order and should be held in contempt in the New York hush money case. The hearing will now be held on Tuesday, April 23, one day sooner than originally planned.\n\nProsecutor Christopher Conroy argued on Monday that Trump should be held in contempt and fined $3,000 for three social media posts that Conroy said violated the judge's prohibition on Trump publicly commenting on the participation of potential witnesses.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s campaign puns ‘Stormy’ criticism of Donald Trump\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s Democratic campaign put out a statement Monday criticizing Republican rival Donald Trump over abortion and highlighting the controversy in Arizona where an 1864 law has been reinstated to outlaw all abortion.\n\nBut the headline sounded more like an Empire State of mind than focused on the Grand Canyon state. The same day Trump’s trial began on charges he falsified business records to pay hush money to porn star Stormy Daniels, the Biden campaign headline cited “Stormy” coverage of the abortion ban and the attempt to “hush panic.”\n\nTrump has claimed credit for appointing as president three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade, which had guaranteed a right to abortion. He recently said states should be left to decide the decision, but that the Arizona law “went too far” and should be overturned.\n\n–Bart Jansen\n\nIs Trump trial being televised?\n\nThe trial won't be televised, as is typical in New York courts. Reporters will be present in the courtroom and an overflow room that will have a live stream of the proceedings.\n\nTrump may hold press conferences outside of court and speak to reporters in the courthouse hallway.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhy did Michael Cohen go to prison?\n\nMichael Cohen, Donald Trump's former attorney, pleaded guilty in 2018 to concealing more than $4 million from the IRS and \"causing $280,000 in payments to be made to silence two women who otherwise planned to speak publicly about their alleged affairs with a presidential candidate, thereby intending to influence the 2016 presidential election,\" according to court records.\n\nProsecutors said Cohen arranged a $150,000 payment to McDougal and a $130,000 payment to Daniels.\n\nCohen was sentenced to three years in prison but was released early to home detention because of the spread of COVID-19.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nDonald Trump lashes out over hush money case on Truth Social\n\nDonald Trump has used Truth Social in the last few hours to attack his hush money trial, calling it a \"farce\" on his social media platform and an effort to target his reelection bid.\n\nThere is no evidence that the sweeping criminal charges Trump faces across four cases are attempts to undermine his presidential campaign.\n\nTrump has also shared a poll on Truth Social on Tuesday showing him leading Biden in pivotal swing states including Georgia, Nevada and Michigan.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nJurors dismissed for lunch\n\nJudge Juan Merchan dismissed potential jurors for lunch, telling them to be back at 2:15 p.m. ET.\n\nOutside of their presence, Merchan indicated in a conversation with lawyers for both sides that a process of striking jurors would begin later this afternoon. That could mean the lawyers will begin to use \"peremptory strikes\" – essentially vetos on particular jury candidates.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump lawyer to jurors: What is your real opinion of Donald Trump?\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche posed the same question to several potential jurors: What is your real opinion of Donald Trump?\n\nBlanche got a variety of answers.\n\n\"I'm a female. He's targeted some females,\" one potential juror said. She added that some of her friends have strong opinions on Trump, and she knows there are opinions that he doesn't treat females correctly, but she doesn't know the details and doesn't have her own conclusion about it.\n\nAnother potential juror said he has a lot of friends in law enforcement who are fairly \"pro-Trump,\" but he didn't personally have an opinion on Trump on national politics.\n\nOne woman said she's a person of color, so people around her have opinions on Trump. But she appreciated that Trump actually speaks his mind.\n\nAnother prospective juror said he would be happy to share his view with Blanche if they were in a bar, but in the courtroom his opinion isn't important. After being pressed, he told Blanche he's a Democrat, but all Trump is to him in this room is a defendant.\n\nTrump is \"fascinating,\" another potential juror said. Trump walks into a room and just sets people off \"one way or the other.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump lawyer to jurors: Trump wants 'a fair shake'\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche began questioning potential jurors in the early afternoon. \"This isn't a baseball game,\" Blanche started off by saying. This is extraordinarily serious, and it's extraordinarily important to President Trump that we're getting \"a fair shake.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWho is Karen McDougal?\n\nKaren McDougal is a former Playboy model. She indirectly received a hush money payment in 2016 after claiming to have an affair with Donald Trump.\n\nMichael Cohen, Trump's former attorney, funneled the money through the publication National Enquirer owned by American Media Inc., under a \"catch and kill\" approach, paying the tabloid to buy rights to her story and prevent her from telling anyone else about it.\n\nMcDougal has since spoken out about her affair with Trump, saying it lasted for about 10 months starting in 2006. He denies the allegation.\n\n– Kinsey Crowley\n\nProsecutor references Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels, asks if jurors can keep open mind on witnesses with 'baggage'\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass told potential jurors that several witnesses in the case have some \"baggage.\" He said they include a tabloid publisher, an adult film star, and a former lawyer for Trump, Michael Cohen. The adult film star Steinglass referenced is almost certainly Stormy Daniels, who received the $130,000 hush money payment at issue in the case.\n\nCohen pleaded guilty to several crimes, including lying to Congress, Steinglass noted, adding that some witnesses have been given immunity.\n\nSteinglass said those are factors that should be taken into account by jurors, but asked if those factors would, on their own, prevent the potential jurors from listening to or believing the witnesses. No one said they would.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump changes mind on listening to private talk between lawyers and judge\n\nA lawyer for Trump previously indicated the former president wanted to be present for \"sidebars\" in the trial. Those are communications between the judge and at least one lawyer from each side that are outside the earshot of the potential jurors.\n\nBut a little past noon on Tuesday, after lawyers from each side went up to Judge Juan Merchan for a private conversation, the judge asked Trump to confirm that he was now waiving his right to be present for those conversations. Trump confirmed he was.\n\nThere are various reasons to have a sidebar, such as a lawyer's desire to explain an objection to something when giving that explanation means saying things that could prejudice the jury.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWould-be juror Kara McGee reports on happenings inside the courtroom, says jury box is balanced\n\n\"You walked in and you felt like history was happening which was a really, really cool sensation,\" excused potential juror Kara McGee told a crowded field of reporters.. \"I wish I could have stayed for the entire trial. It's fascinating, it's unprecedented.\"\n\n\"You got a sense that people were really trying to put anything they had brought to this aside and step in and do their civic duty,\" McGee said. She reported being pleasantly surprised at the honesty of fellow jurors − some disclosed they were on Trump mailing lists or watched Fox News, while others said they had volunteered for anti-Trump causes, giving a clearer picture of the political makeup of the jury, which she said seemed fairly balanced.\n\nMcGee herself is \"not a fan\" of the former president. During COVID-19 she lived with someone who was immunocompromised and wasn't pleased with how he had handled the pandemic. She also has a sister adopted from China and cited his divisive rhetoric about the country.\n\nHer views on his policies don't mean he shouldn't get his day in court though, she said.\n\n\"Something extremely important in this country, especially in this age where en masse we do not trust each other, is the right to a fair trial,\" McGee said. \"No matter what you think of someone as a person and what other things they may have done, what he is on trial for is a very specific thing that even he deserves the right to a fair trial\"\n\n−Anna Kaufman\n\nLawyers begin addressing jury candidates directly\n\nAround 11:37 a.m. ET, lawyers began to ask potential jurors questions directly. Before, the jury candidates had only been answering questions from a 42-question list Judge Juan Merchan decided on before the trial.\n\nJoshua Steinglass from the Manhattan District Attorney's office was the first lawyer to speak. He introduced himself and his team, and said they are trying to pick jurors who will be fair to the defense and to the prosecution.\n\n\"Let's start with the obvious,\" Steinglass said, noting Trump is a former president and current presidential candidate. Steinglass said jurors aren't expected to have been living under a rock; the important thing is that jurors are able to be fair.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDefendant Trump to hold political rally Saturday in North Carolina\n\nThe Trump campaign is moving forward with plans to hold political rallies around the hush money trial, scheduling an event for Saturday in Wilmington, N.C.\n\nThe airport rally is scheduled to start at 7 p.m. on Saturday; the trial takes weekends off.\n\nNorth Carolina is an important state in the fall presidential race between Trump and President Joe Biden.\n\nTrump carried North Carolina by narrow margins in 2016 and 2020, but Biden supporters believe that issues like abortion and Trump's criminal cases give them a chance to flip the state this fall.\n\n−David Jackson\n\nDismissed juror touts importance of fair trial\n\nKara McGee, a dismissed juror, exited the courtroom Tuesday afternoon to a swarm of microphones and cameras eager to hear what she thought of the former president and why she had been ousted from the pool.\n\nMcGee is one of the roughly 500 potential jurors called Monday when the trial kicked off. She was released Tuesday for scheduling conflicts with her cyber-security job.\n\n\"It was a little bit surreal to be that close to a former president, someone who's been on the news in the public eye so much,\" McGee told reporters. She reported looking down on the questionnaire while in the jury box and making only minimal eye contact with Trump who she assumed was looking at her.\n\nSome of the questions she was asked dealt with whether she had an opinion on the defendant being a former president, and how that should affect the trial. Mcgee told the judge she could be unbiased. \"It's very difficult for anyone really in this country to not come to this with prior opinions, I think we all have prior opinions about the defendant unless you've been living in a cardboard box since 2014,\" she said. \"But, personally, the right to a fair trial in this country is more important to me than anything this particular defendant has done or any feelings about him I personally have.\"\n\n−Anna Kaufman\n\nTrump mutters at defense table as potential juror says he is being treated fairly\n\nFormer President Donald Trump could be seen muttering at the defense table after a potential juror said she believed he was being treated fairly in the case.\n\nThe woman, who has lived in New York for more than 20 years, was responding to one of the questions each potential juror is being asked: \"Do you have any feelings or opinions about how Mr. Trump is being treated in this case?\"\n\nThe woman was later excused after she said she was \"not 100%\" sure she could be impartial in the case.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nHow long will the Trump trial last?\n\nThe trial will last about six-to-eight weeks, according to a court media advisory.\n\nThe proceedings are generally scheduled for Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday each week. The court may make some accommodations for the Passover holiday in April. Trump has asked for May 17 off for Barron Trump's high school graduation, but the judge has not yet issued a ruling on the request.\n\n-Kinsey Crowley and Aysha Bagchi\n\nJuror with Republican friends and family excused over bias concerns\n\nA potential juror who said he believed he had unconscious bias that could get in the way of being impartial was excused Tuesday morning.\n\nOriginally from Texas, the man added he wasn't sure he could be fair and impartial. Judge Juan Merchan then told him there was a need for an unequivocal assurance that he can be impartial. The potential juror said growing up he had a bunch of Republican family and friends and it would \"probably\" be hard to be impartial.\n\nAfter conferring privately with attorneys, Merchan excused the man from service.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump would rather be on the campaign trail\n\nThe former president and presumptive Republican nominee argued as he entered the courtroom Tuesday that he should be campaigning in state such as Pennsylvania, Florida, North Carolina and Georgia rather than attending the trial. He alleged again without evidence that the trial was being directed from the Biden White House.\n\n“They’re using this in order to try and win an election,” Trump said.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nMonday featured mass dismissals of potential jurors\n\nThe beginning of jury selection Monday afternoon demonstrated how many New Yorkers will be quickly deemed ineligible. About 96 potential jurors came into the courtroom and more than 50 were swiftly excused because they said they couldn't be fair and impartial. At least 10 more potential jurors were excused later for other reasons, leaving a much smaller group.\n\nIn total, the New York criminal court has called upon 500 New Yorkers to potentially comprise the 12 jurors and several alternates who will be asked to hear all the evidence in the trial.\n\n−Aysha Bagchi\n\nNew Yorkers unperturbed by Trump trial circus\n\nNew Yorkers who work in the Manhattan courts lined up behind police barricades to enter as NYPD officers reported there was a security freeze while Trump entered Tuesday morning.\n\nDan Horwitz, a white-collar defense attorney who had a case later that day sat in nearby Foley Park. “You get used to it,” he said of the interruptions the former presidents cases have caused “It’s just another day in New York.”\n\nJury selection may take some time, he says, but he does think it’s possible to find an impartial bench. “Jurors take their jobs seriously, it’s New York so you gotta weed out the nuts and people who are going to say 'I hate this guy,'” he said, “but most people take it seriously.”\n\n−Anna Kaufman\n\nAs crowds dissipate, Trump becomes just another New Yorker getting his day in court\n\nDay 2 of Donald Trump's first criminal trial kicked off with little fanfare. Even the modest crowds from the day before had dissipated leaving just two pro-Trump demonstrators wandering outside the courthouse.\n\n−Anna Kaufman\n\nTrump continues futile call for judge's recusal\n\nIn his pre-trial statement to the press Tuesday morning, Trump repeated his argument that Judge Juan Merchan should be removed from the case because his daughter works for Democratic politicians.\n\nMerchan has refused to withdraw, noting that the New York State Advisory Committee on Judicial Ethics' found Merchan's impartiality couldn't be reasonably questioned. The New York City Bar Association has described Trump's accusation of bias as \"baseless.\"\n\nTrump said legal scholars such as Jonathan Turley and Andrew McCarthy have called the prosecution a “disgrace.”\n\n“It should have never happened,” Trump said. “It should have been thrown out a long time ago.”\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nJurors are running late, judge says\n\nJudge Juan Merchan arrived in the courtroom at about 9:45 a.m. ET for the second day of trial proceedings. After the lawyers identified themselves and Trump, Merchan said, \"Good morning, counsel, good morning Mr. Trump.\" Trump made a displeased expression as the judge acknowledged him.\n\nThe judge said two potential jurors still haven't arrived, while a third has arrived despite feeling sick. Although she indicated she had tested negative for COVID-19, she also said she didn't feel well enough to be there. After checking with the lawyers, Merchan excused her from service.\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche said the missing jurors are running more than 15 minutes late and asked that they be excused from service. Merchan indicated he will give them at least a couple more minutes.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump contends payments accurately described as ‘legal expenses’\n\nFormer President Donald Trump gave a preview of his defense Tuesday at his New York criminal trial by arguing his payments to his former lawyer Michael Cohen − which the prosecution and Cohen say were reimbursements for hush money to porn star Stormy Daniels − were accurately described as “legal expenses” on his company records.\n\n“I was paying a lawyer and marked it down as a legal expense – some accountant, I didn’t know – marked it down as a legal expense,” Trump said during a two-minute statement to reporters before entering court. “That’s exactly what it was. And you get an indictment over that?”\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records. Cohen paid Daniels $130,000 to silence her claim before the 2016 election about having had sex with Trump in 2006, while Trump was married. Trump has denied her allegation.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nTrump arrives in courtroom for day 2 of hush money trial\n\nDonald Trump entered the courtroom and sat down at the defense table at 9:30 a.m. ET Tuesday for the second day of his New York hush money trial. He is wearing a blue suit jacket and striped blue tie.\n\nJury selection is expected to resume in the morning. Judge Juan Merchan sizably whittled down the first batch of about 96 potential jurors on Monday. Dozens were excused because they said they couldn't be fair and impartial in the case, while several more were let go for other reasons.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump trial day 2: schedule and location\n\nThe trial is scheduled to reconvene at 9:30 a.m. today at the criminal court in lower Manhattan.\n\nThe legal teams are expected to pick up where they left off yesterday, questioning dozens of potential jurors.\n\nProceedings are likely to run through the afternoon with a break for lunch. The trial takes off on Wednesdays, so after today, the trial will reconvene on Thursday morning.\n\n−Kinsey Crowley\n\nMonday was a bad day for Trump\n\nInside the courtroom, Monday wasn't a good day for the former president.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan opened proceedings by denying Trump's request for the judge's recusal. Trump argued Merchan should get off the case because his daughter leads a marketing agency that does work for Democratic political candidates. But Merchan noted the determination by the New York State Advisory Committee on Judicial Ethics that his impartiality couldn't reasonably be questioned based on his daughter's work because the Trump case doesn't involve her business.\n\nMerchan also denied a similar request from Trump back in August. \"The court will not address this matter further,\" he said Monday.\n\nThe Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office also asked for Trump to be held in contempt and fined based on alleged violations of Merchan's gag order on the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Merchan prohibited Trump from publicly commenting on the participation of potential witnesses in the case. But prosecutor Christopher Conroy pointed to three potential violations, including when Trump appeared to refer to Stormy Daniels and Michael Cohen as \"sleaze bags\" on his Truth Social media platform.\n\nThe judge scheduled a hearing on the gag order issue for April 23 – a signal he may entertain the prosecution's request.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nProtests fizzle out on second day of Trump’s trial\n\nAs reporters slowly trickled inside the Manhattan Criminal Court Tuesday morning, the park across from the courthouse was mostly empty aside from a handful of people sitting on benches. Near the court, a man held up a pro-Trump flag. Another man, wearing a black balaclava, held a sign “Israel vs. TikTok.”\n\n-Eduardo Cuevas\n\nWas Trump sleeping at the New York trial?\n\nTrump glared at New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman for several seconds when he walked out of the Manhattan courtroom during a short break Monday afternoon. Haberman reported earlier in the day that the presumptive Republican presidential frontrunner appeared to be sleeping in the courtroom: she saw his head drop down multiple times and his mouth go slack.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump and supporters complain about possibly missing his son’s graduation ceremony\n\nDonald Trump is continuing to campaign for the White House during his criminal trial in New York, but he and his allies are complaining about how the case could hinder his other priorities, such as attending Supreme Court arguments or his son’s graduation ceremony.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan acknowledged attending arguments April 25 over whether the former president is immune from federal prosecution is important, but not as much as the trial on charges he falsified business records to hide hush money payments.\n\n“This shows such great disdain and disrespect for our Nation’s Highest Court, especially for a topic so important as Presidential Immunity, without which our Country would never be the same!” Trump wrote Monday on Truth Social.Trump also asked to not appear at the trial May 17, so he could attend his son Barron’s high school graduation. Merchan said he’d think about it.\n\nTrump called Merchan a “highly biased Judge” and the case a “Witch Hunt.” Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s former campaign lawyer and a co-defendant in his election racketeering case in Georgia, also blasted the decision as if it was already made. “Heartless and cruel,” Giuliani wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. “These people have no heart or soul.”−Bart Jansen", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/04/19/donald-trump-hush-money-trial-news-updates/73379651007/", "title": "Trump trial updates: Man sets self on fire outside courthouse", "text": "Editor's note: This file recaps the news from Donald Trump's criminal trial on Friday, April 19.

The victim was seen dousing himself with a liquid around 1:35 p.m. in a park across the street from the Manhattan courthouse, witnesses told USA TODAY.\n\nThe shocking incident took place in full view of news cameras shortly after a full panel of 12 jurors and six alternates was seated for his hush money trial. Witnesses said the victim tossed the flyers into the air before dousing himself and setting himself ablaze with what appeared to be a lighter. Six first responders suffered minor injuries trying to put out the fire and provide medical attention, the New York City Fire Department said.\n\nKeep up with USA TODAY's live updates from inside and outside the Manhattan courthouse:\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nTrump trial live updates:Day 7 could bring cross-examination of Pecker, gag order ruling\n\nManifesto shows Max Azzarello was mired in conspiracy theories before setting himself on fire outside Trump trial\n\nIn a post on a Substack newsletter called \"The Ponzi Papers,\" Max Azzarello said he had burned himself alive to draw attention to the U.S. political and economic system.\n\n\"My name is Max Azzarello, and I am an investigative researcher who has set himself on fire outside of the Trump trial in Manhattan,\" the post says.\n\nAzzarello's manifesto took aim at Trump, President Joe Biden, cryptocurrency, and the federal government.\n\n\"To my friends and family, witnesses and first responders, I deeply apologize for inflicting this pain upon you,\" he wrote.\n\nWitness saw it coming: 'I'm going to see something bad here'\n\nA bystander who asked to be identified by only his first name, Dave, told USA TODAY he watched the victim's actions with a growing sense of panic before the man went up in flames.\n\n\"I heard this clap, and this fellow was throwing these papers into the air,\" the 73-year-old Manhattan resident said. \"He had a can and he poured fluid all over himself, at which point I thought, 'Oof, I'm going to see something bad here.'\"\n\n\"And sure enough, he pulled out a lighter. And he set himself on fire.\"\n\nOne person blasted the burning man with a fire extinguisher as a New York emergency medical technician joined the fray.\n\nBy the time the flames were doused, \"his face was completely black,\" another witness, Julie Berman, told reporters.\n\n−Aysha Bagchi\n\n'Don't interrupt me,' judge scolds Trump lawyer. 'Have a seat'\n\nWith court back in session, Judge Merchan arrived and the prosecution raised an issue about restricting access to information tied to Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and a potentially key witness in the case. Merchan engaged in a back-and-forth with Trump lawyer Emil Bove when the judge scolded the lawyer.\n\n\"Don't interrupt me,\" Merchan said. \"I'm not interrupting you,\" Bove shot back. \"You are. Have a seat,\" Merchan instructed.\n\nNew York Supreme Court Justice Marsha Michael denied a request Friday from Trump’s attorneys to halt the criminal trial. Another motion to move the case out of Manhattan is still pending.\n\nOpening statements in Trump’s trial are slated to begin Monday morning.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump: Judicial system in New York 'an outrage'\n\nIf Donald Trump testifies at his New York hush money trial, prosecutors want to introduce evidence about other his other legal disputes. Trump harshly criticized judges in other cases as he left the criminal trial.\n\nNew York Judge Arthur Engoron ordered Trump to pay $454 million in a civil fraud trial for exaggerating the value of his real estate. Trump is appealing.\n\n“Engoron is a whack job,” Trump said. “What he did was a disgrace.”\n\nU.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan presided over a trial where columnist E. Jean Carroll won $83 million in a defamation lawsuit for denying that he assaulted her in a department story changing room in the 1990s. Trump appealed that verdict, too.\n\n“I had no idea who this person was,” Trump said of Carroll.\n\n“What’s happening with the judicial system is an outrage,” Trump added.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan, who is presiding over the criminal trial, said he would rule Monday on what additional evidence prosecutors can introduce if Trump testifies.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nTrump's historic trial now has a full slate of 12 jurors and 6 alternates\n\nThe chosen alternate jurors have been were sworn in after two more were chosen.\n\nThey swore to try the case \"in a fair and impartial manner.\" Judge Merchan told the jurors he expects to begin the trial proceedings on Monday. He advised them proceedings will end at 2 p.m. ET on Monday and Tuesday and will run through lunch on those days.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump legal team opposed information from E. Jean Carroll trials\n\nThe Trump \"Sandoval hearing\" this afternoon is going into whether the prosecution can introduce multiple negative outcomes for Trump from past legal cases to undermine his credibility if he chooses to testify in his New York criminal case.\n\nThose negative outcomes include Trump's losses in two civil cases against New York writer E. Jean Carroll, where Trump was found liable for sexually abusing and defaming her. The former president was ordered to pay her $88.3 million in damages.\n\nTrump lawyer Emil Bove argued that bringing in information from the Carroll trials is inappropriate because it \"pushes the salaciousness\" onto another level.\n\nMerchan asked why not just keep out the allegations and just allow the findings in the cases to be introduced in the trial. Bove said that would still allow for inappropriate evidence.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\n'Egomaniacal' and 'the devil': Another potential alternate struck by judge\n\nAnother potential alternate juror was struck for impartiality concerns after the defense brought social media posts to the judge's attention that they believed were from an account belonging to the man.\n\nOn questioning, the potential juror didn't recall making certain posts he was shown (which were not shown to reporters). Some posts included descriptions of Trump as \"egomaniacal\" and \"the devil.\"\n\nAsked by Judge Merchan if the man believed Trump is the devil, the man replied: \"At that time, yeah, I may have felt that.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge advises Trump defense to stop flooding court with filings\n\nJudge Juan Merchan is addressing additional issues with prosecutors and Trump's defense team after wrapping up the Sandoval hearing.\" Merchan advised Trump's defense that they need to accept his rulings at a certain point. He complained that the defense was targeting individual court decisions \"one by one by one\" and submitting filings challenging them.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nSocial media comes back to haunt yet another potential juror\n\nDefense attorney Susan Necheles asked Judge Merchan to strike another potential alternate based social media posts she showed to the judge (the posts weren't shown to reporters).\n\nAfter bringing the man in for questioning, Merchan said he found the prospective juror credible − adding that he didn't know that the sentiments in the posts were anti-Trump. But Merchan said he was concerned that one of the photographs that was featured included text describing \"a massive anti-Trump rally.\"\n\nToo many people have worked too hard to get the case this far, Merchan said. \"I'm going to grant the challenge for cause.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nMore:How Donald Trump's hush money trial team is using social media to weed out New York jurors\n\nThird and fourth alternate jurors chosen\n\nTwo more alternate jurors have been chosen, making four alternates at this point. One is a man who is an audio professional. He earlier said he believed Trump is being treated fairly. The other is a woman who is active in a school parents' association.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDismissed juror number 4 speaks out: 'I feel sorry for the other jurors'\n\nUSA TODAY Network had an exclusive interview Thursday with Herson Cabreras, who was chosen for the jury on Tuesday but kicked off two days later, after the prosecution raised questions about whether he accurately described his background.\n\nThe kerfuffle over his jury service arose after prosecutors raised the issue of a 1991 incident in which Cabreras and an associate were accused of tearing down political campaign signs in Harrison, New York.\n\n\"I feel sorry for the other jurors,\" he said, expressing concern about other jurors potentially being dragged into the center of a fiercely contested legal battle.\n\n-Asher Stockler\n\nJudge strikes Women's March attendee from alternate juror contention\n\nJudge Merchan struck a potential alternate juror based on impartiality concerns.\n\n\"I don't believe she's being disingenuous. I do believe that she's credible,\" Merchan said. However, leaning on the side of caution and \"looking at her answers as a whole,\" he said he thought the safer course is to grant the defense's challenge for cause.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump team trying to get woman who attended Women's March struck by judge\n\nTrump lawyer Susan Necheles is arguing that a woman who attended the Women's March protest after Trump's presidential election should be struck by the judge based on impartiality concerns. Necheles said the potential juror made statements such as that Trump enabled racist and homophobic comments.\n\nThe potential alternate said earlier she didn't know what Trump's rhetoric is, but she is familiar with people who made homophobic and racist comments and cited Trump.\n\nThe potential alternate has been brought in for additional questioning. She echoed her previous comments, but also told the judge she can be fair and impartial.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nSecond alternate juror chosen\n\nA second alternate juror, a woman who said she doesn't watch news, was chosen after neither side used a challenge to strike her. She will be the second alternate juror. The first alternate was chosen on Thursday.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump lawyer's questioning of potential jurors ends. We could have more alternates soon\n\nTrump lawyer Susan Necheles' questioning of potential alternate jurors has ended. The judge has given the lawyers some time to confer and review their notes before they will go through any challenges they have to the alternate juror candidates.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nPotential juror says his opinion on Trump is neutral, leaning hostile\n\nPressed by Trump lawyer Susan Necheles about his opinion on Trump, a potential juror said he likes Trump's tax policy, but doesn't like where the Republican Party is when it comes to women's rights over their bodies. The man said his opinion on Trump is neutral, leaning hostile.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nAlternate juror candidate says Trump's base 'can feel enabled by his rhetoric'\n\nA potential juror who attended the Women's March protest after Trump's presidential election said Trump's base can sometimes \"feel enabled by his rhetoric.\" But she also said she didn't know what his rhetoric is. She said she was familiar with people who made homophobic and racist comments and cited President Trump.\n\nNecheles asked if the potential juror would hold Trump responsible for that, and the woman said no. She said she thought of it as an issue at the ballot box, not in the court room.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nPotential juror questioned about attending Women's March\n\nTrump defense attorney Susan Necheles asked a potential juror about having attended the Women's March protest after Trump was elected president in 2016. Asked if there was strong anger toward Trump, the potential juror said she remembered the event as being about women's solidarity.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nAnother potential juror is excused after saying she was feeling anxiety\n\nA woman being considered for the remaining alternate juror spots spoke up as questioning continued between potential jurors and Trump lawyer Susan Necheles. She said she has started to feel anxiety and asked to approach the judge's bench. After a brief private conversation, Judge Merchan announced she was excused.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump lawyer Susan Necheles begins questioning potential jurors\n\nTrump defense lawyer Susan Necheles has begun questioning the potential alternate jurors.\n\n\"Biases color the way that we look at the world,\" she tells them. She asks them to continue to do the best they can \"to really be honest.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nHoffinger asking potential jurors about issue that may tie to Michael Cohen\n\nProsecutor Susan Hoffinger is asking potential jurors how they would feel about the testimony of someone who has pleaded guilty to a crime in the past. Former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen is a potential witness in the case and has pleaded guilty to multiple crimes, including lying to Congress.\n\nEveryone said they would keep an open mind.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWoman who said father is a lifelong Chris Christie friend gets emotional, is excused from jury duty\n\nA prospective juror who earlier in the day said her father is a lifelong friend of former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie – a one-time Trump ally who broke publicly with Trump after the former president refused to accept the 2020 election results and ran against him in the 2024 Republican primaries – has now been excused.\n\nDuring individualized questioning by prosecutor Susan Hoffinger, the potential juror suddenly said she thought she \"could do this,\" but it is more stressful than she expected. The woman was emotional, her voice cracking as she spoke.\n\nThe judge held a private conversation at his bench, and then stated the woman is excused.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nPotential juror disqualified. 'Good luck,' she said as she left\n\nA potential juror who earlier described having a criminal history and doubted she was allowed to serve as a juror has now been formally disqualified. The woman was the 21st potential juror to speak today, and she spoke emotionally about having been incarcerated, at one point mentioning some charges related to drugs. The judge still had her respond to the full jury questionnaire.\n\nThe woman said she is a firm believer that when people do something they should be accountable for their actions. In response to one question about following the judge's instructions on the law, she said, \"I promise to follow your instructions, sir.\"\n\nAfter the break, the judge said the woman was disqualified because she needs a particular certificate to be able to serve. He added that, depending on the nature of her charges, she may be able to serve in the future\n\n\"Okay, thank you,\" the woman said as the judge dismissed her. \"Good luck,\" she added. It wasn't clear to whom she directed that last comment.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nCourt proceedings resume\n\nCourt proceedings resumed around 11:37 a.m. ET.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nCourt takes 10-minute break\n\nThe judge announced a 10-minute break. The potential jurors who spoke today and weren't excused still need to be directly questioned by attorneys for the prosecution and defense. Trump was especially attentive yesterday as potential jurors responded to his lawyer's questioning about their opinions of him.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nPotential juror participated in Women's March\n\nWe are nearing the end of this batch of potential alternate jurors responding to the jury questionnaire. The current potential juror speaking was born in India and grew up in Minnesota. She said she participated in the Women's March, a protest after Trump was elected president in 2016.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nPotential juror's father is lifelong friend of Chris Christie\n\nThe 17th potential juror to speak today said her father is a lifelong friend of former Republican New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. Christie was a strong supporter of Trump during the 2016 general election and most of Trump's presidency, but he broke with Trump after Trump refused to accept the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\n14th potential juror volunteered for Clinton campaign\n\nThe 14th potential juror to speak today may not be someone the Trump legal team wants as an alternate. He said he volunteered for the Clinton campaign. That appears to be the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. The juror questionnaire asks if the jury candidates have ever attended a campaign event for any anti-Trump group or organization.\n\nThe man said he gets his news from The New York Times. He doesn't watch much TV, but his television news would be from MSNBC, he said.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nThird potential alternate juror excused over impartiality concerns\n\nA third potential juror was excused at the get-go of her time to speak today. She said after reading the 42 questions on the jury questionnaire yesterday, she doesn't think she can be impartial. Judge Merchan released her.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump awake, alert again for past several potential jurors\n\nAfter appearing to be sleepy and struggling to stay awake as potential jurors responded to the jury questionnaire earlier this morning, Trump has been fully awake through the past several potential jurors speaking.\n\nWe are on the eleventh potential juror to speak this morning.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump Media stock price\n\nAt open on Thursday April 19, Trump Media & Technology Group Corp's share price rose to $36.95, up 11.33% from Wednesday April 18's close.\n\n– Kinsey Crowley\n\nAnother potential juror says she doesn't think she can be impartial\n\nA woman was excused after she said, upon learning of the questions posed to potential jurors, she doesn't think she can be impartial.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump continues to appear sleepy\n\nTrump's eyes have often been closed for extended periods – dozens of seconds at a time – as the third potential juror to respond to the jury questionnaire this morning is speaking.\n\nAt one point, his mouth went agape for seconds as his eyes were closed. He just opened his eyes as the jury candidate said she might have read his book, \"Trump: The Art of the Deal,\" when she was younger.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump appears sleepy\n\nTrump's eyes have been closed almost entirely for more than two minutes as the second potential juror to be questioned this morning is speaking.\n\nHis head dropped down at least three times before he lifted it back up. After the third time, he opened his eyes and said something to his lawyer, Emil Bove. He is now looking around.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nFirst potential alternate juror excused\n\nThe first potential juror to be questioned this morning was quickly excused. She raised at the get-go her anxiety about participating in the trial. She said she worried people in her life would figure out she was on the jury over time, even without her telling them, and that could prevent her from being fair and impartial.\n\nJudge Merchan excused her.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nPotential jurors arrive and receive questionnaire\n\nThe potential alternate jurors who will be questioned to start off the morning have arrived and been passed a copy of the 42-question jury questionnaire.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge Juan Merchan arrives\n\nJudge Juan Merchan just arrived.

Prosecutors are also seated at their table in the courtroom.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhat is Trump on trial for?\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to charges that he falsified business records to cover up a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels that was designed to unlawfully interfere in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe payment was made by former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen and violated federal campaign finance laws, according to prosecutors. They say Trump authorized the payment to help his presidential campaign, and falsified records to cover up the checks he sent to reimburse Cohen for the hush money.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWho are Donald Trump's lawyers?\n\nTrump's defense team is led by Todd Blanche and Susan Necheles.\n\nBlanche was a federal prosecutor for nine years in the Southern District of New York, which includes Manhattan.

That's a hearing where the judge would consider what kind of evidence the prosecution may introduce on Trump's prior \"bad acts\" if he chooses to testify.\n\nTrump said last week he plans to testify, although he also said he would testify when the defense had a chance to put on witnesses in his civil fraud trial, only to back out the day before he was scheduled to take the stand.\n\nAccording to March court filings, the prosecution wants to question Trump about several legal determinations, including a civil jury's finding that Trump sexually abused New York writer E.

One expressed concern about her identity becoming public and her ongoing ability to render a judgment free from outside influences. The other was excused after questions were raised about whether the man was truthful in responding to a question about whether he or anyone close to him had been accused of a crime.\n\nKeep up with USA TODAY's coverage of the former president's groundbreaking trial.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nCourt has wrapped for Thursday\n\nCourt proceedings have wrapped for the day.

He cited one calling it a \"zombie case,\" in reference to the fact that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's predecessor had opened the investigation but didn't bring charges.\n\n“It’s a whopping outrage,” Trump said. “The whole world is watching this hoax.”\n\nTrump, who has bristled about being kept in court rather than out campaigning for president, complained about the courtroom being cold.\n\n“I’m sitting here for days now, from morning 'til night, in that freezing room,” Trump said. “Everybody was freezing in there.”\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nJudge says he 'can't fault' prosecutors for not sharing witness names in light of Trump's attacks\n\nIn light of Trump's social media posts attacking potential witnesses, prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said he didn't intend to share with the defense the names of witnesses the prosecution will call. Steinglass said that's a courtesy he would normally extend during a trial, but not under these circumstances.\n\n\"I can't fault the people for that,\" Judge Juan Merchan said. Trump lawyer Todd Blanche proposed that he could represent to the court that Trump wouldn't post about any witness.\n\n\"That he will not tweet about any witness? I don't think you can make that representation,\" Merchan said.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge to end Monday proceedings early in light of Passover\n\nJudge Juan Merchan said he will end proceedings on Monday early at 2:00 p.m. ET in light of the Passover holiday.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge indicates he expects to be ready for opening statements Monday\n\nAlthough Judge Juan Merchan said \"We have our jury,\" after the 12th juror and one alternate was chosen, several more alternates are still needed and the selection process is expected to continue Friday.\n\nThe selected jurors were sworn in, and Merchan told them he expects to have the alternates before Monday morning.

One alternate has also been selected.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan also rejected a defense request to strike a potential juror based on impartiality concerns. Merchan didn't find that social media posts flagged by the defense raised sufficient concern.\n\n\"We have our jury,\" Merchan said Thursday.\n\n–Aysha Bagchi\n\nPotential juror who called Trump a 'racist, sexist narcissist' struck by judge\n\nAfter questioning a potential juror, Judge Juan Merchan, agreed with the defense to strike her over concerns about her impartiality, though he also said he found her credible. The potential juror called Trump a \"racist, sexist narcissist\" among other strong language in social media posts. The posts appeared to be old. The judge referred to posts from nearly eight years ago.\n\nOn questioning, the potential juror said she would \"withdraw the term racist,\" and she felt she should apologize for some of the tone of her posts. She said she does have some strong feelings about the politics of that time, and understood the defense's concern, but also believed at her core \"that everybody is entitled to a fair trial.\"\n\nI don't think that we need to \"take a chance with this juror,\" Merchan said. \"Those were pretty strong views that she expressed.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nShe called him a 'racist, sexist narcissist': Trump lawyer asks judge to strike potential juror\n\nAnother small batch of potential jurors who have been through questioning are going through the final steps of the selection process. Trump lawyer Susan Necheles has asked Judge Juan Merchan to strike one of the candidates based on social media posts in her past.\n\n\"These posts are vitriol,\" Necheles said. \"She harbors a deep hatred of him.\"\n\nShe called him a \"racist, sexist narcissist,\" Necheles added. Necheles said one post suggested Trump was a liar, which Necheles said wasn't appropriate for a juror who would be judging Trump's veracity or failure to tell the truth. Necheles added that the potential juror said Trump was \"anathema\" to everything the woman was taught about love and other values.\n\nThe woman has been called in for additional questioning.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTwo new jurors selected for jury in Trump hush money trial, replacing lost spots\n\nAfter the prosecution and defense teams had the chance to use their own against potential jurors – essentially vetoes to having someone on the jury – two new jurors have been selected. They will take the seats of the two individuals who were selected for the jury on Tuesday but then excused earlier on Thursday.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge rejects defense request for judge to strike potential juror with Trump legal team connection\n\nJudge Juan Merchan denied a request from Trump lawyer Susan Necheles to strike a potential juror who said she met Necheles about 15 years ago through her husband. The man married to the potential juror and Necheles were both lawyers at the time, the potential juror said, adding that the couple went and stayed at Necheles' house.\n\nNecheles pushed for the potential juror to be removed. Necheles described knowing the husband well.\n\n“She doesn’t really know you,” Merchan said, speaking of the potential juror.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nPotential juror dismissed by judge\n\nThe judge said he would excuse a potential juror after Trump's legal team noted the potential juror had herself raised questions about her ability to be impartial and prosecutors acceded to her being excluded as a candidate for the jury.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump legal team is making arguments for judge striking potential jurors\n\nTrump's legal team is making arguments about why they think the judge should himself strike potential jurors from being candidates for the jury based on concerns about their ability to be impartial.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nHow many jurors need to be selected in Donald Trump's hush money case?\n\nTwelve jurors and several alternates will need to be selected. Forty-eight potential jurors brought in Thursday morning were excused after saying they couldn't be impartial in the case and another nine were excused for other reasons.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump lawyer ends questioning of potential jurors\n\nTrump lawyer Susan Necheles finished her questioning of the potential jurors who have been answering questions from the jury box. The lawyers are now conferring. We could have more jurors selected soon.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nEntrepreneurial potential juror voices admiration for Trump\n\nOne potential juror expressed admiration for Trump. \"He was our president,\" the man said. \"Pretty amazing.\" The potential juror also said Trump made history.\n\nThe man said he himself started as an entrepreneur and made a lot of things happen, \"just like he has,\" referring to Trump. Trump lawyer Susan Necheles responded, \"I appreciate that.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nPotential juror calls Donald Trump 'very selfish and self-serving\"\n\nDonald Trump is leaning forward in his chair, watching the jurors intently, as his lawyer Susan Necheles asks potential jurors if they have strong opinions about him.\n\n\"I don't have strong opinions about him, but I don't like his persona,\" one potential juror just said. When pressed, the potential juror added that Trump is just \"very selfish and self-serving.\" She said she doesn't really appreciate that in any public servant and that it's not her \"cup of tea.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump chuckles as potential juror says she saw him and ex-wife\n\nFormer President Donald Trump chuckled as a potential juror said she once saw him with his former wife, Marla Maples, shopping for baby things. The potential jurors are being questioned by Trump lawyer Susan Necheles.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump lawyer Susan Necheles begins questioning potential jurors\n\nTrump lawyer Susan Necheles has begun questioning potential jurors. She asks them if anyone has a problem being able to believe a witness is lying.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nProsecutor tells jury candidates: No one's going to testify that Trump said, 'Hey, let's falsify business records'\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass said probably the #1 quality his team looks for in a jury is \"common sense.\" That, he said, means examining what the facts are and what logical inferences can be drawn from those facts.\n\nSteinglass went on to say that no witness will get on the stand and testify Mr. Trump said, \"Hey, let's falsify business records,\" let's commit fraud, let's pull the wool over the eyes of Americans.\n\nTrump's legal team made an objection to the comment, which Judge Merchan overruled.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJury selection resumes after lunch\n\nJury selection proceedings have resumed.\n\nJudge Merchan apologized to the potential jurors that the courtroom is cold. He gave them some instructions on how attorneys for both sides will ask them questions, and prosecutor Joshua Steinglass has begun addressing them.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWho is Emil Bove?\n\nEmil Bove is one of Trump's criminal defense lawyers, along with Todd Blanche and Susan Necheles. Politico reported he joined the cohort in September 2023.\n\nBove is a former federal prosecutor at the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.\n\n“Emil is an expert in white collar and CIPA-related litigation and his trial skills are among the best in the business,” Blanche said in a statement provided to Politico.\n\n-Kinsey Crowley\n\nDA Alvin Bragg takes a muted approach\n\nSome prosecutors seek the spotlight. New York Attorney General Letitia James has been trading barbs with Donald Trump, who she has successfully sued for business fraud, for years.\n\nNot Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney who was the first prosecutor to secure an indictment against the former president − or any former president. As Politico New York reports, \"he appears to be a reluctant participant in his own narrative, avoiding interviews and declining to discuss the Trump case in public settings.\"\n\n“I only talk about that matter in court filings and in the court. That’s what we do,” Bragg told the outlet last week.\n\n-Ben Adler\n\nWho are Donald Trump's lawyers?\n\nTrump's defense team is led by Todd Blanche and Susan Necheles.\n\nBlanche was a federal prosecutor for nine years in the Southern District of New York, which includes Manhattan. As a prominent white-collar defense lawyer he has defended Trump advisor Boris Epshteyn and Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort.\n\nNecheles is ranked among the top criminal defense lawyers in New York by the legal rating and head-hunting firm Chambers and Partners. She was also a former counsel to Venero Mangano, the former Genovese crime family underboss known as Benny Eggs.\n\n-Josh Meyer\n\nJury selection breaks for lunch, returning at 2:15 p.m. ET\n\nJudge Merchan broke for lunch after 18 potential jurors either responded to the full jury questionnaire or were excused. Merchan instructed the potential jurors to be ready at 2:15 p.m. ET, and that they would proceed with individualized questioning by lawyers from both sides.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nPotential juror who associates Donald Trump with Silvio Berlusconi excused\n\nA potential juror from Italy was excused after he said he had previously seen Italian media that made associations between Trump and former Italian media mogul and prime minister Silvio Berlusconi.\n\nThe potential juror said it was hard as he was sitting there in the courtroom to maintain impartiality. Judge Merchan excused him.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWho is Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg?\n\nLast year, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg became the first prosecutor to secure a criminal indictment against a former president.\n\nIn 2022, Bragg's office won convictions against two parts of the Trump Organization and its chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg for a tax avoidance scheme.\n\nThe Harlem native earned his undergraduate and law degrees from Harvard University and became an assistant state attorney general and an assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York before being elected district attorney in 2021.\n\nBragg, a Democrat, campaigned as an avid criminal justice reformer. Trump has tried to portray him as uninterested in combatting street crime. Bragg's office notes that violent crime has dropped in the borough during his tenure, however.\n\n-Bart Jansen\n\nWho is Stormy Daniels and what is her real name?\n\nStormy Daniels, born Stephanie Clifford, is an adult film star.\n\nDaniels claims she had an affair with Trump in 2006, months after Melania Trump gave birth to Barron Trump. Michael Cohen paid her $130,000 to stay quiet about the alleged affair ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n\n-Kinsey Crowley\n\nPotential jurors resume responding to jury questionnaire\n\nWe have now resumed hearing potential jurors answering each of the 42 questions.\n\nThe first potential juror speaking as we return is an attorney who said on occasion she watches Fox News just to try to see what's going on on all sides, but more regularly gets her news from The New York Times, CNN, Google, The Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Post.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTwo dismissed jurors leaves only five people on jury so far\n\nThursday was meant to be a day moving forward toward seating a full jury for Trump's hush money case. And new potential jurors have answered preliminary questions this morning.\n\nBut progress has also reversed: we are down to five selected jurors. To get to opening statements in the case, 12 jurors plus several alternates are needed.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJuror #4 is excused\n\nJudge Merchan said he is directing that Juror #4 be excused. The man is no longer expected to show up on Monday.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJuror #4 brought back into courtroom\n\nJuror #4 has been brought back into the courtroom and taken to the judge's bench, where Merchan and lawyers from both sides are standing.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nLawyers discussing Juror #4 with judge\n\nAfter briefly leaving the courtroom, Judge Merchan returned and described having had a conference at the bench with Juror #4. Merchan said some of the information shared was very personal and the judge was going to direct that portion of the published transcript be sealed. \"I will also note for the record that he expressed annoyance\" at how information about him had gotten out there in the public, the judge added, speaking about the juror.\n\nMerchan then asked the attorneys if they had talked about what to do about the juror. Lawyers from both sides approached the judge's bench and are having private discussion there.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nVisiting a bodega, hosting a foreign leader: Trump campaigns in New York during trial\n\nWhile attending jury selection in the New York hush money trial this week, Donald Trump is finding ways to promote his presidential campaign through a campaign-style visit to a Harlem bodega, a meeting with Poland’s president and a planned rally in North Carolina.\n\nAt the bodega, the scene of a fatal stabbing in 2022, Trump railed Tuesday against crime despite a drop in violent crime statistics. He criticized Judge Juan Merchan, who is presiding over his case, and the prosecutor, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\n\nThe former president hosted Poland’s President Andrzej Duda at Trump Tower on Wednesday, saying he’s “done a fantastic job.”\n\nTrump plans a political rally Saturday in Wilmington, N.C., a key swing state.\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nSelected Juror #4 leaves courtroom, attorneys to confer\n\nSelected Juror #4 was interviewed at the judge's bench, although the content of the discussion couldn't be heard. Trump lawyer Todd Blanche chuckled at the juror's first answers. After the conversation ended, the juror was escorted out of the courtroom by court officers.\n\nJudge Merchan said he would give the lawyers a few minutes to talk about it.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nHow is Trump Media stock price?\n\nAt open on April 18, Trump Media & Technology Group Corp share price fell to $25.82, down 2.2% from previous close.\n\n-Kinsey Crowley\n\nWhen is Trump's Georgia trial?\n\nDonald Trump faces 10 criminal counts in Georgia related to alleged election interference.\n\nHis trial in the Peach State hasn't been scheduled yet, but it will be televised, making it the only of Trump's four criminal cases to be broadcast.\n\nFulton County District Attorney Fani Willis proposed to start the trial Aug. 5, but that would mean the potentially five-month trial would be running on Election Day.\n\n– Bart Jansen & Kinsey Crowley\n\nSelected Juror #4 arrives for possible questioning\n\nSelected Juror #4, about whom questions were asked earlier this morning, has come into the courtroom and up to the bench to talk to Judge Merchan. The man was one of seven jurors chosen Tuesday to serve throughout the trial, although one of those seven was excused earlier this morning.\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass said earlier today there are questions about whether the man was truthful in responding to a question about whether he or anyone close to him had been accused of a crime.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhat is voir dire?\n\nVoir dire is the process of questioning potential jurors to see if they are suitable to sit on the jury. The judge and attorneys on both legal teams ask jurors questions to see if they can be fair and impartial in the case.\n\n−Kinsey Crowley\n\nCourt takes short break in jury selection\n\nThe court is taking a short break in jury selection. So far, eight potential jurors have responded orally to the 42 questions on the jury questionnaire.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump appears attentive as potential jurors respond to questions\n\nFormer President Donald Trump appears to be giving his full attention to each potential juror responding to a set of 42 preliminary questions on a jury questionnaire. The questions include whether prospective jurors have been the victim of a crime, whether they have read Trump's books, and where they get their news.\n\nIn previous jury selection sessions, Trump has sometimes held a copy of the questionnaire and read along, as jurors read the questions silently and responded orally. Multiple reporters also said they have previously seen him falling asleep.\n\nToday he has largely been sitting with his chair pushed back and turned toward the jury box.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump has brief exchange with court security officer\n\nFormer President Donald Trump called over a court security officer and appeared to ask him something, starting with \"excuse me.\" It was a brief exchange while potential jurors answer preliminary questions.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nPotential juror participated in Women's March\n\nA potential juror responding to the 42 initial questions that are individually posed to potential jurors said she had discussed the case with co-workers. She said \"it's hard to unring the bell,\" but she did give the judge her assurance that she would follow his instructions on the law and base her decision on the evidence introduced in the courtroom.\n\nShe said she has discussed the book of former prosecutor Mark Pomerantz in the Manhattan D.A.'s office, \"People vs. Donald Trump.\" Pomerantz resigned from the office in 2022 while voicing criticism of the failure to seek an indictment against Trump. Trump was later indicted in 2023.\n\nThe potential juror also said she had participated in the Women's March, which was a protest after Trump was elected president.\n\n−Aysha Bagchi\n\n18 potential jurors randomly selected to enter the jury box for questioning\n\n18 potential jurors of those remaining in the courtroom were randomly selected to enter the jury box, with their assigned numbers being called, to respond to the 42 questions on the jury questionnaire Judge Juan Merchan decided on in advance of trial.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\n9 additional potential jurors excused for other reasons\n\nAnother nine potential jurors were excused after indicating they couldn't serve on the jury for reasons other than the inability to be fair and impartial.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nAbout 48 potential jurors excused after saying they can't be fair and impartial\n\nApproximately 48 potential jurors were excused from a batch of about 96 Thursday after saying they couldn't be fair and impartial in the case. That compares with at least 50 from a similar batch who were excused at the same point in the process earlier this week.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump lawyers ask for delay in federal classified documents case because of New York trial\n\nDonald Trump’s lawyers have asked for a delay in filing written arguments in his classified documents case in Florida until three weeks after the New York hush money trial ends because the same lawyers are working on both cases.\n\nTrump faces federal charges in Florida that he retained national defense records at his Mar-a-Lago resort. His lawyers, Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, who specializes in classified documents, have a May 9 deadline to file arguments about expert testimony and evidence in the case.\n\nBut Blanche and Bove are choosing jurors in New York for his trial on charges he falsified business records to hide hush payments to a porn star before the 2016 election.\n\nThe requirement to discuss filings in the classified records case only in a secure facility is “a virtually impossible task” during the New York trial, the lawyers wrote.\n\nJustice Department special counsel Jack Smith argued against a delay because the the lawyers have had months to prepare. But Trump’s lawyers called the argument “untethered to reality.”\n\nU.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon haven’t ruled on the request.\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nProspective jurors currently being excused from service\n\nJudge Juan Merchan asked the new large batch of potential jurors to indicate if they can't be fair and impartial. Many are being excused from service now. In a previous batch of about 96 potential jurors, at least 50 were excused based on their responses to this initial question.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nNew large group of potential jurors brought in\n\nA new group of dozens of potential jurors has been brought in to start their jury selection process. Judge Merchan is asking them whether they personally know any of several potential witnesses or people tied to the case.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nIssue raised about selected Juror #4\n\nAfter the judge excused selected Juror #2 from jury service Thursday morning, he explained there is a possible issue with selected Juror #4.\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass then explained the prosecution still isn't sure if the issue actually involves Juror #4. They discovered an article stating that a person with the same name had been arrested in the 1990s for tearing down political advertisements. Steinglass said it also seemed the juror's wife was involved in a corruption inquiry that ended with her entering into an agreement with the Manhattan District Attorney's office.\n\nSteinglass noted one of the questions on the jury questionnaire asks whether the potential juror or anyone close to the person has been accused or arrested for a crime. If in fact either of the issues actually does involve this juror or his wife, that would suggest his answer to the question wasn't accurate, Steinglass said.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump lawyer defends former president's posts\n\nTrump lawyer Emil Bove disputed that the Trump posts the prosecution brought up Thursday morning violated the judge's gag order, and said the Trump team will be explaining their argument more fully in a written filing. Bove said former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen has been attacking Trump, and that Merchan had previously said the gag order didn't prevent Trump from responding to political attacks.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nProsecutor says Trump has violated judge's gag order seven more times\n\nProsecutor Christopher Conroy told Judge Juan Merchan that former President Donald Trump has violated the judge's gag order seven more times, in addition to three alleged violations Conroy brought to the judge's attention earlier this week. Conroy wants the new alleged violations added to what's addressed at a hearing next Tuesday on the issue.\n\nSome of the alleged new violations involve former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, who could be a key witness in the case. Another was a post by Trump on Truth Social appearing to quote Fox News host Jesse Watters, stating: “They are catching undercover Liberal Activists lying to the Judge in order to get on the Trump Jury.\"\n\nConroy said that while the prosecution still supports fining Trump, they are still considering their options, as far as the Tuesday hearing goes, in terms of what sanctions they will recommend Trump face. Earlier in the week, the prosecution asked Merchan to warn Trump that future violations could result in jail time.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nCandidate Trump meets with president of Poland during trial's off-day\n\nTrump staged another campaign-within-a-trial event Wednesday night, this one a foreign policy gig: A meeting with Poland President Andrzej Duda.\n\n\"We're behind Poland all the way,\" Trump told reporters as he greeted Duda at Trump Tower.\n\nThe Trump campaign is lining up a series of campaign events in and around the hush money trial, including Tuesday's visit to a bodega in Harlem to discuss the crime issue, and to protest the judge and prosecutors.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump is scheduled to host a political rally in Wilmington, N.C.\n\n-David Jackson\n\nJudge directs press covering Trump trial not to report identifying information about jurors\n\n\"I'm directing the press\" to refrain from writing about anything that you observe with your eyes or hear with your ears related to jurors, Judge Juan Merchan said Thursday morning, after dismissing Juror #2 from jury service.\n\nMerchan specifically instructed the press not to report potential jurors' answers to two questions on the jury questionnaire asking who the individual's employer is and how large the employer is.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nSelected juror for Donald Trump's trial is excused from jury service\n\nJudge Juan Merchan excused Juror #2, who was selected on Tuesday. \"I definitely have concerns now,\" the juror said upon questioning Thursday morning. She said one of her concerns is that aspects of her identity were now out there in the public. On Wednesday she had friends and colleagues sending things to her phone questioning her identity as a juror. She said she doesn't believe at this point she can be fair and unbiased, and not let outside influences affect her judgment in the courtroom.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge says there is an issue with a selected juror\n\nJudge Juan Merchan opened proceedings Thursday by saying Juror #2, one of the seven jurors selected Tuesday, called Wednesday voicing concerns about her ability to be fair and impartial in case. The juror is being brought in for questioning.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump hit with series of setbacks in first two trial days\n\nA lot was rough for Trump in his first two trial days.\n\nTo start things off Monday, Judge Juan Merchan denied Trump's request for the judge to recuse himself. Merchan later scheduled a hearing for next week over whether Trump violated a gag order and should be warned that future violations could earn him jail time.\n\nOn Tuesday, the judge admonished Trump after hearing him commenting while a potential juror was being questioned about a video she posted that featured an anti-Trump event. The judge said juror intimidation wouldn't be tolerated. \"Speak to your client,\" Merchan instructed Trump's lawyer.\n\nTrump also appears unhappy with jury selection, posting on Truth Social Wednesday – a day off in the trial – that his allotted 10 opportunities to exclude potential jurors is \"not nearly enough.\"\n\nThat's to say nothing of the fact that multiple reporters said they have seen Trump falling asleep in court.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump arrives in courtroom\n\nFormer President Donald Trump entered the courtroom, accompanied by his lawyers. He waved but didn't comment or take questions.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhat is Trump on trial for?\n\nTrump,77, faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment he authorized his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, to make to porn star Stormy Daniels less than two weeks before the 2016 presidential election. The records falsely indicated that checks to Cohen were for legal services rather than to reimburse him for paying the hush money, according to Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office.\n\nBragg's office alleges the falsification was done to conceal violating federal campaign finance laws and hide a plan to break New York tax and election laws, making the charges felonies rather than misdemeanors.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty.– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhere is Melania Trump?\n\nMelania Trump hasn't attended the trial so far.\n\nWhen she first saw reports in January of 2018 that her husband had paid off a porn star to keep quiet about an alleged affair, she was furious, according to The New York Times. She left Washington for Florida, and took a separate car to her husband's State of the Union address after she returned.\n\nBut The New York Times also reported Melania Trump agrees with her husband that the Manhattan trial is unfair. The paper cited several people familiar with her thoughts.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWho is Judge Juan Merchan?\n\nNew York Judge Juan Merchan who is presiding the first criminal trial in history of a former president, is no stranger to the defendant, Donald Trump.\n\nMerchan presided over a 2022 tax-fraud trial of two parts of the Trump Organization, in which the company’s former chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, was convicted for not reporting $1.7 million in benefits, and he sentenced Weisselberg to five months in jail.\n\nTrump has attacked Merchan as biased on the grounds that Merchan's daughter works for a marketing firm with Democratic politicians as clients, and he has twice unsuccessfully moved for Merchan to recuse himself from the case. Merchan has refused, citing the New York State Advisory Committee on Judicial Ethics finding that the judge's impartiality couldn't be reasonably questioned based on his daughter's work.\n\nTrump's attacks spurred Merchan to expand a gag order to limit his commentary about the family members of people involved in the trial. On the second day of the trial, Merchan chastised Trump for speaking to prospective jurors.\n\nMerchan has been a felony judge for 15 years.\n\n-Bart Jansen\n\nPotential witnesses in Trump’s hush money trial\n\n• Stormy Daniels: Daniels claims she had an affair with Trump in 2006, months after Melania Trump gave birth to Barron Trump. Michael Cohen paid her $130,000 to stay quiet about the alleged affair ahead of the 2016 presidential election.1\n\n• Karen McDougal: McDougal indirectly received a hush money payment in 2016 after claiming to have an affair with Donald Trump. Cohen funneled the money through the National Enquirer under a \"catch and kill\" approach, paying the tabloid to buy rights to her story and prevent her from telling anyone else about it. Merchan has ruled she can be called to the witness stand, even though Trump’s charges are not related to her hush money.\n\n• Michael Cohen: Cohen paid a combined $280,000 to silence two women in 2016. \"Everything was done with the knowledge and at the direction of Mr. Trump,\" Cohen has testified under oath at a House hearing.\n\n• Hope Hicks: The former press secretary may have been in touch with Cohen about preventing Daniels from going public with her story, court records show. Hicks's lawyer has previously denied her involvement in the hush money payments.\n\n−Kinsey Crowley", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/04/11/donald-trump-new-york-hush-money-trial/72943245007/", "title": "Will Trump go to prison if he is convicted in hush money trial?", "text": "Former President Donald Trump could theoretically face more than a decade in prison if he is convicted on all counts in his New York criminal hush money trial.\n\nBut most legal experts who spoke to USA TODAY said such a dramatic outcome is unlikely. Instead, he would probably be sentenced to something between probation and four years in prison. And he would likely still be out, free to campaign for president as the presumptive or actual 2024 Republican nominee, while his all-but-certain appeal was pending.\n\nA jury of 12 Manhattan residents started deliberating on Wednesday.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. Each count carries a maximum sentence of four years.\n\nMore:Trump hush money trial jury deliberations begin: when we might we get a verdict\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nWhile Trump could in principle be sentenced to serve multiple counts consecutively, several experts said that is unlikely because he has no felony criminal record and the charges don't involve allegations of physical violence.\n\nOn the other hand, Trump has tested boundaries and feuded with the judge who may determine his fate.\n\nTrump has antagonized Judge Juan Merchan\n\nTrump's sentence would be decided by Judge Juan Merchan, who has grown exasperated by the former president's pretrial behavior. Merchan expanded a gag order this month after Trump attacked the judge's daughter on social media over her marketing work with Democratic candidates, including posting a photo of her. Merchan said Trump has a history of attacking the family members of judges and lawyers in his legal cases.\n\n\"The average observer, must now, after hearing Defendant's recent attacks, draw the conclusion that if they become involved in these proceedings, even tangentially, they should worry not only for themselves, but for their loved ones as well,\" Merchan wrote in his gag order decision.\n\nJohn Moscow, a New York lawyer who spent 30 years in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, told USA TODAY that type of behavior could worsen any sentence Trump faces.\n\n\"If I were representing somebody in (Trump's) position, I would suggest to him that the judge is the one who imposes sentence and he ought to be careful,\" Moscow said.\n\nIf Merchan did consider a hefty sentence, it wouldn't be the first time he has taken a harsh view about behavior in Trump's orbit.\n\nIn 2023, Merchan was forced to sentence former Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg to only five months in jail because Merchan had previously accepted a plea bargain agreement between Weisselberg and prosecutors specifying that jail term. Weisselberg pleaded guilty to tax and record falsification charges and agreed to testify against the Trump Organization at trial in order to get that sentence.\n\nThe judge said, however, that he \"would be imposing a sentence much greater than that\" had he not accepted the plea bargain before hearing all the evidence at the trial. Without the plea deal, Weisselberg could have faced many years in prison.\n\nWhat is Trump charged with?\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to all counts in the case, which focuses on whether he falsified business records to cover up reimbursements to his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, for a $130,000 hush money payment to Daniels. Daniels has said she had a sexual encounter with Trump soon after Melania Trump gave birth to their son, Barron Trump. Trump denies the claim.\n\nIn order to secure felony convictions, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office must convince a 12-person jury that Trump falsified the records in order to commit or conceal another crime. In this case, Bragg argues Trump was trying to conceal a federal campaign finance law violation by falsely recording his reimbursements to Cohen as payments for legal services. The federal violation was a limit-exceeding contribution to Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, as the payment was allegedly designed to keep Daniels' story from hurting the then-Republican nominee's election prospects. Bragg also alleges Trump was trying to conceal a plan to violate New York tax and election laws.\n\nNothing in the Constitution prevents Trump from becoming president even if he is convicted or sentenced to prison. If he won the election, however, courts may delay any prison time until after his term in office expires.\n\nWhat is the maximum possible sentence?\n\nThe 34 felony counts Trump faces are classified as \"Class E felonies\" under New York law – the lowest level felony in the state. The maximum penalty on each count is four years of prison, and a judge would have discretion over whether to order Trump to serve sentences on each count at the same time or one after the other. However, New York caps such sentencing for Class E felonies at 20 years.\n\nIn addition, New York judges often impose sentencing ranges, where an incarcerated person becomes eligible for parole at the low end of the range. For Class E felonies, the lowest end of a range would be one-and-a-third years per count, while the highest would be four years. Good behavior in jail or prison can speed things up even more.\n\nA sentence limited to probation?\n\nMerchan would also have discretion to order a fixed sentence of less than those ranges, including probation.\n\nThat's what Mitchell Epner, a New York lawyer with decades of criminal law experience, expects would happen even if Trump were convicted on all counts. Epner noted the felony charges aren't violent and don't involve drugs.\n\n\"With a defendant who has no prior criminal record, my absolute expectation would be a sentence of probation,\" Epner told USA TODAY.\n\nEpner wasn't alone in thinking that could be the sentencing outcome.\n\n\"This is a case that does not involve any physical violence, and it doesn't – there's not sort of a 'named victim,' so to speak – and so the court is going to take that into consideration,\" Anna Cominsky, who directs the Criminal Defense Clinic at New York Law School, told USA TODAY.\n\n\"In addition, I think it is unlikely that he would be sent to prison given who he is, given both the fact that he has no criminal record, and there is no getting around the fact that he is a former president of the United States,\" Cominsky said.\n\nIncarceration a real possibility\n\nNorman Eisen, a Brookings Institution senior fellow who served as special counsel to the House Judiciary Committee during Trump's first impeachment, thought a sentence that includes some incarceration is likely.\n\nEisen co-authored a report looking at sentencing for other defendants with no criminal history who were convicted of falsifying business records in New York. There, he noted one construction executive was sentenced in 2015 to spend two days each week in jail for a year for falsifying records to conceal payments in a bribery scheme. In 2013, two corporate executives were ordered to spend four to six months in jail for falsifying records to misclassify their salaries as expenses under their employer's larger bribery and fraud scheme.\n\n\"I think he's likely to face a sentence of incarceration if he's convicted,\" Eisen told USA TODAY.\n\nCominsky said the evidence Merchan hears at trial could also influence his thinking when it comes to sentencing.\n\n\"Often you'll hear judges refer to testimony at trial, evidence that was presented at trial, and say, 'This is why I'm imposing this sentence, because I heard from this particular witness or I saw this particular piece of evidence,'\" Cominsky said.\n\nMoscow pushed back against the assumption that Trump's sentences on each count would run simultaneously, instead of being stacked on top of each other. Just as a judge may take into account that a defendant has won a Nobel Peace Prize or lifted orphans from poverty, the judge may look at significant evidence of bad acts, Moscow said.\n\n\"When you start attacking the judge's daughter, and making her out to be a target, you have just breached the normal rules,\" Moscow said.\n\nTrump has also posted a photo of himself wielding a bat, with his eyes directed toward an adjacent photo of Bragg, among other attacks on the district attorney. Bragg's office has received thousands of harassing emails, calls, and texts – including death threats – after Trump's social media attacks, it said in a court filing.\n\nDiana Florence, a New York lawyer who spent decades in the Manhattan District Attorney's office, said Merchan's sentence would need to have some relation to what other white-collar defendants in similar cases have received, and she would be surprised if someone had ever gotten a sentencing range for falsifying business records with a minimum of 10 years or more.\n\nSuch a long sentence \"would be very, very, very, very unusual, and if Judge Merchan wanted to make a point and do that, I highly doubt the appellate division would allow that to stand,\" she said. \"It's just too much time for the conduct.\"\n\nHowever, Florence added that a reasonable sentencing range could include a minimum period of more than a year incarcerated.\n\nSentencing someone with Secret Service protection?\n\nContemplating any jail or prison sentence would take Merchan into unchartered territory: Trump is the first former president ever criminally charged, and the Secret Service provides him with around-the-clock security.\n\nBut avoiding a sentence of incarceration on that basis risks undermining the idea of equal treatment under the law, Moscow suggested.\n\n\"If I were the judge − and I don't know what a judge would do in this case − I would reject out of hand the concept that because he was once president, and because as a matter of policy the Secret Service guards former presidents, that therefore he can't go to jail,\" Moscow said.\n\nThe question would then become how to reconcile equal treatment with ensuring a former president's security, according to Moscow. The judge could get creative, for example by ordering the former president to stay in a hotel wing or at a military base, where he is isolated just like any other prisoner but still has Secret Service protection.\n\n\"You can structure things to achieve the proper result without conceding that the defendant has the upper hand,\" Moscow said.\n\nChances of immediate prison? 'Less than 1%'\n\nMany convicted defendants are \"remanded\" pending sentencing, a process in which they are taken into custody while they await their sentence, Florence said.\n\nBut Florence didn't expect Merchan to give that order when it comes to Trump, and even if Merchan did, Trump would likely be able to get bail set by an appeals court in the thousands of dollars to stay free during his appeal. That's all the more likely if Trump receives a low sentence, since the appeal could take longer than his actual sentence, she said.\n\n\"The chances of him going to prison immediately, even if he's convicted in whatever, six weeks from now or whenever, are I would say less than 1% because he would immediately be released on bail pending appeal,\" according to Florence.\n\nEisen agreed Trump probably wouldn't be incarcerated by Election Day, even if he's convicted on all counts.\n\n\"I think he's extremely unlikely to be forced to serve that sentence pending appeal,\" Eisen said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/04/15/donald-trump-trial-new-york-live-updates/73308381007/", "title": "Trump trial Day 1 recap: How the hush money case kicked off", "text": "Editor's note: This page reflects the news from Donald Trump's trial from Monday, April 15. For the latest news on theTrump trial, follow our live updates for Thursday, April 18.\n\nNEW YORK — Former President Donald Trump's historic New York criminal trial for allegedly falsifying business records to disguise a hush money payment to a porn star and unlawfully influence the 2016 presidential election started Monday.\n\nThe presumptive Republican presidential nominee faces 34 felony counts that each carry a maximum sentence of four years, although New York law caps such sentences at 20 years. If he is convicted, many legal experts have said a realistic sentence ranges from probation to four years in prison, although Trump would likely remain free on appeal during the duration of the presidential election.\n\nThe trial is the first of its kind. No former American president has ever been criminally indicted, although former President Richard Nixon may have faced that prospect if his former vice president, Gerald Ford, hadn't pardoned him.\n\nKeep up with USA TODAY's live updates from inside and outside the Manhattan courthouse:\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nTrump trial live updates:Will we get 12 jurors on Day 3? Jury selection continues today.\n\nDay 1 of Trump New York hush money trial ends\n\nJudge Juan Merchan declared the close of proceedings Monday in the first criminal trial against a former U.S. president as a colorful pattern of potential jurors emerged.\n\nDiverse interests in prospective jury pool\n\nMany jurors were excused straight away when they indicated they couldn't be fair or impartial in the case, or couldn't participate for some other reason such as a scheduling conflict. But as individualized jury questioning got underway, remaining potential jurors described varied jobs, hobbies, and family lives.\n\nThey described working as a prosecutor, a bookseller, a nurse, a creative director, and getting their news from The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and a host of other outlets including USA TODAY and Fox News.\n\nSome liked hiking, others cooking. One, who was later excused, said she likes to \"go to the club.\"\n\nJury selection didn't begin until the afternoon, after the judge and lawyers handled procedural legal issues.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDismissed juror speaks\n\nA man, who declined to give his name, walked out of criminal court with his jury identification in his pocket. His name was crossed out.He said the judge dismissed him from jury selection because his daughter had a wedding in early June in Seattle.He didn’t have to answer any questions for the selection, but he believed Trump could get a fair trial.“His challenge is that he's a public figure and there's a ton of information already,” he said.\n\n−Eduardo Cuevas\n\nJudge rejects Trump's request to be excused for Supreme Court immunity arguments\n\nAfter jurors were excused at the end of the day, Judge Juan Merchan rejected a request from Trump lawyer Todd Blanche to excuse the former president from the trial on April 25 so he can attend Supreme Court oral arguments in his criminal federal election interference case. The high court is reviewing whether Trump is immune from prosecution for official acts during his presidency.\n\n\"Arguing before the Supreme Court is a big deal,\" Merchan said, adding that he can very much understand why Trump would want to be there. However, Merchan said he wouldn't alter the plans for the criminal case on that basis.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump Media stock price plummets Monday\n\nWhile Trump was in court Monday, his Trump Media & Technology Group shares plummeted more than 18% after the company took steps to sell millions of additional shares.\n\nTrump Media, the parent company of social media platform Truth Social, filed to register up to 146.1 million shares for sale, including nearly 115 million owned by Trump personally. The company also listed the potential sale of another 21.5 million shares linked to warrants – contracts that give investors the right to buy or sell a stock at a specific price within a certain time frame.\n\nTrump Media’s market cap and Trump’s net worth – both tied to the company’s stock – have taken a hit as its stock price has dipped. The company’s market value as of Monday was more than $3.5 billion, down from a peak of nearly $8 billion.\n\n−Bailey Schulz\n\nTrump glares at reporter who said he appeared to be sleeping in court\n\nAs Trump walked out of the courtroom during a short break in the afternoon's proceedings, he glared at New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman for several seconds. Haberman reported earlier in the day that Trump appeared to be sleeping in the courtroom. She said she saw his head drop down repeatedly and his mouth go slack.\n\nHaberman has reported on Trump for years and wrote a 2022 book about him titled, \"Confidence Man: The Making of Donald Trump and the Breaking of America.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nIndividual jury questioning begins\n\nIndividualized questioning of potential jurors has begun as the New Yorkers orally respond to 42 jury questions Judge Juan Merchan decided on before trial.\n\nA young woman is the first to respond orally to each item from the questionnaire, which she is reading silently. Donald Trump appears to be reading the questions silently at the table as he listens to the responses.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nMore than half of first-round potential Trump jurors say they can't be impartial\n\nJudge Juan Merchan excused at least 50 potential jurors from a group he earlier said included 96 New Yorkers because they indicated they couldn't be fair and impartial in the case. A handful of the potential jurors were wearing masks.\n\nAt least nine more potential jurors were excused after they indicated they couldn't serve for other reasons that weren't disclosed, leaving about 34 potential jurors.\n\nIt was a speedy whittling-down of the first group of potential jurors to be sworn in as former President Donald Trump goes on trial over whether he falsified business records to cover up a hush money payment to a porn star ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge instructs potential jurors on being fair\n\nJudge Juan Merchan told prospective jurors that fair jurors will remain impartial and will guard against various stereotypes, asking themselves if their views on the defendant would be different if the defendant had a different political affiliation, among other attributes.\n\nMerchan also explained that the jurors are the judges of the facts in the case, while Merchan's job is to judge and instruct them on the law.\n\nDonald Trump has largely been looking at Merchan while the judge addresses the potential jurors, but he has occasionally looked at the jury box where some prospective jurors are sitting.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJurors are sworn in as judge begins opening remarks\n\nAt 2:34 p.m. ET, the first batch of potential jurors was sworn in. Judge Juan Merchan instructed the jury about the case and introduced the lawyers as well as Donald Trump. Both sides, including Trump, stood up after they were introduced and turned to face the potential jurors.\n\nMerchan gave the New Yorkers a brief description of the charges Trump faces. Merchan explained that the jury will have 12 jurors, and there will also be alternate jurors who would be called upon to join the jury if one of the 12 isn't able to complete the full trial.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge moves Trump contempt hearing up one day, to April 23\n\nJudge Juan Merchan moved the date for a hearing over whether Donald Trump violated a gag order and should be held in contempt in the New York hush money case. The hearing will now be held on Tuesday, April 23, one day sooner than originally planned.\n\nProsecutor Christopher Conroy argued earlier in the day that Trump should be held in contempt and fined $3,000 for three social media posts that Conroy said violated the judge's prohibition on Trump publicly commenting on the participation of potential witnesses.\n\nMerchan didn't announce any change to the deadline for Trump's legal team to respond in writing to the prosecution's allegations in advance of the hearing: it remains April 19.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nPotential Trump jurors begin going through security\n\nAt 2:05 p.m. ET potential jurors began going through the security that's in place before they can enter the courtroom for Donald Trump's hush money trial.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan has already decided on 42 questions the jury candidates will be asked. Prosecutors and the Trump defense team will also be able to ask follow-up questions.\n\nMerchan isn't allowing questions about whether jurors voted for Trump or intend to vote for him. But he has allowed several questions that could reveal a juror's political preferences. For example, potential jurors will be asked if they've ever attended either a Trump rally or an anti-Trump rally, and whether they have ever followed Trump or an anti-Trump group on social media.\n\nIf potential jurors' answers indicate they probably can't be impartial in the case, Merchan has said he will strike them from consideration. For any potential jurors Merchan doesn't excuse from further service, the two sides will have the option of disqualifying them themselves, though that power isn't unlimited.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhat is a Sandoval hearing?\n\nIf you've been following Donald Trump's criminal hush money case so far, you may have heard the term \"Sandoval hearing\" earlier in the day. But what does the term mean?\n\nIt's basically a short hearing that happens before trials. A judge is asked what previous actions or factors can be brought up during a trial, weighing the potential impact on the case at large.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nAs Trump goes on trial, asylum seekers a block away navigate immigration system\n\nA block from Donald Trump’s trial, New York's Federal Plaza had a steady flow of patrons Monday morning for immigration court. The city has faced the arrival of nearly 200,000 migrants, many bused in from the U.S.-Mexico border, in the past two years.\n\nUnder a treelined path outside the federal building, Alex Rojas, a 24-year-old Venezuelan man, read his book, “Red White & Royal Blue,” an LGBTQ romance novel by Casey McQuiston. The Manhattan criminal courthouse, where Trump was on trial for hiding hush money payments, loomed behind Rojas.\n\nHe's been in the U.S. for six months, without a work permit, and is seeking political asylum due to dangers of violence toward gay people in Venezuela. Rojas, who hopes to work as a physical therapist, admitted he didn’t know much about American politics, but he knew about Trump’s stance on immigration.\n\n“I think he’s going to deport all of us from here,” Rojas said, with nervous laughter. “I don’t think he likes migrants much, even less Venezuelans.”\n\nAs court adjourned for lunch, Rojas also left, heading back to his shelter in the Bronx. He’d return to Manhattan in the morning, as would Trump, to appear in court.\n\n– Eduardo Cuevas\n\n96 jurors to be called in for initial questioning\n\nJudge Juan Merchan said 96 jurors will be called in for initial questioning as the jury selection process gets underway in Donald Trump's New York hush money case. In total, Merchan said 500 prospective jurors have been called on for service in the case.\n\nWe are waiting for prospective jurors to arrive in the courtroom.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge will hold hearing on whether to hold Donald Trump in contempt April 24\n\nFollowing a lunch break, Judge Juan Merchan declared he will hold a hearing on Wednesday, April 24 about whether Donald Trump violated a gag order through posts on his Truth Social media platform and should be held in contempt.\n\nProsecutor Christopher Conroy earlier in the day argued Merchan should hold Trump in contempt and fine him $3,000 – or $1,000 for each of three alleged violations.\n\nMerchan told Trump's legal team to file its response on the gag order allegations by April 19.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrial schedule: Holidays, Barron Trump's high school graduation and more\n\nWhile Donald Trump's hush money trial is expected to extend six to eight weeks, the former president won't be in the courtroom every day. Judge Juan Merchan said Tuesday that the trial will take a break on Wednesdays for its duration, and there will not be any trial on April 29, NBC News reported.\n\nThe judge also said there will not be any trial dates that would conflict with religious observances. That could include Passover, though the courtroom hours could simply be cut short on April 22 and 23.\n\nThe case will also potentially adjourn for the high school graduation of Barron Trump, Donald Trump's youngest son, next month.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nPolice investigating bomb threat at Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's home\n\nPolice say they are investigating a bomb threat targeting the home of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg on Monday morning, according to the Associated Press. Law enforcement official said a 911 caller reported the threat just before 9 a.m. ET.\n\nIt's not the first time Bragg has faced an emergency situation in recent months. A powdery substance was discovered last month in a threatening letter in a mailroom at Bragg's offices, the AP reported.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nProsecutor wants Donald Trump held in contempt, $3,000 fine, for alleged gag order violations\n\nProsecutor Christopher Conroy asked Judge Juan Merchan to hold Donald Trump in contempt and fine him $3,000 for allegedly violating the judge's gag order. The order prohibits Trump from publicly commenting on the participation of potential witnesses in the case.\n\nConroy pointed to three Trump social media posts that he said each warrant a $1,000 fine.\n\nOne post featured a statement from Michael Avenatti, who was once a lawyer for Stormy Daniels, that it is \"outrageous that Cohen and Daniels can do countless TV interviews\" talking badly about Trump, but Trump is gagged if he responds. Trump reposted the comment along with his own thanks to Avenatti \"for revealing the truth about two sleaze bags\" who have hurt the country with lies.\n\nIn 2022, Avenatti was convicted of identify theft and wire fraud for stealing from Daniels and sentenced to several years in prison.\n\nConroy also said Trump violated the gag order by posting a photograph of a publicly available 2018 statement by Daniels denying she had a sexual encounter with Trump. A further violation allegedly occurred when Trump posted about Cohen, asking, \"Has disgraced attorney and felon Michael Cohen been prosecuted for LYING?\"\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche said the defense would like the chance to respond in writing.\n\nThe judge didn't make an immediate decision.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWas Donald Trump falling asleep at hush money trial?\n\nThe former president appeared to nod off before the trial's lunch break, closing his eyes briefly and jerking awake multiple times, according to several reports.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWill Trump testify in his hush money case?\n\nTrump said on Friday that he will testify at the trial.\n\n\"I’m testifying. I tell the truth. I mean, all I can do is tell the truth. And the truth is that there's no case, they have no case,\" Trump said at a Palm Beach press conference.\n\nHowever, the former president has backed out of testifying before.\n\nIn his New York civil fraud case, Trump was forced to testify under a state subpoena when the state attorney general's office was putting on its case. At that time, Trump's legal team didn't ask him a single question on cross-examination. Trump later said he would testify when it was the defense's turn to call their own witnesses. But the day before his scheduled testimony, he backed out.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nCourt takes a lunch break\n\nThe proceedings in the Manhattan courtroom have paused until 1:30 p.m. ET.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nE. Jean Carroll deposition will not be allowed in Trump trial\n\nJudge Juan Merchan on Monday also said prosecutors cannot show a deposition from columnist E. Jean Carroll, who accused Trump of sexually assaulting her in the 1990s.\n\nA jury last year found Trump liable of sexually abusing Carroll and defaming her. In January, a jury also ruled that Trump must pay the columnist $83.3 million in damages for defamation.\n\nBut on Monday, Merchan warned that Carroll's deposition could risk \"building in a trial into a trial.\"\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nAnti-Trump press conference takes place near courtroom\n\nA few blocks from the courtroom at nearby Foley Square, a group of anti-Trump protestors gathered for a press conference. Advocates held up large orange letters reading “No one is above the law” as a series of speakers addressed the election interference charges against the former president.\n\nIn a federal case and state-level case in Georgia, Donald Trump is accused of trying to steal the 2020 election from President Joe Biden.\n\nRobert Weisman, president of the non-profit Public Citizen spoke from a podium emblazoned with “Election interference is a crime.\"\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nWhat is hush money?\n\nHush money is a wide-ranging term used to refer to paying someone to not speak publicly about an issue. It's not necessarily illegal, so why is Donald Trump in court over a hush money case?\n\nThe former president isn’t actually charged with making a $130,000 payment to porn actress Stormy Daniels in exchange for a non-disclosure agreement. Instead, he's accused of falsifying business records to hide the payment.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg described the payments to Daniels and another woman, former Playboy model Karen McDougal, as part of a “catch-and-kill” strategy to prevent the women from telling their stories. But the criminal charges are that Trump falsified his company’s business records to conceal the payments.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nDonald Trump rails against Michael Cohen, despite gag order\n\nThe former president has shown a penchant for launching accusations and insults towards judges, prosecutors and potential witnesses he deems hostile, but he could face fines or even jail time if Judge Juan Merchan determines it runs afoul of a gag order.\n\nBased on what Merchan described as a history of \"threatening, inflammatory, denigrating\" statements against officials, court staff, and prosecutors, the judge issued an order barring Trump from publicly commenting about the participation of potential witnesses in the case, such as porn star Stormy Daniels and former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen.\n\nDespite the gag order's restriction on comments about witnesses, Trump posted on Saturday \"Has disgraced attorney and felon Michael Cohen been prosecuted for LYING?\"\n\nMerchan also prohibited public statements about court staff and prosecution lawyers other than Bragg, as well as their family members, if the comments are meant to significantly interfere with their work in the case.\n\nDays after that order was issued, Trump attacked Merchan's daughter in a series of posts on Trump's Truth Social media platform, calling her \"a Rabid Trump Hater\" and posting a photo of her, leading the judge to expand the gag order to prohibit the former president from publicly commenting on Merchan's or Bragg's family members if the comments are meant to significantly interfere with work in the case.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJury won't watch 'Access Hollywood' tape, judge reiterates\n\nJudge Juan Merchan previously ruled that the jury in Donald Trump's hush money trial can hear testimony about Trump's comments on the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape, but can't watch the tape.\n\nMerchan reiterated that ruling on Monday, saying he continues to regard the video as too prejudicial against Trump to be permitted in the trial. In the tape, Trump crudely describes grabbing women. The release of the tape in early October of 2016 is important context for Trump's alleged $130,000 hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels, according to prosecutors. They say he feared another scandal would further endanger his standing with women voters in the fast-approaching election.\n\nFor that reason, Trump authorized the payment by former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, which constituted a campaign contribution in excess of federal campaign finance limits, prosecutors say. One reason Trump faces felony charges of falsifying business records, as opposed to misdemeanors, is that the alleged falsification was done to conceal that separate federal crime, prosecutors say.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhy did Michael Cohen go to prison?\n\nMichael Cohen, Donald Trump's former attorney, pleaded guilty in 2018 to concealing more than $4 million from the IRS and \"causing $280,000 in payments to be made to silence two women who otherwise planned to speak publicly about their alleged affairs with a presidential candidate, thereby intending to influence the 2016 presidential election,\" according to court records.\n\nProsecutors said Cohen arranged a $150,000 payment to McDougal and a $130,000 payment to Daniels.\n\nCohen was sentenced to three years in prison but was released early to home detention because of the spread of COVID-19.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nDonald Trump's supporters gather to demonstrate outside Manhattan courthouse\n\nAmong the crowd outside the courtroom was Vish Burra, 33, the executive secretary of the New York Young Republican Club, which helped organize the protest.\n\nSporting a black “Make America Great Again” hat, Burra, a former aide to embattled former Rep. George Santos, scanned the crowd and captured some videos of anti-Trump protesters on his phone.\n\nHe voted for Obama in 2012 but is now an ardent supporter of Trump. Free trade, immigration policy, and anti-war beliefs brought him into the GOP.\n\n“Donald Trump didn’t start any new wars when he was president and not only that but his strong presence kept people at peace, kept people at bay.”\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nJudge Juan Merchan says jury won't hear about Melania Trump's pregnancy during alleged affair\n\nAttorneys and Judge Juan Merchan are addressing a series of issues this morning about what testimony and evidence can be introduced in the trial.\n\nMerchan tentatively ruled in the morning that Melania Trump's pregnancy during an alleged affair between Trump and former Playboy model Karen McDougal can't be shared with the jury.\n\nMerchan previously ruled that the prosecution can call McDougal to the witness stand even though Trump isn't charged with falsifying business records to cover up an alleged hush money payment she received. McDougal has said she and the real estate mogul had an affair over many months, which Trump denies. In the earlier ruling, Merchan said McDougal's testimony about steps taken to secure her story \"complete the narrative\" in the prosecution's case.\n\nHowever, Merchan said Monday he doesn't believe \"at this moment\" that testimony or evidence about Melania Trump's pregnancy is necessary.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\n'It's going to backfire'\n\nBijaya Acharya, 32, slept just a couple hours after finishing driving for Uber so he could take the train from Queens to see Donald Trump leave Trump Tower in the morning ahead of his trial. Then, Acharya, donning the iconic red “Make America Great Again” hat, went to the lower Manhattan courthouse to support the former president.\n\nAcharya, a native of Nepal, lives in Jackson Heights, a diverse, immigrant Queens neighborhood, in one of the world’s most diverse, immigrant cities. Still, he supports Trump because of his push to crack down on crime and illegal immigration, two issues Acharya said he sees in New York City.\n\nSince becoming a citizen in 2021, he plans to vote in his first presidential election. He believes the trial only helps Trump’s chances of winning: “It’s going to backfire,” he said. “It’s not going to hurt him.”\n\nAcharya planned to stay outside the courthouse until the afternoon. He normally worked at night, anyway.\n\n– Eduardo Cuevas\n\nWhat will potential jurors be asked in Trump's NY case?\n\nAhead of trial, Merchan decided on a list of 42 questions the potential jurors will be asked, with both sides also having a chance to ask follow-up questions.\n\nSeveral of the questions could help the trial teams figure out if a potential juror has a bias when it comes to Trump that could undermine the ability to be impartial. For example, potential jurors will be asked if they've ever attended a Trump or anti-Trump rally, and whether they follow Trump or an anti-Trump group on social media.\n\nBut jurors will also be asked basic biographical information, like where they live, whether they're married, whether a loved one has ever been a victim of a crime.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nLooking for an unbiased jury in Donald Trump's hush money case\n\nStarting Monday, Donald Trump's and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's trial teams will each be working to select 12 jurors and several alternates who give them the best odds of winning.\n\nEach side will get a limited number of \"peremptory strikes\" – essentially vetoes – they can use to exclude potential jurors. Judge Juan Merchan will also be tasked with striking jurors whose responses to questions indicate they probably can't be impartial.\n\nIt's a case that turns some of the normal ways of thinking about jury selection on their head, according to Jo-Ellan Dimitrius, a seasoned jury consultant who assisted O.J. Simpson's murder trial defense team.\n\n\"In a normal criminal case, it is the prosecution that's looking for the white, older male, and it is the defense that's looking for the minority individual, the anti-police individual − but in this case it's actually reversed,\" Dimitrius told USA TODAY.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge Juan Merchan denies Trump's recusal push over his daughter\n\nTrial Judge Juan Merchan entered the courtroom and began his remarks in the proceedings by denying a Trump motion for his own recusal.\n\nTrump's legal team argued in the motion that a marketing agency headed by the judge's daughter benefits reputationally and financially by targeting Trump, rendering the judge's role in the case improper. The agency does work for Democratic political candidates.\n\nIn rejecting that argument, Merchan noted an opinion from the New York State Advisory Committee on Judicial Ethics that Merchan's impartiality couldn't be reasonably questioned based on his daughter's work because Trump's case doesn't involve her business.\n\nMerchan already rejected a Trump motion for Merchan's recusal in August. Trump argued in the new motion that his success in the Republican primaries since August has \"cemented his status as a political target\" of the daughter's agency.\n\n\"The court will not address this matter further,\" Merchan said Monday.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nMore:Donald Trump loses Hail Mary call for judge's recusal ahead of New York hush money trial\n\nTodd Blanche and Susan Necheles: Donald Trump's lawyers\n\nThey aren’t household names yet like their universally known client, Donald Trump. But the lawyers trying to keep the former president out of prison in his New York hush money trial − Todd Blanche and Susan Necheles − likely will become minor celebrities once the court battle gets going this week.\n\nA year ago, when a grim-faced Trump made history as the first former president to face criminal charges, Blanche and Necheles sat by his side as he pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records associated with hush money payments to two women.\n\nBlanche, who usually does talking in court on the hush-money case, told reporters that Trump was determined to fight the charges.\n\n\"He's frustrated, he's upset,\" Blanche said. \"It's not going to stop him.\"\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nDonald Trump's hush money trial in New York marks a historic moment: The first time a former president has even been on trial and facing criminal charges. The unprecedented case is also set against the backdrop of one of the busiest cities in the world.\n\nBefore the trial started on Monday, Mike Jamison, 67, of Philadelphia, stood alone against the barricades opposite the courthouse.\n\nWhile visiting his brother in Brooklyn, he said he stopped by the courthouse “for the circus.” He is a Democrat who planned to vote again for President Joe Biden.“I think he should get convicted,” Jamison said of Trump. “But who knows, you know? It only takes one juror.”\n\n– Eduardo Cuevas\n\nWho is Karen McDougal?\n\nKaren McDougal is a former Playboy model. She indirectly received a hush money payment in 2016 after claiming to have an affair with Donald Trump.\n\nMichael Cohen, Trump's former attorney, funneled the money through the publication National Enquirer owned by American Media Inc., under a \"catch and kill\" approach, paying the tabloid to buy rights to her story and prevent her from telling anyone else about it.\n\nMcDougal has since spoken out about her affair with Trump, saying it lasted for about 10 months starting in 2006. He denies the allegation.\n\n– Kinsey Crowley\n\nDonald Trump begins fundraising off of trial\n\nMinutes after Donald Trump entered the courtroom, his campaign texted out solicitations for donations, saying “I'M IN COURT NOW!” in an all-caps message.\n\nTrump said in the text, “They're trying to DESTROY ME - BUT YOU CAN STOP THEM!” The former president has long claimed that the criminal charges against him are targeting his reelection campaign, though there's no evidence of that. – David Jackson\n\nWho is Alvin Bragg?\n\nLast year, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg became the first prosecutor to secure a criminal indictment against a former president. On Monday the world's attention will turn to Bragg as Trump's trial on 34 counts of falsifying business records begins.\n\nIn 2022, Bragg's office won convictions against two parts of the Trump Organization and its chief financial officer. Allen Weisselberg was sentenced to five months in prison after pleading guilty to 15 charges in a scheme to avoid taxes. Two Trump corporations were fined a combined $1.6 million for convictions of 17 felonies.\n\nBragg said company officials “have to play by the rules” and that Weisselberg used his position to get lavish perks such as a rent-free Manhattan apartment, multiple Mercedes Benz cars and private school tuition for his grandchildren – “all without paying required taxes.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nWho is Stormy Daniels?\n\nStormy Daniels alleged that Donald Trump had consensual sex with her in 2006 – months after Melania Trump gave birth to Barron Trump.\n\nTrump’s then-attorney and personal fixer, Michael Cohen, paid $130,000 to Daniels just before the 2016 election to silence claims that she had an affair with Trump after she was willing to go public about the scandal.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nDonald Trump: ‘I’m very honored to be here’\n\nDonald Trump gave a one-minute statement to reporters before entering the courtroom, alleging without evidence that his hush-money trial is “political persecution” and “an assault on America.”\n\nTrump cited unnamed legal scholars calling the case “nonsense.”\n\n“It’s a case that should have never been brought” Trump said, adding “I’m very honored to be here.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nAndrew Giuliani calls for 'unbiased jurors' in Trump hush money case\n\nAndrew Giuliani, son of longtime Trump advisor and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, stood among a mix of reporters and Trump supporters waving flags. He acknowledged the difficulty with jury selection because so many have opinions about the president. But he believed if people looked at the facts of the case, Trump would be acquitted.\n\n“You need two or three in there, even one,” Andrew Giuliani said. “But two or three, that way you don’t have one that gets bullied around by the others. I’m just hopeful that you do have a few unbiased jurors in there.”\n\n– Eduardo Cuevas\n\nDonald Trump arrives in the courtroom\n\nFormer President Donald Trump just entered the Manhattan courtroom for the first day of his New York criminal trial. He is wearing a dark suit and red tie.\n\nIt's an unprecedented moment. Trump is the first former president ever to face criminal charges. He faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover-up a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels in advance of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe court has estimated the trial will last between six and eight weeks. Jury selection alone could last several days or even multiple weeks.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nHow many indictments does Trump have?\n\nTrump has been indicted on 91 charges across four separate criminal cases. However, some of those charges have since been dismissed, bringing the current total to 88.\n\nIn Trump's New York case accusing him of making hush money payments before the 2016 election, he faces 34 felony counts\n\nIn the federal case accusing Trump of mishandling classified documents, Trump is charged with 40 felony counts\n\nTrump also faces a federal case accusing him of trying to steal the 2020 election from President Joe Biden. He faces 4 felony counts there\n\nIn the Georgia case accusing him of trying to overturn the results of the 2020 election in the Peach State, the former president 10 felony counts.\n\n– Kinsey Crowley & Bart Jansen\n\nWhy is Donald Trump on trial?\n\nThe trial will feature some salacious allegations. Prosecutors claim Trump falsified records to conceal that he was reimbursing his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, for a $130,000 hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels. Daniels has said she had sex with the real estate mogul shortly after his wife, Melania Trump, gave birth to their son, Barron. Trump denies Daniels' claim, and has pleaded not guilty in the case.\n\nThe charges are felonies, as opposed to misdemeanors, because prosecutors claim Trump falsified the records in order to conceal violating federal election laws through a payment that was meant to help his 2016 presidential campaign but exceeded campaign contribution limits.\n\nThe payment was made less than two weeks before the 2016 election. Prosecutors also allege the records were falsified in order to violate New York tax and election laws.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nSmall (but passionate) crowd gathers outside Trump trial\n\nOutside the Manhattan courtroom where the former president's criminal hush money trial was set to begin Monday, the press and police presence seemed to outnumber the protestors significantly. A large flag that red “Trump 2024: Save America” waved above a small crowd demonstrators who appeared to support the president.\n\nOn the other side of a set of barricades, protestors criticizing the president walked silently behind a banner reading “no one is above the law.” A few nearby Trump supporters shouted at them, one with a bullhorn who repeated “Donald Trump did nothing wrong”\n\nJamie Bauer, who is part of Rise and Resist which formed after Trump’s election says the group has come out to protest every case. “They want to provoke us so that it will look like they’re the victims of left-wing aggression” they said of the pro-Trump crowd.– Anna Kaufman\n\nKey players in Trump's hush money trial\n\nDonald Trump’s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and porn actress Stormy Daniels, who received $130,000 to keep quiet before the 2016 election are the key witnesses expected at his New York trial.\n\nCohen arranged the payment to Daniels, in exchange for her signing a non-disclosure agreement about her claim she had sex with Trump in 2006 while he was married to Melania Trump. Cohen pleaded guilty and spent time in prison on charges including a campaign finance violation for influencing the 2016 election.\n\nTrump has blasted Cohen as unreliable because he is a convicted perjurer and disbarred lawyer. Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, said she was eager to sign the non-disclosure agreement to get the episode behind her.\n\nTrump has denied having a relationship with her. He has argued he was paying Cohen and that he was unaware of money going to Daniels.\n\nTrump could also potentially testify, as he did at his civil fraud trial.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nDonald Trump arrives at NY courthouse\n\nDonald Trump has arrived at the Manhattan courthouse where he's facing sweeping criminal charges in a hush money case.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhat time does the Trump trial start today?\n\nProceedings are expected to begin at 9:30 ET on Monday morning in the Manhattan courtroom where Donald Trump is facing sweeping criminal charges.\n\nRemember, jury selection begins in the case on Monday, so lawyers won't be presenting their cases just yet. But that will come soon: The trial is expected to last between six and eight weeks in total.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nHow long will Trump's trial last? Here's a timeline\n\nThe trial will last about six-to-eight weeks, according to a court media advisory.\n\nThe trial will start with jury selection Monday, which could be an especially lengthy process given many potential jurors will likely have opinions about former President Donald Trump that both sides may want to explore. New York law requires unanimity from a 12-person jury to convict a criminal defendant in a felony case.\n\nNormally, the trial would then proceed into opening arguments, which give both sides the chance to provide an outline to jurors of what they believe the evidence will show, followed by the prosecution calling witnesses to testify and introducing evidence. The defense will try to poke holes in the prosecution's case through cross-examination, and then will have the option of putting calling its own witnesses and introducing its own evidence.\n\nFinally, the parties will give closing arguments, and the jury will be tasked with rendering a verdict.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhere can I watch the Trump trial?\n\nThe trial won't be televised, as is typical in New York courts. Reporters will be present in the courtroom and an overflow room that will have a live stream of the proceedings.\n\nTrump may hold press conferences outside of court and speak to reporters in the courthouse hallway.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nQuiet morning waiting for Donald Trump's trial to start\n\nThere appear to be more reporters than demonstrators before Donald Trump’s trial started Monday morning in lower Manhattan.Police have barricades down the middle of Collect Pond Park, across the street from the Manhattan Criminal Courthouse. Last year, when prosecutors arraigned Trump, the barricades separated pro-Trump demonstrators with those against the former president.\n\nOn Monday, the crowds appear to be mixed, waiting. A few held signs against Trump. There was one large pro-Trump flag waving near the courthouse.\n\n– Eduardo Cuevas\n\nWhat happens if Trump is found guilty?\n\nTrump could theoretically face more than a decade in prison if he's convicted on all counts in the criminal hush money case. But several legal experts told USA TODAY such a dramatic outcome is unlikely.\n\nInstead, Trump would likely face a sentence between probation and four years of prison, and he would probably still be out to freely campaign in the 2024 presidential election while his all-but-certain appeal ran its course.\n\nIf Trump were sentenced to jail or prison time, it's also unclear what that would look like. As a former president, he enjoys around-the-clock Secret Service protection, and no former president has ever been prosecuted. Special accommodations may be needed at a jail or prison, and the sentencing judge could also consider alternative arrangements such as house arrest or placement at some other secure location.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhat's happening today in Donald Trump's trial?\n\nJury selection is scheduled to start Monday and last several days, if not multiple weeks.\n\nThe process will involve Trump's legal team and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office wrangling over who should make it into the pool of 12 jurors and several alternates who will be tasked with deciding whether Trump is guilty.\n\nThe former president lost a flurry of motions and appeals in recent days seeking to delay the proceedings. But unlike in his three other criminal cases, which deal with allegations that he tried to illegally steal the 2020 presidential election and mishandled classified documents, delay tactics haven't allowed him to avoid the start of this trial.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDonald Trump's campaign addresses charges, witnesses and judge\n\nDonald Trump’s campaign issued a statement late Sunday dubbed a “trial fact sheet” as jury selection begins in his New York hush-money case, including that he “did nothing wrong” and the trial is a “full-frontal assault on American Democracy.”\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records to hide payments to Stormy Daniels, before the 2016 election.\n\nTrump’s fact sheet says Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, campaigned in 2021 on the potential to prosecute Trump. Bragg campaigned noting he sued Trump more than 100 times while working at the state Attorney General’s Office.\n\nTrump’s statement also notes that case relies on testimony from his former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, who is a convicted felon, perjurer and disbarred lawyer. The statement also complained about Judge Juan Merchan’s “bizarre” schedule for the trial, as appeals linger to dismiss charges.\n\n“This is an unprecedented abuse of our legal system,” Trump’s statement said about the trial.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nDonald Trump lost several bids to delay his hush money trial\n\nA series of New York judges this month rejected pleas from former President Donald Trump to delay the criminal trial.\n\nIn one request, Trump said Judge Juan Merchan should delay the trial until after the Supreme Court has ruled on the scope of presidential immunity in a separate Trump case dealing with federal election interference charges. The high court is scheduled to hear arguments on that issue April 25.\n\nBut Merchan said Trump raised the argument too late. Trump only made the argument in March, almost a year after Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg announced the charges on April 4, 2023.\n\nOn Friday, Merchan rejected a separate Trump delay request based on his argument that pre-trial publicity about the case created unfair prejudice against him. Merchan said the right way to address that concern is to have a thorough jury selection process.\n\nIn addition, last week three different judges from a New York appeals court each rejected last-minute delay requests from Trump. The former president argued he should get a delay until the appeals court rules on his arguments for moving the trial out of Manhattan and tossing out Merchan's limited gag order against him, and until Merchan rules on his latest request for Merchan's recusal.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/05/29/trump-trial-live-updates-juror-instructions-deliberations/73888214007/", "title": "Trump trial recap: Hush money jury to review Pecker, Cohen testimony", "text": "NEW YORK − Former President Donald Trump’s fate rests in the hands of 12 Manhattan jurors in his historic hush money trial, with the verdict carrying the potential to alter the 2024 presidential campaign.\n\nThe jury sent a note shortly before 3 p.m. EDT requesting to review four sections of testimony from the trial, three from media executive David Pecker, and one from former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen. Almost an hour later, the jurors sent a second note asking to re-hear the jury instructions.\n\nJurors were sent home for the day at 4:07 p.m. EDT. They will resume deliberations Thursday.\n\nJurors began deliberating Wednesday after hearing six weeks of testimony from a parade of 22 witnesses, including a felon convicted of perjury, a porn actress, and the former head of the parent company for the National Enquirer tabloid.\n\nAny verdict requires a unanimous vote. The outcome – a conviction on all or some of 34 counts of falsifying business records, an acquittal or a deadlocked jury – could have a major impact on Trump’s campaign against President Joe Biden.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nTrump is polling ahead of Biden despite the criminal charges in this and three other cases, but a felony conviction could sway some voters against him. An acquittal could bolster his claims that he was the victim of a politically motivated prosecutor.\n\nThese were Wednesday's developments inside and outside the Manhattan courtroom:\n\nTrump complains key witnesses weren’t called to testify – by prosecution or defense\n\nFormer President Donald Trump complained to reporters Wednesday that prosecutors didn’t call potential witnesses in his New York hush money trial, but didn’t explain why his team didn’t ask them to testify instead.\n\n“There are a lot people that they could have called that they didn’t call,” Trump said. “They didn’t call them obviously because they would have been very bad witnesses for them. Take a look at the list. You have a lot of big players that would have solved their problem or given us the win.”\n\nTrump declined to name them because a gag order prohibits him from commenting on potential witnesses. But he seemed to suggest Allen Weisselberg, the Trump Organization’s former chief financial official, is one of the possible witnesses. Weisselberg is serving time on Rikers Island after being convicted of perjury in an early Trump trial.\n\n“In particular, one witness is now suffering bravely because of the viciousness of these thugs,” Trump said. “You know who I’m talking about. They didn’t call him as a witness.”\n\nProsecutors had said they wanted to call Weisselberg but couldn’t because he was jailed. Trump’s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, testified that Weisselberg helped arrange his reimbursement from Trump for paying $130,000 to porn actress Stormy Daniels to keep her quiet about an alleged sexual episode with Trump before the 2016 election.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nWednesday proceedings end\n\nJudge Juan Merchan asked the prosecution and defense to send court reporters tonight a neat outline of the decisions on the pages and lines of the trial transcript to be read back to jurors on Thursday.\n\nMerchan then dismissed the parties at about 5:26 p.m. EDT. \"I'll see you tomorrow morning at 9:30,\" he said.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump has eyes closed as lawyers and judge discuss jury transcript review\n\nFormer President Donald Trump again has his eyes closed for extended periods, this time as the lawyers and Judge Juan Merchan discuss which portions of the trial transcript should be read back to jurors on Thursday.\n\nAt one point, I counted to 37 with a \"Mississippi\" in between each number before he opened his eyes. Trump peered out only briefly before closing them again.\n\nNot long after, I counted to 49 at the same pace before he opened his eyes. This time, he looked as if he might be falling asleep. His head was drooped down in front of him.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nLawyers disagree about one of four jury transcript requests\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass said the two sides have agreed on the portions of the trial transcript to be read back to jurors in response to three of their four transcript requests. The request that has sparked multiple disagreements is former tabloid publisher David Pecker's testimony about a Trump Tower meeting he said he had with Trump and Michael Cohen in August of 2015.\n\nPecker testified that he agreed at that meeting to be \"eyes and ears\" when it came to catching potential stories in the media market that could hurt Trump's first presidential campaign.\n\nJudge Merchan resolved one of the disputes in the courtroom after reviewing the transcript himself. He said he was largely – though not entirely – accepting the proposal from the defense.\n\nOn two other disputes, Merchan said he will review the transcript portions later and let the parties know what he thinks.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge returns to address transcript read-back for jurors\n\nJudge Merchan returned to the courtroom and addressed the lawyers.\n\n\"Okay, where do we stand?\" Judge Merchan asked.\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass said he thinks the two sides have made \"a lot of progress,\" but there are a couple issues they may need him to resolve.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump returns to courtroom\n\nTrump re-entered the courtroom at about 4:55 p.m. EDT. However, the lawyers are still talking to each other and Judge Merchan hasn't returned to the courtroom.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nRead the instructions jurors have asked to re-hear\n\nThe legal instructions jurors have asked to re-hear are complicated. For example, they say Trump is only guilty of a felony count of falsifying business records if he falsified a record in order to interfere in the 2016 presidential election through at least one of three unlawful methods spelled out in the instructions.\n\nYou can read the instructions for yourself here:\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump permitted to leave courtroom while staying in waiting area\n\nThe judge just approved a request from Trump lawyer Todd Blanche for his client to leave the main courtroom simply to go to a nearby courtroom that is a typical waiting area for him. The lawyers have remained in the courtroom to resolve the question of what trial transcript portions the jury will have read back on Thursday.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump defense team, prosecutors remain to work on transcript\n\nAfter excusing the jurors for the rest of the day, Judge Merchan told the prosecution and defense to stay until the court has settled on the precise transcript read-back the jurors are slated to hear on Thursday.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump has eyes closed as judge instructs jurors on not discussing case\n\nFormer President Donald Trump had his eyes closed for extended periods as Judge Merchan gave the jurors standard instructions on not discussing the case upon leaving for the day.\n\nI counted to 25 with a \"Mississippi\" in between each number at one point before Trump opened his eyes, and to 28 at that same pacing a little later.\n\nThere's an air of activity and suspense in the courtroom after hearing the first updates during jury deliberations. It's hard to reconcile that with the notion that Trump is actually falling asleep right now, as opposed to choosing to sit with his eyes closed.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJurors return to courtroom and are sent home for day\n\nThe jurors were brought back into the courtroom. Judge Merchan read aloud the two notes he received from them. He told them reading back the portions of the transcript they requested will probably take at least half an hour. He asked whether they want to hear all the jury instructions again or only a portion of them, and said they can let him know later.\n\nMerchan then excused them for the day.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJurors send second note to judge, want to re-hear instructions\n\nAs lawyers and the court were working on putting together the portions of the trial transcript that will be read aloud to the jurors, Judge Merchan entered the courtroom and announced he had received a second note from the jurors at 3:51 p.m. EDT. They requested to re-hear the jury instructions.\n\nMerchan recommended to the two sides bringing the jurors back into the courtroom. He proposed telling them the court is working on getting the transcript portions together, and asking them if they want to hear all the instructions again or only a portion of them.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJurors ask to review testimony from trial\n\nThe jurors sent a note at 2:56 p.m. EDT asking to review four sections of testimony from the trial, Judge Merchan just announced.\n\nReporters were sitting in the main courtroom when the prosecution entered at about 3:06 p.m. EDT, followed quickly by Trump and his lawyers. We weren't told in advance the reason for their arrival.\n\nMerchan then entered the courtroom and said the jurors want to review these four sections of trial testimony:\n\nDavid Pecker's testimony about a phone conversation with Trump while Pecker was in an investor meeting;\n\nPecker's testimony regarding the decision not to finalize and fund the assignment of former Playboy model Karen McDougal's life rights;\n\nPecker's testimony regarding a Trump Tower meeting he said he had with Trump and Michael Cohen in August of 2015; and\n\nCohen's testimony regarding that same Trump Tower meeting.\n\nPecker used to run the parent company for the National Enquirer, which was involved in two hush money deals related to Trump ahead of the 2016 presidential election. One of those deals involved buying the life rights to McDougal's story of a months-long affair with Trump, which he denies.\n\nPecker and Cohen met with Trump in August of 2015 at Trump Tower to discuss helping catch stories that might hurt Trump's presidential campaign and then prevent those stories from getting out, according to their testimony.\n\nJurors will be brought in to have those portions of the trial transcript read aloud, Merchan indicated.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nProsecution cites 'jaw-dropping' evidence against Trump that defense says 'cannot be trusted'\n\nThe six-week trial featured dramatic clashes between lawyers and witnesses, the judge and Trump.\n\nThe testimony included tense moments such as defense lawyer Todd Blanche accusing Trump’s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, of lying on the standand former Trump spokesperson Hope Hicks breaking into tears.\n\nMeanwhile, Judge Juan Merchan threatened to jail Trump if he continued to violate a gag order against talking about witnesses participating in the case. Merchan also scolded Blanche for an “outrageous” statement in closing arguments that the jury shouldn’t “send someone to prison” based on Cohen’s testimony.\n\nA flock of Republican surrogates showed up to support Trump, and one conspiracy theorist set himself on fire outside the courthouse.\n\nCohen was a key witness testifying that he submitted invoices for “legal expenses” that Trump knew were to reimburse him for paying $130,000 to silence porn actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. But Trump lawyer Todd Blanche accused Cohen of lying on the stand when he testified he notified Trump about the payment to Daniels. In closing arguments, Blanche called Cohenthe “MVP of liars” and “the embodiment of reasonable doubt.”\n\nDaniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, described the alleged sexual encounter in enough detail that Merchan questioned why defense lawyers didn’t object more to block her testimony. She testified that she noticed gold nail clippers in Trump’s hotel room and he didn’t wear a condom during the encounter. Trump has repeatedly denied he had sex with Daniels and Blanche argued the payment “started out as an extortion” whether the allegation was true or not.\n\nDavid Pecker, the former CEO of American Media Inc., which owned the National Enquirer, said he agreed in a meeting with Trump and Cohen in August 2015 to be the “eyes and ears” of Trump’s presidential campaign to buy negative stories about the candidate and never publish them.\n\nPecker acknowledged paying former Playboy model Karen McDougal $150,000 for her story and then refusing to pay for Daniels because Trump hadn’t reimbursed him. Cohen provided a recording, which prosecutor Joshua Steinglass called “jaw-dropping,” of Trump mentioning the $150,000 figure.\n\nBut Blanche raised questions about the credibility of the recording because it cuts off suddenly – Cohen said he got another call – and argued that a meeting to influence the campaign “made no sense.”\n\nTrump paid Cohen for a retainer through invoices marked \"legal expenses,\" so he committed no crime of falsifying business records, according to Blanche. \"This is not a referendum on your views of President Trump,\" Blanche told jurors.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nDonald Trump: ‘Mother Teresa couldn’t beat these charges’\n\nAfter the jury began deliberating in former President Donald Trump’s hush money trial, Trump braced his supporters for a guilty verdict by claiming nobody could be acquitted because of the way Judge Juan Merchan instructed jurors to consider the charges and the evidence.\n\n“Mother Teresa could not beat these charges,” Trump said. “These charges are rigged. The whole thing is rigged.”\n\nTrump went on to say that he would win the Nov. 5 election against President Joe Biden because of border security, inflation and other issues.\n\n“We’re going to win this election,” Trump said. “We’re going to take back this country from these fascists and these thugs that are destroying us.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nJury deliberations begin\n\nAt about 11:35 a.m. EDT, all jurors had exited the courtroom and Judge Merchan instructed the parties to remain in the courthouse in case they are needed as the jury begins deliberating.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nLaptop-responsible jurors leave courtroom\n\nThe two jurors who volunteered to handle the laptop with evidence appeared to be given some instructions at the prosecution's table, and then left. Judge Merchan just confirmed with Trump lawyer Todd Blanche that Trump has consented to the jurors' use of the laptop to access trial exhibits.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nAlternate jurors excused from courtroom, two main jurors coming for laptop instructions\n\nJudge Merchan excused the alternate jurors from the courtroom but is having two of the main jurors brought back in. He said they have volunteered to handle the laptop containing evidence from the trial, and will be given some instructions on that.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\n12 jurors excused from courtroom, alternate jurors remain\n\nJudge Merchan had the 12 jurors who will begin deliberating leave the courtroom, but kept the six alternate jurors in the courtroom. He has now praised their attentiveness during the trial and explained they are not done – they are still on duty in case any of the 12 can't continue through deliberations and alternates are needed to step in.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge makes clarification on juror signature\n\nAfter conversing with the lawyers privately, Judge Merchan clarified to jurors that one instruction about a signature tied to juror notes was about the jury foreperson denoting he signed the document, not having a juror sign a personal name.Merchan also explained jurors will be given a laptop containing evidence from the trial during their deliberations.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\n'That concludes my instructions on the law'\n\n\"That concludes my instructions on the law,\" Judge Juan Merchan just told jurors. He invited the parties to approach, and several lawyers are now having a private conversation with the judge at his bench.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge says plan is to work today until 4:30 p.m. EDT\n\nJudge Merchan just told jurors the plan today is to work until 4:30 p.m. EDT. He said the plan for other days will be figured out if that is needed. He also said it's unlikely, if jurors do work late, that their work will extend beyond 6 p.m. EDT.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge instructs jurors on the law of falsifying business records\n\nJudge Merchan just reached the 34th and final count in his jury instructions. Along the way, he has explained to jurors that Trump is guilty of falsifying business records in the first degree under New York law if he made or caused a false entry in a business enterprise with the intent to defraud – including the intent to commit or conceal another crime.\n\nThat means prosecutors must have proven during this trial not just that Trump is responsible for false records, but also that there was a further criminal or cover-up purpose. That's where alleged 2016 election fraud and alleged plans to violate New York tax and election laws come into play in this case.\n\nMerchan told jurors that intent doesn't require premeditation, but instead can be formed at the time the defendant engages in prohibited conduct.\n\n\"You must decide if the required intent can be inferred beyond a reasonable doubt,\" Merchan said.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nOne juror looking at trial teams as Trump leans back with eyes closed\n\nThe jurors have largely been taking notes and looking at Judge Merchan as he gives them instructions on the law in the case. But one juror who is among the first 12 who are slated to decide the case – not an alternate juror who is here to step in if one of the 12 becomes unavailable – has been looking over at the trial teams for several seconds. There, Trump can be seen slouching back in his chair with his eyes close, in stark contrast to the open-eyed, attentive jurors.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nBig rally near the Trump courthouse – for elderly services\n\nMusic. Dancing. Cheering.\n\nNo, not at the demonstrations in front of the Trump courthouse – it’s a rally for New York elderly services one block over in Foley Square.\n\nWhile the relatively few pro-Trump and anti-Trump forces argue – in one instance requiring police intervention – hundreds of other New Yorkers are boogying to immortal classics like “Get Down Tonight” and “Disco Inferno.”\n\nSample lyrics from the latter: “Folks are screaming, out of control/It was so entertaining when the boogie started to explode/I heard somebody say disco inferno/(Burn baby burn)/burn that mother down.”\n\nThe occasion, a sign said, is the 31st anniversary of Older Adult Health and Fitness Day.\n\nTrial? What trial?\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTrump eyes closed for more than 100 seconds\n\nFormer President Donald Trump isn't fully asleep, but it appears he may be dozing off. I just counted to 100 with a \"Mississippi\" in between each number while his eyes remained closed. I stopped counting at that point. For the first approximately 30 seconds, Trump was slouched forward in his chair, with his head slightly hanging in front of his shoulders. He then slouched back without opening his eyes. I saw him shake his head slightly once, but apart from that he doesn't seem to be showing a facial reaction to the judge's instructions to jurors.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nSeveral jurors taking notes\n\nSeveral jurors appear to be taking notes as Judge Merchan instructs them on the law. The remaining are looking straight at Merchan. The jurors in this case have been very attentive throughout the trial, even through a long day of closing arguments on Tuesday that didn't wrap until about 8 p.m. EDT.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge begins instructions on criminal charges\n\nJudge Juan Merchan has been instructing jurors on what they may and may not consider in their deliberations. He just said he will now begin instructing them on the law related to the actual records charges Trump faces. These instructions are potentially pivotal: even small words can make a big difference when a jury determines whether actions by a defendant were criminal.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump's eyes closed for extended periods during instructions\n\nAs he has done many times throughout this trial, Trump is sitting at the defense table with his eyes closed for extended periods. I just counted to 20 with a \"Mississippi\" between each number before Trump peaked out. I watched Trump again a couple minutes later and reached the number 20 a second time before Trump opened his eyes.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nElectronic audio of Trump audience member goes off\n\nAudio began playing from the section of spectators seated in one of the first two rows behind the defense table, where Trump's entourage sits. I couldn't see if the audio came from a phone. Judge Merchan looked over in that section's direction before the audio was cut off.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJurors told they must not consider Michael Cohen's election-related convictions\n\nJudge Merchan has just instructed jurors they must not consider Michael Cohen's guilty pleas to federal campaign finance violations when it comes to assessing Trump's guilt in this case. It's an instruction Merchan also gave jurors during testimony in the trial.\n\nProsecutors have alleged Trump falsified records to cover up unlawfully interfering in the 2016 presidential election through a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels that violated federal campaign finance laws.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge begins giving jury instructions\n\nJurors entered the courtroom at 10:10 a.m. EDT and Judge Juan Merchan has begun delivering instructions to them. He told them to remember they promised to be fair jurors. He told them they must not allow any bias or stereotype to affect their verdict.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nLow key (and anxious) morning on the protest front\n\nNo more than 20 demonstrators gathered in front of the courthouse as the jury prepared to deliberate the Trump case – anxious demonstrators.\n\n“I know he’s not going to be acquitted – I’m praying for a hung jury,” said Joe Palau, 57, a pro-Trump construction worker from Brooklyn.\n\nNadine Seiler, 59, - who carried a large sign that said “Convict Trump Already!” – was anxious the other way.“I am very concerned about a hung jury,” said Seiler, a home organizer who took the bus to New York from her home in Waldorf, Md.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nJudge enters courtroom\n\nJudge Juan Merchan entered the courtroom at 10:06 a.m. EDT.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDonald Trump, Don Jr. arrive in courtroom\n\nFormer President Donald Trump entered the courtroom at 9:56 a.m. EDT. His oldest child, Donald Trump Jr., joined him today and took a seat in the first bench behind the defense table.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nProsecution arrives in courtroom\n\nThe prosecution trial team arrived in the courtroom at 9:51 a.m. EDT. We are still waiting for the defense team, the judge, and the jury. Proceedings are starting 30 minutes later than usual, at 10 a.m. EDT.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhat is the Trump trial about?\n\nTrump's New York criminal trial centers on a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels, business records kept at the Trump Organization, and the 2016 presidential election.\n\nProsecutors have alleged that Trump falsified business records to cover up a $130,000 payment to Daniels less than two weeks before the election. They say the payment violated federal campaign finance laws, and as a result constituted unlawful election interference.\n\nFormer Trump lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen made the payment and later became a star witness for the prosecution in Trump's case.\n\nTrump defense lawyer Todd Blanche suggested to jurors in his Tuesday closing argument that Cohen acted alone and lied about Trump authorizing the payment. Blanche also said Trump didn't falsify any records in 2017 because he was paying Cohen that year for ongoing legal services, as the checks, invoices, and vouchers in the case reflect. He denied Cohen's story that Trump was actually reimbursing the hush money.\n\nTrump chose not to testify – a decision the jury will be prohibited from holding against him.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWho is Judge Juan Merchan?\n\nJudge Juan Merchan is a former prosecutor who has served as a judge since 2009. Merchan previously presided over a criminal trial in which two Trump businesses – the Trump Corporation and the Trump Payroll Corporation – were found guilty of several crimes, including tax fraud. The two companies were sentenced to pay more than $1.6 million following the verdict.\n\nMerchan has frequently drawn the ire of former President Donald Trump, who just this morning posted in all caps on Truth Social that Merchan is \"A CORRUPT AND CONFLICTED JUDGE\" presiding over a \"KANGAROO COURT!\"\n\nThe judge imposed a gag order on the former president that prohibits public comments on jurors or on the participation of witnesses in the case. The order also provides some protection from Trump's ire for prosecutors and their family members, as well as for family members of the judge. Merchan imposed the order after concluding that Trump's past \"inflammatory\" statements instilled fear in people involved in his legal cases and heightened security needs.\n\nMerchan expanded the order to cover his own family members and those of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg after Trump attacked the judge's daughter for her work at a marketing agency that assists Democrats.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump responds to actor Robert De Niro as ‘small’ and ‘Wacko’\n\nFormer President Donald Trump responded early Wednesday on social media to actor Robert De Niro’s criticism, calling him a victim of “Trump derangement syndrome.”\n\n“I never knew how small, both mentally and physically, Wacko Former Actor Robert De Niro was,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nA movie star for more than 50 years, De Niro won Oscars for his performances in The Godfather Part II and Raging Bull. But Trump said his participation in politics diminished his value.\n\n“Robert, whose movies, artistry, and brand have gone WAY DOWN IN VALUE since he entered the political arena at the request of Crooked Joe Biden, looked so pathetic and sad out there,” Trump wrote.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nWhere is Melania Trump?\n\nMelania Trump has so far stayed away from her husband's criminal proceedings. The former president wished her a \"happy birthday\" from the courthouse hallway when he attended proceedings on her birthday, April 26. He said he would join her in Florida later that Friday.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nActor Robert De Niro, surrogate for President Biden, blasts Trump as ‘clown’ outside courthouse\n\nOscar-winning actor Robert De Niro called former President Donald Trump a \"clown\" and a “buffoon” bent on destroying American democracy from outside the courthouse on Tuesday.\n\nDe Niro was flanked by two former Capitol Police officers, Harry Dunn and Michael Fanone, who defended the Capitol during the attack Jan. 6, 2021, by Trump supporters.\n\n\"We've forgotten the lessons of history that showed us other clowns who weren't taken seriously until they became vicious dictators,\" De Niro said. \"With Trump we have a second chance and no one is laughing now. This is the time to stop him by voting him out once and for all.\"\n\nDe Niro’s appearance served as a Democratic response to Republican lawmakers and vice presidential contenders who criticized the trial for Trump because he was gagged from commenting on witnesses or jurors. Trump’s sons Don Jr. and Eric, and daughter-in-law Lara, who is co-chair of the Republican National Committee, spoke for the former president Tuesday.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nWill Tiffany Trump, other Trump children, be at the trial Wednesday?\n\nTrump's youngest daughter, Tiffany, attended the Manhattan criminal trial for the first time Tuesday. Trump sons Eric and Don Jr., who have attended some earlier days, were also there. It's not yet known which Trump children, if any, will come today.\n\nIvanka Trump and Jared Kushner haven't attended any of the criminal trial. Barron Trump, who just graduated from high school, also hasn't attended proceedings. His parents went to his high school graduation on May 17, a day Judge Juan Merchan allowed Donald Trump to have off in the trial so he could be with his youngest child.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nHow long will the jury take to deliberate?\n\nNo one, not even the jury, knows that yet.\n\nFirst, jurors all meet in the jury room to discuss their views. They have an opportunity to send requests for clarifications or further instruction to the judge. They must come to a unanimous decision to convict or acquit, or else the trial will end in a \"hung jury,\" forcing a mistrial.\n\nThere is no limit to how long the jury can deliberate, but experts say three days would be considered a long time.\n\n– Kinsey Crowley\n\nWhy are jury instructions important?\n\nJudge Juan Merchan said Tuesday that he will deliver jury instructions in the morning, estimating it will take him about an hour.\n\nJury instructions are critical because they inform the jurors about the law to apply in the case. Small words in jury instructions can sometimes make a big difference as jurors are tasked with deciding not just what the defendant did in a given case, but also whether it's a crime.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhat did the defense say about Cohen on Tuesday?\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche was full of invectives for Michael Cohen as he urged jurors on Tuesday not to credit the former Trump fixer's testimony. Cohen testified that Trump authorized him to make a $130,000 hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election, and approved a plan to cover it up even as he reimbursed Cohen in 2017.\n\n\"He's literally like an MVP of liars,\" Blanche argued.\n\n\"In fact, he's also a thief,\" Blanche said. Cohen himself admitted on the witness stand to stealing by claiming a larger reimbursement from the Trump Organization than Cohen actually paid for polling-related help for Trump.\n\nBlanche also accused Cohen of committing a crime at the trial by lying on the witness stand. The defense lawyer pointed to text messages indicating Cohen called Trump's bodyguard on Oct. 24, 2016 about harassing calls he was getting. Confronted with the messages, Cohen largely stuck to his previous testimony, saying he believed he also spoke to Trump about hush money to Stormy Daniels during that call.\n\n\"It was a lie!\" Blanche exclaimed Tuesday. \"That is per-jur-y,\" he also said, putting emphasis on each syllable of the crime.\n\n\"He got caught red-handed,\" Blanche told jurors.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhat is Trump on trial for?\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to commit or conceal another crime. Prosecutors have said Trump was falsifying records to hide the violation of federal campaign finance laws and to hide plans to violate New York tax and election laws.\n\nTrump wanted to hide a $130,000 hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels in particular, according to prosecutors. They say the payment violated federal campaign finance laws and amounted to election fraud.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/05/03/donald-trump-hush-money-trial-news-live-updates/73547676007/", "title": "Donald Trump trial Friday recap: Former Trump spokesperson Hope ...", "text": "Editor's note: This page reflects the news from Donald Trump's hush money trial on Friday, May 3. For the latest news on witness testimony in Trump's trial, follow our live updates for Monday, May 6.\n\nNEW YORK — Former top Trump aide Hope Hicks became emotional and teary-eyed upon the beginning of her cross-examination by Donald Trump's attorney Emil Bove on Friday afternoon. Judge Juan Merchan excused her for a brief break, after which she returned to the witness and cross-examination resumed.\n\nHicks was called by the prosecution to testify on the 11th day of Trump's New York hush money trial. The then-campaign spokesperson was in close contact with Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen in 2016 after the emergence of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, in which Trump boasted of grabbing women by their genitals.\n\nHer initial advice to the campaign when a reporter reached out about the tape: \"Deny, deny, deny.\"\n\nTrump is on trial for 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels. Cohen made the Daniels payment and, according to prosecutors, Trump falsely recorded his reimbursement of Cohen as legal expenses. Trump's lawyer denied that allegation in an opening trial statement.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nOn Friday, Hicks testified that Donald Trump was \"concerned\" about how a Nov. 4, 2016 Wall Street Journal story on a separate hush money deal involving former Playboy model Karen McDougal would be viewed by his wife, Melania Trump.\n\nKeep up with USA TODAY's live updates from inside and outside the Manhattan courtroom:\n\nTrump: 'They've been after us for years'\n\nTrump capped his week in court by telling reporters he could not comment on the proceedings, including Hope Hicks' testimony, because of the gag order issued by Judge Juan Merchan, which prohibits him from attacking witnesses. Trump was found earlier this week to have repeatedly violated that order and he was fined $9,000.\n\nBut Trump did claim that political opponents have tried for years to get him and the people around him.\n\n\"They've been after us for years,\" Trump said as he departed the courthouse.\n\nThroughout the day, Trump − or his aides − also posted statements on social media criticizing the trial.\n\n\"THIS ISN’T A TRIAL, IT’S A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN,\" he said in one all-caps Truth Social post.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nCourt adjourned for the weekend\n\nJudge Merchan has called an end to the day's proceedings. The trial will start back up on Monday.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge rules Trump can't be cross-examined on gag order violations if he testifies\n\nJudge Juan Merchan ruled that, if Trump chooses to testify, the prosecution can't cross-examine Trump over Merchan's determination that Trump violated the gag order in the case. Merchan has already determined Trump violated the order nine times, and he is considering an additional four instances that the prosecution has argued constituted violations. Merchan held Trump in criminal contempt and fined him $9,000 for the violations.\n\nMerchan said the jury hearing that the judge in this case has held Trump in contempt would be too prejudicial. He said the prosecution had made a request to ask Trump about it, and he was denying that request.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump to testify? His lawyer is arguing over what prosecutors may ask\n\nThe jury has been dismissed for the weekend, but the lawyers are still discussing issues with Judge Merchan. Trump lawyer Todd Blanche just argued that, if Trump testifies in the trial, the prosecution shouldn't be able to question Trump about being held in criminal contempt for re-posting language that Merchan determined violated his gag order.\n\nProsecutor Matthew Colangelo responded that Trump's violation is relevant evidence when it comes to Trump's credibility.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nHope Hicks testimony ends\n\nTrump lawyer Emil Bove ended his cross-examination of former top Trump aide Hope Hicks. The cross-examination had a gentle tone throughout, even though – or perhaps, even slightly, because – Hicks seemed to start crying near the beginning of Bove's questions. The judge took a break for some minutes so Hicks could leave the courtroom and regroup, before she resumed her testimony.\n\nProsecutor Matthew Colangelo didn't have any more questions for Hicks after Bove's cross-examination. She has been dismissed from the courtroom.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump slouched back, eyes slightly opening and then closing periodically\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is slouched back in his chair currently, with his eyes often closed for extended periods but sometimes opening slightly. While earlier today he didn't seem to be watching Hope Hicks directly as she testified, he is now looking at her when he does open his eyes.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nHicks: Cohen was only \"Mr. Fix-it\" because he first broke it\n\nTrump lawyer Emil Bove has continued the critical line of questioning he has developed across witnesses when it comes to former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen.\n\nResponding to Bove's questions, Hope Hicks confirmed Michael Cohen sometimes did things that were \"frustrating\" to the Trump 2016 campaign staff. She agreed Cohen \"went rogue\" sometimes. She said Cohen liked to call himself \"a fixer\" or \"Mr. Fix-it,\" but she used to say it was only because he first broke it that he was able to fix it.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump lawyer resumes questioning of Hicks\n\nTrump lawyer Emil Bove has resumed questioning Hope Hicks. His tone is kind and respectful – significantly less aggressive than multiple other cross-examinations we've seen him conduct in the trial. Hicks is discussing her professional time with Trump before he ever ran for president. She just confirmed she felt she had Trump's trust and respect when she worked for him.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nHicks returns to courtroom after becoming emotional on stand\n\nHope Hicks re-entered the courtroom and again took the witness stand at 3:07 p.m. EDT, after she got emotional as cross-examination began and confirmed to Judge Merchan she would like to take a break. The jury is getting seated as we wait to get started again.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nHicks gets emotional and court takes a break\n\nHope Hicks appeared to be starting to cry as Trump lawyer Emil Bove began asking her questions on cross-examination. The questions were introductory in nature, rather than aggressive. Bove had just asked her a question about the portfolio she once handled in a past role.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan asked Hicks if she would like a break, and she said yes. Both Hicks and the jury have been excused from the courtroom.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nHicks asked about whether she called Pecker after former Playboy model McDougal sued\n\nProsecutor Matthew Colangelo showed jurors a text message Hope Hicks received in March of 2018 from former Trump aide Madeleine Westerhout. Hicks confirmed she received the text the day Karen McDougal sued to get out of her non-disclosure agreement. Westerhout said in the text that Trump wanted to know if Hicks called Pecker again.\n\nMcDougal ultimately settled her lawsuit with American Media Inc., which had paid her $150,000 in a deal that required her to stay quiet about her alleged affair with Donald Trump. Trump denies the affair. The settlement allowed her to discuss the alleged affair.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump allegedly asked Hicks to keep McDougal news story from wife Melania\n\nHicks testified that Donald Trump was \"concerned\" about how the Nov. 4, 2016 Wall Street Journal story on the Karen McDougal hush money deal would be viewed by his wife, Melania Trump. He wanted to make sure that newspapers weren't delivered to his and Melania's residence the morning the article ran, Hicks said.\n\nAsked by prosecutor Matthew Colangelo if Trump asked whether the news article was likely to affect the campaign, Hicks said \"everything\" discussed at that time was about whether there was an impact on the campaign.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\n'We have no knowledge of any of this': Hicks asked about 2016 statement\n\nProsecutor Matthew Colangelo asked Hope Hicks about a statement she gave to The Wall Street Journal for its Nov. 4, 2016 article about the hush money deal involving Karen McDougal. Speaking as a Trump campaign spokesperson, she told the publication: \"We have no knowledge of any of this.\"\n\nHicks said she doesn't remember whether Trump told her directly he had no knowledge about the McDougal deal. Prosecutors have already played an audio recording between Michael Cohen and Trump in which they seemed to be discussing the deal.\n\nColangelo asked Hicks to privately read testimony she previously gave to a grand jury, in case that would refresh her recollection. Jurors and the audience weren't shown that earlier testimony. After reading it, Hicks said that she sees what she said then, and she's not saying Trump didn't tell her he had no knowledge, but she doesn't \"have a strong memory\" that he said it.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nHicks asked about call between Trump and Cohen on Nov. 4, 2016\n\nProsecutor Matthew Colangelo resumed questioning former Trump aide Hope Hicks about a Nov. 4, 2016 Wall Street Journal story on a hush money deal involving former Playboy model Karen McDougal. Hicks said she believes she observed a phone call between Cohen and Trump shortly after the story was published, although she doesn't remember what was said. Reince Priebus, who would eventually become White House chief of staff, was also in the car when she observed the phone call, Hicks said.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump team arrives for more questioning of former aide Hope Hicks\n\nDonald Trump and his legal team entered the courtroom at 2:14 p.m. EDT. Judge Merchan has also returned and called in former Trump aide Hope Hicks. We are waiting for the jury.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nProsecution arrives for more questioning of Hope Hicks\n\nThe prosecution team entered the courtroom at 2:06 p.m. EDT, as we near the end of the court's lunch break. We are still waiting for the Trump team and Judge Merchan.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nHope Hicks' testimony may include conversations with Michael Cohen in NY trial\n\nIn the month before the 2016 presidential election, as Donald Trump's campaign scrambled to contain the fallout from a recording of him lewdly discussing grabbing women, Trump's campaign press secretary Hope Hicks was in frequent contact with his lawyer at the time, Michael Cohen.\n\nNow that she is on the witness stand, Hicks could testify about those conversations in the former president's New York criminal business fraud trial because Cohen says he paid two women on Trump's behalf to stop more salacious stories from emerging.\n\nExperts believe her testimony could be intended to bolster Cohen's credibility, as his reliability as a witness is questioned by Trump and his defense team.\n\n-Bart Jansen\n\nHow is Trump Media stock performing?\n\nAt open on May 3, Trump Media & Technology Group Corp share price fell to $47.47, down 2.49% from previous close.\n\n-Kinsey Crowley\n\nCourt breaks for lunch\n\nJudge Juan Merchan announced a lunch break just before 1 p.m. EDT. The defense and prosecution teams have left the courtroom.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nHicks reached out to Michael Cohen, David Pecker after Wall Street Journal inquiry\n\nHicks said, in addition to reaching out to Jared Kushner, she contacted Michael Cohen and David Pecker about the Wall Street Journal's comment request on the Karen McDougal story. She said she called Cohen because she knew he had a relationship with Pecker. And she called Pecker's office to let them know about the inquiry.\n\nPecker told Hicks the contract with McDougal was for paying the former Playboy model for magazine covers and fitness columns, Hicks testified.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nHicks asked Jared Kushner about asking Rupert Murdoch for more time on damaging Karen McDougal story\n\nAfter Hicks was contacted for comment about The Wall Street Journal's planned story on a hush money deal involving former Playboy model Karen McDougal, Hicks reached out to Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner. She testified that she asked Kushner if it was worth reaching out to the Journal's publisher, media mogul Rupert Murdoch, to see if the campaign could buy some extra time.\n\nKusher said he wasn't going to be able to reach Murdoch, and the campaign should just work on responding and dealing with the story, Hicks testified.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nHicks says she first heard Karen McDougal's name from a Wall Street Journal reporter\n\nHicks said she first heard Karen McDougal's name from a Nov. 4, 2016, email from a Wall Street Journal reporter, who indicated the Journal was planning to publish a story on McDougal's deal with the National Enquirer's parent company to keep quiet about her account of a months-long affair with Trump. Trump denies McDougal's story.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nProsecution continues to focus on Trump campaign concerns\n\nProsecutor Matthew Colangelo is continuing to focus his questions on how stories about Trump's conduct with women were creating campaign concerns as the 2016 election day approached. Colangelo played a video for jurors of a rally in North Carolina, where Trump said that if only 5% or 10% of voters believed the stories, the campaign would lose.\n\nColangelo asked Hicks if it was fair to say Trump was concerned the reports could hurt his standing with voters. \"Yes,\" was Hicks' quick reply.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nHope Hicks was one of the first Trump political aides\n\nHope Hicks isn't just any Trump political supporter − she is one of the originals.\n\nHicks was part of the very small campaign staff − less than a half-dozen people − that served the New York businessman when he announced his first presidential run in June of 2015.\n\nThe former Trump Organization employee worked mainly with the media, a duty she continued to perform in the Trump White House; she was known as someone who had a good relationship with Trump, who was known to refer to as \"Hopey.\"\n\nHicks managed an often fractious relationship between the volatile president and an aggressive media.\n\nAlthough she left the White House in 2018 to become a communications executive with the Fox Corporation, Hicks returned to the Trump administration in 2020 to help with that year's presidential campaign.\n\nShe won praise from Trump for exhibiting such loyalty.\n\n−David Jackson\n\nFemale voter concern is a potentially key point in hush money trial\n\nWhen they ultimately deliver closing arguments in this trial, the prosecution may return to Hicks' comments about the Trump campaign's concern about women voters after the Access Hollywood tape release. Here's why:\n\nFor Trump to be convicted of felonies, prosecutors must show not only that he falsified business records, but also that he did so in order to commit or conceal another crime.\n\nOne of the prosecution's ways to try to prove that is to show Trump was attempting to hide that campaign finance laws were broken through the $130,000 hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels. Trump, on the other hand, could argue the hush money wasn't about the campaign, but instead about sparing his family from embarrassing stories.\n\nHicks' testimony could be used to bolster the prosecution's argument that the hush money was about the campaign, and the alleged cover-up was about hiding a campaign finance violation.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nAccess Hollywood tape caused Trump campaign concern about female voters\n\nProsecutor Matthew Colangelo asked Hicks if the release of the Access Hollywood tape caused concern about its effect on female voters. \"Not in that moment, but certainly eventually that was something that was raised,\" Hicks said.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump felt the Access Hollywood comments were 'pretty standard stuff'\n\nHicks said she thinks Trump felt like his comments on the Access Hollywood tape were \"pretty standard stuff\" for two men having a private chat.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\n'Deny, deny, deny': Hicks message after learning of Access Hollywood tape\n\nThe prosecution showed jurors an email Hicks sent to trump adviser Steve Bannon and others after The Washington Post emailed her for comment about the Access Hollywood tape, which included a recording of Trump bragging about kissing and grabbing women without their consent. The email to her included a transcript of Trump's comments.\n\nHicks wrote in her email: \"FLAGGING\" and suggested a two-step process for approaching the issue: 1. \"Need to hear the tape to be sure.\" 2. \"Deny, deny, deny.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nHicks is asked about Access Hollywood tape\n\nHicks is currently describing when a Washington Post reporter reached out to her about the Access Hollywood tape of Trump saying he kisses women without waiting and gropes their genitals. The Post broke the story on the tape on Oct. 7, 2016.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nHicks overheard Trump praising Pecker's hit piece on Ben Carson during 2016 presidential campaign\n\nHope Hicks said she overheard a conversation between Trump and National Enquirer publisher David Pecker about Ben Carson, who was a rival to Trump for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.\n\nTrump was congratulating Pecker on the \"great reporting,\" Hicks said. The article accused Carson, a neurosurgeon, of medical malpractice. Hicks remembers Trump congratulating Pecker on a \"great investigative piece.\" She said she \"vaguely\" recalls that Trump would sometimes say things like \"this is Pulitzer worthy\" during the call.\n\nThe Enquirer savaged Trump's political rivals, including Hillary Clinton and Ted Cruz, with fabricated stories during the 2016 campaign.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nHicks asked: How did you know tabloid executive David Pecker?\n\nHicks' testimony may be moving into the hush money deals at issue in the case. Prosecutor Matthew Colangelo just asked how she knew David Pecker, the former executive for the parent company of the National Enquirer.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump watching Hicks testimony on screen\n\nTrump appears to be watching Hope Hicks' testimony on a screen attached to a wall in front of him. There are four large screens attached to walls in the front half of the courtroom, showing a live video stream of proceedings. That video feed also plays into an overflow room down the hallway, where more reporters and members of the public are seated.\n\nTrump has often had his eyes closed during the trial, but when they are open, he has typically looked directly at the witness who is testifying.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nHicks says Trump may have 'been joking' the first time he suggested her as press secretary\n\nHope Hicks testified she thinks Trump might have \"been joking\" the first time he suggested she would be the 2016 Trump campaign's press secretary. \"I didn't take it very seriously,\" she said.\n\nBut later, Hicks took on that role. She is continuing to discuss her background with Trump, including her role broadening out the communications staff for the 2016 Trump campaign.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump averts his eyes from former trusted aide Hope Hicks\n\nTrump's eyes are open and he appears to be listening to Hicks' testimony, which right now is focusing on her work with different people at the Trump Organization. Trump is looking straight ahead, whereas Hicks is pretty far to Trump's right.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWho is Hope Hicks?\n\nHope Hicks was the Trump 2016 presidential campaign press secretary and later the communications director in Trump's White House starting in September 2017. She was the fourth person in the Trump administration to hold the position before resigning in February 2018. She was 29 years old when she resigned.\n\nHicks may have been in touch with Cohen about preventing Stormy Daniels from going public. Court records show Hicks spoke with Trump and Cohen on the phone on Oct. 8, 2016. That day and those conversations have become key in Cohen's federal conviction for campaign finance violations related to the hush money payments. Hicks has said she was not present for discussions about Daniels, and only learned about the upcoming scandal through reporters, CNN reported.\n\n\"Again, I had no knowledge of Stormy Daniels other than to say she was going to be mentioned in the story amongst people that were shopping stories around,” Hicks previously testified before the House Judiciary Committee, according to CNN.\n\nHicks first came into Trump's orbit while working for Ivanka Trump's fashion line.\n\n−Kinsey Crowley\n\nHope Hicks describes Trump as 'multitasker' and 'hard worker'\n\nHicks said Trump is a very good multitasker and hard worker. She said he's always doing multiple things at once and would sometimes come to meetings with information to advance his interests.

Trump said in the video that he has said and done things he regrets, but his words on the tape don't reflect who he is.\n\n\"I said it,\" \"I was wrong,\" and \"I apologize,\" Trump said in the video. \"I pledge to be a better man tomorrow, and will never, ever, let you down.\"\n\nTrump started talking about American jobs in the video and the safety of the country. He attacked Hillary and Bill Clinton, and drew a distinction between words and actions.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge will allow jury to see Trump social media posts\n\nThe jurors just returned from a short break. Before they returned, Judge Merchan ruled that multiple Twitter posts by Trump, as well as a Truth Social post, will be permitted to be shown to the jury. The posts haven't been displayed in court yet.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nParalegal from Manhattan District Attorney's office begins testifying\n\nParalegal Georgia Longstreet from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office has begun testifying.

I just counted to 40, with a \"Mississippi\" in between each number, before Trump opened his eyes.\n\nYesterday, the former president claimed on social media he doesn't fall asleep at his trial, but instead simply closes his \"beautiful blue eyes\" sometimes as he listens \"intensely.\"\n\nIt's true Trump sometimes has his eyes closed when he doesn't appear to be asleep. But I also saw him on April 19, during jury selection, clearly appear to be falling asleep. He repeatedly dropped his head down before lifting it back up and, at one point, he had his mouth agape while his eyes were closed.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump lawyer asking about handling of Cohen-Trump audio recording\n\nTrump lawyer Emil Bove is questioning computer forensic analyst Douglas Daus about the handling of the audio recording we heard yesterday in which Michael Cohen and Trump appeared to be discussing a hush money deal. Daus confirmed to Bove that news media reported on the contents of the recording in 2018. Daus also confirmed that, because Cohen and his legal team sent it to the media, they must have handled the audio file.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nComputer forensic analyst re-takes witness stand\n\nComputer forensic analyst Douglas Daus re-took the witness stand at 9:47 a.m. EDT, and the jury has been called in.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWeinstein decision doesn't impact rulings in Trump case, judge says\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche argued that a New York appeals court's decision to toss out the New York rape conviction against Oscar-winning movie producer Harvey Weinstein should cause Judge Merchan to re-think some of his pre-trial rulings about the evidence that can be introduced in Trump's current trial. Merchan, for example, has allowed in testimony of Trump's infamous comments on the Hollywood Access tape about kissing women without waiting and groping their genitals, although Merchan isn't allowing the tape to actually be played in court.\n\nHowever, Merchan said the New York court of appeals didn't announce new legal standards – it simply applied existing legal standards to the facts in Weinstein's case. Merchan used the existing legal standards when ruling on evidence in Trump's case, so there's no cause for changing his rulings, he said.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge tells Trump gag order does not restrict his testimony\n\nJudge Juan Merchan opened proceedings this morning by addressing the Trump team to clear up any \"misunderstanding\" about whether the gag order impacts Trump's right to testify. This was likely a response to Trump's comments in the courthouse hallway after proceedings yesterday, when he said: \"I'm not allowed to testify; I'm under a gag order ... I guess, right?\"\n\n\"I want to stress, Mr. Trump, that you have an absolute right to testify,\" Merchan said this morning. \"That is a constitutional right\" and a \"fundamental right that cannot be infringed upon.\"Merchan told Trump he also has the right not to testify, but if he chooses to testify, the gag order doesn't limit or minimize what he can say from the witness stand. As the order indicates, it only applies to \"extrajudicial statements\" – meaning statements made outside of court, Merchan noted.Merchan advised Trump to tell his lawyer if had has any lingering questions.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump talks jobs report before attacking the trial\n\nTrial? What trial?\n\nTrump devoted the start of his pre-trial address to Friday's disappointing jobs report, claiming \"our economy is bad\" and blaming President Joe Biden.\n\nTrump then turned to his daily diatribe against the legal proceeding, saying \"there is no crime\" and again blaming Biden, as well as the judge and New York prosecutors.\n\nThe angry former president also expressed a bit of optimism, saying \"we are winning this trial.\"\n\n−David Jackson\n\nTrump defense team arrives in courtroom\n\nFormer President Donald Trump and his defense team entered the courtroom at 9:25 a.m. EDT.

She was also a former counsel to Venero Mangano, the former Genovese crime family underboss known as Benny Eggs.\n\n-Josh Meyer\n\nWhat did we learn Thursday on Day 10 of hush money trial?\n\nThe testimony of Keith Davidson, the lawyer for Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels in each of their hush money deals tied to Trump, wrapped up yesterday. Jurors saw a text from Davidson to the National Enquirer's editor on 2016 Election Night: \"What have we done?\"\n\nDavidson characterized the message as humorous, but also said it reflected his belief that his activities when it came to the hush money deals – one of which was made directly with the National Enquirer's parent company – assisted the Trump campaign.\n\nWe also heard an audio recording that prosecutors say shows Trump himself was involved in the McDougal hush money deal. \"So, what do we got to pay for this? 150?\" Trump asked Michael Cohen. That, according to the prosecution, was a reference to the $150,000 hush money that ultimately was paid in McDougal's deal.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nCould Trump go to prison?\n\nTrump could theoretically face a couple decades in prison if convicted on all 34 felony counts.

Daniels has alleged she had sex with Trump in 2006, a claim he denies.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/05/28/historic-trump-criminal-trial-reaches-critical-day-closing-arguments/73832451007/", "title": "Historic Trump hush money trial reaches critical day: lawyers to give ...", "text": "Former President Donald Trump's historic criminal hush money trial will reach a critical peak on Tuesday when the prosecution and defense will present their closing arguments to the jury. Each side will weave together five weeks of evidence and testimony to make a case for the first-ever conviction or acquittal of a former U.S. president.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in order to conceal or commit another crime. Prosecutors argue Trump falsified records tied to reimbursing his then-lawyer, Michael Cohen, for an unlawful $130,000 hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nClosing arguments can be crucial for helping jurors understand whether the testimony and evidence they have heard adds up to a compelling case.\n\nFinally, jurors will hear the judge's instructions on the law they should apply in the case.\n\nTo win a conviction, prosecutors have to prove not only that Trump falsified business records, but also that his motivation was to hide the violation of federal campaign finance laws in 2016 or hide a plan to violate New York tax or election laws. The alleged campaign finance violation was the $130,000 hush money, which prosecutors say was a campaign contribution that exceeded the $2,700 legal limit. Cohen pleaded guilty to that federal crime in 2018.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nThese are the key questions the closing arguments will address and jurors will be asked to decide:\n\nIs Trump responsible for falsifying records tied to hush money?\n\nThe 34 allegedly falsified records in the case are checks, vouchers, and invoices tied to a series of $35,000 payments to Cohen in 2017. Prosecutors say the payments were mischaracterized as 2017 legal expenses under a non-existent agreement to retain Cohen's services. The payments were actually reimbursing Cohen for the hush money and another expense, as well as giving him an extra bonus.\n\nMichael Cohen was a star prosecution witness for a reason: he had more to say than anyone else in the trial about Trump's alleged participation in both paying the hush money and covering it up. Cohen testified that Trump approved the falsified reimbursement scheme during a meeting with Cohen and then-Trump Organization executive Allen Weisselberg in early 2017. Cohen also testified that Trump authorized the hush money to Daniels – saying \"Just do it\" – in October of 2016.\n\nProsecutors are likely to point to evidence from trial that bolsters Cohen's testimony, such as Trump's own signature – according to testimony from multiple witnesses who worked with him – on many of the checks to Cohen.\n\nProsecutors will probably also point to statements by Trump that suggest he would be paying attention to invoices from Cohen and to what his own checks were for. For instance, a book publisher read aloud these statements from Trump's 2005 book, \"Trump: Think Like a Billionaire\":\n\n\"I always sign my checks, so I know where my money's going\" and \"I also always try to read my bills to make sure I'm not being over-charged,\" Trump said.\n\n\"Pay attention to the small numbers in your finances, such as percentages and cents,\" Trump said.\n\n\"Always look at the numbers yourself,\" Trump said.\n\n\"(Even) though various payments always need to be made, always question invoices and never accept a contractor's first bid,\" Trump said.\n\n\"When you sign a check yourself, you're seeing what's really going on inside your business, and if people see your signature at the bottom of the check, they know you're watching them, and they screw you less because they have proof that you care about the details,\" Trump said.\n\nProsecutors are also likely to remind jurors of notes they saw that former Trump Organization executive Jeffrey McConney said were drafted by Weisselberg and outlined the calculation of payments to Cohen, including doubling the $130,000 hush money payment to account for taxes.\n\nAnd prosecutors may try to bolster the notion that Trump was kept abreast of the Stormy Daniels hush money deal by pointing to an audio recording from the trial that allegedly involves Cohen and Trump talking about an earlier $150,000 hush money deal to quiet former Playboy model Karen McDougal.\n\nIn the somewhat cryptic conversation, Cohen references \"our friend David\" and \"financing,\" while Trump appears to ask about paying \"150\" and instructs not to pay with cash. Cohen testified he made the recording to reassure tabloid publisher David Pecker that Trump planned to re-pay him for the hush money.\n\nWhat will Trump's defense tell jurors about records?\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche gave a preview last week of what his team may argue to jurors. Blanche urged Judge Juan Merchan to toss out the entire case, saying the business records \"were not false\" because Cohen agreed he supplied Trump with legal services in 2017.\n\nTrump's team is also likely to tell jurors that Michael Cohen is a liar – so they can't trust his testimony that the payments were actually reimbursing hush money, not paying for ongoing legal services. They may remind jurors that Cohen previously pleaded guilty to lying to Congress and making false statements to a bank.\n\nRobert Costello – one of just two witnesses the defense called in the trial – may be a key focus in challenging Cohen's testimony. Costello quoted Cohen as having said: \"I swear to God, Bob, I don't have anything on Donald Trump.\" Meanwhile, Cohen said Costello was trying to create a back channel of communication to Trump, and he didn't trust the \"sketchy\" lawyer.\n\nWas this an attempt to hide unlawful election interference?\n\nProsecutors need to prove not just that Trump falsified business records, but also that he was trying to commit or conceal another crime. Their leading argument throughout the trial has been that Trump was trying to hide unlawfully interfering in the 2016 election. \"It was election fraud, pure and simple,\" prosecutor Matthew Colangelo told jurors in his opening statement.\n\nThat argument turns on whether the hush money payment to Daniels violated federal campaign finance laws. A key issue in answering that question will be whether the hush money was about the campaign, as opposed to protecting Trump's marriage or family life.\n\nIn fact, former Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards escaped conviction in his own criminal case on campaign finance charges by arguing that nearly $1 million from donors that was used to conceal an affair and illegitimate child during his campaign was aimed at shielding his actions from his cancer-stricken wife.\n\nThe prosecution in Trump's case may point to a series of statements from witnesses at trial to make their case:\n\nMichael Cohen testified that Trump urged him to delay paying Daniels until after the election, and then not pay her at all, saying if he lost the election, he \"wouldn't care\" about the story.\n\nDaniels' former lawyer, Keith Davidson, backed up the testimony about Cohen delaying payment so much that he questioned whether they would get the money at all. Davidson said Cohen only paid less than two weeks before the election, at a time when Davidson believed Daniels really was going to go public, potentially with ABC News.\n\nJurors also heard a recording of Davidson claiming to Cohen that Daniels told him he \"better settle this God damn story\" because if Trump loses the election, \"we lose all (expletive) leverage.\"\n\nCohen also testified that Trump wasn't thinking about his wife, Melania. Trump said, according to Cohen, that if she left him over the Daniels scandal, he wouldn't be on the market long.\n\nDavid Pecker testified \"the conversations that I had directly with Mr. Trump, his family wasn't mentioned.\" Pecker said of one conversation in particular: \"It was basically, what would be – the impact be – to the campaign or election.\"\n\nFormer top White House aide Hope Hicks testified about a post-2016 election story about the hush money to Daniels. She said Trump asked for her thoughts on how an earlier story before the election would have compared had Cohen not paid the hush money. \"I think Mr. Trump's opinion was it was better to be dealing with it now, and that it would have been bad to have that story come out before the election,\" she said.\n\nWhat will the Trump defense team say?\n\nTrump's defense team appears poised to argue Trump didn't know about the hush money payment ahead of time. In his cross-examination of Cohen, Blanche displayed text messages suggesting a call from Cohen to Trump's bodyguard was to talk about harassment from a 14-year-old, not to get Trump on the phone about the Daniels hush money deal. Cohen said he believed he also discussed the deal with Trump.\n\nIn addition, the defense team could say there's no clear evidence the hush money payment was focused on the election. Hope Hicks testified that Trump was \"concerned\" about how a November, 2016 story on the hush money deal involving McDougal would be viewed by Melania Trump, and wanted Hicks to make sure newspapers weren't delivered to the Trump residence that morning.\n\nAnother former Trump White House aide, Madeleine Westerhout, also testified to admiring Trump's relationship with his wife, although she also said she didn't observe any change in the relationship after the Wall Street Journal reported on the Stormy Daniels hush money deal broke in 2018.\n\nWas this an attempt to hide a plan to violate state election and tax laws?\n\nProsecutors are likely to also argue there are alternative options for convicting Trump, even if jurors don't find that he falsified records in order to cover up the violation of federal campaign finance laws.\n\nIn pre-trial filings, prosecutors said Trump was also planning on violating a New York election law by using \"unlawful means\" to promote Trump's presidential election. And they said he was planning on committing tax fraud by doubling the reimbursement to Cohen to account for taxes.\n\nThe Trump team, on the other hand, will likely say the business records weren't covering up any crime.\n\n\"There is simply no evidence that there is any effort to conceal anything by – not only by President Trump, but also by any of the others involved,\" Blanche already told Merchan in his unsuccessful attempt to get the case tossed out.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/05/21/trump-trial-end-jury-deliberation-verdict/73784120007/", "title": "When will the Trump trial end? After closing arguments, jury ...", "text": "Donald Trump's hush money trial is nearing its end. The prosecution and defense have rested their cases and closing arguments are scheduled to start Tuesday, May 28.\n\nThe former president has appeared nearly daily in the Manhattan courthouse over the past five weeks as prosecutors built a case to argue he falsified business records in 34 different instances. Throughout 19 witnesses and dozens of pieces of evidence, they tried to prove Trump disguised reimbursements to former aide Michael Cohen, who they accuse of violating campaign finance laws when he paid porn star Stormy Daniels $130,000 in 2016 to stay quiet about a sexual encounter that allegedly happened a decade earlier.\n\nThough Trump has been charged in four different criminal cases, this case is likely the only one to reach a trial ahead of the 2024 general election. Now that both sides have rested their cases, 12 jurors will decide if the presumptive Republican nominee will also be a convicted felon. Experts say we could have that decision by the end of next week.\n\nHere is what we know about the timeline for the remainder of the trial:\n\nTrump trial:Historic Trump trial heading to jury after prosecutors, defense lawyers rest\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nDefense and prosecutors to recap case ahead of jury deliberation\n\nJurors were excused Tuesday, but both the prosecution and the defense must return in the afternoon to argue over the instructions Judge Juan Merchan will provide to the jury ahead of their deliberations.\n\nThose instructions could be crucial to the outcome of the case. Merchan will tell the jury what the applicable law in the case is. He will then task them with not just deciding what happened factually in the case – for example, whether former President Donald Trump authorized Michael Cohen to pay porn star Stormy Daniels hush money – but also determining whether Trump's actions violated the law.\n\nMerchan told jurors they would hear closing arguments Tuesday, May 28, and seemed to put plans in place for them to stay late in order to get through both sides. If jurors are able to come in the following next day, typically an off day for this court, they could start deliberating then.\n\nThe 12 jurors must come to a unanimous decision to convict or acquit Trump.\n\nHow long can the jury take to deliberate?\n\nThere is no limit for how long a jury can take to deliberate, says Diana Florence, a former Manhattan prosecutor.\n\n\"But, obviously, that doesn't mean that ... the world will be ending and they'll still be deliberating,\" Florence said.\n\nIf the group cannot come to a unanimous decision, it is considered a \"hung jury\" and the judge must declare a mistrial. \"You know it when you see it when it comes to a hung jury,\" she said.\n\nBut any deliberation taking at least three days would be considered a long time, according to Kevin J. O’Brien, a New York-based trial lawyer.\n\nIf the jury takes a long time reviewing and discussing the evidence, it could indicate good news for the prosecution, he said.\n\n\"Defense verdicts tend to be in quickly, because people have their views, and one or more jurors are not going to budge. ... They don't go through the labor of weighing all the evidence,\" O’Brien said. \"But if they're out three or four days, that tends to suggest they're really looking at the evidence. And of course, the evidence favors the prosecution.\"\n\nWhen will there be a verdict in the Trump trial?\n\nIf jury begins deliberation by May 30, which the schedule indicates they could, Florence said we could have a verdict by the end of next week.\n\n\"Could it take longer? Sure,\" she said. \"That's where it becomes anybody's guess and it's reading tea leaves.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/04/17/donald-trump-hush-money-trial-day-2-takeaways-nyc-the-excerpt/73353815007/", "title": "Donald Trump hush money trial Day 2 takeaways | The Excerpt", "text": "On Wednesday’s episode of The Excerpt podcast: A second day of former President Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial is in the books, and jury selection is going quicker than expected.

That's despite early predictions that it would take weeks to seat 12 unbiased jurors. At the current pace, five more jurors and six alternates are expected to be seated in the coming days. Yesterday's proceeding saw the presumptive Republican presidential nominee warned by Judge Juan Merchan over potential juror intimidation. While several possible jurors were confronted with social media posts that Trump's lawyers showed bias against the one-time reality TV star.

Opening arguments could begin within a matter of days.\n\n♦\n\nPresident Joe Biden wants to win back blue collar voters. And several congressional districts won by former President Donald Trump in 2020 may offer some clues.\n\nI spoke with USA TODAY Congress Campaigns and Democracy reporter Karissa Waddick to learn more. Karissa, thanks for hopping on the Excerpt today.\n\nKarissa Waddick:\n\nYeah, thanks for having me. Happy to be here.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Karissa, would you just start by telling us about Tony Milidantri and his friends? Who are they and what are their priorities this election?\n\nKarissa Waddick:\n\nTony and a group of retired veterans who live about 20 to 30 minutes east of Scranton, Pennsylvania, they live in this area called Lake Ariel. And they go to a diner every morning and they sit there and they chat about politics, about the main issues they're facing right now. All of them are older, probably about over the age of 70. These are men who for the most part worked in unions for most of their lives. They're now retired. Tony especially was a union Democrat. And in 2016 he started seeing some trends. He didn't feel like the Democratic Party really represented him. Something that we heard echoed by a lot of the people in this diner that we went to, and around this area of Pennsylvania where President Biden grew up. Tony and his friends this election year are more concerned with economic issues as opposed to some of the more social issues. They cited immigration and the economy as the two big things really influencing how they are looking at the world right now, how they're looking at US politics.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nHow important is it to both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump to win over these voters this election? And also Karissa, what role did blue collar voters play in the last couple presidential elections?\n\nKarissa Waddick:\n\nSo blue collar voters are extremely important in this election, especially when you look at the map of swing states across the country, and three of the big ones are Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. I'm sure a lot of people remember hearing about these three states in 2016 and again in 2020. And that's because they've had a major role in the past two elections, and they're likely to play a major role in this election too. They have a lot of these voters like Tony kind of Union Blue Democrats, former Union Blue Democrats, Donald Trump won these states in 2016. That was the first year that a Republican had won these states in the presidential election since 1992. They had been considered democratic strongholds, something called Blue Wall states. And in 2020, Biden was able to win these states back. That trend was also reflected across a number of what we call swing districts across the country, congressional districts that flip from Democrat to Republican.\n\nThese areas have a similar demographic, similar history to Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin. And they show these same trends, voters in these areas, blue collar voters, they swing based on the status of the economy. And Trump was able to win these voters over because they had felt like Democrats had left them behind. Biden in 2020 kind of touted his blue collar roots and then really leaned into his economic messages to win these voters back. But some of the other swing districts, he didn't win them but he narrowed the margins. In 2024 I talked to some experts and they said, it's great that Biden narrowed the margins and was able to win because of that in 2020. In 2024, he might need to do more than that. He's going to need to win back substantially more of these voters to continue on with the second term.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYeah. In your story, Karissa, you point to some Democratic representatives who have managed to win over Conservative voters in working class areas. How have they done so and what lessons can Biden take from them?\n\nKarissa Waddick:\n\nWe looked at three districts, Pennsylvania's eighth district, which is represented by Matt Cartwright, who's a Democrat. We looked at Ohio's ninth District, which is in the northwestern corner of that state, includes Toledo and a few other areas. And then Maine's second district, which is in the northern part of Maine and that is represented by Jared Golden. And these three representatives really, really focus on the economic issues that impact their districts. They in Congress almost exclusively focus on bringing back earmarks and bringing back funding to their districts, talking infrastructure projects, bridges, things like that that impact their constituents. One of the other reasons that these representatives have held on in their districts, even though Trump has won these districts in 2020, was because they're seen as kind of locals. They understand that they come from a similar background as them. That ability to relate to voters one-on-one has really helped them.\n\nSo the major lessons for Biden, I think that can be taken from these folks is that in these blue collar areas, it really is maybe less of a focus on the cultural issues that Democrats have been focusing on this election so far. Abortion is an incredibly important issue and we've seen it be a salient issue across the country. But in some of these blue collar areas it might be less so, the economy might be the issue that really stands out.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nKarissa Waddick covers congress campaigns and democracy for USA TODAY. Thank you, Karissa.\n\nKarissa Waddick:\n\nThank you, Taylor.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnother conservative hardliner has publicly come out in support of forcibly removing house speaker Mike Johnson from the job. Congressman Thomas Massie joins Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene in calling for Johnson to resign from the post. If he doesn't, they're threatening to call up a vote on the house floor that could supplant the speaker and create another leadership hole in the chamber. Johnson took the job putting him second in line of succession for the presidency after a handful of Republican rebels last fall voted to remove speaker Kevin McCarthy from the role. Massie's support for what's known as a motion to vacate or a procedural vote to remove the speaker, puts Johnson's job in jeopardy since Republicans control the house with a razor-thin majority.\n\n♦\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas will today announce the launch of an initiative to fight online crimes against minors. I spoke with domestic security correspondent Josh Meyer to learn more about what he told USA TODAY in exclusive interviews. A warning, the following deals with sexual violence against children. Josh, thanks for hopping on as always.\n\nJosh Meyer:\n\nThanks, Taylor.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\neSo Josh, a disturbing story here, just how bad has online child exploitation gotten and what kinds of harm are we talking about here?\n\nJosh Meyer:\n\nThe crimes that we're talking about here run the gamut. I interviewed multiple DHS officials from a frontline agent in Tennessee to top transnational organized crime fighting supervisors at DHS. And we're talking about live-streamed sexual assaults and even rapes of toddlers. We're also talking about predators grooming unsuspecting children on popular online gaming sites like Roblox and others, would be molesters targeting their underage prey on social media, Instagram, Facebook and so on. And then using geolocation apps to show up in person at their schools and meet them. Some of the crimes are so violent and troubling that in my exclusive interview with Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, Mayorkas told me, \"I don't think I should get into the specifics. Let me just say that it is beyond most people's imagination.\"\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nOne aspect to this, Josh, was this idea of financial sex exploitation of minors. Can you talk about that as well?\n\nJosh Meyer:\n\nYeah, that's something that's been really a problem that's surfaced just in the past couple of years and it's growing very quickly. What happens is very savvy cyber actors, many of them in West Africa are targeting American teenagers and pretending to be their counterparts, young kids. Even sending them sexually explicit pictures of themselves and then asking for pictures in return. And then when the kids do that, they blackmail them and say, \"I'm going to send this to all of your friends if you do not pay me 500 or $1000. And they even walk them through how to pay it through money apps and so forth, or they threaten to expose them online. And some of the DHS officials I've talked to said that some of these kids pay, but some of them have committed suicide because they feel that their life is over, their friends aren't going to like them. It's a really troubling trend, and it's something that DHS is trying to fight as much as it can.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYeah, awful stuff, Josh. So what is this new DHS campaign then aimed at combating these heinous crimes?\n\nJosh Meyer:\n\nSo this is something called Know2Protect. They call it K2P. And really what DHS is trying to do is bring a whole of government approach to this, or at least whole of DHS approach to this problem. Partnering federal investigators from various elements within DHS on the cyber side, on the law enforcement side and so forth, partnering them with nonprofit organizations, private sector companies and state and local law enforcement officials to combat what Mayorkas says is an alarming rise in these horrific online crimes against minors.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nJosh, often this type of exploitation stretches outside US borders. How complicated does that make this issue, and how does the DHS hope this plan might offer solutions there?\n\nJosh Meyer:\n\nIt's true. Mayorkas told me that these crimes know no borders, and so they're working with authorities around the world, including the Five Eyes, which is the key US Allies, Canada, Britain, Australia, and so forth, but European Union, other government agencies and nonprofits overseas to really make this a global awareness campaign. One of the things that they're doing is learning how to recognize the signs of this crime in its many forms, what they can do to prevent it, how they can report it to law enforcement whether it's overseas or here, and how they can support survivors. Homeland Security Investigations does have a presence overseas in many of our embassies, and so they're going to be working with authorities over there to go after some of this stuff, including child sex tourism, which is this horrible phenomenon where people from this country go overseas to have sex with minors.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nIt's a disturbing story. Josh Meyer covers domestic security for USA TODAY. Thanks for your work on this, Josh. Appreciate it.\n\nJosh Meyer:\n\nMy pleasure. Thanks, Taylor.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nMassive coral bleaching across the world's oceans. During the past years, warm water temperatures was labeled a global coral bleaching event by federal officials on Monday. It's the fourth global coral bleaching overall and the second in the last 10 years with extensive bleaching and heat stress across the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. That's according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Coral scientists around the world say bleaching is growing worse and becoming more frequent as climate change sends temperatures higher in the world's oceans. A bleaching event does not mean all the coral will die necessarily, but scientists say it's difficult for the coral to recover when such events occur more often.

This farm houses 26,000 birds.\n\nThis is considered a presumptive-positive case at this time, according to the Indiana State Board of Animal Health, and samples are being verified at the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary lab in Iowa.\n\nWhile the results are pending, all the turkeys will be euthanized.\n\n\"The risk is too high of spread to wait until the laboratory confirmation comes in, especially with the presumptive positive and clinical signs in the birds already,\" said Denise Derrer Spears, spokeswoman for the board of animal health. \"So the owners are taking action to prevent further spread.\"\n\nThis does not present an immediate concern to public health, federal officials said, but it does have agriculture and industry folks worried.\n\nLast week, the USDA reported the confirmed case of the H5N1 strain of avian flu at a farm in Dubois County. It is a highly pathogenic strain, meaning it is lethal to all poultry that contract the disease. All turkeys at that farm — 29,000 — were euthanized to help control the spread.\n\nIt was the nation’s first confirmed case of the flu in a commercial operation since 2020 and six years since it was last found on farms in Indiana, when hundreds of thousands of birds were killed as a result.\n\nBird flu: Virus found on poultry farm in Indiana, nearly 30,000 turkeys killed to contain spread\n\nAs soon as the state received the first results Feb. 9, it issued a quarantine at the site and all those farms within a 10-kilometer radius primarily in Dubois County and a portion of northern Spencer County. That includes 17 other operations, Derrer Spears said.\n\nThe second affected farm is one of those within the control area and already under quarantine. The close proximity of that second farm to the initial site means the established control circle will remain the same.\n\nAll those farms within the control area will have to test their animals at least once each week to monitor for the disease. The first round of tests last week came back negative, Derrer Spears said.\n\nThe second flock was tested again after the farmer noticed water consumption by the birds dropped dramatically — a clinical sign of avian influenza.\n\nThe names of the affected farms have not been publicly released.\n\nThe euthanized turkeys from both farms will be disposed of onsite by composting them, a method that is approved and overseen by state and federal agencies. The barns and all equipment also need to be thoroughly cleaned – “eat off the floor clean,” Derrer Spears said.\n\nOnce the cleaning is complete and the disposal has reached a certain stage, the quarantine will be lifted. There are many factors involved and there is no target date to do that, the state said it likely will be about four to six weeks.\n\nPollution: Indiana steelmaker has to pay $3 million for cyanide spill that killed thousands of fish\n\nThe state Board of Animal Health has also established a surveillance zone that extends an additional 10 kilometers beyond the control area boundary to allow for additional monitoring for the virus in commercial poultry in the area. The operations in this zone are not under quarantine but will be tested regularly, though at less frequent intervals, until the control area is lifted.\n\nIt is unclear how the Dubois County flocks were infected. The avian flu viruses are fairly common in wild migratory birds and waterfowl, according to Derrer Spears, and ducks and geese that contract the disease will spread it in their droppings as they fly by.\n\nIndiana is not the only state struggling with an outbreak of the virus.\n\nPoultry operations in Kentucky and Virginia were confirmed to have birds infected with the highly lethal form of avian flu just days after the first Indiana flock tested positive — raising worries about a wider outbreak across the country.\n\nThe most recently identified infections occurred at a Tyson Foods commercial chicken operation in Kentucky with 240,000 birds as well as a backyard flock of mixed species in Virginia. Officials also are waiting for test results of a turkey flock in another Kentucky county.\n\nThe strain also has been wreaking havoc on Asia and Europe, and has been found in some wild birds along the East Coast. Canada recently confirmed an H5N1 bird flu in a commercial poultry operation in Nova Scotia.\n\nThis current Midwest outbreak is significant because it shows that the strain has entered a migratory pathway for birds called the Mississippi Flyway, which follows the Mississippi and Ohio rivers and includes several major poultry states such as Indiana.\n\nThe last time this bird flu was found in commercial poultry in Indiana was in January 2016. That situation similarly started with one flock and then testing showed that it had spread to nearly a dozen other flocks. Ultimately more than 400,000 birds across the state needed to be euthanized.\n\nDubois County is the top turkey producing county in Indiana. And Indiana is the third-largest turkey producing state in the country, the No. 1 state in duck production and the second largest in table eggs and egg-laying chickens.\n\nStill, this outbreak is not only of concern for commercial farming operations.\n\nBoard of Animal Health staff continue to reach out to known hobby or backyard poultry owners in the control area to schedule testing of birds. The state said that to date, 25 such flocks have been sampled but the laboratory testing is not complete.\n\nThe state asks that hobby poultry owners in southern Dubois County contact the Board of Animal Health at 317-544-2387 to schedule testing at no charge.\n\nStaff with the USDA-Wildlife Services in Indiana also is beginning wild bird surveillance efforts in the area.\n\nCall IndyStar reporter Sarah Bowman at 317-444-6129 or email at sarah.bowman@indystar.com.

The week prior, sick dairy cattle in Texas and Kansas tested positive for bird flu. Bird flu was later reported in a Michigan dairy herd that included cows transported from Texas. Cattle in New Mexico and Idaho are also presumed to be positive for the disease, officials said.\n\nThe only symptom reported by the Texas patient was pink eye, or conjunctivitis, according to an update April 1 from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nOfficials say the risk to public health remains low. They note that there are steps people can take to curb the spread of the potentially dangerous virus. The events in Texas, they say, raise future concerns about how the bird flu virus evolves.\n\n\"This is definitely an evolving situation,\" Dr. Diego Diel, director of Cornell University's virology laboratory at the Animal Health Diagnostic Center, which worked to sequence the virus, told USA TODAY. \"Right now, I think the viruses that have been detected in cattle and in other animals in these farms don't contain any mutations that would indicate increased transmissibility or pathogenesis to humans.\"\n\nBut if the virus is being transmitted from cow to cow, Diel stressed, it's important to continue monitoring the virus in the long term to see whether there are potential mutations that could cause spillover into other species, including humans.\n\nCDC says cases rising:What to know about meningococcal disease\n\nHow does bird flu spread?\n\nBird flu primarily spreads through contact with infected birds. Most cases in humans have occurred after a person had unprotected exposure to sick or dead infected animals.\n\nAvian flu viruses infect birds’ respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, which causes them to shed the virus via their saliva, mucous and feces, the CDC said. Humans and other mammals can get it when they get enough virus in their eyes, nose, or mouth or inhale it into their lungs.\n\nPeople who have close contact or unprotected contact for long periods are at greater risk of infection. The disease can cause mild upper respiratory issues or severe illness, including pneumonia and multiple organ failure that leads to death.\n\nIn the U.S., the disease tends to spread from wild birds. However, outbreaks in commercial poultry or backyard flocks that led to deaths have been reported in 48 states since February 2022.\n\nCan cats get bird flu?\n\nOfficials identified the latest bird flu cases in unpasteurized milk from sick cattle at dairy farms in Kansas and Texas, in addition to a positive throat swab of a cow at another Texas dairy farm. This spread to cows is believed to be the first for the species. The other species caught the virus directly from wild birds: cats.\n\nCornell researchers believe the virus was transmitted to Texas dairy cows through contaminated water and other food sources from infected birds migrating through the area. The virus then likely spread among cows who were near each other or the birds, however, there isn't yet definitive proof of this, said Diel, who is an associate professor of virology.\n\nIn early March, Dr. Elisha Frye, an assistant professor of practice at Cornell's Department of Population Medicine and Diagnostic Sciences, received a call about an outbreak among Texas dairy herds of a disease of unknown origin. Samples of milk and manure and nasal swabs from the cattle showed bird flu was present. Researchers also found evidence of bird flu in the testing of dead birds and one of three cats found dead at the dairy facilities around the same time.\n\n\"It was kind of the same timeline as when we found it in the cattle samples, but it did kind of link it together,\" Frye told USA TODAY. \"The birds, the cat and milk from the cows all having the same pathogen in them made sense at the time for that being the main cause of illness.\"\n\nHow do humans get bird flu?\n\nIt's rare for humans to be infected with bird flu. The only other human case in the U.S. occurred in 2022, in a person incarcerated in a Colorado prison who was exposed to poultry infected with avian flu.\n\nOn Tuesday, the CDC said the current public health risk is low, and there is no person-to-person spread of bird flu so far. That is a vital measurement that would prompt concern for the spread of the disease.\n\nThere remains an increased risk for poultry, livestock and farmers and workers in these sectors, as well as veterinarians, veterinary staff and first responders who respond to cases, officials said.\n\nOzempic and Wegovy:Weight-loss drugs cost $1,000 a month but less than $25 to make. Why do we pay so much?\n\nDo eggs carry bird flu? What about dairy products?\n\nFood production officials have been taking steps to prevent the distribution of milk or eggs from infected animals. Cooked eggs and pasteurized milk, in general, should be safe for consumers.\n\nLast week, the largest U.S. chicken egg supplier reported positive tests for bird flu at its facility in the Texas Panhandle. In a news release, Cal-Maine Foods said production at the Panhandle facility stopped temporarily, following protocols to prevent bird flu set by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Personnel at the company killed about 1.6 million laying hens and 337,000 young hens to curb the spread of the virus.\n\nThere isn't as simple of a solution to reduce the risk of bird flu since the eggs can carry the virus, so the traditional method has been to destroy products and kill the poultry, said Diel, of Cornell.\n\nAmong dairy cows, milk from animals suspected or confirmed to have the virus is being removed from human food supplies. However, even if milk from infected cows makes it to the commercial milk supply, pasteurization effectively inactivates bacteria and viruses, including influenza, according to a March 29 joint news release from the CDC, USDA and the Food and Drug Administration. In addition to protecting against bird flu, pasteurization is central to other health efforts. The FDA says that unpasteurized raw milk can have microorganisms dangerous to human health.\n\nDr. Meghan Davis, an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and a former dairy veterinarian, said it’s important to note differences among industries in poultry and cattle, and how the virus gets treated: Chicken culling, or killing, has been a steadfast way to curb disease spread, whereas this is a first for cattle, and it appears cows aren’t getting as sick.\n\nShe said people are at risk if they consume raw milk and cheese or live near an area with intensive dairy production.\n\nThe spread among cows is a red flag for public health officials and veterinary care professionals. But Davis said she was encouraged by the fact that the person with bird flu only had mild eye problems and the cows had mild symptoms.\n\n“If that’s the worst we see, then that’s good,” she said. “But we don’t yet know.\"\n\nHow can bird flu be stopped?\n\nThe latest developments are reminders for Americans to take standard precautions when storing, cooking and consuming food, said Darin Detwiler, a professor of food policy at Northeastern University, who has advised the USDA and FDA on food safety. The recommendations include frequent hand-washing when preparing food, properly cooking eggs and meat and reducing consumption of unpasteurized dairy products.\n\nDetwiler believes consumers should be proactive if they have concerns about outbreaks.\n\n\"That's our power as consumers that are stakeholders in this,\" he told USA TODAY. \"We don't have to wait until we're harmed to voice our support or concern over some of these issues.\"\n\nOther ways to avoid contracting bird flu include eliminating unprotected exposure to sick or dead animals, including wild birds, poultry or domesticated birds, or other sick or dead wild or domesticated animals. This includes contact with animal feces, waste, or materials contaminated by animals suspected or confirmed with bird flu.\n\nPeople working directly with animals who could be infected should wear personal protective equipment such as face masks – ideally approved particulate respirators such as N95 masks, as well as goggles, gloves, boots and boot covers. Additionally, they should use fluid-resistant coveralls and disposable head covers or hair covers.\n\nPeople who have spent time near animals confirmed or suspected of being sick should be monitored for signs and symptoms for 10 days after the exposure. This includes those who were wearing PPE.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/05/29/bird-flu-updates-iowa-infected-chickens-alpacas/73892743007/", "title": "Bird flu update: 4.2M Iowa chickens infected, flock to be culled", "text": "Bird flu outbreaks have continued across the U.S. as officials work to keep the spread at bay.\n\nThe virus has been detected in alpacas for the first time.\n\nThe CDC has documented two cases of human bird flu infections in 2024.\n\nBird flu outbreaks have continued across the U.S. as officials work to keep the spread at bay.\n\nWhile the outbreak likely began amongst chicken flocks and spread to dairy cows, reports of the virus infecting other animals have come out of several states. Two cases of the virus appearing in people have been reported despite ongoing testing, said the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and their symptoms were relieved by simple over-the-counter flu medication.\n\nCommercial farming facilities have taken to destroying infected flocks in an attempt to quell the ongoing spread. Even so, a new large-scale infection was reported in Iowa this week, impacting millions of egg-laying chickens.\n\nBird flu updates:CDC unveils dashboard to track bird flu as virus spreads among dairy farms\n\nMore than 4 million chickens set to be killed\n\nAn outbreak of bird flu was detected in Iowa on Tuesday in a commercial flock of 4.2 million chickens, according to the state Department of Agriculture.\n\nThe egg-laying flock, located in Sioux County, will be culled to prevent further spread. Since 2022, about 22.9 million birds from backyard flocks and commercial facilities have been destroyed to keep the virus at bay in Iowa, the nation's top egg producer, according to USDA data.\n\nBird flu infection found in alpacas for first time\n\nBesides the unusual spread to dairy cows in recent months, bird flu has been detected in other animals, including barn cats that were found dead at infected facilities. And now it's been found in alpacas.\n\nThe US Department of Agriculture’s National Veterinary Services Laboratories said Tuesday that a group of alpacas tested positive on May 16 on a farm in Idaho where poultry had previously tested positive and been destroyed.\n\nThis is the first known infection in alpacas, said the USDA.\n\nBird flu testing:Farmworkers face high-risk exposures to bird flu, but testing isn’t reaching them\n\nWhat is bird flu?\n\nBird flu, or avian flu, is a contagious infection that spreads among wild birds and can infect domestic poultry and other animal species. The virus does not often spread to humans but sporadic infections have been reported. There are several strains all belonging to influenza A-type viruses.\n\nThe most common subtypes that may affect humans are A (H5N1), A (H7N9) and A (H9N2), according to the Cleveland Clinic. In humans, symptoms can resemble a typical flu but may advance into more serious respiratory symptoms.\n\nIn birds, avian flu is highly contagious and cases can range in severity from mild to highly deadly. Infected birds shed the viruses in their saliva, nasal secretions and feces, meaning other birds can contract the virus through contact with those fluids directly or via contact with a contaminated surface.\n\nThe CDC has documented two cases of human bird flu infections in 2024, one in a Michigan dairy farm worker and one in a dairy farm worker from Texas. Both infected people showed only symptoms of conjunctivitis, or pink eye.\n\nBird flu virus outbreak in dairy cows\n\nThe current multi-state outbreak of bird flu in cattle likely began late last year.\n\nAt least 67 dairy cattle herds in nine states have been confirmed infected in nine states, including Colorado, Idaho, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio and South Dakota.\n\nIn late April, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced that dairy product testing had found remnants of the virus in one out of five commercial dairy samples but none that contained a live virus capable of transmitting the disease.\n\nAs long as people consume pasteurized dairy products and cook poultry products to a proper temperature, mass-produced products continue to be safe, the agency said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/environment/2022/02/17/turkeys-killed-bird-flu-indiana-farms-outbreak/6832786001/", "title": "Over 103,000 turkeys killed as bird flu outbreak spreads in Indiana", "text": "The highly lethal bird flu has now been found at a third farm in Indiana, and one that is much closer to Indianapolis.\n\nThe state announced Thursday that the virus showed up at a turkey farm southwest of Bloomington — meaning the outbreak has jumped a couple counties from where it was first detected and is growing.\n\nThe third farm, in Greene County, has approximately 48,000 turkeys that will be euthanized in an effort to contain the spread. That brings the total number of birds in Indiana destroyed because of the virus to more 103,000.\n\nThis is considered a presumptive-positive case at this time, according to the Indiana State Board of Animal Health. Samples are being verified at the U.S. Department of Agriculture's national veterinary lab in Iowa.\n\nBird flu: Indiana outbreak of virus grows, an additional 26,000 turkeys to be killed from virus\n\nThis does not present an immediate concern to public health, federal officials said, but it does have agriculture and industry folks worried about a larger outbreak.\n\nFarms are hoping to avoid a repeat of 2015 when an outbreak of bird flu killed 50 million birds across 15 states and cost the federal government nearly $1 billion. While Indiana escaped from that catastrophe, it has farmers and the industry on high alert.\n\nOfficials say they have learned a lot from the 2015 outbreak, which has been deemed the most expensive animal health disaster in U.S. history. Some countries have already restricted poultry meat and egg products from Indiana. Prices for poultry products could also rise and availability drop if birds at enough farms were to be infected.\n\nIndiana's outbreak started on Feb. 9, when the USDA reported the first confirmed case of the H5N1 strain of avian flu at a farm in Dubois County. It is a highly pathogenic strain, meaning it is lethal to all poultry that contract the disease. All turkeys at that farm — 29,000 — were euthanized to help control the spread.\n\nIt was the nation’s first confirmed case of the flu in a commercial operation since 2020 and six years since it was last found on farms in Indiana, when hundreds of thousands of birds were killed as a result.\n\nAs soon as the state received the first results Feb. 9, it issued a quarantine at the site and all those farms within a 10-kilometer radius primarily in Dubois County and a portion of northern Spencer County. That includes 17 other operations, said Denise Derrer Spears, spokeswoman for the state Board of Animal Health.\n\nThen earlier this week, the virus was detected at a second farm in Dubois near the first. The second affected farm was one of those within the control area and already under quarantine. It housed roughly 26,000 birds that have all been culled.\n\nWhile the virus was initially contained to Dubois County, this latest case has moved north. The names of the affected farms have not been publicly released.\n\nThis third flock was tested after seeing a high mortality rate among the turkeys.\n\nBecause the third farm is outside the existing control area in Dubois County, another 10-kilometer circle has been established in Greene County and a portion of Northern Daviess County. There are nine other commercial poultry operations within this new control area that are under quarantine and will be tested at least once per week.\n\nThat means there are a total of 28 commercial poultry farms in Indiana now under quarantine. They cannot bring birds in or move them out without extensive testing and a specific permit to do so.\n\nThe euthanized turkeys from the farms will be disposed of onsite by composting them, a method that is approved and overseen by state and federal agencies. The barns and all equipment also need to be thoroughly cleaned – “eat off the floor clean,” Derrer Spears said.\n\nOnce the cleaning is complete and the disposal has reached a certain stage, the quarantine will be lifted. There are many factors involved and there is no target date to do that. The state said it likely will be about four to six weeks.\n\nIt is unclear how these flocks were infected. The avian flu viruses are fairly common in wild migratory birds and waterfowl, according to Derrer Spears, and ducks and geese that contract the disease will spread it in their droppings as they fly by.\n\nIndiana is not the only state struggling with an outbreak of the virus.\n\nPoultry operations in Kentucky and Virginia were confirmed to have birds infected with the highly lethal form of avian flu just days after the first Indiana flock tested positive — raising worries about a wider outbreak across the country.\n\nThose infections occurred at a Tyson Foods commercial chicken operation in Kentucky with 240,000 birds and among a backyard flock of mixed species in Virginia.

More than 700 seals were found dead in December in the Caspian Sea, near to the site of a large outbreak of H5N1 in wild birds months earlier.\n\nHow does avian flu spread to mammals?\n\nIn the UK, the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) has tested 66 different species of mammals, and found four otters and five foxes were positive for avian flu.\n\nWhile there is currently no evidence that bird flu can spread from fox to fox or otter to otter, “genetic sequencing of the virus from an October 2022 outbreak on a mink farm in Spain suggests the animals were infected with a new variant of H5N1 that could spread between mink”, said New Scientist.\n\nMunir Iqbal, from the Pirbright Institute, told the magazine that more investigation is needed to confirm mammal-to-mammal transmission.\n\nIt has nevertheless “reignited long-smouldering fears that H5N1 could trigger a human pandemic”, said Science magazine.\n\nAre these fears well founded?\n\nHumans can catch bird flu. There have been six confirmed infections in the latest worldwide wave, including one death. But there is currently “no evidence that the virus can pass between humans”, the i news site said. The latest cases were all acquired “directly from close contact with poultry or other birds”.\n\n“Yet researchers are worried that if the H5N1 virus mutates to transmit between mammals, it could soon be able to jump between human hosts,” said the New Scientist.\n\nThe discovery of H5N1 in the two UK mammal species has triggered a move to more “targeted surveillance and testing of animals and humans exposed to the virus in the UK”, said the BBC.\n\nProf Ian Brown, APHA’s director of scientific services, told the broadcaster he was “acutely aware of the risks” of bird flu becoming a pandemic like Covid-19. “We do need globally to look at new strategies, those international partnerships, to get on top of this disease,” he said.\n\nMarion Koopmans, head of the department of virology at the Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam and a member of the World Health Organization team charged with tracing the origins of Covid, said: “We are playing with fire.”\n\nIf it can spread between mammals, there is an “opportunity for a virus from the risk list to pick up mutations which could make it transmissible between humans”, she said. “It didn’t happen this time, and it may not happen, but this is one of the scenarios from which a new pandemic could originate.”\n\nWhere did the new virus come from?\n\nBird flu, mostly of a mild kind, has always existed in birds, particularly migratory waterfowl such as geese and ducks (songbirds are largely unaffected). However, a new form of the H5N1 virus emerged in Asia in the 1990s in intensive poultry farms, an ideal viral breeding ground.\n\nThis was first detected in Guangdong province, southern China, in 1996, and spread to chicken farms in Hong Kong a year later, where it killed six people. In 2005, the virus caused a large outbreak among wild birds in Lake Qinghai in China, where nearly 200 migratory breeds congregated near large poultry farms.\n\nSince then, the virus has infected wild birds in Europe, the Middle East and North America, and now circulates the world most years, often infecting farmed birds. The latest outbreak hit the UK in October 2021.\n\nHow is the situation different this time?\n\nWith a reproduction number as high as 100 (each infected bird can infect about 100 others), the latest bout of H5N1 has spread exceptionally quickly. It is “highly pathogenic”: it causes respiratory problems and diarrhoea, and is often fatal.\n\nIn previous years, outbreaks in Britain have been caused by migratory waterbirds arriving from Europe and the Arctic in autumn and winter, bringing the virus with them; but outbreaks have historically fizzled out once those birds have left in the spring.\n\nThis time has been different. For the first time, H5N1 spread to Britain’s nonmigratory wild birds, possibly owing to a mutation in the virus. In particular, it has affected seabirds, which live in huge, dense colonies on Britain’s cliffs and islands, making it easy for the virus to take hold.\n\nWhat is the government doing?\n\nIn October, the Department of Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) imposed a bird flu “prevention zone” across the whole of Great Britain: free-range birds were to be kept within fenced areas, and other strict biosecurity measures were imposed. In November, Defra ordered all poultry and captive birds in England to be housed indoors; free-range eggs will be relabelled “barn-laid”. Those who have had to cull flocks are being compensated.\n\nBut some have criticised a lack of urgency in the official response. As bird flu spread through the Farne Islands last summer, for instance, not a single bird was tested for the virus. Guidance on collecting birds has been criticised as “patchy”, resulting in decaying corpses being left on the islands for weeks.", "authors": ["Arion Mcnicoll", "The Week Uk", "Last Updated", "Devika Rao", "The Week Us", "Becca Stanek", "Harriet Marsden", "Richard Windsor", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "The Week Staff"], "publish_date": "2022/11/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/03/26/bird-flu-milk-dairy-cattle-texas-kansas/73102761007/", "title": "Milk from sick dairy cattle in 2 states test positive for bird flu: What to ...", "text": "Sick dairy cattle in two central U.S. states have tested positive for bird flu, federal officials reported.\n\nAs of Monday, the highly contagious pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAI) had been found in unpasteurized clinical samples of milk from ill cows at two dairy farms in Kansas and one in Texas, plus a swab from a dairy cow in Texas, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced in a news release.\n\nThe agency said its officials, along with the Food and Drug Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state veterinary and public health authorities, were investigating an illness detected primarily in older dairy cows in those states, as well as in New Mexico.\n\nWild migratory birds are believed to be the source of the infection, the USDA wrote, and viral testing and epidemiologic efforts are continuing this week.\n\nAre manatees endangered?Here's the current conservation status of the marine mammal.\n\nFarms in Texas, Kansas report finding dead birds on properties\n\nAdditional testing took place Friday and over the weekend, the USDA reported, because farms have also reported finding dead wild birds on their properties.\n\nBased on findings from Texas, the agency wrote in the release, the detections appear to have been introduced by wild birds, and the commercial milk supply \"remains safe due to both federal animal health requirements and pasteurization.\"\n\nBird flu spread to humans is low risk, USDA says\n\nInitial testing by the National Veterinary Services Laboratories has not found changes to the virus that would make it more transmissible to humans, the USDA said, which means the risk to the public contracting the virus remains low for now.\n\nFederal and state agencies said they \"are moving quickly\" to conduct additional bird flu testing.\n\n\"The first detection of HPAI in dairy cattle in Texas and Kansas underscores the importance of adherence to biosecurity measures, vigilance in monitoring for disease, and immediately involving your veterinarian when something seems ‘off,’\" American Veterinary Medical Association president Dr. Rena Carlson said. \"A complete evaluation, including the collection and submission of laboratory samples and reporting to state animal health officials when appropriate, and in a timely fashion, are incredibly important.\"\n\nBird flu in Texas, Kansas affecting older dairy cows\n\nThe Texas Animal Health Commission confirmed the flu virus is the Type A H5N1 strain, known for decades to cause outbreaks in birds and to occasionally infect people.\n\nThe virus, the state agency said, is affecting older dairy cows in Texas and Kansas, as well as cattle in in New Mexico, causing symptoms including decreased lactation and low appetite.\n\nBreaking:Baltimore's Key Bridge collapses after ship collision; 2 rescued, search continues: Live updates\n\nWhat is bird flu?\n\nBird flu is a disease caused by a family of flu viruses primarily transmitted among birds.\n\nAvian influenza viruses, according to the CDC and USDA, are classified into two groups: low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) (often seen in wild birds) and HPAI, found mostly in domestic poultry. According to the Centers for Disease Control, LPAI viruses cause mild or no disease, and HPAI cause severe disease and high mortality rates in infected birds.\n\nBird flu has cost the government roughly $660 million and in recent times raised the price of eggs and poultry. At least 58 million birds were slaughtered last year to limit the spread of the virus.\n\nWhat are signs of bird flu?\n\nSymptoms of bird flu include:\n\nLoss of appetite, lethargy.\n\nDeath without prior symptoms.\n\nEyelid swelling.\n\nTwisting of the head and neck.\n\nPurple discoloration to body parts, including legs.\n\n'No concern' about commercial milk supply safety\n\n\"At this stage,\" the USDA wrote, there is \"no concern about the safety of the commercial milk supply or that this circumstance poses a risk to consumer health.\"\n\nDairies are required to send milk from healthy animals into processing before it can be put on grocery shelves, the agency said, and the milk from the sick animals was being destroyed.\n\nIn addition, USDA officials said, pasteurization \"has continually proven to inactivate bacteria and viruses,\" including influenza, in milk.\n\nIt's also required for milk entering interstate commerce.\n\n\"For the dairies whose herds are exhibiting symptoms, on average about ten percent of each affected herd appears to be impacted, with little to no associated mortality reported among the animals,\" the USDA wrote in its release. \"Milk loss resulting from symptomatic cattle to date is too limited to have a major impact on supply and there should be no impact on the price of milk or other dairy products.\"\n\nNatalie Neysa Alund is a senior reporter for USA TODAY.

Where other coaches avoided the press or muttered platitudes, the longtime Florida State coach, who died Sunday at age 91, embraced every chance to talk with reporters and prided himself on saying something interesting.\n\nHe let reporters in the locker room during halftime talks, wore television microphones during big games and rarely encountered a question that he felt deserved \"no comment.\"\n\nHe disarmed critics with such frank postgame admissions as \"We out-slopped the world today.\" He filled notebooks with quips, such as “If short hair and good manners won football games, Army and Navy would play for the national championship every year.”\n\nThe result? Even the most hardened reporters adored Bowden, and not coincidentally he received almost uniformly good press.\n\n\"We’re in the selling business.

In 2006, his youngest son, Jeff, resigned in the face of mounting criticism after seven seasons as FSU offensive coordinator.\n\nFor a brief period after Steve’s conviction, Bowden stopped talking to the media and closed the FSU locker room after games. Even after he resumed talking to the media, he was curt with reporters he felt were unfair to him, and he was rumored to be behind the firing of FSU radio commentator and former FSU quarterback Peter Tom Willis, who had described the Jeff Bowden-led offense as a “high school offense.”\n\n“I think the (media) profession has gotten a bit out (of) line,” Bowden said of his new attitude toward the media.\n\nBowden particularly opposed Jeff’s resignation, which he believed had been forced by the media, who he said, “were listening to eBay, email and all that junk.” He reportedly ponied up a portion of Jeff’s severance package of $537,000 over five years.\n\n‘‘It’s just amazing,’’ Bobby Bowden said. ‘‘When things go wrong the first thing they blame is the offensive coordinator.

Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThe biggest differences between the film and book versions of 'Leave The World Behind'\n\nAlam's novel is anchored to a mysterious blackout in New York City that causes George, or G.H. (Ali), and Ruth (Myha'la) to go back to their fancy home on Long Island, which Amanda (Roberts) and her family have rented.\n\nEsmail says he has long been fascinated with cyberattacks (\"they're out there and they're mystifying\") and decided to weave that into his movie as an added layer, which results in eerily garbled smartphone news alerts and other discomfiting plot points.\n\nBut the biggest change was made to the character of Ruth, who in the book is G.H.'s wife. In the movie, Ruth is now his snarling daughter. \"Because this subject of alienation is so timely, I felt we needed that Gen Z and millennial point of view, not just for her commentary on the crisis but also for the friction with Amanda,\" he says.\n\nImagine Julia Roberts as unpleasant and racist and you have her 'Leave The World Behind' character\n\nAmanda's unrelenting suspicion of G.H. and Ruth keeps the movie on a perpetual boil. But the motivations behind her sentiments can be seen two ways, at times unflinchingly racist (how can these Black people be the owners of this ultra-fancy vacation home, she suggests) and in others borderline reasonable (why are these strangers showing up at our door at nearly midnight claiming there's a blackout?).\n\nRoberts walks that tightrope delicately, as Esmail had hoped. \"She was my only choice for this role,\" he says. \"Julia is the Michael Jordan of actors, so why not go to M.J. if you need to pull off something insane like this movie. Amanda is so prickly and so flawed, so you need great talent but also that undeniable charm for the audience to stay with her.\n\n\"I think her America’s Sweetheart persona is why this was exciting,\" he continues. \"After test screenings, some people said they could see her (character's) point of view about not wanting to let these strangers in so late.\"\n\nYes, Barack Obama really gave notes for scenes in 'Leave The World Behind'\n\nEsmail says Obama did leverage his White House years in helping fine-tune some of the technological disaster elements of the film, reassuring the director that some of the more dystopian implications of his movie were less than likely.\n\nInstead, Esmail says, Obama spent most of his time drilling down on the character interactions that crumble away during the crisis.\n\n\"Here we have one of the most brilliant minds on the planet making sure we kept focusing on this cautionary tale about mistrust,\" he says. \"He's a movie lover and a fan of the book, so what he really wanted to emphasize with me was hitting on this point about how lack of empathy that can happen in a crisis and what that means for us all.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/trump-2024-presidential-bid/index.html", "title": "Donald Trump announces a White House bid for 2024 | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, aiming to become only the second commander-in-chief ever elected to two nonconsecutive terms, announced Tuesday night that he will seek the Republican presidential nomination in 2024.\n\n“In order to make America great and glorious again, I am tonight announcing my candidacy for president of the United States,” Trump told a crowd gathered at Mar-a-Lago, his waterfront estate in Florida, where his campaign will be headquartered.\n\nSurrounded by allies, advisers, and conservative influencers, Trump delivered a relatively subdued speech, rife with spurious and exaggerated claims about his four years in office. Despite a historically divisive presidency and his own role in inciting an attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, Trump aimed to evoke nostalgia for his time in office, frequently contrasting his first-term accomplishments with the Biden administration’s policies and the current economic climate. Many of those perceived accomplishments – from strict immigration actions to corporate tax cuts and religious freedom initiatives – remain deeply polarizing to this day.\n\nAs Trump spoke to a roomful of Republicans who expect him to face primary challengers in the coming months, he also claimed the party cannot afford to nominate “a politician or conventional candidate” if it wants to win back the White House.\n\n“This will not be my campaign, this will be our campaign all together,” Trump said.\n\nTrump’s long-awaited campaign comes as he tries to reclaim the spotlight following the GOP’s underwhelming midterm elections performance – including the losses of several Trump-endorsed election deniers – and the subsequent blame game that has unfolded since Election Day. Republicans failed to gain a Senate majority, came up short in their efforts to fill several statewide seats, and have yet to secure a House majority, with only 215 races called in their favor so far out of the 218 needed, developments that have forced Trump and other party leaders into a defensive posture as they face reproval from within their ranks.\n\nTrump’s paperwork establishing his candidacy landed with the Federal Election Committee shortly before he delivered his announcement at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTo the delight of aides and allies who have long advised him to mount a forward-looking campaign, he spent only a fraction of his remarks repeating his lies about the 2020 election. Though he advocated for the use of paper ballots and likened America’s election system to that of “third world countries,” Trump also tried at times to broaden his grievances – lamenting the “massive corruption” and “entrenched interests” that in his view have consumed Washington. Many of Trump’s top advisers have expressed concern that his fixation on promoting conspiracies about the last presidential election would make it harder for him to win a national election in 2024.\n\nThroughout the hour-long speech, Trump made clear that he wants his campaign to be seen by Republicans as a sacrificial undertaking.\n\n“Anyone who truly seeks to take on this rigged and corrupt system will be faced with a storm of fire that only a few could understand,” he said at one point, describing the legal and emotional toll his presidency and post-presidential period has taken on his family members.\n\nOn the heels of last week’s midterm elections, Trump has been blamed for elevating flawed candidates who spent too much time parroting his claims about election fraud, alienating key voters and ultimately leading to their defeats. He attempted to counter that criticism on Tuesday, noting that Republicans appear poised to retake the House majority and touting at least one Trump-endorsed candidate, Kevin Kiley of California. At one point, Trump appeared to blame his party’s midterm performance on voters not yet realizing “the total effect of the suffering” after two years of Democratic control in Washington.\n\n“I have no doubt that by 2024, it will sadly be much worse and they will see clearly what has happened and is happening to our country – and the voting will be much different,” he claimed.\n\nBeating others to the punch\n\nTrump is betting that his first-out-of-the gate strategy will fend off potential primary rivals and give him an early advantage with deep-pocketed donors, aides say. He is widely expected to be challenged by both conservative and moderate Republicans, though the calculus of some presidential hopefuls could change now that he is running. Others – like his former Vice President, Mike Pence – may proceed anyway.\n\nTrump’s third presidential bid also coincides with a period of heightened legal peril as Justice Department officials investigating him and his associates revisit the prospect of indictments in their Trump-related probes. The former president is currently being investigated for his activities before and during the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and his retention of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate after he left office. While Trump is counting on an easy path to the GOP nomination with his sustained support among the party’s base, his announcement is likely to dash the hopes of party leaders who have longed for fresh talent. In particular, top Republicans have been paying close attention to the next moves of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who won his reelection contest with a 19-point margin of victory and considerable support from minority and independent voters. Some Republican leaders may try to scuttle Trump’s campaign by elevating or encouraging alternative candidates, including DeSantis, who has been quietly laying the groundwork for a possible White House bid of his own.\n\nOf course, any countereffort to inhibit Trump’s path to the nomination is likely to prove difficult. Despite his myriad legal entanglements and the stain of January 6, the twice-impeached 45th president remains immensely popular among most Republican voters and boasts a deep connection with his core backers that could prove difficult for other GOP hopefuls to replicate or weaken. Even leading conservatives who disliked Trump’s pugnacious politics and heterodox policies stuck with him as president because he helped solidify the rightward shift of the US Supreme Court with his nominations – one of the most far-reaching aspects of his legacy, which resulted in the conservative court majority’s deeply polarizing June decision to end federal abortion rights. In fact, while Trump ended his first term with the lowest approval rating of any president, Republicans viewed him favorably, according to a May NBC News poll. That alone could give Trump a significant edge over primary opponents whom voters are still familiarizing themselves with.\n\nAmong those potential competitors is Pence, who would likely benefit from high name recognition due to his role as vice president. Pence, who has been preparing for a possible White House run in 2024, is sure to face an uphill battle courting Trump’s most loyal supporters, many of whom soured on the former vice president after he declined to overstep his congressional authority and block certification of now-President Joe Biden’s 2020 victory. Trump could also find himself pitted against DeSantis, who has risen to hero status among cultural conservatives and who is widely considered a more polished version of Trump. Even some of the former president’s advisers have voiced similar observations to CNN, noting that DeSantis also made inroads with major Republican donors during his quest for reelection and built a mountain of goodwill with GOP leaders by campaigning for federal and statewide Republican candidates in the middle of his own race.\n\nBeyond his potential rivals, Trump has another roadblock in his path as the House select committee continues to investigate his role in January 6, 2021, and Justice Department officials weigh whether to issue criminal charges. The committee, which subpoenaed him for testimony and documents in October and which Trump is now battling in court, held public hearings throughout the summer and early fall featuring depositions from those in Trump’s inner circle at the White House – including members of his family – that detailed his public and private efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results through a sustained pressure campaign on numerous local, state and federal officials, and on his own vice president.\n\nBut Trump’s desire to announce his campaign early can be especially traced to the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, which advisers say further emboldened his decision to mount what he believes will be a triumphant political comeback. The day after the search, the former president fielded calls from allies advising him to accelerate his 2024 timeline. That night, he huddled with House lawmakers in the Republican Study Committee and told them he’d “made up his mind” about launching a bid, though some of those same House Republicans later convinced him to wait until after the midterm elections to announce his next move.\n\nFew of those lawmakers were present for Trump’s speech on Tuesday, choosing to remain in Washington as House Republicans conducted their leadership elections and the party continues to grapple with its failures in highly prized midterm races. Rather, the room was filled with prominent election deniers like MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, several of Trump’s attorneys, and past and present aides. Before he entered the room on Tuesday alongside former first lady Melania Trump, several members of the ex-president’s family were also seen filtering into the ballroom, including Eric and Lara Trump, his son Barron, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is engaged to Donald Trump Jr. His eldest son was notably missing, along with daughter Ivanka, , who has since said she will no longer be involved in the political arena. A source close to Donald Trump Jr. said he was stuck on a hunting trip in the mountain west and unable to catch a flight back to Florida in time for his father’s announcement. Other guests included longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone; outgoing North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn; former congressman and the current CEO of Trump’s Truth Social app Devin Nunes; and his chief political adviser Susie Wiles.\n\nPreparing for 2024\n\nFrom the moment Trump left Washington, defeated and disgraced, in January 2021, he began plotting a return to power – devoting the bulk of his time to building a political operation intended for this moment. With assistance from numerous former aides and advisers, he continued the aggressive fundraising tactics that had become a marker of his 2020 campaign, amassing a colossal war chest ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, and worked diligently to elect steadfast allies in both Congress and state legislatures across the country.\n\nWhile maintaining a home base in Florida, he also regularly jet-setted across the country for campaign rallies that afforded him crucial face time with his base and with candidates he bet would become valuable allies in the US Senate and House.\n\nThrough it all, Trump continued to falsely insist that the 2020 election was stolen from him, indulging in far-flung conspiracy theories about voter fraud and pressuring Republican leaders across the party’s election apparatus to endorse changes that would curtail voting rights.\n\nTrump’s aides were pleased earlier this fall when his public appearances and rally speeches gradually became more focused on rising crime, immigration and economic woes – key themes throughout the midterm cycle and issues they hope will enable him to draw a compelling contrast with Biden as he begins this next chapter. Allies of the former president have long said that he views the 2024 contest as an opportunity to regain what he believes is his: another four years in the Oval Office.\n\nBut there is no guarantee that Trump will glide easily to a nonconsecutive second term. In fact, it could be quite difficult.\n\nNot only does history offer just one example of such a feat (defeated in 1888 after his first term, President Grover Cleveland was elected again in 1892), no previously impeached president has ever run again for office. Trump was first impeached in 2019 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of justice, and then again in 2021 for inciting the riot at the US Capitol. Though he was acquitted by the Senate both times, 10 House Republicans broke with their party the second time around to join Democrats in a vote to impeach him. Seven Republican senators voted to convict him at his Senate trial.\n\nTrump has also been the subject of a bevy of lawsuits and investigations, including a New York state investigation and a separate Manhattan district attorney criminal probe into his company’s finances, a Georgia county probe into his efforts to overturn Biden’s election win in the state, and separate Justice Department probes into his campaign’s scheme to put forth fake electors in battleground states and his decision to bring classified materials with him to Mar-a-Lago upon leaving office.\n\nTrump’s actions since he left Washington have, for the most part, signaled his interest in an eventual return. While most former presidents go quietly into retirement – resurfacing to assist their parties during midterm cycles or for the opening of their presidential libraries – Trump bucked tradition to instead plot the comeback he now hopes to make. Despite its distance from Washington, Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club has transformed into a new hub for Republicans and a home base for his political machine. Assisted by a small group of paid staffers, he has hosted numerous candidate and committee fundraisers and seen a rotating cast of party leaders and congressional hopefuls filter through its gilded hallways in the hopes of nabbing his endorsement or reingratiating themselves with his base. Trump’s schedule has enabled him to build close relationships with party leaders and fringe figures – from House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy of California to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia – whose support in a contested primary could ultimately help him clear the field. Many of the aides who have been with him since he left the White House are expected to continue on as campaign hands, as the former president and his de facto chief of staff, longtime Florida GOP strategist Wiles, aim to maintain a lean operation much like the early days of his 2016 presidential campaign. Among those who are likely to be involved are Wiles, Taylor Budowich, Chris LaCivita, Steven Cheung, Justin Caporale and Brian Jack. Brad Parscale, who managed part of Trump’s failed 2020 campaign will not be part of his 2024 operation, nor will Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who was deeply involved in his quest for reelection.\n\nTime in office\n\nAs president, Trump faced criticism over several of his actions, especially his management of the worst public health crisis in nearly a century – the Covid-19 pandemic – though his administration helped facilitate the development of vaccines to treat the novel coronavirus in record time. He also was blasted by critics over his handling of Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico in 2017; the White nationalist rally, also in 2017, in Charlottesville, Virginia, where Heather Heyer was killed while walking with a group of counterprotesters; and Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nWhile in office, Trump signed sweeping tax cuts into law, enacted controversial hard-line immigration policies, including a policy that separated migrant children from their families and one known as “Remain in Mexico,” which the US Supreme Court ruled in June could be ended by his successor, and appointed hundreds of federal judges with deep conservative credentials. He also successfully nominated three Supreme Court justices, whose decisions this year as part of the court’s majority have shifted American society and laws rightward on issues such as abortion, guns, religious freedom and climate change.\n\nThe former real estate businessman and reality TV star was first elected to office in 2016, beating out a wide field of more than a dozen GOP candidates in an ugly primary, and then prevailing over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a contentious general election, despite sexual misconduct allegations that would have typically been campaign-ending.\n\nAs president, Trump was an impulsive leader, who dispensed with long-standing norms, often announcing policy and Cabinet personnel changes on Twitter. (He was ultimately banned from the platform following the US Capitol riot and was later barred from Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube as well.)\n\nHe pushed an “America First” foreign policy approach, pulling the US out of international agreements such as the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal, a pair of controversial moves that were decried by many of America’s top European allies.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story mistakenly said who was likely to be involved in the Trump campaign.

And for a whole year now, the insurrection itself has been lied about.\n\nDonald Trump supporters’ violent attack on the Capitol has been the subject of a dishonesty campaign that began amid the fog of January 6 and escalated even as the facts became clearer. Trump, some right-wing media figures and some Republican members of Congress have mounted a sustained effort to rewrite the history of that deadly day.\n\nThey have falsely claimed all of the rioters were unarmed. They have falsely claimed the people at the Capitol merely held a “protest” against an election they falsely claimed was fraudulent. They have falsely claimed the rioters were welcomed into the Capitol by police officers.\n\nThey have falsely claimed the riot was orchestrated by left-wing groups or the FBI. And they have falsely claimed nonviolent rioters are being jailed as “political prisoners.”\n\nHere is a fact check of five of the most enduring lies about January 6.\n\nLie: The rioters were completely unarmed\n\nTrump and some of his allies continue to claim that all of the people at the Capitol on January 6 were unarmed.\n\nIn a December 21 statement, Trump called January 6 a “completely unarmed protest.” Similarly, in a tweet on December 17, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia wrote, “One of the biggest holes in the lie about J6 being a planned insurrection is that all the people there were unarmed. Anyone with half a brain knows that gun owners only leave their firearms at home when they don’t feel the need to carry a gun or are obeying the law.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that all of the people at the Capitol on January 6 were unarmed – and the claim is still false even if it is specifically about guns. People who illegally entered Capitol grounds during the insurrection were armed with a wide variety of weapons, including guns, stun guns, knives, batons, baseball bats, axes and chemical sprays. The Department of Justice said in an official update last week that so far “over 75” people charged in connection to the attack “have been charged with entering a restricted area with a dangerous or deadly weapon.”\n\nWe may never get a complete inventory of the concealed weapons the rioters possessed on January 6, since nearly all of the rioters were able to leave the Capitol without being detained and searched. But prosecutors have alleged that some of the people present at the Capitol were armed with guns, as were some other Trump supporters who traveled to Washington for January 6.\n\nMark Mazza of Indiana has been charged with crimes including possession of a firearm on Capitol grounds; he has pleaded not guilty. According to the Capitol Police, Mazza accidentally dropped his loaded revolver during a struggle with police on a Capitol terrace. He allegedly told investigators later that if he had visited House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that day, “you’d be here for another reason.”\n\nGuy Reffitt of Texas has been charged with crimes including illegally carrying a semi-automatic handgun on Capitol grounds; he has pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors allege Reffitt “specifically targeted at least two lawmakers – the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, and then-Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell – whom he sought to physically remove or displace from the Capitol building.” And police allege Christopher Alberts of Maryland was arrested trying to flee Capitol grounds on January 6 with a loaded pistol; he has pleaded not guilty.\n\nMark Ibrahim, who was an off-duty special agent for the Drug Enforcement Administration at the time of the riot, has been charged with crimes including carrying a firearm on Capitol grounds. Ibrahim, who has said he was later fired by the DEA (the DEA would confirm to CNN only that he no longer works there), was photographed that day displaying what appeared to be a handgun. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn addition, Lonnie Coffman of Alabama, who pleaded guilty to weapons charges in November, admitted that he had carried two loaded pistols in Washington on January 6 and that a truck he had parked blocks from the Capitol contained additional loaded guns, Molotov cocktails and other weapons. Cleveland Meredith Jr., who pleaded guilty to threatening to kill Pelosi and was sentenced to 28 months in prison, drove from Colorado to Washington with a rifle and handgun that were found in his trailer outside a Washington hotel. The FBI said Meredith had told agents he had tried to get to Washington on January 5 but ended up arriving late on January 6.\n\nLie: The rioters were merely protesting a ‘rigged’ election\n\nTrump called on his supporters to come to Washington on January 6 for a “wild” protest against President Joe Biden’s victory, which Trump falsely claimed was fraudulent. During his rally speech on the morning of January 6, Trump pushed that election lie, directed supporters to march to the Capitol and urged them to “fight like hell.”\n\nAfter the insurrection, Trump continued to repeat the election lie for months – and adapted it to minimize what had happened at the Capitol. In an October statement, he claimed that the “real insurrection” was the 2020 election and January 6 was simply a “day of protesting.” (He also made similar claims later in the year.)\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are obvious lies. The election wasn’t rigged and wasn’t fraudulent; Biden won fair and square; there was a tiny smattering of voter fraud that was nowhere near widespread enough to have changed the outcome in any state, let alone to have reversed Biden’s 306-232 victory in the Electoral College. And the insurrection of January 6 – in which approximately 140 police officers were assaulted and the peaceful transfer of power was violently interrupted – involved thousands of alleged crimes; it was, very clearly, no mere protest.\n\n“This was not a peaceful protest. Hundreds of people came to Washington, DC, to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power,” Chief Judge Beryl Howell of the DC District Court said last January. Howell added in October: “The rioters attacking the US Capitol on January 6th, as part of a large mob, were not mere trespassers engaging in protected First Amendment protests; they were certainly not tourists. And I say that again and again because there still seems, in some areas, to be a debate about that issue.”\n\nLie: The rioters were invited into the Capitol by police\n\nA common refrain from January 6 rioters, and some of their Republican defenders, is that they were welcomed into the Capitol by police officers.\n\nTrump said in a book interview in March that “the Capitol Police were ushering people in” and “the Capitol Police were very friendly. You know, they were hugging and kissing.” The claim has been echoed by Trump supporters. For example, Trump-endorsed Republican Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake declared at a Trump rally in October that the people being held in jail over the Capitol attack “were invited in by Capitol Police.”\n\nFacts First: The claim that the rioters were invited into the Capitol is false. Again, about 140 police officers were assaulted while trying to stop the mob from breaching the Capitol. There were hours-long battles between police and rioters near some entrances. CNN obtained footage from police body-worn cameras showing how dozens of officers engaged in hand-to-hand combat with rioters in a desperate effort to keep them out of the building.\n\nRioters inside the Capitol after breaching barricades on Jan. 6, 2021. Victor J. Blue/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThere are plenty of instances where rioters waltzed into the Capitol without a fight, but only after they had stormed past barricades and, in some cases, even stepped through broken windows. In some areas, police were so outnumbered by the mob that they retreated, stood aside or tried to politely engage with rioters to de-escalate the situation rather than fighting or making arrests, but that is clearly not the same as welcoming rioters into the building.\n\nSince we don’t have video of every single encounter between police and rioters, it’s theoretically possible that some tiny number of officers did invite rioters in. The Capitol Police announced in September that three officers were facing discipline for unspecified noncriminal “conduct unbecoming” that day, while three others were facing discipline for other policy violations.\n\nBut no evidence has publicly emerged to date of even one officer inviting a rioter into the Capitol. And even if a few isolated incidents emerge in the future, it’s clear that this was not a widespread or systemic occurrence as Trump and others suggested.\n\nCapitol Police Chief Tom Manger said on CNN in September: “The officers that we have investigated and disciplined, the cases that we investigated, they run from minor infractions to officers making very poor judgments for more serious misconduct. But this notion that the Capitol Police were somehow allowing these folks into the Capitol, inviting them in, helping them, just simply not true.”\n\nLie: The jailed rioters are nonviolent political prisoners\n\nOne of the most prevalent counternarratives about January 6 is that a large number of nonviolent people who were present at the Capitol are being unfairly prosecuted by liberal zealots at the Justice Department, and that these nonviolent people have now become “political prisoners” while awaiting trial in jail. Such claims have emerged as a rallying cry among a small but vocal cohort of Trump loyalists in the House Republican conference.\n\nArizona Rep. Paul Gosar claimed in July that jailed rioters who had supposedly spent time in solitary confinement “are not unruly or dangerous, violent criminals” but are “political prisoners who are now being persecuted”; he suggested that there are “nearly 200” nonviolent Capitol participants behind bars. And the pro-Trump group behind September’s “Justice for J6” rally said its event was meant “to bring awareness and attention to the unjust and unethical treatment of nonviolent January 6 political prisoners.”\n\nFacts First: This “political prisoners” narrative is false. The vast majority of the 700-plus people charged in the Capitol riot to date were released shortly after their arrests. Only a few dozen were ordered by judges to remain in jail before trial, and most of those defendants were charged with attacking police or conspiring with far-right militia groups.\n\nIt’s true that the conditions are poor at the Washington jail where incarcerated rioters are being held. And it’s obviously unpleasant for anyone to live behind bars. But the small subset of January 6 defendants who are currently in jail are there only because a federal judge ruled that they are either too dangerous to release or pose a flight risk. The decision to keep them incarcerated was not made by Biden’s political appointees or any other Justice Department officials.\n\nA few rioters have claimed in court that they are the victims of politically motivated prosecution because they support Trump. Federal judges, including those appointed by Trump, have rejected these arguments.\n\nLie: January 6 was a false flag attack\n\nBefore the Capitol was even cleared of rioters on January 6, some prominent Trump supporters started to try to deflect blame – claiming that left-wing Antifa, a loose collection of self-described anti-fascists, was actually behind the violence.\n\nSuch “false flag” theories – that the violence was secretly orchestrated by Trump’s opponents in an attempt to make Trump look bad – never went away. And the theories have expanded to include claims that the violence was orchestrated by the Black Lives Matter movement or even by an arm of the federal government itself, the FBI.\n\nFox News host Tucker Carlson has promoted false flag theories, focusing on the FBI, both in his own remarks and in his revisionist documentary series on a Fox streaming service in November. Carlson has claimed on his show that government documents showed that “FBI operatives were organizing the attack on the Capitol on January 6.” Former Army Capt. Emily Rainey said in the documentary (and in a trailer Carlson tweeted out): “It is my opinion that false flags have happened in this country, one of which may have been January 6.”\n\nAnd Trump himself has given oxygen to the theories, claiming in a December interview with ring-wing commentator Candace Owens, “You have BLM and you had Antifa people, I have very little doubt about that, and they were antagonizing and they were agitating.”\n\nFacts First: The insurrection at the Capitol was not a false flag. Just as it looked on January 6, a mob of diehard Trump supporters stormed the building. They did so after Trump urged supporters to come to Washington and then, as we noted above, made a speech urging them to “fight like hell” and to march to the Capitol. The rioters’ allegiance to Trump has been exhaustively documented in court proceedings and in their social media posts and media interviews.\n\nThough there are thousands of pages of court documents stemming from criminal cases against January 6 rioters, no Capitol riot defendant as of the end of 2021 had any confirmed involvement in Antifa or Black Lives Matter groups. (One defendant who filmed the riot had expressed support for Black Lives Matter but was disavowed in 2020 by BLM activists, some of whom suspected he was a provocateur connected to the political right.) By contrast, hundreds of Capitol riot defendants were confirmed to be Trump supporters – and some were members of far-right extremist groups. Members of the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys have been charged with conspiracy regarding January 6; some have pleaded guilty.\n\nCarlson wrongly described the court documents he inaccurately claimed were a smoking gun about FBI operatives organizing the attack; you can read more about that claim here. While it is entirely possible that some of the Capitol rioters were secretly serving as informants for the FBI – The New York Times reported in October that a member of the Proud Boys who had entered the Capitol on January 6 was an FBI informant – the presence of a few FBI informants among the estimated 2,000-plus people who illegally breached the Capitol would not make the entire mob assault an FBI-orchestrated “false flag” operation.\n\nRepublican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, vice chair of the House select committee investigating the insurrection, said on Fox News in November that there is no truth to claims that January 6 was a false flag perpetrated by “deep state” liberals trying to set up Trump supporters.\n\n“It’s the same kind of thing that you hear from people who say that 9/11 was an inside job, for example.

McMillan – who served two terms as state agriculture commissioner and is a former commissioner of the state Department of Conservation and Natural Resources – told the news outlet he expects to accept the job, which would require him to resign as state treasurer. Al.com reports Commission Vice Chair Rex Vaughn said he has been in discussions with lawmakers about moving up the start date for licensing cultivators from Sept. 1, 2022 to early 2022. The time required to grow the plants, which will be raised in greenhouses, is 90 to 110 days. The 14-member commission oversees a new agency that will license and regulate cultivators, processors, secure transporters, testing laboratories and dispensaries of medical marijuana products. It will be a seed-to-sale intrastate program, with products made from plants grown in Alabama. A special legislative session is expected this fall on redistricting. Another might be held on prison construction.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Gov. Mike Dunleavy said President Joe Biden’s push to require millions of U.S. workers to get vaccinated against COVID-19 is “ill conceived, divisive and un-American.” “At a time in which we are called to work together, forced medical procedures run counter to our collective sense of fairness and liberty,” the Republican governor said Friday. Biden on Thursday outlined plans to mandate that employers with more than 100 workers require their employees to be vaccinated or tested for the coronavirus weekly. When asked Friday about critics who might sue over the plan, Biden said: “Have at it.” Dunleavy has faced some criticism for not issuing a statewide mask mandate and for not implementing a new disaster declaration to deal with a recent surge in COVID-19 cases. He has instead asked lawmakers to act on legislation intended to address staffing concerns raised by health care facilities. In a letter to legislative leaders this month, he said the virus is now “endemic,” and his administration is “adapting and proposing changes that make the response to the challenge more durable, and not subject to the whims of 30-day proclamations or health orders.” Still, in his statement, Dunleavy said it is “clear from the data and empirical evidence over the last year that the vaccine is the most effective way to fight COVID-19.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state has sold off $93 million in Unilever bonds and plans to sell the remaining $50 million it has invested in the global consumer products company over subsidiary Ben & Jerry’s decision to stop selling its ice cream in Israeli-occupied territories, the latest in a series of actions by states with anti-Israel boycott laws. The investment moves state Treasurer Kimberly Yee announced last week were mandated by a 2019 state law that bars Arizona government agencies from holding investments or doing more than $100,000 in business with any firm that boycotts Israel or its territories. Arizona appears to be the first of 35 states with anti-boycott laws or regulation to have fully divested itself from Unilever following Ben & Jerry’s actions. While Ben & Jerry’s, based in Vermont, is owned by London-based Unilever, it maintains its own independent board, which Unilever said makes its own decision on its social mission. Ben & Jerry’s announced July 19 that maintaining its presence in the occupied territories was “inconsistent with our values.” The Arizona law enacted in 2016 and revised in 2019 had broad, bipartisan support and was signed by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey. He tweeted that the Ben & Jerry’s decision “is discrimination.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: An appeals court has reversed a lower court judge’s order that the city must reinstate a police officer who was fired for fatally shooting a Black motorist. The Arkansas Court of Appeals panel on Wednesday reversed Pulaski County Circuit Judge Tim Fox’s decision last year regarding the firing of former Officer Charles Starks over the fatal shooting of Bradley Blackshire. Starks fired his gun at least 15 times through the windshield of a car Blackshire was driving in February 2019. Fox reversed the Little Rock Civil Service Commission’s decision to uphold Starks’ firing and instead imposed a 30-day suspension and reduction in salary. Starks resigned in September and accused the police chief of making his working conditions “intolerable” after his reinstatement. Starks pulled over Blackshire because the car he was driving had been reported stolen, though Blackshire’s family has said he borrowed it from a friend. Surveillance and dashcam footage showed that Starks instructed Blackshire to exit the parked car. Instead, Blackshire began to slowly drive away and bumped Starks, who fired into the windshield four times. The car briefly stopped, and Starks got onto its hood and fired at least 11 more times into the car as it continued to move.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: State lawmakers have approved what advocacy groups say are the nation’s strongest protections against falsely labeling items as recyclable when they in fact are destined for landfills. The measure sent late Thursday to Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom for his consideration would reserve the “chasing arrows” recycling symbol for items that actually can be recycled. The bill’s author, Democratic Sen. Ben Allen, said in a statement that it will force truth in advertising and “will reduce contamination in the recycling stream and improve the sorting process, thereby saving cities and ratepayers money while empowering consumers to make more informed decisions.” It’s among efforts in several states to ease confusion about recycling and increase recycling efforts. A Consumer Brands Association report recently asserted that confusion has led to “a broken recycling system in America.” A coalition of 14 opposition groups countered that the bill would have “resounding impacts” on the state’s goal to divert 75% of trash from landfills and hinder efforts to recycle packaging. The bill would likely require regulators to create a list of eligible items that “is extremely limiting,” potentially including just 15, the groups said – eight types of paper materials, two forms of glass, two types of metals, two types of plastics and one type of colored plastic.\n\nColorado\n\nGolden: Security workers will accompany nurses and staff members of Jefferson County Public Health’s three mobile vaccine units for the foreseeable future after months of harassment and abuse. One weekend this month, the agency was forced to pull vans off the street after a driver in Gilpin County, which contracts Jefferson County’s health agency, drove toward and destroyed signage around the van. Others “verbally abused” staff members Sept. 4, said Dr. Dawn Comstock, the agency’s executive director. These types of attacks have been going on for months, she said, but they’ve escalated to a higher degree. For instance, last month someone threw live fireworks into a tent of nurses and staff members, the Gazette reports. Despite the ongoing barrage of attacks and harassment, the county was still set to hold its COVID-19 vaccine events. “JCPH will not be intimidated out of its public health mission,” Comstock said. “We’ve arranged additional security measures to keep staff safe and will be working with our law enforcement partners to assure these handful of extremists are not allowed to infringe on the rights of those who want to be vaccinated.” Each incident has been reported to law enforcement, but each time the perpetrator has left the scene before officers arrived.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Tourism officials plan to spend more money than usual promoting the state’s fall foliage in an attempt help the industry rebound from the pandemic. Gov. Ned Lamont helped launch the $1.4 million “Full Color Connecticut” marketing campaign Friday, which he said will link leaf peeping to other attractions across the state. Tourism officials said the play on the fall colors is meant to highlight other colorful destinations in the state, “from the golds of corn mazes and the pinks of cotton candy to the blues of coastline sails and the ambers of craft beer.” The campaign’s budget is nearly triple the amount typically invested in a fall marketing program, officials said. It is designed to reach about 33% of the market in Connecticut, New York, Massachusetts and Rhode Island – compared to 10% in recent years – and expand into other markets, such as Philadelphia. The campaign also will take advantage of the state’s high COVID-19 vaccination rates, which tourism officials have said helped bring visitors to Connecticut this summer. The campaign will run through Nov. 20 and feature hundreds of tourism-related businesses, from the state’s parks and orchards to its casinos and shops.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Decades of structural defects and water damage have put a 30-year-old condominium complex at risk of collapse, but disagreements among condo owners over annual fees have prevented repairs from moving forward. “The buildings are deteriorating. We’ve been paying through the nose,” Michael “Mick” Donnelly said, comparing the situation at Le Parc, where he’s lived since 2009, to that of a condo that collapsed in June near Miami. “It’s been a nightmare situation similar to Surfside because the buildings are nearing condemnation and the people here don’t deserve it.” The fatal collapse of the 12-story condominium complex in Surfside, Florida, put many Le Parc residents on edge. Most of the issues found to have contributed to the collapse of the over 130-unit Champlain Towers South on June 24 mirror long-standing problems Le Parc owners have endured. Le Parc Condominiums – consisting of three four-story buildings housing 76 units – has faced similar issues to those at Champlain Tower South, including shoddy construction practices, design flaws, the developer going bankrupt, and decades of deterioration and water infiltration. While some emergency work was done, a permanent fix – estimated to cost $4.5 million – has been on hold nearly five years due to a lack of funds and financing.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden, who has a doctorate in education, joined D.C. middle school students and families Friday, welcoming them back to classrooms and honoring the educators who made it all possible, WUSA-TV reports. The first lady spoke at Brookland Middle School and delivered words of encouragement while acknowledging the challenges of the past year and a half during the coronavirus pandemic and highlighting goals to come. “We are going to partner with you because we don’t always know what the future holds, but we do know what we owe our children,” she said, while affirming that the administration will ensure schools like Brookland have the resources and support to continue in-person learning. “We owe them a promise to keep their schools open as safe as possible. We owe them a commitment to follow the science. We owe them unity so that we can fight the virus, not each other.” Meanwhile, the president emphasized the necessity of COVID-19 shots. “Parents, get your teens vaccinated – you’ve gotten them vaccinated for all types of other things,” he said. “The COVID-19 vaccine is safe, easy and convenient.” Biden also celebrated D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser’s vaccination efforts and her success in setting up 20 inoculation sites at local schools\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami Gardens: The most notable catch in Saturday’s NCAA football game between Miami and Appalachian State didn’t happen on the field. It wasn’t even a football. It was a cat. The animal somehow got into Hard Rock Stadium, then got caught by one of its paws off the facade of the upper deck in the first quarter. It eventually fell to the lower level of the stadium, where fans using an American flag as a makeshift net were able to safely break its fall and catch it before it was carried off to safety. “They were trying to grab it from above, and they couldn’t reach it, but they were scaring it downward,” said Craig Cromer, a facilities manager at the University of Miami and season ticket holder who with his wife, Kimberly, brings the flag to each home game. “It hung there for a little while with its two front paws, then one paw, then I was like, ‘Oh my goodness, it’s coming soon.’ ” That’s when the Cromers unhooked the flag from the railing and hoped for the best. The petrified cat fell, bounced a bit off the flag, and eventually was secured by some in the student section before being brought away by stadium security. “I’ll tell you, if the cat will help us in our red-zone offense, I’m going to see if we can give it a scholarship,” Miami coach Manny Diaz said. Some videos of the incident were posted on Twitter, tagged #HardRockCat.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The city’s transit authority is soliciting public input for the exterior graphic design of new railcars. The Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority is encouraging current and potential future riders to vote for one of four design options through its website or on its social media pages. All four designs include MARTA’s traditional color scheme and are inspired by “the dynamism and movement of trains,” according to a news release. The transit authority says more than 1,300 people participated in a similar crowdsourcing effort in the spring that sought input on the interior design of the railcars. Those votes and comments revealed that the most popular interior features are digital maps, next station and destination displays, and Americans with Disabilities Act accessible seating and signage, the release says. “We were thrilled with the response we received on the interior features and are eager to see what riders think of the exterior design options,” MARTA General Manager and CEO Jeffrey Parker said in the release. The new railcars are slated to arrive in stations in 2023.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Gov. David Ige is requiring government contractors and visitors to state facilities to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination or a negative coronavirus test. Ige’s executive order issued Thursday takes effect Monday, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. State contractors must attest to their employees’ vaccination status or provide weekly tests for unvaccinated staff. Contractors also must wear masks and maintain physical distance while on state property. The order also applies to visitors to state facilities. It does not apply to beaches or outdoor state properties. Inmates at correctional facilities, patients at state hospitals, and children under 12 or students attending state public or charter schools are exempt. Travelers arriving at airports are also exempt. The order says it is intended for the “safety of the government workforce during this ongoing escalation in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths resulting from the delta variant.” Last month, Ige issued an executive order requiring state and county employees to be either vaccinated or tested weekly.\n\nIdaho\n\nCoeur d’Alene: Northern Idaho’s long, deep streak of anti-government activism has confounded attempts to battle a COVID-19 outbreak overwhelming hospitals in the deeply conservative region. A deadly 1992 standoff with federal agents near the Canadian border helped spark an expansion of radical right-wing groups across the country, and the area was for a long time the home of the Aryan Nations, whose leader envisioned a “White Homeland” in the county that is now among the hardest-hit of the pandemic. Hospitals in northern Idaho are so packed with COVID-19 patients that authorities announced last week that facilities would be allowed to ration health care. “This is extremism beyond anything I ever witnessed,” Tony Stewart said of people who refused to get vaccinated and wear masks. Stewart is a founding member of the Kootenai County Task Force on Human Relations, which battled the Aryan Nations for decades and helped bankrupt the neo-Nazi group. “I’m almost speechless in seeing so many people have lost concern for their fellow humans.” Anti-government sentiments are strong in northern Idaho. State Rep. Heather Scott, R-Blanchard, refused an interview request, saying reporters were liars. She has promoted mask-burning protests and is among lawmakers who have frequently pushed COVID-19 misinformation on Facebook.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Lawmakers are considering whether to put a statue on state Capitol grounds of Ronald Reagan, the Illinois native who served as the country’s 40th president. Members of the House Statue and Monument Review Task Force met Wednesday to discuss Reagan’s legacy and whether to memorialize him at the statehouse in Springfield, where there are statues of two of the four U.S. presidents who were either born in or launched their political careers from the state, the Chicago Sun-Times reports. Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses Grant are represented on the Capitol grounds, but not Reagan or Barack Obama, who started his political career in the Illinois Legislature. Reagan was born in Tampico and raised in Dixon. He later had an acting career in Hollywood before becoming governor of California. Rep. Mary Flowers, D-Chicago, the chairwoman of the task force, said that “whether we agree with his policies or not … (Reagan) had a profound impact on the direction of this country.” She noted Reagan’s “made-for-TV” presidency produced images and ideas that remain with the U.S. today – for better or worse. His “It’s Morning Again in America” campaign ad created an idealistic vision of the country, she said, but he also is credited with the offensive phrase “welfare queen.” The task force will continue to take public comment.\n\nIndiana\n\nLogansport: The body of a Marine who was among 13 U.S. service members killed in a suicide bombing during the U.S.-run evacuation at Afghanistan’s Kabul airport was returned Sunday to his northern Indiana hometown. A military procession marked the beginning of memorial services for Marine Corps Cpl. Humberto Sanchez, 22, of Logansport. Sanchez’s body arrived Sunday morning at Grissom Air Reserve Base. The procession then headed about 20 miles to Logansport. People lined the route to show their respects, many with American flags, and jets flew overhead as the procession approached downtown Logansport. It stopped briefly downtown, where the hearse carrying Sanchez’s body paused under a garrison flag. The procession included Indiana State Police and vehicles carrying Sanchez’s family, followed by thousands of motorcycles. Sanchez was among 17 members of his Logansport High School class who joined the military after their 2017 graduation. He died in the Aug. 26 attack in Kabul, where he had been transferred after serving as a U.S. embassy guard in Jordan, according to his obituary. A public visitation is scheduled for Monday at LifeGate Church in Logansport. The funeral is set for 11 a.m. Tuesday at the church. Burial will follow at Mount Hope Cemetery.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A state court judge declined Friday to halt enforcement of a law that prohibits school boards from enacting mask requirements, saying there is no evidence that any school board would immediately impose a mask mandate if the law weren’t in effect. The ruling came in a lawsuit filed by Frances Parr, a mother of twin boys from Council Bluffs. She sued the state, Gov. Kim Reynolds and several state officials last month in Polk County District Court, seeking an order halting enforcement of the law. Judge Celene Gogerty, who was appointed to the bench by Reynolds in November 2018, said Parr has presented no evidence that a temporary injunction would alleviate Parr’s alleged harm caused by the law. Parr has asserted the law violates her constitutional rights. Her sons were set to start first grade in the Council Bluffs Community School District this fall, but she is teaching them at home over fears for their safety because the school cannot require other students to wear masks. Parr also has asked Gogerty to issue an order for a universal mask mandate for all students and school personnel until a voluntary plan can be implemented that separates mask-wearing students and staff from those who refuse. That request has not yet been argued before the judge but is another available remedy, Gogerty said.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Hospitals across the state will receive $50 million in federal COVID-19 relief funds for extra pay for nurses to keep them on the job but will be required to report monthly on how many nurses they’ve lost and why, under a plan a state task force approved Friday. Kansas law required a bipartisan pandemic response task force to spell out how the $50 million would be spent, and the task force added the reporting requirement. The task force’s meeting came a day after President Joe Biden imposed new vaccine requirements for as many as 100 million Americans. Republican officials in Kansas and across the nation strongly criticized Biden’s mandate. Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Andover, proposed the reporting on nurses who’ve been terminated. He called Biden’s new federal vaccine requirements “dictatorial edicts.” “We’ve had front-line workers – I mean, you can call them heroes – on the front lines for the last year and a half,” Masterson said. He also said he worries that “we’re gonna get some of them premium pay, and we are going to give some others a pink slip.” Earlier in the week, Masterson proposed to make hospitals with vaccine mandates ineligible for retention incentives – a proposal that failed on a 5-2 vote.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Lawmakers grabbed the quarterback role to direct the response to COVID-19, but when it came time to lead, the GOP-led Legislature “punted” the decision on mask-wearing in schools to local boards, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear said Friday. A day after a special legislative session ended, Beshear gave a blistering response to the Legislature’s decision to halt statewide mask mandates to combat Kentucky’s worst surge of the coronavirus pandemic. He declared that the Legislature “owns this pandemic moving forward.” Legislators passed bills Thursday that scrapped a statewide mask mandate for public schools and imposed a ban on any statewide mask rules until June 2023. Beshear vetoed the mask-related language, but Republican lawmakers overrode him before ending their three-day session. “The masking decision the General Assembly made was wrong. And it was also a punt,” Beshear told reporters. “I’ve been willing to make the calls, to take the hits, to make the plays. And the Legislature asked to go in … at QB. And what did they do? They punted on first down. When you’re in charge, it means you’ve got to make the decision. This one was to push the decision to others.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Supply trucks are once again delivering beer on Bourbon Street, and the landmark Cafe Du Monde is serving beignets, fried pastries dusted with powdered sugar, even though there aren’t many tourists or locals around to partake of either. With almost all the power back on in New Orleans nearly two weeks after Hurricane Ida struck, the city is showing signs of making a comeback from the Category 4 storm, which is blamed for more than two dozen deaths in the state. More businesses are opening daily, gasoline is easier to find, and many roads are lined with huge debris piles from cleanup work. Thousands are still struggling without electricity and water outside the metro area, and officials say oppressive heat is contributing to health problems and misery. It could still be weeks before power is restored in some areas, and many residents who evacuated haven’t returned. “It is not lost on anybody here at the state level and certainly not on our local partners just how many people continue to suffer,” Gov. John Bel Edwards said Thursday. “While things are getting better, and we can be thankful for that … this is going to be a very long-term recovery.”\n\nMaine\n\nPhippsburg: A group wants to create an oyster reef off the town’s coast to improve water quality, protect a shoreline from storm surges and act as a habitat for other smaller shellfish. The oyster reef is part of the fight against “the immense amount of change” that’s taking place because of climate change in waters off the Maine coast, Marissa McMahan, a senior fisheries scientist at Manomet, a Brunswick-based conservation nonprofit, told the Times Record. The project is the continuation of a two-year pilot program the Nature Conservancy began in 2017. The conservatory’s goal was to see if an oyster reef could be grown on the ocean floor in the Gulf of Maine, which is warming faster than 99% of the world’s large bodies of saltwater, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Phippsburg group is growing oysters in bags that float on the surface of the water. They’ll eventually be released into the ocean with a hope that they’ll attach to one another and grow as a vertical structure. Oysters benefit the environment because they filter algae, creating clearer, cleaner water that can support underwater grasses used for habitat by crabs, scallops and fish. They also can break up waves and reduce shore erosion.\n\nMaryland\n\nBethesda: Activists are calling for the return of a Black cemetery to a church decades after it was erased by development. The Rev. William J. Barber II and Rev. Liz Theoharis, co-chairs of the Poor People’s Campaign, spoke by Zoom to participants at a Friday rally, which organizers said included descendants of those buried at the Moses African Cemetery and members of the Macedonia Baptist Church. The church plans to restore the cemetery and build a monument and museum on the site. The Bethesda African Cemetery Coalition sued Montgomery County’s Housing Opportunities Commission last month claiming that part of the cemetery is beneath the parking lot of the Westwood Tower Apartments, news outlets report. The housing agency owns the property and apartment building and uses the rental income to cover costs of the agency. An estimated 500 bodies of enslaved people or relatives of the enslaved rest at the cemetery, the lawsuit says. The plaintiffs argue that selling the parcel that was used as a burial ground without court approval violates state law. Last week, a Montgomery County judge temporarily blocked the $51 million sale of land that includes the Westwood Tower Apartments, WTOP-FM reports. The temporary restraint forbids the sale until a Sept. 27 hearing on the matter.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nLawrence: The body of a U.S. Marine killed in a suicide bombing in Afghanistan returned home Saturday in a solemn procession through Massachusetts on the 20th anniversary of the attacks that led to America’s longest war. Sgt. Johanny Rosario Pichardo died in the Aug. 26 bombing near the Kabul airport where people were being evacuated amid the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan. A dozen other U.S. service members and 169 Afghans were killed as people struggled to get into the airport and on flights out of the country. Dignitaries including Gov. Charlie Baker, Boston Mayor Kim Janey and U.S. Sen. Edward Markey paid their respects to Rosario Pichardo’s family as her body arrived at Boston’s Logan International Airport. In her hometown, Lawrence, people lined highway overpasses and streets waving American flags as the vehicle procession made its way through the city near the New Hampshire state line. A Marine honor guard carried the flag-draped draped casket into the Farrah Funeral Home as police, firefighters and others stood and saluted. “We will never forget her name,” Lawrence Mayor Kendrys Vasquez said afterward. “We are proud to have her home.”\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Friday vetoed a Republican-sponsored bill that would have restricted state officials’ ability to use the Public Threat Alert System to announce new laws or executive orders. The Democratic governor, whose veto had been expected, said the system has only been activated once in the five years since it was created, for an active-shooter situation. The state used a different, federal system last year to send alerts to wireless devices about Whitmer’s stay-at-home and mask orders due to the coronavirus pandemic. That angered GOP lawmakers who said it should only be activated for “immediate” threats. That system would not have been affected by the state legislation. In a letter to legislators, the governor said the bill “would add complexity to the administration of the state’s public threat alert system, making it harder for law enforcement officers to do their jobs and making Michiganders less safe. … There is no need to further limit or complicate its use.” The measure had cleared the Republican-controlled Legislature mostly along party lines. The federal Wireless Alert System allows four types of messages: presidential alerts, imminent threat alerts, AMBER alerts and – as of 2019 – public safety messages designed to save lives or safeguard property. People can opt out of the latter three.\n\nMinnesota\n\nIsabella: Authorities said Sunday that a vast majority of the Greenwood Lake wildfire in northern Minnesota is contained, one month after lighting ignited the blaze in the Superior National Forest. The U.S. Forest Service reported that the nearly 27,000-acre fire was 67% contained as of Sunday morning. The Forest Service had said last week that the fire was nearly half under control as hundreds of firefighters were still being dispatched to the area. “I think the team is feeling really good about how things are looking out there. There’s been a lot of great work done and progress made taking advantage of this cooler weather,” Fire Service spokeswoman Stefani Spencer said. “The containment is pretty much growing every day.” Spencer added that the public is happy to have roads open, including all traffic opened along Highway 2. She said the closure was an inconvenience and frustration for folks traveling to Ely and the popular Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, the Star Tribune reports. The fire started Aug. 15 about 10 miles southwest of Isabella has destroyed 14 cabins and homes along with 57 outbuildings. Some residents in the affected area who were evacuated have recently been allowed to return to homes and cabins after the fire lost intensity.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Physicians who spread misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines could now have their licenses to practice medicine suspended or completely revoked, according to a new policy adopted by the Mississippi State Board of Medical Licensure. The policy, adopted Sept. 7, says doctors have an “ethical and professional responsibility” to practice medicine in the best interest of their patients and share factual and scientifically grounded information with them. “Spreading inaccurate COVID-19 vaccine information contradicts that responsibility, threatens to further erode public trust in the medical profession and puts all patients at risk,” the policy says. Whether physicians “recognize it or not,” they possess a high degree of public trust due to their specialized knowledge and training, giving them “a powerful platform in society,” it says. The policy specifically warns doctors against spreading misinformation on social media and strongly recommends physicians separate their personal and professional content online. “Physicians must understand that actions online and content posted can affect their reputation, have consequences for their medical careers, and undermine public trust in the medical profession,” it says.\n\nMissouri\n\nLiberty: Thieves in the Kansas City area have in the past month have taken two churches’ fruit harvests. Hosanna! Lutheran Church in Liberty had planned to harvest grapes it grows after a Sunday worship service earlier this month, WDAF-TV reports. But members discovered that all 1,500 pounds of grapes had been stolen, apparently cut off their vines. The church has for about 15 years had the grapes bottled for communion wine. The harvest is a big annual event, especially for children in the congregation. The grapes were valued at $1,500. “This wasn’t really about theft of grapes,” said Pastor Mike Kern. “We don’t care about the value. It was more of a theft of joy.” Kern’s church was not alone. St. Peter and All Saints Episcopal Church in Kansas City reported that four of its apple and pear trees were recently picked clean, too. The anticipated harvest was three or four years in the making. The Rev. Jonathan Frazier said the Episcopal church donates its fruit to a nearby food pantry and a downtown homeless shelter. “So it’s just really sad because for somebody to take that quantity of fruit, they’re probably going to sell it,” he said.\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: Glacier National Park’s reservation system for Going-to-the-Sun Road, which ended last week after a three-month trial run, caused countless headaches for locals and outsiders who struggled to secure $2 tickets, but park officials say it worked as intended, alleviating traffic congestion inside the park and preventing long lines of cars from spilling onto U.S. 2. “Generally we do feel it was a success because it met our major goals,” Glacier spokesperson Gina Kerzman told the Daily Inter Lake. Kerzman noted the park never had to close the west entrance, as it has been forced to do in past seasons, and there were never more than about 15 cars backed up on the highway. In recent years, she said, traffic jams have stretched for miles from West Glacier to Coram. Additionally, the reservation system helped ensure that many visitors could find parking and access their desired trailheads and campsites. “We feel that we were able to manage the number of visitors and be able to ensure a good experience for everybody,” Kerzman said. Of course, not everyone was enamored by the new approach to crowd control. One recent review on tripadvisor.com called the reservation system “a disgrace” that made it “impossible” to access the park and prompted the author to cancel their visit, losing money on a hotel booking.\n\nNebraska\n\nNorfolk: Starting in early 2022, public transit will be more widely available in the city and surrounding communities. To address the increasing demand for public transit in Northeast Nebraska, the newly renamed North Fork Area Transit announced new services that will provide “safe, efficient and affordable” public transportation. A new flexroute bus service called “Forklift” will provide rides along three routes and the addition of almost 100 bus stops across the community, said Steve Rames, Norfolk’s public works director. The Norfolk Daily News reports that Forklift, which will operate seven days a week, will also allow anyone who lives within three-quarters of a mile from any marked bus stop to schedule curbside service. The flexroutes will run from 6:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Monday through Friday and 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekends. The system will likely rotate on 30-minute cycles during peak times and one-hour cycles during non-peak times, Rames said. The North Fork Area Transit’s existing call-ahead ride service will continue but under a new name, “Telelift.” With Telelift, riders are able to schedule a ride 24 hours in advance. Service is available up to 30 miles around Norfolk, seven days a week, Rames said.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A change in newly issued Nevada driver’s licenses means airport security screeners may have to manually check the credentials because their scanners can’t read the bar codes, officials said. The Transportation Security Administration hasn’t yet updated its scanning system to account for a minor change to the bar code on the state’s new license design, said Kevin Malone, a state Department of Motor Vehicles spokesman. TSA agents at U.S. airports can manually inspect a license if the scanning system won’t read the bar code, TSA Lorie Danker spokeswoman said. The state began issuing licenses with the new design in July. A note on the DMV’s website recommends that travelers allow extra time to complete airport security screening.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nBrentwood: Dozens of families have challenged mask-wearing policies in New Hampshire school districts during the coronavirus pandemic, with two cases in court Friday calling for injunctions to stop enforcing them. A lawyer representing families in the Epping, Londonderry and Timberlane districts argued at a Rockingham County Superior Court hearing that mask mandates violate the parents’ rights to make health care and medical decisions for their children, and they are illegal restraints under a state law that limits the use of child restraint practices in school. “Their children have difficulty breathing with these masks on,” attorney Robert Fojo said. “It’s causing them to be afraid; they suffer anxiety and stress as a result of wearing these masks, experiencing lightheadedness and trouble concentrating. Masks irritate their skin, cause acne. It exacerbates already inherent problems that they have, such as asthma, difficulty with speech, learning-related disabilities, and obviously a distraction. They inhibit social interaction, which is what these children should be doing in school.” Attorneys for the school districts have argued for the case to be dismissed, saying the districts have been following a “tool kit” for schools from the state Department of Health and Human Services that recommends mask-wearing.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Four more counties have received a major disaster declaration from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, paving the way for residents of Essex, Hudson, Mercer and Union counties to access federal assistance in the wake of the remnants of Hurricane Ida, Gov. Phil Murphy confirmed. The declaration comes after Bergen, Gloucester, Hunterdon, Middlesex, Passaic and Somerset counties received declarations from the White House last Monday. The declaration allows for assistance with needs like grants for temporary housing and home repairs, among other things that will help residents and business owners in the aftermath of Ida. There also will be federal funding available to all levels of government as well as some nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work to repair or replace facilities damaged by the storm in the designated counties. Many in Essex County had been pushing for a disaster declaration after the area got crushed by Ida. Montclair officials had hoped for FEMA to include the county after the storm brought “devastating” flooding. In Montclair, which received 7.5 inches of rain, at least 50 drivers were rescued from cars and countless more ruined, more than 150 basements needed to be pumped out, officials said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Native American communities across the state are putting the finishing touches on proposed redistricting maps aimed at greater self-determination in future public elections, as competing plans wind their way toward the Legislature for consideration. Participants in a redistricting commission for New Mexico’s Indigenous pueblo communities said Friday that map proposals may be finalized as soon as this week. The maps will be submitted to a seven-member Citizen Redistricting Commission that is reviewing and vetting redistricting maps for the Legislature, which can adopt recommendations or start from scratch. The seven-seat commission has no Native American representation. New Mexico is home to 23 federally recognized tribes, whose growing political clout is reflected in the election of Laguna Pueblo tribal member Deb Haaland to Congress in 2016 and her promotion this year to secretary of the interior. Attorney Joseph Little is working with a broad alliance of Native American communities to turn redistricting principles into action using results of the 2020 census to track population changes. Major redistricting changes are most likely in the heavily Native American northwest region of the state and an oil-producing region in the southeast.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: For the first time in 550 days, an audience was inside the auditorium at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts on Saturday night, attending a Metropolitan Opera performance of Verdi’s “Requiem.” The night of multiple extended standing ovations was in commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks but in fact marked much more. The company was performing in its home for the first time since hundreds of thousands of deaths caused by the coronavirus pandemic, including Met violist Vincent Lionti, assistant conductor Joel Revzen and chorister Antoine Hodge. It also marked the first performance in the house since the death of conductor James Levine, the Met’s towering figure of the last half-century. He died in March at 77, a little over three years after was he was fired for sexual improprieties. Levine’s successor as music director on the podium is 46-year-old Yannick Nezet-Seguin. The pandemic caused the Met to cancel more than 275 performances, including its entire 2020-21 season, plus an international tour. The gap was the longest since the company began in 1883. A series of Broadway shows will start opening this week. The New York Philharmonic begins Friday at Alice Tully Hall, while David Geffen Hall undergoes reconstruction expected to last another year.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A judge has set a mid-October deadline for state lawmakers to follow a court-ordered plan to provide full funding for improving public education, or he will take action himself. State Superior Court Judge David Lee said he was “very disheartened” that the General Assembly is funding a small part of a plan calling for at least $5.6 billion in new education funding by 2028, news outlets report. Lee has scheduled a court hearing Oct. 18 and said if the plan isn’t fully funded by then, he will consider options on how the court can resolve the matter. Pat Ryan, a spokesman for Senate leader Phil Berger, also accused Lee of overstepping his authority, The News & Observer of Raleigh reports. Lee’s warning marks the next stage in the Leandro school funding case first filed in 1994 by low-wealth school districts to get more state funding. The case is named after a Hoke County student who has since graduated from college. The North Carolina Supreme Court assigned Lee to oversee the case after Judge Howard Manning retired. Over the years, the state’s highest court has ruled that the North Carolina Constitution guarantees every child “an opportunity to receive a sound basic education” and that the state wasn’t meeting that standard.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State agriculture officials have confirmed a second case of cattle anthrax in Kidder County. The case was confirmed by the North Dakota State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory on Friday, according to the state Agriculture Department. The first case was reported in August. Officials say producers in the county and surrounding areas should check with their veterinarians to see if they should start vaccinating their cattle for anthrax. The disease is caused by bacterial spores that can lie dormant in the ground for decades and become active under ideal conditions, such as drought. Anthrax vaccines are readily available, but it takes about a week to establish immunity, and the vaccine must be administered annually. Two cases of anthrax were reported in North Dakota in 2020. In 2005, more than 500 confirmed animal deaths from anthrax were reported, with total livestock losses estimated at more than 1,000.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The Cincinnati Police Department is pledging to increase recruitment of female officers to reach the goal of a force composed of 30% women by the year 2030. The department announced it is joining the New York University School of Law’s “30x30 Pledge.” In addition to recruitment, Cincinnati police also want to improve the retention and promotion of women in policing. According to a memo from the Cincinnati City Manager’s Office, the force is currently 22.7% female, compared to the national average of 13%. Officials say about 100 departments throughout the country have signed the pledge. “The goal of the pledge is not only to inform agency progress but also to identify and understand barriers to progress such as resources, capacity or authority,” the manager’s office reported. Officials said the police force should also be representative of the population it serves, which is 51% female.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Oklahoma Supreme Court has rejected a request to remove two members of the state’s Pardon and Parole Board from a high-profile death penalty case. The court’s brief ruling Friday denied a prosecutor’s request to remove Adam Luck and Kelly Doyle from considering the commutation request of Julius Jones, who was sentenced to death for the 1999 killing of Edmond businessman Paul Howell. The ruling came after a lawyer for District Attorney David Prater argued before a court referee that unless members Luck and Doyle were barred from taking part in the decision, the five-member board would likely recommend that Jones’ sentence be commuted following a hearing Monday. Prater, who argued that Luck and Doyle have a conflict of interest because of their work with released inmates, said in a statement that he respects the high court’s decision. “This is the system I operate in every day and I believe in it, though decisions don’t always go as I desire,” Prater wrote. He said his office is prepared to present “the truth of the circumstances” surrounding the fatal shooting of Howell during a carjacking. “If the Board objectively considers the truth, they will quickly vote to deny the killer’s commutation request,” Prater wrote.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The Oregon Transportation Commission has granted conditional approval to a plan to expand Interstate 5 through Portland’s Rose Quarter as well as build a cap over the freeway to allow for the redevelopment of a Black community destroyed when the interstate was first built. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports the commission’s unanimous decision Thursday follows the recommendation of Gov. Kate Brown that the Oregon Department of Transportation pursue “hybrid option 3.” That plan would essentially tunnel the freeway and provide economic opportunity for the region’s Black community in an effort to reclaim the Albina district. Supporters say the idea is to remediate historic harm caused by the freeway’s original construction and displacement of community members. Approval of the hybrid 3 model is contingent upon ODOT providing a thorough analysis of the project’s cost structure and funding sources by December. It also requires ODOT and its contractors to update its diversity and subcontracting plans and to reevaluate the project’s initial environmental impact study. The project’s cost has risen significantly from its initial price tag of between $715 million and 795 million to upward of $1.18 billion.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Some physicians are offering stock doctor’s notes for use by parents wishing to have their children exempted from wearing masks in school, according to state health officials who say they have referred the matter for possible disciplinary action. A statewide, universal mask mandate for Pennsylvania schools went into effect Tuesday as the Wolf administration seeks to keep school buildings open for in-person learning amid the latest surge in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths. The acting health secretary’s face covering order contains an exemption for students for whom wearing a mask would cause or worsen a medical condition. But parents in districts that require a doctor’s note or other medical documentation have complained it’s been difficult to find a physician who will sign off. The Health Department said some doctors are pushing stock exemptions available to anyone. “The administration is aware that some physicians have indicated that they intend to offer blanket ‘exemptions’ to individuals with whom they have no treatment relationship, and regardless of whether the individual’s physical condition required an exemption,” the department said in a statement. Those doctors “have been and will be referred to the appropriate licensing boards for possible disciplinary action.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nSouth Kingstown: A pond has been closed to shellfish harvesting after seven people reported becoming ill after consuming raw shellfish harvested in the area last month. The state departments of health and environmental management said Saturday that Potter Pond in South Kingstown will be closed until further notice. The agencies said two of the sickened individuals tested positive for Campylobacter Jejuni. People with Campylobacter infection usually have diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps as well as nausea and vomiting, the agencies said. The symptoms usually start after two to five days and last about one week. The agencies advise anyone who consumed shellfish from the area and is feeling ill to seek medical attention, as more serious complications can develop. Health officials say they’ve contacted all commercial harvesters in the area to ensure that any product harvested during the time frame under investigation is not sold at restaurants and markets. They’re also urging recreational harvesters who collected shellfish between Thursday and Saturday in the pond to either discard them or avoid consuming them raw or undercooked. Officials say quick steaming isn’t sufficient to prevent illness, but cooking the shellfish until it reaches an internal temperature of at least 145 degrees Fahrenheit can reduce risk.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A lawsuit filed in federal court is asking a judge to overturn a requirement in state ethics laws that makes it illegal for anyone who files a complaint against a public official from talking about it unless the complaint is found valid. The lawsuit is filed by a whistleblower who says a state lawmaker broke ethics laws by voting in favor of a special interest that paid the legislator $108,000 over three years through contracts with firms with ties to the lawmaker. The State Ethics Commission rejected the complaint after discussing it behind closed doors, saying the lawmaker taking money from a subsidiary of the special interest didn’t affiliate him with the interest, the whistleblower’s lawyer said in a lawsuit obtained by The Post and Courier. In the lawsuit, attorney Chris Kenney called the finding a “legal absurdity.” Kenney, who works in state Sen. Dick Harpootlian’s law firm, told the newspaper he can’t further identify the lawmaker or the special interest without a ruling in his favor from the court. Ethics laws prevent people who file a complaint from talking about it publicly before the complaint is heard and also if the commission rules against it, even on a technical issue. Critics of that provision have said it violates free speech rights under the U.S. Constitution.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nDeadwood: The first sporting bets have been wagered in the city, bringing to fruition an effort that began several years ago after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a federal law that banned commercial sports gambling. Four casinos in Deadwood opened sports betting Thursday: Tin Lizzie, Cadillac Jack’s, Gold Dust and Mustang Sally’s. Betting is only allowed at licensed facilities in Deadwood. People can place their bets with tellers at a window, at a digital kiosk or, soon, through an app on their phone. The app will only work within the facilities. The South Dakota Commission on Gaming issued a final ruling Wednesday on a list of sporting events on which gamblers will be able to place bets, including Olympic events and professional and college-level sports, the Rapid City Journal reports. Deadwood Gaming Association Executive Director Mike Rodman said Thursday’s opening was a success. “We’re very pleased that we got to this point,” he said. “And it’s been a long haul getting there. We’re happy to be there today.” In 2019, the Deadwood Gaming Commission attempted to get the Legislature to legalize it but came up three votes short. In 2020, South Dakota voters legalized sports gambling with about 58% approval, and the Legislature passed the gaming laws in 2021.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The federal Environmental Protection Agency is proposing the addition of a former munitions factory just outside the city to a list of prioritized Superfund toxic cleanup sites, U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen said. The EPA has proposed adding the National Fireworks site in the Memphis suburb of Cordova to its Superfund National Priorities List for removal of toxic chemicals detected in groundwater, Cohen, D-Memphis, said in a statement Thursday. National Fireworks made flares, grenades, incendiary bombs and large caliber rounds for the U.S. Army and Navy from 1942 to 1945, the EPA said. Metals and chlorinated solvent contamination have been identified in the soil and groundwater on the Superfund site, the EPA said. The 260-acre site was redeveloped in 1986 as an industrial park. The listing would make the site eligible for cleanup funding as one of the nation’s highest priority contamination sites. The site is “dangerously close to Memphis’ Shaw Wellfield that provides drinking water to 79,000 people,” Cohen said.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: The CEO of Salesforce said the company will help employees leave the state, and he did so while retweeting a story linking the offer to concern about Texas’ new anti-abortion law. Salesforce, which sells customer-management software, joins a small number of companies that have reacted against the law. CNBC reported that the San Francisco-based company told employees in a Slack message that it will help them move “if you have concerns about access to reproductive healthcare in your state.” On Friday night, CEO Marc Benioff retweeted a post about the story, adding: “Ohana if you want to move we’ll help you exit TX. Your choice.” Ohana is a Hawaiian term for family. The company did not return messages for comment. The Texas law passed the Republican-controlled Legislature and was signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott in May but didn’t go into effect until this month. It bans most abortions after six weeks, before many women know whether they are pregnant, and lets private residents sue anyone who helps a woman get an abortion. By a 5-4 vote, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to block the law. Last week the U.S. Justice Department sued Texas to block the law.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Thirteen Utah hospitals will postpone many nonemergency surgeries starting this week as health care workers are overwhelmed by another surge in coronavirus cases from the faster-spreading delta variant, a major health care company said Friday. Intermountain Healthcare announced that the hospitals will postpone non-urgent procedures for several weeks starting Wednesday. The announcement comes a week after state hospital leaders made emotional pleas for vaccinations and universal masking to curb the state’s ongoing COVID-19 surge. Hospital utilization in Utah is nearing its previous peak in December, when intensive care units were 104% full, and 606 COVID-19 patients in hospitals. There were 516 people hospitalized for COVID-19, and ICUs were 93% full as of Thursday, state data shows. About 62% of Utah residents ages 12 and older were fully vaccinated as of Thursday. Utah reported 10 new deaths from COVID-19 on Thursday, bringing the total since the pandemic began to 2,703. Several Utah hospitals postponed nonemergency surgeries at the start of the pandemic in 2020 to alleviate some of the strain on health care networks.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The city’s annual marathon has been shortened so that fewer health care professionals will be needed at the race next month amid a surge in COVID-19 infections, organizers said. The People’s United Bank Vermont City Marathon & Relay will be a half marathon and modified relay event Oct. 24, RunVermont said. “After extensive review and discussions with professionals associated with the health care field, RunVermont believes it would be insensitive to ask those professionals to step aside from their duties to attend to the needs of the race at a time when the medical community is under some significant strain,” the organization said in a statement. Marathon runners can switch to a half marathon, select a virtual marathon option or defer the race until May 2022, organizers said. They can also chose to enter one of three races on a complimentary basis if space is available: the Mad Marathon in Vermont on Sept. 12; the Adirondack Marathon in upstate New York on Oct. 3; or the Eversource Hartford Marathon in Connecticut on Oct. 9.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Arrests on marijuana-related charges have fallen dramatically this summer in and around the capital city since a new law legalized possession of small amounts of pot and residents keeping a few cannabis plants, according to a newspaper report. Twenty-five marijuana-related arrests occurred in Richmond and in Chesterfield, Hanover and Henrico counties in the first seven weeks after the law took effect July 1, compared to 257 arrrests during the same period last year, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reports, citing local law enforcement data. “A 90% reduction in marijuana arrests indicates that the public policy is performing as intended and in a manner that is consistent with post-legalization observations from other states,” said Jenn Michelle Pedini, executive director of the Virginia chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. The law legalized possession by adults age 21 and over of up to 1 ounce of marijuana and the cultivation of four pot plants per household, among other decriminalization provisions. Selling marijuana remains illegal until the state launches a regulated market in 2024 and issues licenses. A regulatory board will help carry out the details.\n\nWashington\n\nLa Conner: The Swinomish Tribe is threatening to sue the federal government to speed up estuary restoration and salmon preservation on the Skagit River delta. Much of the estuary has been drained and closed off with tide gates to facilitate agriculture, but such habitat is crucial for juvenile salmon. The tribe says that under an agreement reached in 2010 – following a prior lawsuit – the Army Corps of Engineers isn’t supposed to grant construction permits to dike districts for work on the tide gates unless they first restore estuary habitat. But for the past five years, the Corps has been doing just that, the tribe says. During that time, at least 660 acres should have been restored. The restoration efforts are now behind the agreement’s schedule, which calls for restoring 2,700 acres by 2035. At the current pace, it will take a century to complete that, tribal scientists say. The tribe notified the Army Corps last week that it intends to sue within 60 days, saying the agency has allowed the dike districts to violate the Endangered Species Act. Skagit River Chinook salmon are protected under the law. The Army Corps and NOAA Fisheries said they are reviewing the tribe’s claims.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMorgantown: West Virginia University is expanding its mask mandate to include all indoor campus spaces, officials said Friday. Masks will be required beginning Monday in all buildings and facilities regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status through Oct. 6, when public health conditions will be reevaluated, the school said in a statement. Last month, the university began requiring masks to be worn in classrooms and labs, citing several factors, including that not enough students and employees have submitted proof that they have been inoculated against COVID-19. The numbers of cases and quarantines involving university employees and students remain manageable, but officials said they decided to take the precautionary step due to the recent, significant increase of COVID-19 cases in the state. The mask requirement won’t apply in personal office spaces, small gatherings in residence halls, or while eating or exercising, officials said. Meanwhile, Gov. Jim Justice said Friday that cases in West Virginia are still rising, and there are a record number of patients in intensive care units and on ventilators. He continued to urge residents to get vaccinated. “This thing is running rampant right now,” he said. “These vaccines are incredibly safe, and they’ll stop this.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A woman who admitted to helping stab a classmate to please online horror character Slender Man will be freed Monday from a mental health institution under strict conditions, a judge ruled Friday. Anissa Weier, 19, will be released after spending almost four years at the Winnebago Mental Health Institute in Oshkosh. A conditional release plan calls for her to live with her father, submit to around-the-clock GPS monitoring and receive psychiatric treatment, among other things. She won’t be allowed to use the internet except at home, and the state Department of Corrections will monitor her online activity. Weier and a friend, Morgan Geyser, both were committed to Winnebago after pleading guilty to attacking Payton Leutner when they were all 12 years old. Geyser stabbed Leutner multiple times as Weier urged her on. Leutner suffered 19 stab stab wounds – including one that narrowly missed her heart – and barely survived. Waukesha County Judge Michael Bohren said the conditions of Weier’s release were fair, and the plan “provides for the protection of the community” as well as for Leutner and for Weier herself. Weier, dressed in a dark suit and smiling occasionally, said nothing during the 20-minute proceeding. “She looks forward to moving on into a productive life,” her attorney, Maura McMahon, told the judge.\n\nWyoming\n\nSheridan: Artifacts found this summer at Medicine Lodge Archaeological Site are slated for radiocarbon dating, which could tell researchers more about when the Crow, or Apsaalooke, people came to the area, according to the state archaeologist. “This summer, we found Crow ceramics, as well a range of things, from thousands and thousands of flakes and 10 arrow points (or arrowheads) and preforms to make arrowheads to animal bone from bison as well as bighorn sheep, as well as obsidian,” Wyoming State Archaeologist Spencer Pelton said. “We really hoped to find Crow ceramics to radiocarbon date, to have a better idea of how old those ceramics are.” Sharon Peregoy, a member of the Montana House of Representatives who represents the Crow Agency, said this type of work may help date early people of the area, preserving – or recovering – history that can otherwise be lost. “It helps dispel the concept that the Crow, Apsaalooke, people were new transplants to the area,” she said, adding that in this context, “new” means an arrival of 500 years ago. “The findings of these types of excavations and research correlates with our Crow oral history, which dates from time immemorial … prehistoric,” Peregoy said. “History is important to preserve a homeland for future generations.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2019/12/31/asheville-decade-look-back-top-stories-2010-2019/2775164001/", "title": "WNC's decade: A Look back at top stories around Asheville from ...", "text": "A lot can change in the course of a decade.\n\nBut while different events mark each year, some topics endured in Asheville: Development. Hotels. Apartments. Affordable housing. Beer. Restaurants. Asheville Police. Asheville politics. Natural disasters. The I-26 Connector.\n\nIn no particular order within each year, here are many of the stories that captured headlines and attention in the decade now closed. No doubt this is a compilation of highlights, not a comprehensive list.\n\n2010: Obamas visit Asheville and a big GOP win in the General Assembly\n\nSnowstorms: Ask any parent who had school-age children and they'll likely remember the snow and the accompanying days out of school. Storms that started in December 2009 ended the winter with 39.2 inches by March 2010 at the airport. A whopper of a storm then hit at Christmas 2010.\n\nObamas in Asheville: For three days in April, Asheville was in the national spotlight. President and first lady Barack and Michelle Obama decided to vacation here, and it seemed everybody wanted to know what they were doing.\n\nWong trial: It was a tragic case that captured the interest of Western North Carolina: the 2008 murder of N.C. Trooper David Shawn Blanton Jr. during an Interstate 40 traffic stop in Haywood County that left behind a grieving widow and a prematurely born son who later died. The trial was moved to Catawba County. Wong was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole.\n\nHealth care reform: The ebb and flow of the national issue triggered emotional highs and lows in both supporters and opponents through the passage of the sweeping Affordable Care Act on March 21.\n\nShuler-Miller race: As the midterm elections approached, it appeared likely Republicans would make significant gains in national positions. Frustration by Democratic voters over Shuler's \"no\" vote on health care reform was not enough to sway the race in favor of Republican challenger Jeff Miller, and Shuler wound up being re-elected with 54% of the votes. It would be his final term in Congress.\n\nLarchmont apartments: A Mountain Housing Opportunities development was hotly debated when it came before City Council in March 2010. Advocates of affordable housing saw the infill project near jobs and public transportation as the ideal place to put such complexes in the city. It took council almost four hours to listen to the 33 members of the public who spoke on the project and to decide. Council unanimously approved a rezoning needed for the project to move ahead, but the margin of victory was narrower than it appears. Because some neighbors had filed a legal protest petition, state law provides that six of council’s seven members would have to go along for the rezoning to pass. The apartments came online in 2012.\n\nDowntown vandalism: On May Day, a mob of black-clad people marauded through downtown, breaking business windows and damaging property. Eleven were caught, and an anarchist group claimed responsibility.\n\nLightning kills woman on Max Patch: Bethany Lott, 25, of Knoxville, Tennessee, was hiking June 4 at the Madison County scenic spot when she was struck and killed by lightning. Compounding the tragedy was that her death happened moments before Richard Butler, her boyfriend and companion that day, was going to propose marriage.\n\nI-26 wreck kills 5: A dump truck accident Oct. 24 that caused a line of cars to stop on Interstate 26 near Fletcher suddenly became much more. A tractor-trailer driven by a Wisconsin man plowed into the back of the line, causing a chain-reaction pileup that resulted in five deaths.\n\nMaggie Valley mudslide: A 30-foot-high wall of mud and debris traveled 3,000 feet down Buck Mountain, crossing Rich Cove Road in at least two places and damaging three homes after a system of retaining walls at Ghost Town in the Sky failed during heavy rain on Feb. 5.\n\nTexting-while-driving fatality: Ashley Johnson, a student at Buncombe County Early College, died in a crash on Long Shoals Road that was caused by distracted driving. After her death, Johnson's father Amos spoke out, imploring drivers to be safe on the road.\n\nHistoric GOP win: Republicans gain the majority in both houses of the General Assembly for the first time in more than a century. The change ushers in a rightward shift in the state legislature, including new abortion restrictions, cuts to the university system and a same-sex marriage ban that was eventually overturned by federal courts.\n\nMoogfest: The sixth edition of Moogfest, an annual, multiday music, art and technology festival, was held in Asheville for the first time. It took place in five stages at places in downtown Asheville, attracting around 7,000 people a day. The festival would move to Durham four years later, after its parent company, Moog Music, cited a lack of public and private partners in Asheville.\n\n2011: Asheville Fire Department mourns Jeff Bowen, Gerrymandering in the 11th\n\nFirefighter death: Asheville Fire Department was rocked by tragedy on July 28, as Capt. Jeff Bowen, a 13-year department veteran, died in a fire at 445 Biltmore Ave. The father of three was searching the fifth floor of the building and put out a \"mayday\" call. He was 37. Ten other firefighters were treated for injuries sustained in the blaze. The city would go on to name the Patton Avenue bridge for Bowen.\n\nBuncombe County districts: The GOP-majority General Assembly threw a curve at the Democratically-controlled Board of Commissioners, changing the election of members from an at-large system to one with three districts that mirrored N.C. House districts. The law, passed in May along party lines, also added two seats, making for a seven-member board with Republicans holding three spots.\n\nAPD chief retires: Amid controversy over an evidence room that was missing guns, drugs and money, APD Chief Bill Hogan announced in April that he would retire the following month. He had been chief since 2004.\n\nA-B Tech tax referendum: A controversial tax to bolster the capital needs of Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community College passed by a slim margin in November. Buncombe County voters approved a quarter-cent sales tax increase that supporters said would provide millions for sorely needed renovations and new buildings. Voters approved the referendum by fewer than 500 votes. More than 33,000 votes were cast. Robert Malt, executive director of the Sales Tax Opposition Partnership, which organized to fight the sales tax increase, said he was disappointed with the results. As much as 20% of the money was misspent (see 2019).\n\nTimeline: A-B Tech's quarter-cent sales tax history\n\nOccupy Asheville: In the fall, a group of more than 200 protesters set up camp around Asheville, speaking out against corporate greed and preferential treatment, social inequality and a lack of compassion in America for the poor. It was part of a larger, national movement, the \"Occupy Wall Street\" effort that spread to numerous American cities. The movement in Asheville wound down in 2012.\n\nGerrymandering hits the 11th: Now in control of the redistricting process, General Assembly Republicans draw new maps greatly favoring GOP candidates in the state House and Senate as well as Congress. As part of gerrymandering techniques known as \"cracking\" and \"packing,\" urban areas with high concentrations of Democratic votes are split and added to districts with more Republicans.While part of Asheville stays in the 11th, a large section is split off into the 10th, which runs east all the way to the suburbs of Charlotte.\n\nWE DO Campaign launches: The Campaign for Southern Equality launches the WE DO Campaign, through which same-sex couples would repeatedly request – and typically be denied – marriage licenses in Asheville. Buncombe County Register of Deeds Drew Reisinger would become North Carolina’s first government official to accept a marriage license request from a same-sex couple in 2013, solidifying Asheville as an organizing hub for LGBTQ rights.\n\nTroy & Sons opens: Expanding Asheville's alcohol profile beyond beer, the city's first craft distillery, Troy & Sons, opened in a building in east Asheville next to Highland Brewing Co., making white corn liquor and building on the heritage of moonshine.\n\n2012: Meadows wins redrawn 11th, big breweries move into Asheville\n\nTavern slayings: On April 4, a gory scene started in front of witnesses at Mike's Side Pocket Tavern on Haywood Road and ended a block away near a city bus carrying more terrified bystanders. In the end, all three victims died from stab wounds, marking one of the city's most violent and chaotic crime scenes in years. Police say Steven Wike, 45, of Wilmington, instigated the stabbings, using what one witness described as \"the biggest knives I've ever seen.\" After being thrown out of the now-closed bar earlier in the day, Wike returned and attacked three people, killing two of them. Wike fatally stabbed Harold McHone, who suffered five wounds to the chest and abdomen. He also killed Phillip Davis.\n\nMark Meadows elected: In a redrawn 11th Congressional District, conservative Republican Mark Meadows swept to victory, flipping the district after Democrat Heath Shuler opted not to run for reelection. Meadows would go on to chair the Freedom Caucus. In late 2019, he announced he would retire from Congress.\n\nSierra Nevada chooses Mills River: In January, Sierra Nevada Brewing of Chico, California, announced it would build its long anticipated East Coast expansion brewery in Mills River at the Ferncliff Industrial Park near Asheville Regional Airport.

Asheville Brewing Co. president Mike Rangel said Sierra Nevada’s expansion “really establishes us as more of a craft brewing mecca.\"\n\nNew Belgium picks Asheville: It didn’t take long for other major beer news. In April, New Belgium, maker of the popular Fat Tire ale, rolled out plans for a new brewery on the banks of the French Broad River. It picked Asheville over a list of competitors including Philadelphia, drawn by the city's sustainability, bike paths and greenways as much as the growing microbrew scene The Fort Collins, Colorado, company, said it would invest $175 million over the next seven years, bringing 154 jobs to a brewery to be built on the site of the former WNC Livestock Market on Craven Street.

No reason was given for the departure. Dunn helped win voter approval in 2011 of a special quarter-cent tax in Buncombe County to fund new buildings and renovations at the school, but he and county officials also clashed over how to use those proceeds. Dunn admitted earlier in 2013 to actively trying to keep County Commissioner Mike Fryar, a critic of Dunn and the tax, off the school's board of trustees.\n\nRiver Arts District development: In October, City Council unanimously approved a zoning change to allow a major development on the empty site of the former Dave Steel facility.

After 2014, the festival would pull out of Asheville and move to Durham.\n\nPolice recording rallies: In September, it was learned that city police have spent the last decade recording video of public gatherings under a seemingly unorganized system that now has officials working to comply with state law. At least some of the gatherings were political. The recordings raised free speech issues, advocates across the political spectrum said. The practice came to light after at least two people complained about a police forensics officer recording a Mountain Moral Monday rally at Pack Square Park. The Citizen Times sued for release of the videos and won.\n\nN.C. ranked worst state for teachers: North Carolina came in dead last at 51st on WalletHub's list, which included D.C.

The list did not take into account the teacher raises approved this summer by state lawmakers.\n\nJudge strikes NC gay marriage ban: Just after 5 p.m. Oct. 10, a federal judge in Asheville struck down the state's ban, approved by state voters in 2012, paving the way for same-sex marriage to begin immediately. Five days earlier, the U.S. Supreme Court announced it would not hear any appeal of a July ruling by the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond striking down Virginia's ban. That court has jurisdiction over North Carolina. Buncombe County Register of Deeds Drew Reisinger kept his office open until 7 p.m. to issue marriage licenses to 19 waiting couples.\n\nHundreds protest Ferguson verdict in Asheville: Nearly 200 people rallied in downtown Asheville the November day after a grand jury decided not to indict the white officer who fatally shot 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in a case that touched off waves of sometimes violent protests around the nation and ignited fierce debates on race relations in the U.S.\n\nNew DA in town: Longtime District Attorney Ron Moore lost his re-election bid to defense attorney Todd Williams in the May Democratic primary.

Tim Moffitt in November in Buncombe County's most expensive and hotly contested local race that year. He has retained the House District 116 seat since.\n\nAPD chief retires: Asheville Police Chief William Anderson announced in November that he would retire at year's end. His decision came about a month after a quarter of the city's officers signed a petition saying they had no confidence in the department's leaders. A Citizen Times investigation into the department found allegations of on-the-job retaliation, an increase in officer resignations and administrative errors that led to officers using expired radar guns. Hundreds of traffic cases were dismissed.\n\nRelated:APD: Troubled past, uncertain future\n\nBrewery boom: From 2009-13, the Beer City USA poll existed, and Asheville dominated. During the poll’s run, the Asheville area was transformed into the nation’s East Coast craft beer capital, with both Sierra Nevada Brewing and New Belgium Brewing building their East Coast expansions here. Oskar Blues built its expansion in nearby Brevard. Wicked Weed jumped on the scene in 2012. The poll shut down in 2014, but the boom continued.\n\n2015: Asheville gets first female police chief, NC legislation allows religious objection to same-sex marriage\n\nMore: Top stories in 2015\n\nCivil rights landmark: In a landmark decision June 26, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutional right of LGBTQ Americans to marry. From Asheville to Spruce Pine, people in WNC organized gatherings to celebrate the historic ruling. More than 200 people, young and old, gathered in downtown Asheville. Buncombe County Register of Deeds Drew Reisinger was one of the first in the state to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples after U.S. District Court Judge Max O. Cogburn Jr. declared the state's same-sex marriage ban unconstitutional Oct. 10, 2014. Later, a two-story rainbow flag was flown outside of City Hall, which drew its own share of controversy.\n\nReligious objection to same-sex marriage: On June 11, North Carolina passed legislation that exempts magistrates and some registers of deeds workers with \"sincerely held religious objection\" from carrying out same-sex marriage ceremonies. Republican Gov. Pat McCrory vetoed the bill, but it was overridden by the General Assembly.\n\nNew APD chief: Tammy Hooper, a 26-year veteran of the Alexandria, Virginia, Police Department, got the nod, becoming the third chief in four years and the city's first female chief. Hooper, 49, began work July 20 and wasted no time in overhauling the department's organizational structure. She would be on the job until January 2019\n\nInnocence settlements: Kenneth Kagonyera and Robert Wilcoxson, who served 11 years behind bars for a murder they did not commit, settled federal lawsuit against Buncombe County, former Sheriff Bobby Medford and several detectives in April and July. Kagonyera's suit cost the county $515,000. Wilcoxson's cost $5.1 million. The overall price to settle with the five men who say they were wrongfully accused in the 2000 murder of Walter Bowman came to $7.9 million. That included attorney fees to defend Medford and civil litigation. Insurance picked up $2.9 million, while county taxpayers were on the hook for $5 million.\n\nRelated:How the county's settlements were tied to Wanda Greene's fraud\n\nCodd murders: Cristie Schoen Codd, 38, and Joseph “J.T.” Codd, 45, were reported missing March 15 by family members. Acting on leads generated from a tip, investigators the next day found human remains in a wood stove on the property of Robert Jason Owens, about a mile from the Codds’ home. That led to his arrest. In 2017, Owens, 37, admitted killing them and also pleaded guilty to two counts of dismembering human remains. Owens' name has also been linked to the disappearance of Zebb Quinn, who was last seen Jan. 2, 2000.\n\nMore:All our coverage of Owens, the Codds and Quinn\n\nDouble murder: In late October and November, the city was gripped by the disappearance and later discovery of the double murder of Alexandra Diz and Tatianna King, who were found in the French Broad River after a week of searching.

In November 2017, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life in prison without parole.\n\nCity time capsule: Asheville unearthed a time capsule from underneath Vance Monument, placed there in 1897 when the obelisk was constructed and dedicated. It was wedged beneath a Masonic cornerstone block at the base. Among the capsule's contents: the only known copy of The Colored Enterprise, a newspaper representing about a third of Asheville's population in its day.\n\nRelated:Dear future, a letter from 2015 and Asheville's past\n\nLake Julian power plant’s future: In May, Duke Energy Progress announced it would build a natural gas facility at Lake Julian, replacing a decades-old coal-fired plant. (That new plant is set to be online anytime now, as 2020 dawns.) Environmentalists and local officials hailed the announcement. Duke then announced plans for a 45-mile transmission line from Campobello, South Carolina, to Lake Julian to guarantee backup power for the plant. Caught off guard by the \"volume and intensity\" of opposition, the utility dropped those plans in November. Duke instead decided to change plans to reconfigure the existing plant with two smaller gas-burning units.\n\nMore:Duke Energy's new $893 million natural gas plant to open in late 2019\n\nWaking Life controversy: In September, West Asheville's Waking Life Espresso became embroiled in controversy after its co-owners chronicled their graphic sexual conquests of women in forums they believed were anonymous.

One-term Incumbent Mark Hunt lost his re-election bid, landing fifth in the voting.\n\n2016: Wildfires burn thousands of acres of WNC, HB2 met with significant pushback\n\nWildfires: In the fall of 2016, WNC was on fire. The Party Rock Fire in near Lake Lure and Chimney Rock spread across 7,142 acres of state park land and private property starting Nov. 5 and burned for a month. Miraculously, no life was lost.\n\nBut the bigger fires were farther west, blowing across the Pisgah and Nantahala national forests, state parks and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. They began with the Dicks Creek Fire Oct. 23 northwest of Sylva. The Boteler Peak Fire started Oct. 25 on Boteler Peak near Old Highway 64 east of Murphy, which was the only fire to be started by lightning strike. The Tellico Fire and Rock Mount Fire burned the largest at 14,000 and 24,000 acres, respectively.\n\nAnd on the Tennessee side of the Smokies, the wildfire toll was devastating. Fires raged through Gatlinburg on Nov. 28, killing 14 people, injuring nearly 200 others and damaging nearly 2,500 homes and businesses for a total estimated cost that could exceed a billion dollars.\n\nJerry Williams shooting: Jai Lateef Solveig Williams, 35, was shot and killed by Asheville police Sgt. Tyler Radford on July 2 at Deaverview Apartments, a subsidized housing complex in West Asheville. The case sparked questions over whether a white officer used excessive force in shooting Williams, who was black. It led to a series of rallies and meetings, including an overnight protest in APD headquarters, intended to address fears that race and poverty played a role. On Dec. 22, Buncombe County District Attorney Todd Williams announced his finding that the shooting was justified.\n\nMore:Timeline of Jerry Williams shooting and aftermath\n\nHB2: North Carolina House Bill 2, which became known simply as \"HB2,\" was enacted in March, requiring schools and other government agencies to designate restrooms designed for use by more than one person at a time for either male or female use. And it required transgender people to use the restroom of the sex listed on their birth certificate. It was met with swift and significant pushback, including the loss of economic development deals, events by the ACC, NCAA and NBA, as well as major musicians and more. A compromise to repeal parts of the bill was reached in 2017, but opposition remained.\n\n2016 election: Politics is local, and the 2016 election of Donald Trump was no exception. WNC voters cited health care, a stagnant economy, Supreme Court nominations and a healthy distaste for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton as reasons to get a Republican into the White House. A September visit by candidate Trump drew a significant crowd to downtown Asheville with scuffles and protests in and outside the U.S. Cellular Center. The case of a disabled woman who said she was struck during a protest, drew national news. On the state level, the governor's mansion flipped to a Democrat, with the ouster of Gov. Pat McCrory in favor of Roy Cooper.\n\nWater fight: Asheville fought off a years-long attempt to seize its water system by the Republican-majority General Assembly. In 2013 the state legislature said because the city system included some smaller noncity systems that had been added during the Great Depression, the water infrastructure should now be given to the Buncombe County Metropolitan Sewerage District. But in December 2016 the N.C. Supreme Court invalidated the law, saying the city should keep control.\n\nI-26 Connector: After years of designing, negotiating and delays, the North Carolina Department of Transportation made a decision on the route of the I-26 Connector through the west side of Asheville. In May, it picked Alternative 4B, the most expensive option but one that achieves longtime goals of many area residents who favor alternative modes of transportation and a boulevard-style connection between West Asheville and downtown.\n\nMore:In the path of I-26 Connector, residents and businesses see an unsettling future\n\nEyes on Asheville: The region became even more alluring for tourists, punctuated by Lonely Planet naming Asheville its top U.S. destination for 2017.\n\nWest Asheville HGTV dream home: A modest bungalow came to stardom after its transformation into a high-dollar \"Urban Oasis\" through an HGTV show.

Cecil dies: The man who brought his family's home, the Biltmore Estate, back from the brink died in October at age 89. The grandson of the estate's famous founder, George Washington Vanderbilt III, he devoted himself to the estate's preservation, and he was determined to make it self-supporting. The 8,000 acres, including the French-style chateau and on-site attractions such as the Antler Hill Village retail area and a winery now host more than 1.4 million tourists annually, but during the mid-20th century the estate struggled financially. Cecil was 89.

Billy Graham was called home, dying at his Montreat home surrounded by family. His funeral a week later would draw dignitaries, including most living presidents.\n\nJohnnie Rush: Body camera footage obtained by the Citizen Times and published on Feb. 28 showed a black man, Johnnie Rush, being beaten by a white APD officer, Christopher Hickman, after Rush was accused of jaywalking. The incident occurred in August 2017, but many city officials learned of it only after the publication of the video and an accompanying story. Hickman would be arrested and the city would reach a $650,000 settlement with Rush. In 2019, Hickman pleaded guilty to felony assault. He will serve no jail time if a unique — and controversial — restorative justice program is completed.\n\nWest Asheville shooting: In April, a mother and two of her children were shot to death in their West Asheville home before the shooter turned the gun on himself. Erica Nichelle Smith, a 32-year-old mother of six, was dead. Three of Smith's children also were injured. Police say Smith's boyfriend, 35-year-old Maurice Garner, was the shooter. He was found near the home with a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n\nHooper resigns: In the wake of a white officer’s beating of a black pedestrian accused of jaywalking — captured by body camera video — Tammy Hooper in November announced she would resign as police chief, effective in early 2018. During her tenure, she made major changes in the department’s organizational structure, oversaw a drop of 2.5 percent in property crimes from 2016-17, and added officers on downtown patrol. But she struggled to establish good relationships with minority communities. Violent crime climbed from 2015-17. A police intelligence monitoring operation of civil rights groups Asheville Black Lives Matter and Showing Up for Racial Justice drew fire from community groups and some City Council members. And a civil rights group analyzing city data found 24% of traffic stops involved African-American drivers, though blacks are 12% of the population.\n\nMission sale: In August, Mission Health announced it had agreed to be acquired by HCA Healthcare for a staggering $1.5 billion. Attorney General Josh Stein would approve the deal in January, after protections were added for rural hospitals.\n\nA-B Tech taxes: Records revealed that about 20% of all revenue generated by a tax that community leaders promised would fund a $130 million building plan at A-B Tech when they pitched it to county voters in 2011 was actually spent on capital projects. In fat, more than $400,000 of sales tax revenue that officials said would fund only new construction at Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community College instead was diverted to pay county employees, including corrupt administrators Wanda Greene and Jon Creighton.\n\nCancer kills firefighter: The cancer death of Asheville firefighter Will Willis was ruled a “line of duty death” by the N.C. Industrial Commission. In only the second time in state history, the ruling meant his family would receive disability benefits and Willis’ name will be added to a state memorial in Raleigh. The ruling also further validated the growing crisis of cancer as the leading cause of death among firefighters. Nearly a year later, in September 2019, the January death of Assistant Fire Marshal Karen Shuart, 58, from ovarian cancer and cancer in her intestines was also ruled in the line of duty.\n\nCity Council districts: A bill that established district elections for five of seven seats on Asheville City Council beginning in 2020 became law in June. It also did away with primary elections for council, providing for only one round of balloting on Election Day, and changes the years in which council elections were to be held. (See 2019.)\n\nQuentin Miller elected:Buncombe County voted in a new sheriff in November, after Van Duncan decided to retire with 12 years under his belt. The 25-year veteran of the Asheville Police Department clinched the seat after a hard-fought battle with Shad Higgins, the owner of a Weaverville tire and wheel shop. He is the county's first African American sheriff.\n\n2019: Mission becomes part of HCA, hotel moratorium set for one year\n\nMission sale closes: Mission Health officially became part of HCA Healthcare, with the closing of the landmark sale. The Tennessee-based hospital giant finalized its acquisition of the Asheville health system on Jan. 31, ending roughly a year of negotiations with a $1.5 billion deal that could have far-reaching impacts on the future of health care in WNC. The deal placed Mission's six-hospital system and its nearly 12,000 employees under the umbrella of for-profit HCA.\n\nBuncombe County officials sentenced: Former Buncombe County manager Wanda Greene, along with assistant managers Mandy Stone and Jon Creighton, Business Intelligence Manager Michael Greene and longtime engineering contractor Joe Wiseman, were sentenced on Aug. 28. Wanda Greene was given 7 years in prison and ordered to pay a $100,000 fine. U.S. District Judge Robert Conrad called the 68-year-old the \"architect\" of a culture of corruption in Buncombe County and said Greene engaged in \"out-of-control criminal activity\" despite her nearly $250,000 annual salary and generous retirement benefits as a county employee.\n\nDogwood Health Trust names leader: The foundation born out of the proceeds of the Mission Hospital sale named its first CEO in August. Antony Chang, founding president of Empire Health Foundation in Spokane, Washington, was picked from a pool of approximately 125 applicants. He will formally join the new foundation in November.\n\nEllen Frost indicted: An 11-count grand jury indictment on July 16 charged former Buncombe County Commissioner Ellen Frost with conspiracy, federal program fraud and mail fraud. The most serious charges against her carry a maximum prison term of 20 years and a $250,000 fine. Frost, a Black Mountain Democrat who served as a commissioner for about six years, pleaded not guilty July 31 to fraud and conspiracy charges. She requested a jury trial.\n\nAPD chief hired, quits: After just two months on the job, Asheville Police Chief Chris Bailey announced his resignation, citing a desire to return to family in Indianapolis. City manager Debra Campbell hired him in June, and he started July 29. He replaced former Chief Tammy Hooper, who resigned following turmoil over the police beating of a black pedestrian and news she ordered an intelligence operation to monitor local civil rights groups. A 15-year-old criminal incident could have cost Bailey his job shortly after he was hired, preventing him from being certified as a law enforcement officer in North Carolina.\n\nHotel moratorium: On Sept. 24, after months — if not years — of growing outcry over continued hotel building, Asheville City Council voted in a yearlong moratorium. As of fall 2019, hotels approved since 2015 included 2,761 hotel rooms, with 39% of them downtown, according to the city. Less than half have opened, with the rest under construction or slated to be built. Over the course of the year, City Council members intend to seek counsel on smarter development strategies to offer developers more reliable expectations.\n\nCity Council district elections: In its Oct. 22 meeting, City Council approved ordinances to amend Asheville's charter, reversing a state-imposed election system instituting new districts planned to take effect for the 2020 election.

A vault called “Old Glory Lookout” has been added to Cheaha State Park in Delta and will be dedicated Tuesday, on the 80th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor. The vault will hold the remains of old U.S. flags, which are supposed to be destroyed by fire. A statement from Alabama’s state park system said the container consists of a steel vault encased in quartzite that was cut by members of the Civil Conservation Corps, a New Deal program formed in the 1930s under then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The vault is on the eastern slope of a ridge near a public boardwalk. The project is a joint effort between an American Legion post in Atmore and the park, located about 80 miles east of Birmingham. Paul Chason, adjutant for the American Legion post, said military, veteran and civic organizations will be able to inter flag ashes at the site. “We believe it is the first of its kind in America,” he said. Flags that were retired and burned during a ceremony on the 20th anniversary of the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, will be placed in the vault during the ceremony Tuesday.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The Matanuska-Susitna Borough is suing the Alaska Redistricting Board over recently drawn legislative boundaries that it says dilutes the votes of its residents. The lawsuit – brought on behalf of the borough and Michael Brown, the borough manager – was filed Thursday, their attorney Stacey Stone said. The board finalized its maps Nov. 10, triggering a 30-day period in which challenges could be filed. The board was charged with rewriting Alaska’s political boundaries following the 2020 census. The lawsuit cites concerns with the degree to which the target population for House districts was exceeded in the region and says two shared districts, with Valdez and parts of the Denali Borough, ignore “logical, municipal, and natural boundaries.” Peter Torkelson, the board’s executive director, said the board “will review any legal challenges with our counsel and then respond through the court system as contemplated by the Alaska Constitution.” A plan proposed by the Matanuska-Susitna Borough included four full House and two shared House districts. It did not seek to be paired with Valdez in one of the shared districts. Officials with the borough and Valdez argued against such a pairing.\n\nArizona\n\nScottsdale: A high school principal will not be back next year after a firestorm over a summer book assignment. The Paradise Valley Unified School District governing board voted Thursday not to renew the contract of Linda Ihnat, principal at Horizon High School. Ihnat failed to follow procedure when it came to informing parents about sensitive content in a book, according to board members. The book, “So You’ve Been Publicly Shamed” by Jon Ronson, was an option on an Advanced Placement English reading list last summer. The book examines victims of social media mobs and so-called cancel culture. Controversy erupted last month after some parents became aware of sexual content in the book, including references to orgies and bestiality. Ihnat was put on leave. Superintendent Troy Bales issued an apology letter to parents Nov. 16. He wrote that the book was not on a district approved literature list, nor was it age-appropriate. He also promised better reinforcement of procedures when it comes to relaying assigned books to parents. Several parents and students – some with signs – showed up to Thursday’s meeting to give public comment. Some protested and called for the teacher to be fired. But others argued that the sexual content was only a small portion of the book and that teachers should be given more discretion.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: A computer used by Josh Duggar at work contained child pornography behind a partition that allowed the user to circumvent an application that monitors internet use, and metadata indicates the images were downloaded when the former reality TV star was working, computer forensics experts testified. Duggar, 33, is charged with receiving and possessing child pornography and faces up to 20 years in prison on each count if convicted. His federal trial began last week in northwest Arkansas. Defense attorneys for Duggar have argued that someone else downloaded or placed the child pornography onto the work computer, noting that no child pornography was found on Duggar’s phone or laptop. But federal prosecutors have detailed logs showing, minute by minute, the activity on Duggar’s computer that alternated between him sending personal messages, downloading child porn and saving pictures of notes. On Thursday, Justice Department computer expert James Fottrell testified that a Linux open-source operating system and a browser capable of encryption were installed behind a partition on the used-car dealership’s desktop computer. That essentially split the hard drive into a public-facing side that was business-related and included the tracking program and a secret second side using Linux and the browser, experts said. This allowed anyone using the computer to evade an accountability program installed to report to Duggar’s wife about inappropriate internet activity, such as searching for pornography.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A stench that emanated from a flood-control channel in a Los Angeles suburb and triggered thousands of complaints resulted from chemicals that flowed from a storage yard during a fire and caused vegetation to decay, air regulators said Friday. The South Coast Air Quality Management District said in a statement that it issued notices of violation to four companies and Los Angeles County, which is responsible for maintaining Dominguez Channel. The notices allege the emissions of hydrogen sulfide caused a public nuisance. The fire began Sept. 30 at a warehouse property in Carson where two companies stored large amounts of wellness and beauty products, and chemicals including ethanol subsequently flowed into the channel, the district said. Complaints of a rotten-egg stench began Oct. 3 and eventually came from thousands of people in at least a half-dozen communities in the area. The air district sent violation notices to two companies’ whose products were involved, the company that owns the property and its parent company, and LA County. Prologis Inc., the parent of the company that owns the property, said in a statement that it was working with the Los Angeles County Fire Department to safeguard the property from stormwater runoff and to clean up the fire debris.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The Mile High City’s winter has started with a whimper, and the parched mountains to the west aren’t faring much better. Denver has already shattered its 87-year-old record for the latest measurable snowfall, set on Nov. 21, 1934, and it’s days away from breaking an 1887 record of 235 consecutive days without snow. The scenario is playing out across much of the Rocky Mountains, as the West at large is experiencing a megadrought that studies link to human-caused climate change. The warm, dry weather has drawn crowds to restaurant and bar patios in Denver, and the city’s parks and trails have been bustling with people basking in the sunshine in shorts, short sleeves and occasionally flip flops. As enjoyable as the weather is, climate scientists and meteorologists are warning that prolonged drought could threaten the region’s water supply and agriculture industry. It also could hurt tourism, which relies heavily on skiers, snowboarders, rafters and anglers. “Every day that goes by that we don’t see precipitation show up, and we see this year-to-year persistence of drought conditions, it just adds to a deficit. And we continue to add to this deficit year after year, particularly in the Colorado River Basin,” said Keith Musselman, a hydrologist at the University of Colorado-Boulder.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNorwalk: Multiple students at a southwestern Connecticut high school were hospitalized after using a vaping product at school. WABC-TV reports police responded to the school Friday afternoon after receiving a report of a student needing medical attention. Officers found several students had used a vaping product that appeared to have been tainted somehow and made the students very ill. The Brien McMahon High School students were taken to Norwalk Hospital for treatment. The Norwalk Public Schools district did not immediately respond to a message Saturday seeking an update on the students and more information about the incident. Police warned parents to discuss the dangers of vaping products with their children and said they can be tainted with dangerous or deadly chemicals.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A federal judge on Friday rejected a request by the University of Delaware to allow the state Supreme Court to weigh in on a lawsuit over coronavirus restrictions imposed by school officials last year. The judge ruled in August that current and former students could pursue claims that the university breached contractual obligations and unjustly enriched itself by halting in-person classes and shutting down the campus last spring. The plaintiffs are seeking partial refunds of their spring 2020 tuition and fees. Judge Stephanos Bibas said in his August ruling that the students had plausibly alleged the school promised them in-person classes, activities and services. “True, the school never promised them expressly. But promises need not be express to be enforceable,” he wrote. “By its statements and history of offering classes in person, the school may have implied a promise to stay in person.” Following that ruling, the university sought to petition the Delaware Supreme Court for a determination on whether state law permits an implied contract to be formed between a university and a student where an express written contract exists. The university also wanted the court to determine whether any implied terms sought by a student are limited to those involving “good faith and fair dealing.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Holiday decorations unveiled last week for Joe and Jill Biden’s first White House Christmas honor front-line workers who persevered during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nurses, doctors, teachers, grocery store workers and others are recognized in this year’s gigantic Gingerbread White House, which was made into a 350-pound gingerbread village with the addition of a school and police, fire and gas stations, as well as a hospital, a post office, a grocery store and a warehouse to honor workers who stayed on the job. Fewer people are likely to see the decked-out mansion in person this year, with public tours still suspended because of the continuing threat from COVID-19. But videos, photos and other details are available at WhiteHouse.gov/Holidays. “Gifts from the Heart” is the theme. In remarks thanking volunteers for decorating, the first lady explained the vision behind her theme, speaking of unity and her view that everyone comes together around faith, family and friendship, gratitude and service, and love for one’s community. Front-line workers are also represented in the iridescent doves and shooting stars that illuminate the East Colonnade hallway, “representing the peace and light brought to us by all the front-line workers and first responders during the pandemic,” the guidebook says.\n\nFlorida\n\nGainesville: Nearly two decades after earning a place in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and more than four years after his death, rock icon Tom Petty has been awarded an honorary Ph.D. from the University of Florida. The school’s board of trustees unanimously voted to award Thomas Earl Petty a posthumous doctoral degree in music during a Friday meeting. Born and raised in Gainesville, Petty once worked as a groundskeeper at UF as he tried to make it in the music industry, but he was never enrolled. Petty passed away from an accidental drug overdose in October 2017. Days later during a UF home football game, the song “I Won’t Back Down” was played at the stadium as a memorial to Petty. The song has since become a regular feature at Gators games. Usually backed by the Heartbreakers, Petty broke through in the 1970s and went on to sell more than 80 million records, featuring hits like “Free Fallin,’ ” “Refugee” and “American Girl.” Petty and the Heartbreakers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The University of Georgia is asking regents to name two buildings for some of the university’s earliest Black graduates. Last week’s proposal followed a decision by the University System of Georgia regents not to remove names of any people associated with slavery, segregation or the mistreatment of Native Americans from 75 buildings statewide. University President Jere Morehead said UGA would seek to name its existing science library for Shirley Mathis McBay, the first African American to earn a doctorate from the university. UGA also is asking regents to name a dormitory under construction for Harold A. Black, Mary Blackwell Diallo and Kerry Rushin Miller. They were the first three African American students to enroll at UGA as freshmen and graduate. Regents decide the names of buildings and facilities at all of Georgia’s 26 public universities and colleges. Their next scheduled meeting is in January. “Through these namings, we acknowledge the importance of these pioneers in the history of our institution,” Morehead said in a statement. “We celebrate their remarkable achievements and recognize the profoundly positive, lasting impact they have made on the University of Georgia.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Amid a continuing crisis over fuel contaminating the Navy’s tap water at Pearl Harbor, Honolulu’s water utility said Friday that it shut off one of its wells so it doesn’t taint its own supply with petroleum from an underground aquifer it shares with the military. The Honolulu Board of Water Supply said it acted shortly after the Navy on Thursday disclosed that a water sample from one of its wells had shown the presence of petroleum. The well is near a giant World War II-era underground fuel tank complex that has been the source of multiple fuel leaks over the years. The tap water problems have afflicted one of the military’s most important bases, home to submarines, ships and the commander of U.S. forces in the Indo-Pacific region. They also threaten to jeopardize one of Honolulu’s most important aquifers and water sources. Nearly 1,000 military households have complained about their tap water smelling like fuel or of physical ailments like stomach cramps and vomiting. The Navy water system serves 93,000 people. The Navy said Thursday that it would flush clean water through its distribution system to clear residual petroleum products from the water, followed by testing to make sure the water meets Environmental Protection Agency drinking standards. The Navy said it will investigate how contaminants got into the well and fix it.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Far-right activist Ammon Bundy says hours he spent campaigning to be the next governor should count toward his community service requirement after he was convicted of obstructing police during his arrest for trespassing at the state Capitol. Aaron Welling, Bundy’s campaign treasurer, wrote to Ada County’s 4th District Court that Bundy has “completed 1,621 hours of public service,” doing what appears to be campaign activities. In the letter submitted late last month on campaign letterhead, Welling said that Bundy has traveled the state while encouraging people to “become more active in holding public officials accountable” and that he encouraged people to register to vote. When asked by phone whether the letter described community service or campaign activities, Welling told the Idaho Press newspaper: “It is what it is. If the courts don’t like it, the courts don’t like it.” Bundy was convicted of misdemeanor trespassing and resisting or obstructing officers during a jury trial earlier this summer. He was ordered to pay more than $1000 in fines and sentenced to a few days in jail, but the sentence was commuted to 40 hours of public service to be completed within 6 months. The conviction stemmed from Bundy’s Aug. 25, 2020, arrest after he refused to leave an auditorium in the Statehouse that officials ordered cleared.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A civil rights attorney joined Jelani Day’s mother Friday to demand the FBI take charge of an investigation into why the Illinois State University graduate student disappeared in August and was later found dead in a river. Ben Crump told a news conference at Rainbow PUSH headquarters in Chicago that the Justice Department must step in and investigate Day’s death as urgently as it has probed cases of suspected foul play involving white victims, such as Gabby Petito. Crump, who is Black, gained prominence by representing the families of victims of police brutality and vigilante violence. “We will make him a priority,” Crump said Friday of Day. “There is a killer out there on the loose of this young Black man, and we need to find him.” A coroner determined in October that Day died from drowning but said it was unclear how the 25-year-old had gone into the Illinois River, 60 miles north of Bloomington, where he was last seen. LaSalle County’s coroner said an autopsy on Day found no evidence of “manual strangulation, an assault or altercation, sharp, blunt or gunshot injury.” Authorities have said his death remains under investigation. But Day’s mother, Carmen Bolden Day, said law enforcement officials have all but told her they believe her son died by suicide, which she dismissed out of hand.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette: The two Indiana-raised turkeys given Thanksgiving pardons by President Joe Biden are now at their new Purdue University home. The turkeys arrived last week and were welcomed by visitors on the West Lafayette campus’ Memorial Mall. The turkeys named Peanut Butter and Jelly will live at Purdue’s Animal Sciences Research and Education Center, where the school says they’ll spend their days in an enclosed setting with access to a shaded grassy area. Animal sciences professor Marisa Erasmus told WLFI-TV that having the turkeys on campus will provide a chance to explain more about the birds. Indiana ranks fourth in the country in turkey production, according to Purdue. The two turkeys were raised by Jasper, Indiana-based Farbest Farms, which says it oversees the raising of about 15 million turkeys each year with growers in Indiana, Illinois and Kentucky. The birds were featured in a Nov. 19 ceremony at the White House during which Biden continued the annual tradition of sparing them from the fate met by millions of turkeys on Thanksgiving Day.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, launched in 2015 by the Iowa Attorney General’s Office, has finally worked through the state’s evidence kit backlog, Attorney General Tom Miller announced last week. Iowa received $3 million in federal grant money to tackle its backlog, with roughly 3,800 untested evidence kits collected prior to April 2015, including some dating back to the 1990s. The initiative worked with a private lab to test 1,606 of those kits, resulting in 852 valid DNA samples and 290 matches with other DNA profiles in federal databases. Twenty-six of those belonged to people previously convicted of sex crimes. Others were referred to local prosecutors and have so far resulted in four criminal cases and two convictions. In announcing the conclusion of the project Tuesday, Miller touted not only the hard work of sorting out the backlog but also procedural changes and additional staffing that will allow the state to process sexual assault evidence faster, with more transparency to victims, and without allowing another backlog to develop despite an 87% increase in kits submitted to the state lab for testing. “We’ve gone from a backlog that was a significant problem to a system where it takes eight weeks to test – and it can be tracked during that eight weeks,” Miller said.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Dr. Lee Norman, who led the state through the coronavirus pandemic until his abrupt departure last month, has said in an interview that he was “Fauci’d” out by COVID-19 politics. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly announced Nov. 19 that Norman had stepped down both as top administrator at the state Department of Health and Environment and as state health officer. He had been the health department’s top administrator since Kelly took office in January 2019. He was replaced quickly by Janet Stanek, a longtime hospital administrator from Topeka. But in an interview with Kansas News Service published Tuesday, Norman said he resigned because he was asked. He cited constant friction between the governor and the Republican-led Legislature. “The shameful treatment in the Trump administration of public health leaders, I think, set the stage for having the same thing happen at the state level,” Norman said, citing frequent criticism from the right of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert. Referring to the constant criticism, Norman said: “To be honest with you, I think I was Fauci’d.” Kelly, in announcing Norman’s departure, praised him as “the most consequential” leader in the department’s history.\n\nKentucky\n\nMurray: A century-old Confederate statue outside a western Kentucky courthouse has been vandalized with red paint, authorities said. The incident involving a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee outside the Calloway County Courthouse was reported Thursday morning, Sheriff Nicky Knight told the Murray Ledger and Times. The monument had red paint on its base as well as the statue of Lee atop it before volunteers with Sons of Confederate Veterans and other community members cleaned it, news outlets report. The statue had drawn calls for its removal last year, including a resolution from the Murray City Council asking county officials to “expeditiously remove and relocate” the monument. County officials decided to keep it, saying it was erected to honor residents who fought for the Confederacy and not, “as several have argued, for the purpose of promoting continued oppression.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nHolly Beach: Dredging has begun for a marsh creation project in southwestern Louisiana. The Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority said the Great Lakes Dredge and Dock is expected to complete the 308 acres of marsh in January in Cameron Parish northwest of Holly Beach. “The project will restore critical habitat for fish, wildlife, and the people and communities who depend on those resources,” the authority’s executive director, Bren Haase, said Thursday. This is the second phase of a $3 million project that started by creating 2.3 miles of terraces to slow waves. The agency says those were finished in June. The area has been hit hard by subsidence, drought, surges from storms including Hurricane Rita in 2005, and saltwater retention caused by poor drainage resulting from silted-in canals. The authority said 1.9 million cubic yards of sediment will be pumped from the Gulf of Mexico to make the new marsh. “The Cameron Meadows project will fortify the natural buffer that protects southwest Louisiana from storm surge while restoring hundreds of acres of coastal marsh habitat lost due to hurricanes and other factors,” agency chairman Chip Kline said.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: An abandoned Maine Central Railroad Company corridor is being converted to a new multiuse trail. The Madison Branch spans 32 miles across Kennebec and Somerset Counties and will connect with the Maine Interconnected Trail System and Maine ATV Trail System, officials said. “Snowmobiles and ATVs are as much a part of the Maine outdoor experience as hiking boots, snowshoes, and skis,” said Democratic Gov. Janet Mills. “My administration has listened to our off-road recreational vehicle riding community who wants to be able to travel long distances, legally and safely, and have a good time.” The Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry completed the purchase in November from Pan Am Railways at the cost of just over $1 million.\n\nMaryland\n\nPoolesville: A home was accidentally burned to the ground by an owner trying to get rid of a snake infestation, officials said. The homeowner in Poolesville, a town about 25 miles outside Washington, D.C., was attempting to use smoke to purge the snakes from the house, according to Montgomery County Fire Department officials. In the process, the homeowner caught the house on fire, causing about $1 million in damage, The Washington Post reports. The fire broke out about 10 p.m. Nov. 23, officials said. Pete Piringer, a spokesman for the county fire department, said on Twitter that 75 firefighters were called to put out the blaze that started in the basement. Piringer said that the fire, caused by placing coals too close to combustible material, was accidental and that no people were hurt. But he said the well-being of the snakes was “undetermined.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Middle and high school students would learn about the history of genocide and human rights issues under a bill signed into law by Gov. Charlie Baker last week. The bill requires middle schools and high schools in the state to include instruction on the history of genocide. The legislation comes as incidences of hate and antisemitism are on the rise across the country, with several incidents reported in Massachusetts over the past year, according to supporters of the legislation. Massachusetts has not required education on the Holocaust or other genocides as part of its classroom curriculum. Lawmakers renewed the push for mandating education about the history of genocide earlier this year after a Duxbury high school football coach was fired following reports that the team used antisemitic language, including a mention of Auschwitz, in its on-field play calling. This bill would create a Genocide Education Trust Fund to support the development of teaching materials and to provide professional development training for educators. The legislation would also require school districts to annually file a description of their lesson plan and programs to educate students about genocides with the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state Senate on Thursday unanimously approved $3.3 billion in water infrastructure spending to replace lead pipes and repair aging dams around the state while also sending money to a Detroit-area system that has struggled with flooding blamed on climate change. The House will next consider the massive influx of aid, likely in the new year. It includes about $2.4 billion in federal funding – $1.4 billion from the infrastructure law enacted last month and nearly $1 billion from the pandemic rescue law passed in March. Senators initially proposed $600 million to replace service lines that can leach lead into drinking water if the supply isn’t properly treated. They upped it to $1 billion following the passage of the federal infrastructure bill. Benton Harbor currently is grappling with elevated lead levels in homes. The Natural Resources Defense Council has estimated Michigan has 460,000 lead pipes in the ground, the third-most in the country. State regulations, made tougher following Flint’s water crisis, generally require that every line be replaced by 2040 – which could cost $2.5 billion in today’s dollars.\n\nMinnesota\n\nDuluth: The U.S. Forest Service plans to reduce the number of entry permits for the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness next year, citing damage to natural resources, crowding and congestion. The Forest Service didn’t say how many permits would be eliminated, nor which entry points into the million-acre wilderness would be affected. Superior National Forest spokeswoman Joanna Gilkeson said the reduction will be spread across the entire wilderness, with a focus on more popular entry points and lakes where visitors have complained over the years about resource damage and an inability to find campsites. The number of visitors to the Boundary Waters has surged amid the COVID-19 pandemic as people look for more outdoor recreation. Nearly 166,000 people visited the BWCA in 2020, a 16% jump from the previous year and the most in at least a decade, according to the U.S. Forest Service. The number of permits issued jumped from about 25,000 to more than 30,000, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. The increased popularity played a role in what Forest Service officials said was “unprecedented natural resource damage,” including cutting of trees, littering, and improper disposal of human waste. There were also reports of increased crowding and noise levels, plus disruptive, oversized groups.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A federal judge has declared that a state law allowing landlords to seize tenants’ belongings during the eviction process is unconstitutional. In his Tuesday order, U.S. District Judge Michael P. Mills called the Mississippi law “unpredictable and absurd” and said it goes further than eviction statutes in any other state in the U.S. Under current law, “Mississippi tenants who overstay their lease may be confronted with the loss of virtually everything they own, even cherished belongings such as family photos and diplomas which have no discernable economic value to the lessor,” Mills wrote. Mills was tasked with reviewing Mississippi’s law after Columbus resident Samantha Conner filed a lawsuit last year against an apartment rental company, the apartment’s owner and manager, and the Lowndes County constable. She was aided by a low-income housing clinic at the University of Mississippi School of Law. When she was evicted in 2019, Conner said, her landlord changed the locks on her apartment and refused to let her take any of her belongings from inside, including her computer and hard drive needed for her work as a paralegal, keepsakes from when her son was a baby, family photographs and personal records. Many of her personal items were later discarded by her landlord.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: A state health department analysis shows cities that have required masks to combat the coronavirus pandemic this year saw fewer infections, but Republican Gov. Mike Parson insisted Thursday that mandates don’t work. The analysis was first reported Wednesday by The Missouri Independent and the Documenting COVID-19 project at the Brown Institute for Media Innovation following an open-records request. Parson’s office asked the health department for information on the impact of mask mandates on infections, according to emails obtained in the request. In response, the agency last month compared infection rates in urban centers, where mask mandates were in place, with rural areas between April and November. The data shows that cities with mask mandates saw fewer infections and deaths across the board. Parson on Thursday responded to the Independent’s report with a scathing 12-part Twitter thread attacking the reporter. He described the article as “purposefully misleading” and said it left out important context. “There is no definite evidence that proves mandates solely saved lives and prevented COVID-19 infections in Missouri’s biggest cities,” Parson said. He added that mask mandates “do not work and can have collateral health consequences.”\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Helium prospecting is picking up in north-central Montana, with Canadian companies expanding south after years of development in Saskatchewan and Alberta. Montana oil and gas records show at least two companies drilling wells in an area spanning Toole, Hill and Liberty counties. Developers say geological formations on the U.S. side of the border share similarities with areas in Canada where helium development has become part of a larger plan for long-term economic development. “It all goes back to geology,” Genga Nadaraju, Avanti Energy vice president of subsurface geology, told The Billings Gazette. “Helium is the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium. It comes up from basement rock. Helium is everywhere, but in that area, there are higher concentrations of helium and the right geological conditions. We have reservoir rock, we have structure and we have a seal where you can trap it.” Drilling information at the Montana Board of Oil, Gas and Conservation shows development in potential helium sites. Permit holders have six months to show the state what they’re drilling for, but companies are disclosing Montana development to would-be investors.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: U.S. Rep. Don Bacon is among a list of Republicans being targeted by former President Donald Trump, who is calling for a “Republican patriot” to challenge the Omaha lawmaker in next year’s primary election. On Wednesday, Trump reiterated in a statement his call for Bacon and 12 other lawmakers to face primary challenges, the Omaha World-Herald reports. Trump has targeted Bacon for his vote last month in support of President Joe Biden’s $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill. Bacon was one of 13 House Republicans who voted for the bill. Bacon’s campaign said Wednesday that Trump is “entitled to his views” but that the congressman “has a strong record of delivering results for the people of Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District.” Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts also issued a statement Wednesday defending Bacon, saying the congressman “has served our country honorably, he has done a good job serving the 2nd Congressional District, and has earned their trust time after time.” So far, no primary challenger has filed to run against Bacon. At least two Democrats – state Sen. Tony Vargas, of Omaha, and Omaha therapist and mental health advocate Alisha Shelton – have announced their candidacies for the seat.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: In a federal effort to forcibly assimilate Native Americans into Euro-American culture, more than 20,000 students were sent to the Stewart Indian School, among more than 350 residential schools that the U.S. Interior Department plans to examine as part of the Federal Boarding School Initiative Review. On Friday, Gov. Steve Sisolak heard stories from tribal elders about the school’s history. The governor, tribal leaders, state agency heads and Interior officials discussed ways the state – which funded the school’s construction and helped gather children to send there – can contribute to the federal efforts to confront historic injustices and intergenerational trauma and honor the children who died at boarding schools. Descendants of Paiute, Washoe and Shoshone people who attended Stewart during the 90 years it was in operation told stories of bounties being offered to bring Native children to the school; of students attempting to run away due to starvation; and of extreme overcrowding in dormitories. The governor apologized on behalf of the state and promised to fully cooperate with the Interior Department and its first Native American secretary, Deb Haaland, as they review records and investigate the federal government’s past policies and oversight of Native American boarding schools.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated a long-brewing mental health crisis for the state’s children, particularly those whose illness manifests as aggression, according to the latest annual report by a state watchdog agency. The 2021 report released Thursday by the Office of the Child Advocate highlights the state’s recent rollout of community-based services to prevent psychiatric hospitalizations and the long waits in emergency rooms that often precede them. But implementation was long delayed, and in the meantime, the pandemic further stressed children with “isolation, uncertainty and fear,” the report says. The effect was greatest on children with chronic developmental disabilities or those whose illness was so neglected or aggravated that they became assaultive or aggressive, according to the report. Moira O’Neill, the child advocate, said such children have been systemically excluded from acute psychiatric care at Hampstead Hospital, the private psychiatric hospital that the state is in the process of purchasing for children’s treatment. The state moved children from New Hampshire Hospital to Hampstead last year, but the contract excludes patients with “violent or aggressive behaviors resulting in criminal charges or serious bodily harm.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: The city will host a three-day country music concert festival next August, headlined by Luke Bryan and Morgan Wallen. The Tidalwave Music Festival will be held on the beach Aug. 12-14, 2022. An additional headliner will be announced in the coming weeks. “We knew we wanted to bring our country music festival concept to the northeast coast, but the location had to be just right,” said Brian O’Connell, president of country touring at Live Nation. “The perfect spot by the ocean in Atlantic City. We can’t wait until next summer to bring these world-class acts, alongside a tailor-made festival experience.” Also performing will be Lauren Alaina, Blanco Brown, Breland, Travis Denning, Riley Green, Lindsay Ell, Hardy, Jon Langston, Tracy Lawrence, Chase Rice, Runaway June, Elvie Shane, DeeJay Silver, Mitchell Tenpenny and Lainey Wilson. Three-day passes will go on sale beginning Dec. 13 at 10 a.m. EST at www.tidalwavefest.com.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: James Lujan has resigned as Rio Arriba County sheriff after being sentenced to prison on felony convictions of aiding a felon and intimidating a witness in 2017. Lujan submitted his resignation Thursday after being sentenced to a three-year prison term, one day after state District Court jurors convicted him following a three-day trial. A judge denied a request by Lujan’s attorney that his client remain free pending an appeal, and the 60-year-old Lujan was taken into custody by Santa Fe County sheriff’s deputies. Lujan was convicted on charges stemming from allegations he helped former Española City Councilor Philip Chacon evade police following a high-speed chase. The jury found Lujan guilty of harboring a felon for helping conceal Chacon as police were searching for him. Lujan also was found guilty of bribery of a witness for threatening one of his deputies to prevent him from revealing Chacon’s whereabouts to other officers.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A new allegation of sexual harassment against Chris Cuomo emerged just days before CNN announced it was firing the anchor amid an investigation into work he did defending his brother from similar harassment allegations. Attorney Debra Katz said Sunday that her client was the victim of “serious sexual misconduct” by Cuomo and that she had contacted CNN about the woman’s allegations Wednesday. CNN suspended Cuomo last week after details emerged about how he assisted his brother, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, as the politician faced sexual harassment allegations. Katz said the accuser decided to come forward came after the New York attorney general’s office released evidence showing Chris Cuomo had taken a much more active role than previously thought in strategizing and helping to craft a response to the allegations his brother was facing. When the initial allegations surfaced against the then-governor, Chris Cuomo had told viewers he had “always cared very deeply about these issues,” Katz said. “Hearing the hypocrisy of Chris Cuomo’s on-air words and disgusted by his efforts to try to discredit these women, my client retained counsel to report his serious sexual misconduct against her to CNN,” Katz said in the statement.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s 2022 elections under new legislative and congressional maps can begin as scheduled this week after judges on Friday rejected demands from lawsuit filers who claim the lines have to be blocked because they so egregiously favor Republicans. The refusal of a three-judge panel to issue preliminary injunctions against the boundaries drawn and approved by GOP majorities in the General Assembly last month means candidate filings for the March 8 primary may start at noon Monday. One of the lawsuits, filed by the North Carolina League of Conservation Voters, mathematicians and voters, challenges both the legislative and congressional maps. The other, filed by voters supported by a group affiliated with the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, focuses solely on the state’s U.S. House map. The judges said there was a reasonable doubt about whether the lines violated the state constitution. The plaintiffs in the League of Conservation Voters lawsuit filed an appeal notice with the state Court of Appeals late Friday. And Friday’s ruling doesn’t throw out the lawsuits that formed the basis for the injunction requests heard in Wake County court.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The cost of the state’s special five-day session last month is within the amount allotted, a legislative budget analyst said Thursday. Figures released to the Associated Press show costs incurred by taxpayers total just more than $301,000. About $316,000 was budgeted for the session, highlighted by redistricting legislation and the spending of nearly the entire amount of the $1.1 billion in federal coronavirus aid available to the state. The Republican-led Legislature also approved policy-related measures, including bills banning COVID-19 vaccine mandates and the teaching of certain concepts about race and racism in public schools. Eleven of the Legislature’s 141 members had not submitted lodging and mileage expenses as of Thursday, said Allen Knudson, the lead budget analyst at the Legislative Council, the Legislature’s research arm. “We expect the final cost of the special session to be very close to the amount budgeted,” Knudson said. Most legislators make $189 daily while in session, with an extra $10 or $15 per day for certain leaders. Each day they are in a special or reconvened session costs taxpayers about $64,000, budget writers estimate. Legislators who do not live in Bismarck or Mandan are eligible for a housing and travel allowance.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A judge on Friday refused to dismiss the 25-count murder indictment against a doctor accused of ordering excessive painkillers for hospital patients, meaning one of the biggest cases of its kind ever brought against a U.S. health care professional will proceed toward trial. William Husel, 46, has pleaded not guilty. His lawyers say he was providing comfort care for dying patients in the Columbus-area Mount Carmel Health System, not trying to kill them. Mount Carmel’s review concluded Husel ordered excessive painkillers for about three dozen patients who died over several years, but the fired doctor was charged only in cases involving at least 500 micrograms of the powerful painkiller fentanyl. The previous prosecutor on the case, who wasn’t reelected, had said using dosages that large in nonsurgical situations – for people being taken off ventilators – pointed to an intent to end lives. Husel’s attorneys argued that during the still-secret grand jury proceedings, the prosecution must have misrepresented whether such dosages would surely be deadly, and that the resulting indictment should therefore be dismissed. They noted that prosecutors had records from a patient who was not part of the indictment who received even larger dosages and survived for days.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt denied clemency Friday for a death row inmate sentenced to die for the 1985 shooting death of a Putnam City schoolteacher. The Republican governor’s decision clears the way for Bigler Stouffer II, 79, to receive a lethal injection at 10 a.m. Thursday at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester. It comes despite a 3-2 recommendation from the state’s Pardon and Parole Board that Stouffer’s sentence be commuted to life in prison without parole. Several members of the board voiced concerns about the state’s ability to humanely execute people after John Grant convulsed on the gurney and vomited during his lethal injection in October. Stouffer has maintained his innocence in the attack on Linda Reaves and her boyfriend, Doug Ivens, that left Reaves dead and Ivens seriously wounded. Stouffer was convicted and sentenced to death in 2003 after his first conviction and death sentence were overturned. He said at his parole board hearing last month that Ivens was shot as the two men fought over a gun at Ivens’ home and that Reaves was already dead when he arrived. Prosecutors said Stouffer went to the home to borrow the gun from Ivens, then fatally shot Reaves and wounded Ivens in an attempt to gain access to Ivens’ $2 million life insurance policy. At the time, Stouffer was dating Ivens’ ex-wife.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: TriMet officials say bus services will be reduced starting Jan. 9 because of an extreme shortage of bus operators. The Portland-area transit agency said TriMet would temporarily reduce service levels by 9%, meaning TriMet will shrink weekly bus service on about 20 of its 84 bus lines, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. TriMet Spokesperson Roberta Altstadt said services will be less frequent on weekdays for those lines, and most affected lines will follow Saturday schedules. Altstadt said riders should check TriMet’s online trip planner after Jan. 9. As of last week, Altstadt said the agency was short 45 operators. The agency dropped service levels by about that much in April 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic led to a nearly 70% decrease in ridership. Public transit use slowly began to increase again, but TriMet has had trouble recruiting workers – a problem it hasn’t historically faced. Altstdat said TriMet has stepped up hiring efforts. Bill Bradley, an executive board member with Amalgamated Transit Union 757, representing about 2,700 TriMet workers, said the union believes the current shortage is higher, about 60 drivers. The agency saw a rise in assaults on operators around the beginning of the pandemic, which Bradley said hasn’t decreased. The stressors and dangers have taken a toll on operators, he said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf followed through on his veto threat Thursday, rejecting Republican-penned legislation to allow people to carry a firearm openly or concealed, without a permit, adding to his total for Pennsylvania’s chief executive with the most vetoes in more than four decades. Wolf, a Democrat, called the permitless-carry bill “dangerous.” Wolf’s veto comes amid a tide of deadly gun violence in Philadelphia, the state’s largest city, and political finger-pointing over blame. Republicans said the bill would have made people safer. Wolf has said it is a top priority to address what he says is a gun violence crisis affecting largely minority communities, but the Republican-controlled Legislature has rejected nearly all his proposals. The bill he vetoed Thursday would have removed the requirement that gun owners get a permit to carry a gun that is concealed, such as under clothing or in their vehicle’s glove box. It also would have wiped out a law, applying only to Philadelphia, that requires gun owners to get a permit to openly carry a firearm in the city. According to online state records, Wolf penned his 52nd veto with 13 months left in his second term, more than any other governor since Milton Shapp, who left office in 1979.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The largest state employees’ union in Rhode Island has approved a new four-year contract that includes $3,000 COVID-19 vaccination bonuses, officials said. Council 94 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which represents about 3,800 workers, overwhelmingly approved of the deal Thursday. The contract also includes 2.5% annual raises. Union and state officials said the bonus will help retain strained public workers. “Our employees continue to provide services while shouldering increased demands because of the pandemic, and it is important we recognize those efforts and make the state an employer of choice,” state Director of Administration James Thorsen said in a statement. “This was done so that we could retain your public servants,” Council 94 Vice President Lynn Loveday said. Workers can get the bonus without being vaccinated against COVID-19 if they are granted a religious or medical exemption. The program is estimated to cost $9.6 million and will be funded with federal relief dollars. Democratic Gov. Daniel McKee told WPRI-TV that the contract “was fair to the workers and fair to the taxpayers.” The bonuses drew criticism from some Democrats and Republicans who said it was unfair and appeared to condemn the unvaccinated.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Gov. Henry McMaster and his wife, Peggy, are inviting people to come to their house Monday evening to view their Christmas decorations and listen to carols. The open house at the Governor’s Mansion in downtown Columbia is scheduled for 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. Monday. The Columbia Garden Club is decorating the mansion, and light refreshments will be served. Simone Bryant of Benedict College has been invited to sing Christmas carols. Admission is free, but the governor and first lady ask guests to please bring canned goods to donate to Harvest Hope Food Bank. Guided tours of the governor’s mansion are also available on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday mornings over the next two weeks.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: The state Department of Health is beginning to issue medical marijuana cards, but officials say it could be months before dispensaries will have anything to sell. Municipalities across the state are also receiving applications for permits from those who want to open a dispensary. The businesses must sell marijuana that is grown in the state, and with no cultivation facilities licensed in South Dakota, the dispensaries, for now, will have nothing to sell. Importing cannabis products across state lines remains a federal offense. State health officials say they’ve received 11 cultivation applications. Commercial grow facilities are now going through the state and local application process. It could take months for them to begin selling cannabis. In the meantime, medical marijuana cardholders can grow up to three plants for personal use. Cities have taken different approaches to selling medical marijuana. Yankton will permit two medical cannabis dispensaries. “Once those two applicants get state approval, they still have to do a certificate of occupancy with the city,” said Lisa Yardley, the city’s deputy finance officer. “They still have to do a site permit. They still have to do any building permits, building inspection.” Yankton will not allow any marijuana cultivation or processing operations.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A federal judge on Friday had harsh words for state officials who continue to enforce retroactive punishments against sex offenders, some of whom committed their offenses decades before the state’s sex offender law took effect. “Tennessee officials continue to flout the Constitution’s guarantees,” U.S. District Judge Aleta Trauger wrote in her ruling ordering officials to remove eight men from the sex offender registry and stop subjecting them to restrictions on where they can live and work, among other things. In April, a different federal judge, also in the Middle District of Tennessee, ordered two men be removed from the sex offender registry, finding that it was unconstitutional to subject them to sex offender laws that were written after they committed their offenses. In her Friday order, Trauger cited the April ruling and other similar recent rulings. She noted that the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2016 ruled against the retroactive enforcement of a Michigan sex offender law. “The federal district courts of this state have repeatedly concluded that the same analysis applies … to Tennessee’s own, very similar scheme and policies,” Trauger wrote. Despite those rulings, “Tennessee officials have continued to impose the state’s repeatedly-held-to-be-unlawful policy on other, similarly situated individuals.”\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: For more than seven years, no one has known what happened to $600,000 in checks and cash that were stolen from a safe at Pastor Joel Osteen’s Houston megachurch, which has one of the largest congregations in the country. Now, there’s a possible plot twist in the case: The money might never have left the church, and a plumber could have helped solve the mystery. Houston police are investigating whether cash and checks discovered by a plumber during repair work that was being done at Lakewood Church is connected to the money that was stolen in 2014. The revived investigation comes after a plumber on Thursday called “The Morning Bullpen with George, Mo & Erik on 100.3 The Bull” during a segment on the Houston radio station in which people were asked to talk about the most unusual things of value they had ever found. The plumber went on the air with his story of what he found while repairing a leaky toilet at the church about four weeks ago. “I went to go remove the toilet, and I moved some insulation away, and about 500 envelopes fell out of the wall. I was like, ‘Oh, wow.’ I got my flashlight, shined up in there,” he said in audio provided by the station. The plumber said he thought the envelopes full of money were connected to the 2014 theft and immediately told the church’s maintenance supervisor, who contacted police.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Zion National Park will soon require reservations to hike a famous southern Utah trail perched on the edge of a red-rock cliff, officials announced Friday. As of April 1, people who want to hike the narrow Angels Landing hike will need permits provided through a lottery system. The lottery will be fairer to visitors and reduce crowding on the trail, said superintendent Jeff Bradybaugh. Crowding is a major concern on the trail edged by a sheer cliff, where a small number of people typically fall and die every year, park officials have said. The number of people visiting Zion has been growing rapidly in recent years, swelling from about 2.8 million visits in 2011 to nearly 4.5 million visits in 2019. Angels Landing is one of the most sought-after destinations, and more than 300,000 people hiked it in 2019, according to park officials. There will be two lotteries, one seasonal and another for one day ahead of planned hikes. Each drawing costs $6 per person to enter, and people who win must pay a $3-per-person fee. That will cover the cost of running the lottery and rangers to check permits on the trail. The permit system will apply specifically to the narrowest section of the trail, often called the “chain section” because it has metal handholds driven into the rock.\n\nVermont\n\nRutland: The public is invited to cut down a Christmas tree from Green Mountain National Forest. A required $5 permit can be purchased online or at Green Mountain National Forest offices in Manchester and Rochester. This year, the U.S. Forest Service is providing free Christmas tree vouchers to fourth grade students in support of the Every Kid Outdoors initiative. It was created so that the country’s fourth graders and their families could discover wildlife, resources and history for free. The students must register online at everykidoutdoors.gov and present a printed voucher to redeem a Christmas tree voucher, U.S. Forest Service officials said. Trees may be harvested within designated areas of the forest and must be cut 6 inches or less from the ground, the Forest Service said. All trash and litter from the activity, including woody debris, must be removed from roads, ditches and culvert openings, officials said.\n\nVirginia\n\nVirginia Beach: A three-judge panel overseeing a recount in a close Virginia Beach state House race upheld the Republican candidate’s victory Friday, a decision that also reaffirms the GOP’s takeover of the chamber and completes the party’s sweep of last month’s elections. Republicans also claimed the statewide offices of governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general in the Nov. 2 balloting. Those wins were a dramatic turnaround in a state where the GOP had not won a statewide race since 2009. Democrats still hold a 21-19 majority in the Senate – where elections won’t be held until 2023 – splitting control of the Legislature. The certified results from the election showed Republicans leading in 52 districts and the Democrats leading in 48. The recount in the 85th District race resulted in Democratic incumbent Alex Askew gaining 12 votes, but he still trailed Republican challenger Karen Greenhalgh by 115 votes. There was one contested ballot. The panel found that the intent of the voter was unclear, so that ballot was not counted for either candidate. After Democrats requested recounts in two races with razor-thin margins, that left open the remote possibility of a 50-50 split. Though the second recount, in the 91st District, is still expected to proceed this week, Democrats no longer have a shot at undoing the GOP’s majority.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: An explosive device was tossed at the Islamic Center of Olympia – an act leaders of the facility said was an apparent act of intimidation. “It seems like it was meant to stoke fear,” Mustafa Mohamedali, social secretary for the Islamic Center of Olympia, told KING5. The Washington chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations said nobody was hurt, and there was no damage Nov. 23, but neighbors heard the blast. The explosion is the latest in a series of assaults on houses of worship in the Puget Sound region, including churches, synagogues and mosques. In October, someone set fire to the Islamic Center of Tacoma. The Thurston County Sheriff’s Office didn’t respond to questions from KING5.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: John Hutchison will become the state Supreme Court’s chief justice Jan 1, the court announced Thursday. As chief justice, Hutchison will become the administrative leader of the state’s judiciary system, including circuit, family and magistrate courts. A new intermediate court system will open July 1. In 2020, Hutchison won a special election for a four-year term on the court. He was appointed in 2018 to the seat vacated by convicted former Justice Allen Loughry. The court also announced that Beth Walker will serve as chief justice in 2023. Walker also served as chief justice in 2019. The current chief justice is Evan Jenkins.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Democratic Gov. Tony Evers vetoed five Republican-authored anti-abortion bills Friday. Evers, who is making his support for abortion rights a key plank of his 2022 reelection campaign, had been widely expected to veto the measures the GOP-controlled Legislature passed in October. “I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again today: as long as I’m governor, I will veto any legislation that turns back the clock on reproductive rights in this state – and that’s a promise,” Evers tweeted in announcing the vetoes. Republicans do not have enough votes in the Legislature to override the vetoes. One bill would impose criminal penalties on doctors who fail to give medical care in the extremely rare circumstance in which a baby is born alive following an abortion attempt. Violators would be guilty of a felony punishable by up to six years in prison. The bill also would make intentionally causing the death of a child born alive as a result of an abortion a felony punishable by life in prison. Doctors insist the proposal is a solution in search of a problem, as doctors are already ethically and legally bound to try and keep those babies alive. A second bill Evers vetoed would require doctors to provide the parents of fetuses and embryos that test positive for a congenital condition information about the condition. A third would prohibit abortions based on a fetus’ sex, race or national origin.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The 14th annual Menorah Lighting Ceremony was held Wednesday at the state Capitol, where Rabbi Zalman Mendelsohn and Gov. Mark Gordon placed an emphasis on spreading a positive light this Hanukkah season. The event moved back indoors this year, filling a wing of the Capitol with people from around Wyoming, as well as food, music and the massive menorah that towered behind the podium. The Cheyenne Youth Symphony contributed a string ensemble to play classic Hanukkah songs prior to the event. When it was time to light the menorah, Medelsohn stepped to the podium and thanked the many people who had gathered for the event before holding a moment of remembrance for Rabbi Larry H. Moldo, who died in August 2020. To conclude the introduction, he offered a gift in the form of a metal sculpture of a menorah to Gordon, thanking him and first lady Jennie Gordon for embodying the “commonality that exists within each and every one of us.” “There’s so many different paths, so many different lifestyles and so many different political viewpoints,” Rabbi Mendelsohn said in his speech. “There’s a solid gold that brings us all together, with love, with humanity, with character and with a sense that we are all part of the same people of Wyoming.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/02/14/unidentified-objects-briefing-national-security-live-updates/11251368002/", "title": "Feinstein won't run; Haley announcement: recap", "text": "Sen.

The images do not show dramatic development, but rather the continued progress of fortifying and expanding an area analysts say is of vital importance to Russia’s defensive strategy, at a time of great strain on Moscow’s resources.\n\nAccording to Maxar, the images demonstrate continued work on the radar stations at the Olenegorsk site, on the Kola Peninsula in northwest Russia, and at Vorkuta, just north of the Arctic circle. They also appear to show work moving ahead to complete one of five Rezonans-N radar systems at Ostrovnoy, a site located by the Barents Sea, near Norway and Finland in Russia’s west. The Rezonans-N are claimed by Russian officials to be able to detect stealth aircraft and objects.\n\nSatellite image ©2022 Maxar Technologies Satellite image ©2022 Maxar Technologies At Tiksi air defense site, towards the East of Russia's arctic region, satellite imagery shows three radomes (which protect radar systems) have been built up between this October and last. The remote Russian military Arctic base is located on the coast of the Laptev Sea. Satellite image ©2022 Maxar Technologies\n\nThree new radomes, the weatherproof enclosures used to protect radar antennas, were completed this year at the Tiksi air defense site, in the far northeast, according to Maxar’s images and analysis. There are also improvements to a runway and parking apron at Nagurskoye air base – Russia’s northernmost military facility – and runway improvements at ‘Temp’ air base, on Kotelny Island, in the northeast of the country.\n\nRussia has been bolstering its defenses in the far north for years, refurbishing a series of old Soviet bases with modern designs and equipment.\n\nIts Arctic region has long been key to its oil and gas sector, but also to its nuclear defenses, with a significant proportion of its sophisticated nuclear weaponry and submarine facilities in that area.\n\nSatellite image ©2022 Maxar Technologies Satellite image ©2022 Maxar Technologies On the arctic Kola Peninsula in northwest Russia, change is visible at the Olenegorsk Radar Station, including a new building compared to the imagery from June last year. Satellite image ©2022 Maxar Technologies\n\n“That deterrence has always been ready,” said a senior Western intelligence official. “It’s never down to low readiness; it’s a high status all the time,” the official said.\n\nAt the start of the war with Ukraine in February some submarines were repositioned to signal “this is a real capability,” the official added, but they soon returned to standard high readiness.\n\nNATO chief Stoltenberg reasoned: “The shortest way from Russia to North America is over the Arctic North Pole. So the strategic importance of these areas has not changed because of the war in Ukraine.”\n\n“We see Russia reopening old Soviet bases, military sites,” he said, noting that it is also “testing novel weapons in the Arctic and the high north.”\n\nSatellite image ©2022 Maxar Technologies Satellite image ©2022 Maxar Technologies Build-up continued between August this year and last at the Ostrovnoy site located by the Barents Sea, near Norway and Finland in Russia's west. One of five new Rezonans-N radars, which Russia claim can find stealth jets, is located here. Satellite image ©2022 Maxar Technologies\n\n“It is significant that they have managed to shelter this area from the impact of the Ukrainian war”, said Malte Humpert of the Arctic Institute, who has written extensively on the development of the Arctic.\n\n“They are prioritising energy resources in the Arctic, but another aspect is to project power. Yet this is also economic. About 20% of Russia’s GDP comes from the Arctic area, and that may be more in the future. There is a lot of money involved in the area for them.”\n\nThe war in Ukraine has led to a major adjustment in Russia’s troop strengths in the region, the senior Western intelligence official said. “They’re down to somewhere between 20 and 25% of their original land forces up there. But then the naval component is totally untouched by the war,” they noted.\n\nFollowing strikes earlier this month on two key airfields deep inside Russia in Ryazan and Saratov, Russian military jets and bombers have been dispersed across the country and the Arctic north, the official added. Moscow has blamed the strikes on Ukraine, while Kyiv has offered no comment on the explosions at the Russian bases.\n\nThe Arctic is also vital to Russia because its melting ice is rapidly opening up new shipping routes from Asia’s southeast to Europe, using a much shorter path along the Russian coast.\n\nAt Russia's northernmost military facility, the runway at Nagurskoye airfield has visibly progressed over the last year despite Russia's war on Ukraine. Nagurskoye is one of several \"trefoil\" bases featuring a three-pronged building in the colours of the Russian flag. The base, located in Alexandra Land far up in the Arctic Circle, was built by the Soviets in the 50s, and has been refitted since 2015. Satellite image ©2022 Maxar Technologies\n\nThe Northern Sea Route could cut around two weeks off the current journey time across the Suez Canal. Russian state TV has reveled in the launch of several atomic-powered icebreakers, designed to boost Russian influence and power in the region. Critics say Moscow is seeking to exert outsized control over a route that should be equally accessible to all nations.\n\nSpeaking via videolink at the launch of a new nuclear-powered icebreaker in St. Petersburg last month (November 22), Russian President Vladimir Putin said the development of the “most important” Northern Sea Route “will allow Russia to fully reveal its export potential and to establish effective logistics routes, including to southeast Asia.”\n\nAt the same time, the war in Ukraine has boosted NATO’s presence in the region. Once Finland and Sweden join the block, as is widely expected, seven out of eight Arctic states will be NATO members.\n\nThe alliance has also ramped up its military clout in the region. In August, Norway released the first images of US B52 bombers flying over its territory escorted by Norwegian F35 jets and 2 Swedish JAS Gripen.\n\nIncreased signaling by NATO included a recent test of the new weapons system, the Rapid Dragon Palletized Munition Deployment, involving a complex drop by US special forces of a normal supply pallet from the back of a C130 cargo craft.\n\nThe pallet contains a cruise missile, which launches as the pallet falls by parachute. The display was designed to show the United States can launch these powerful weapons systems from the back of an ordinary cargo plane. The test took place in Norway, not far from the Russian border.\n\nNATO has also become increasingly concerned about the potential sabotage of Norway’s oil and gas infrastructure. Now Russian energy is subject to sanctions, Norway’s natural gas makes up more than 20% of Europe’s supply, according to some analysis.\n\n“Since the sabotage in the Baltic Sea,” Stoltenberg said, “we have doubled our presence, with ships, with submarines, with maritime patrol aircrafts in the Baltic and North Seas, partly to monitor, to have better situational awareness, but also to send a message of deterrence and readiness to protect this critical infrastructure.” The NATO head was referring to the blasts at the Nord Stream pipeline in September, which were caused by an act of sabotage, according to Swedish prosecutors, after evidence of explosives was discovered at the sites.\n\nThe senior intelligence official said, however, that a recent Norwegian review of its infrastructure security concluded no major attempts to attack it had occurred and that “the oil infrastructure is well secured now.”", "authors": ["Nick Paton Walsh Sarah Dean", "Nick Paton Walsh", "Sarah Dean"], "publish_date": "2022/12/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/27/bomber-boneyard-flying-farmer-crashes-blueberry-bonanza-news-around-states/118952548/", "title": "B-1 bomber boneyard, Flying Farmer crashes, Blueberry bonanza ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery:The state is considering whether to use $400million in pandemic relief funds to build new prisons, a proposal Gov. Kay Ivey and Republican legislative leaders said would save state taxpayers’ money, but that critics argue is not for what the funds are supposed to be used. Lawmakers on Monday begin a special session focused on a $1.3 billion prison construction plan to build at least three new prisons and renovate others. The projects would be done in phases and funded with a $785 million bond issue, $150 million in general fund dollars and $400 million from the state’s $2.2 billion share of American Rescue Plan funds. Ivey and Republican legislative leaders have defended the use of the virus funds, saying it will enable the state to essentially “pay cash” for part of the construction and avoid using state dollars as well as paying interest on a loan.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state reported more than 1,700 resident COVID-19 cases Friday, which state health officials said included reports from earlier this month as they work to clear a backlog that has built up during the latest case surge. Health officials encouraged looking at cases by their symptom onset date versus the date they were submitted to the state health department. Dr. Anne Zink, the state’s chief medical officer, also recommended looking at weekly trends. Zink said the high daily report includes a mix of current and older cases, “but it does not diminish the fact we continue to see tremendous COVID spread in our communities.” Dr. Joe McLaughlin, the state epidemiologist, told reporters there is no indication yet that Alaska has hit a peak.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: More than a dozen B-1 bombers decommissioned by the Air Force have been flown to a boneyard in Tucson. The last of the 13 bombers destined for storage or disposal at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson arrived Thursday after being flown from a base in California, an Air Force statement said. The Air Force decommissioned a total of 17 B-1s, with the other four going to various locations for testing and other purposes. With the retirements of 17 of the B-1 bombers, 45 others remain in the Air Force’s active inventory. In addition, four of the B-1s sent to Davis-Monthan will be stored in a manner that would allow them to be put back into use if needed. The Air Force said retiring some of its B-1s will allow it to give more attention to remaining B-1s to increase their readiness while the service transitions to a bomber fleet consisting of only two types of aircraft – rebuilt B-52s and a new model, the B-21.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The number of COVID-19 patients in Arkansas’ hospitals hit its lowest point in two months on Friday as the state reported more than 1,300 new coronavirus cases. The state Department of Health reported COVID-19 hospitalizations dropped by 62 to 894. It’s the lowest number of COVID-19 patients the state has reported since 875 were hospitalized on July 24. The state reported 1,365 new coronavirus cases, bringing its total since the pandemic began to 491,221. Arkansas ranks 23rd in the country for new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: California will strike the word “alien” from its state laws, getting rid of what Gov. Gavin Newsom called “an offensive term for a human being” that has “fueled a divisive and hurtful narrative.” Newsom on Friday signed a law that removes the word from various sections of the California state code. California passed laws in 2015 and 2016 that removed the word from the state’s labor and education code. But the law Newsom signed on Friday finishes the job by removing the word from all state laws. The word will be replaced with terms such as “noncitizen” or “immigrant.” “By changing this term, we are ensuring California’s laws reflect our state’s values,” Newsom said. The federal government has used the term “alien” to describe people in the U.S. who are not citizens since at least 1798 with the passage of the “Aliens and Sedition Acts.” But Assemblywoman Luz Rivas, a Democrat from Arleta, said the word “has become weaponized and has been used in place of explicitly racial slurs to dehumanize immigrants.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Whistleblower allegations that the state health department’s air pollution division interfered with staff efforts to properly enforce federal air quality standards are unsubstantiated, according to an independent report released Friday by the Colorado attorney general’s office. The Colorado Department of Law, which is led by Attorney General Phil Weiser, hired the independent investigator after a complaint was filed with the Environmental Protection Agency’s office of inspector general in March. Three whistleblowers alleged that dozens of air pollution permits were issued unlawfully by the health department’s Air Pollution Control Division to companies, and that at least one whistleblower was asked to falsify data to get pollution estimates under permitted limits. They also alleged that health department division leaders ignored EPA regulations on modeling and permitting short-term pollutants from important Colorado industries – including mines, asphalt plants and oil and gas gathering sites. They said the permits were part of a larger problem of state officials allegedly catering to industry. The Denver Post reported the findings released Friday didn’t substantiate the claims of fraud and suppression.\n\nConnecticut\n\nDurham: A retired Connecticut physician and surgeon’s license was suspended Friday by a state medical board for allegedly providing people she had not treated with blank vaccine, mask-wearing and other exemption forms, so long as they sent her a self-addressed stamped envelope in the mail requesting the paperwork. The state Department of Public Health said it received an anonymous tip in July about Dr. Sue Mcintosh of Durham sending people fraudulent exemption forms. After an investigation, DPH called on the Connecticut Medical Examining Board to hold Friday’s emergency hearing and summarily suspend the doctor, saying she poses a “clear and immediate danger to public health and safety.” The panel voted unanimously in favor of the suspension. A full hearing on the merits of the case is scheduled for Oct. 5.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A judge has refused to order a hospital to administer the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin to a man who is seriously ill with COVID-19. Vice Chancellor Morgan Zurn said in a ruling issued Friday that patients, even if they are gravely ill, do not have a right to a particular medical treatment. She also said a health care provider’s duty to treat is bound by that provider’s standard of care. “While ivermectin has been approved as safe and effective to treat human parasitic infections, and so is distinct from a wholly unapproved new drug, DeMarco still has no right to compel its use to treat COVID-19 outside the standard of care,” Zurn wrote. The ruling came a day after a hearing in a lawsuit filed last week by Mary Ellen DeMarco on behalf of her husband, David, against Christiana Care Health Services. Despite refusing to issue an injunction sought by Mary Ellen DeMarco, Zurn indicated she was prepared to quickly consider an application for an interlocutory appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Two women, a pastor and a college student, who live in the D.C. area, will headline CBS's “Survivor 41” that premieres at 8 p.m. Wednesday, WUSA-TV reported.

A ferret in the European nation of Slovenia previously tested positive for the virus. USDA officials said samples from the Florida ferret were tested after the animal showed symptoms that included sneezing and coughing. Officials believed the ferret acquired the virus from an infected human. The small mustelids are commonly kept as pets. Officials didn’t say where in Florida the infected ferret was found. COVID-19 has been reported in several animal species around the world, usually animals that come in close contact with infected humans, officials said. The USDA said the the risk of animals spreading the virus to people is low and doesn’t recommend routine testing for animals.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: The largest city in coastal Georgia is in talks about a new way to recycle glass that it’s burying in a landfill, even though it still accepts glass in recycling bins. WTOC-TV reported Savannah officials are in talks with Glass WRX SC, a South Carolina company that seeks to recycle glass into air and water filtration systems, road surfaces and prefabricated interior walls. The city stopped recycling glass more than five years ago after running out of users willing to accept the bulky material. It’s a common problem nationwide. Savannah still finds new users for paper, plastic and metals that it collects from all-in-one recycling bins. In 2020, about 25% of what the city collected from recycling bins, including about 1,000 tons of glass, were buried in the city landfill. Some of that was because materials were too contaminated for further use. City officials recently toured Glass WRX SC’s facility in Beaufort, South Carolina. One use is turning glass into rock-like water filters.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Hawaiian Airlines said a passenger assaulted one of its flight attendants in an unprovoked attack during a flight. The airline said the incident occurred shortly after flight HA152 left Honolulu for Hilo at 7:30 a.m. Thursday. The flight attendant was walking down the aisle at the time. The pilot returned the plane to Honolulu. Deputy sheriffs assigned to the airport arrested a 32-year-old male passenger for third-degree assault based on information they received from the airline, said Toni Schwartz, a spokesperson for the state Department of Public Safety. The FBI was investigating the matter, said agency spokesperson Joy Van Der Voort. Hawaiian Airlines spokesperson Alex Da Silva said the flight attendant was evaluated for injuries and released from work to rest. The flight took off again for Hilo at 9:09 a.m.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The U.S. Department of Defense is taking input on its plan to build an advanced mobile nuclear microreactor prototype at the Idaho National Laboratory in eastern Idaho. The department began a 45-day comment period on Friday with the release of a draft environmental impact study evaluating alternatives for building and operating the microreactor that could produce 1 to 5 megawatts of power. The department’s energy needs are expected to increase, it said. The draft environmental impact statement cited President Joe Biden’s Jan. 27 executive order prioritizing climate change considerations in national security as another reason for pursuing microreactors. The draft document said alternative energy sources such as wind and solar were problematic because they are limited by location, weather and available land area, and would require redundant power supplies.\n\nIllinois\n\nRockford:The northern Illinois city that figured prominently in the movie “A League of Their Own” might be getting a museum of its own. The Rockford Zoning Board of Appeals voted unanimously last week to grant a special-use permit to build a $10 million International Women’s Baseball Museum at Beyer Park on the city’s southeast side, the Rockford Register Star reported. The city and the league gained international fame in 1992 when the movie starring Tom Hanks, Geena Davis and Madonna was released. At the park, Beyer Stadium was the actual home of the real Rockford Peaches of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League in the 1940s and 1950s. To put the museum on the site, the Rockford Park District, which owns Beyer Park, plans to sell an acre of land at the north end of the park to the International Women’s Baseball Center. The vote came after a group called Friends of Beyer Stadium urged the zoning board to find a different site for the museum – an effort the group said will continue as the issue moves to a Rockford City Council committee on Monday and the full council on Oct. 4.\n\nIndiana\n\nMuncie:A beverage can company has started work on a factory in eastern Indiana where it expects to produce about 3.6 billion cans a year. A groundbreaking ceremony was held last week for the new aluminum can factory in Muncie that will be operated by Canpack, a subsidiary of the Polish company Giorgi Global. The factory is expected to ultimately employ about 340 people, according to the company. The new factory will help meet the demand for more beverage cans in the U.S., company executive Tom Johnson told The Star Press. Johnson said the company plans to start recruiting employees early next year and have the factory in operation by late 2022. Delaware County approved 15 years of property tax breaks for the new factory, while the state agreed to provide up to $6 million in tax credits and worker training grants.\n\nIowa\n\nWaterloo: At least 16 people in eastern Iowa were charged with gun crimes after a two-day sweep by federal authorities this week. Grand juries met Wednesday through Friday in the U.S. District Court for Northern Iowa and issued the indictments, the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier reported. Many of those indicted have already been charged in state courts for weapons offenses. Most of the indictments were for felons in possession of a firearm or for having a firearm and using drugs.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly said the state will adopt the recommendation from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concerning Pfizer booster shots as part of the effort to fight COVID-19. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky ruled Thursday that people 65 and older, nursing home residents and those ages 50 and older who have chronic health problems such as diabetes should be offered a booster once they’re six months past their last Pfizer dose. Kelly, a Democrat, said in a news release that she has authorized all COVID-19 vaccine providers to begin administering Pfizer booster shots to eligible Kansans as of Friday. Kelly said the CDC’s announcement “will provide additional protection to the most vulnerable Kansans and our frontline healthcare workers.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear called on the state’s residents Friday to honor a 15-year-old Fayette County student who died from COVID-19 by lighting porches with green lights. In a statement posted to social media, he also urged Kentuckians to “encourage vaccinations among friends and family and to mask up indoors.” Sophomore Christopher “C.J.” Gordon Jr. died from virus, Fayette County Superintendent Demetrus Liggins confirmed Thursday in a news release. Gordon’s mother, Renita Wright Gordon, told the Lexington Herald-Leader that Gordon always put other people first and you rarely saw him “not smiling.” Earlier this month, a 15-year-old Shelby County student who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 before the school year began also died from the virus.\n\nLouisiana\n\nAlexandria: Next month, people can order firewood from the Rapides Parish Sheriff’s Office and in the process help out the community and inmates. Sheriff Mark Wood has started a firewood project that can help recycle the many trees felled by recent hurricanes and winter storms. Priority for the wood will go to elderly and disabled residents of the parish, but anyone can buy up to two ricks beginning Oct. 1. Each rick costs $60, and sales are handled with money orders only. Wood told The Town Talk the object isn’t to make a lot of money through the venture. Some of the proceeds will go toward the upkeep of chainsaws and log splitters, and some will go into the sheriff’s office Inmate Welfare Fund. Money from the fund is “used to purchase basketballs and other sports equipment and work clothes or work boots for those inmates who have an economic need,” according to a news release. Some inmates don’t have family to help them with things like shoes, he said. He said the fund can help provide that so inmates “can continue paying back their debts to society.” Residents interested in buying wood through the program can call (318) 709-8489 to check availability. The sheriff’s office also asks local tree surgeons or cutters to call them if they have hardwood trees needing disposal.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Maine’s wild blueberry growers had a bounce-back year this summer after struggling with low prices and small crops sizes in recent seasons. The only commercial-scale wild blueberry growers in the U.S. harvest the fruit in Maine, mostly in the rural Down East region. The 2020 crop was less than 48 million pounds, and that was the lowest number since 2004. But the 2021 season, which ended recently, appeared to be much better, said David Yarborough, emeritus professor of horticulture with the University of Maine. He said the crop was likely about 90 million pounds, which would be the most blueberries since 2016. Growers had a better year in part because of a cool, wet July, Yarborough said. Hot summers and droughts have hurt the crop in recent years. It was also a good season for pollinators, Yarborough said. Prices were also up to about 70 cents per pound to farmers, which would be an improvement of 10 cents from last year and more than twice the number from 2017, when prices cratered, he said. Wild blueberries are smaller than cultivated blueberries, and they serve a slightly different niche in the market. Although many cultivated blueberries are sold fresh, the vast majority of the wild blueberry crop is frozen. The berries are also used extensively in processed food products.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: City officials said two sewer discharges have released an unknown amount of sewage in residential neighborhoods. The City Department of Public Works issued a notice of the overflows Saturday. One occurred in the Reiserstown area northwest of downtown and affected the stream known as Gwynns Falls. The other happened in the Poplar Hill neighborhood north of downtown and impacted the stream known as Jones Falls. Officials urged people to avoid swimming or other contact with the impacted streams.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: City Councilor and mayoral candidate Michelle Wu has won the endorsement of her former political rival and current office holder, Acting Mayor Kim Janey. Janey made the endorsement Saturday, the Boston Globe reported. In a statement, Janey said Wu has the record and values to protect and build upon the city’s progress in becoming more “equitable, just and resilient.” “Important policies like our housing agenda, equitable vaccine distribution, and how we handle mental health crises are on the line in this election,” said Janey. “Moreover, Black and brown residents who are most impacted by systemic inequities need a leader in City Hall who will center equity and inclusion in all her policies, and ensure they have a seat at the table when real decisions are made.” Wu was the top vote-getter in Sept. 14′s preliminary election. City Councilor Annissa Essaibi George came in second and also advanced to the Nov. 2 general election, and three major contenders – City Councilor Andrea Campbell, Janey, and John Barros – were eliminated.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s office said she will declare unenforceable a Republican-written budget provision that seeks to ban indoor mask requirements for children. The Democrat had been expected to block the language as unconstitutional since $55 billion in spending was unveiled and quickly passed by Michigan’s Legislature earlier this week. Spokesman Bobby Leddy confirmed this week’s move in a statement, calling the proposed restriction “dangerous.” The provision, which is not tied to spending, would prevent the state health director and local health officers from issuing or enforcing orders that require children under age 18 to wear a face covering. More than a dozen counties, including most of the state’s most populated ones, mandate masking in schools to curb COVID-19. Various K-12 districts in other counties also require face coverings. The governor and GOP legislators did negotiate other language related to coronavirus vaccine exemptions and reporting requirements for epidemic orders.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: State regulators launched a court-ordered process for assessing the risks to clean water from waste from the proposed PolyMet copper-nickel mine in northeastern Minnesota. The Department of Natural Resources announced plans for a trial-like proceeding known as a contested case hearing, which was ordered by the Minnesota Supreme Court in April. The hearing will be confined to the narrow question of whether the bentonite clay lining planned for the mine’s waste basin would be sufficient to keep pollution contained. A prehearing conference has been set for Nov. 1. An administrative law judge will later schedule the hearing itself, which will be a potentially lengthy proceeding in which all sides can present evidence and call witnesses before the neutral judge, who will report his findings back to the agency. The open pit mine and processing plant near Babbitt and Hoyt Lakes would be Minnesota’s first copper-nickel mine. Environmentalists have fought it because of the potential for acid mine drainage.PolyMet said the mine will be safe and that the project has undergone more than a decade of thorough, public environmental reviews.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state will soon start rebuilding a section of highway that collapsed during torrential rainfall brought by Hurricane Ida, the head of the state Department of Transportation said. Two people were killed and nine injured Aug. 30 as seven vehicles plunged into a deep pit that opened up on the dark, rural stretch of Mississippi Highway 26 near Lucedale. One of the injured people died in a hospital on Sept. 11. Department of Transportation Director Brad White told legislative budget writers Friday that the department has completed a geotechnical review and will choose a company early next month to repair the damage for about $1.2 million. He said the highway could reopen in about 45 days. White said the area had received more than double its average annual rainfall before the hurricane, and then Ida dumped more than 12 inches of rain in less than a day. The stretch of highway is on a hillside, and White said the deluge blew out a pipe that ran under the roadbed.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: State lawmakers who want to halt all public funds to Planned Parenthood are recommending the Legislature give Republican Gov. Mike Parson’s administration authority to cancel abortion providers’ Medicaid contracts based on behavior in other states deemed illegal or unethical. The Senate Interim Committee on Medicaid Accountability and Taxpayer Protection approved a report with that recommendation on Thursday. Planned Parenthood is Missouri’s only abortion provider. Abortion providers are prohibited from using Medicaid funds for abortion except when the mother’s life is in danger or in the cases of rape or incest. Some lawmakers want to pull all public funds, including those for birth control, sexually transmitted disease treatments, cancer screenings and other health care for low-income women. Democrats warned that the move would trigger a confrontation with the federal government that could threaten the overall Medicaid program.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A therapeutic boarding school in northwestern Montana, which state inspectors learned had once made boys sleep outside in winter conditions without proper clothing as punishment, closed Friday. Staffers confirmed to the Montana State News Bureau on Tuesday that the 16-bed Wood Creek Academy near Thompson Falls was shutting down. A message had also been posted on the program’s website, which had been pulled down by Friday. Wood Creek Academy, a residential boarding school for boys ages 13 to 18, had been the subject of two complaints filed with the state within the past year and inspections uncovered other infractions. The state health department sent inspectors to the boarding school in January in response to a complaint. The inspection found two boys ran away from the school one morning in January and Wood Creek Academy staff waited for more than an hour before calling law enforcement. As punishment for running away, staff prohibited the boys from having any interaction with their peers for three days. Such punishment is prohibited under state regulations. The inspector reported the boys also were sent to sleep in shorts and T-shirts in tents as nighttime temperatures dipped as low as 28 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nNebraska\n\nKearney: Authorities in south-central Nebraska said a teenage girl survived after a car she was driving collided with a train. The collision was so violent that her car’s engine was ejected. The crash happened Wednesday at a rural railroad crossing west of Kearney, the Kearney Hub reported. Buffalo County Sheriff’s officials said Sydney Conner, 17, was traveling north on a county road about 7:45 a.m. when her car collided with a westbound Union Pacific train. Sheriff’s Sgt. Ramey Ristine said investigators believe Connor was blinded by the rising sun as she approached the crossing and didn’t see the train. There are no crossing arms at that railroad intersection, but it is marked with stop signs.\n\nNevada\n\nElko: A hospital in rural northeastern Nevada is pleading with residents to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and to take other precautions to help slow the spread of the coronavirus to “keep our health care system from being overrun.” The Northeastern Nevada Regional Hospital in Elko said Friday the virus was “running rampant”” in the region and that the hospital’s intensive care and medical-surgical units were near capacity and that it had postponed elective surgeries and added beds. “As a hospital staff, we are pleading with you to practice the precautions we know are effective in stopping COVID-19,” the hospital said in a statement posted on social media. “Avoid large gatherings, wear a mask when around people from outside your household, observe physical distancing, and practice good hand hygiene. Most importantly, please get vaccinated against COVID-19.” The hospital said wait times were longer than normal but that it was still able to safely provide medical care. “Please help us slow the spread of COVID-19 and keep our healthcare system from being overrun,” the hospital said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A former high school teacher accused of soliciting sexually explicit videos from a student for money and making and possessing child pornography has pleaded guilty to human trafficking and manufacturing child sex abuse images. Joshua Harwood, 38, of Manchester entered his pleas to the two felony counts on Wednesday, the Concord Monitor reported. Harwood had taught business at the high school, where he was hired in July 2020. Police were notified of the allegations involving a minor in December and Harwood was placed on administrative leave. He was later arrested and has been in jail since February. A sentencing hearing is scheduled for Oct. 19. On the trafficking charge, attorneys are recommending a sentence of 31/ 2 to seven years in jail, which may be suspended if Harwood completes a sex offender program. They’re recommending a consecutive sentence of 71/2 to 15 years, a portion of which may be suspended, for the manufacturing charge.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nCherry Hill:The New Jersey craft beer scene took home a few big honors at this year's Great American Beer Festival in Denver. Among the 265 breweries awarded 290 medals from the Brewers Association were Mechanical Brewery of Cherry Hill, which took home the gold in the English mild or bitter category for its Momentum. Departed Soles Brewing Co. of Jersey City and Spellbound Brewing of Mount Holly each took home silver medals. The Jersey City brewery was honored in a gluten-free beer category for None Shall PATH, and the Mount Holly brewery won for its wood- and barrel-aged beer for Porter Aged on Palo Santo. The Great American Beer Festival honored beers in 97 categories spanning 175 styles in the 35th edition of its competition, with judging held across 17 days and 34 sessions, according to a news release.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham visited southern New Mexico on Friday to talk with fellow elected Democratic leaders and business groups about economic development and to tour a military base near the U.S.-Mexico border where Afghan refugees are being housed. The Democrat’s visit was not made public until late in the afternoon. Her office said she walked through the processing area at Fort Bliss Army base, spoke with volunteers about the need for winter coats and other items for those at the facility and saw how the refugees were screened for COVID-19. “Whenever the federal government tells us they need our help, New Mexico is ready to help these families on their way,” Lujan Grisham said in a statement after the tour. There was no indication that Lujan Grisham visited the U.S.-Mexico border while in the area. She has faced criticism in recent months for not doing more to address the concerns of residents along the border amid the latest influx of immigrants.\n\nNew York\n\nHolbrook: Mourners began arriving at a Long Island funeral home viewing Sunday for Gabby Petito, whose death on a cross-country trip has sparked a manhunt for her boyfriend. A line had formed outside the funeral home in Holbrook, about 35 miles east of New York City, by noon, and groups of firefighters were seen filing past. A fire truck sat on each side of the building, each with its ladder raised. Across the street from the funeral home, a chain link fence was adorned with posters featuring Petito’s image and messages such as, “She touched the world.” Petito was reported missing Sept. 11 by her parents after she didn’t respond to calls and texts for several days while she and Brian Laundrie visited parks in the West. Her body was discovered Sept. 19 in a remote area in northwestern Wyoming. Laundrie and Petito grew up on Long Island but in recent years moved to Florida. Petito’s death has been classified as homicide, meaning she was killed by another person, but medical examiners in Wyoming haven’t disclosed how she died pending further autopsy results. The couple posted online about their trip in a white Ford Transit van converted into a camper. They got into a physical altercation Aug. 12 in Moab, Utah, that led to a police stop for a possible domestic violence case. Ultimately, police there decided to separate the quarreling couple for the night. But no charges were filed, and no serious injuries were reported. Investigators have been searching for Laundrie in Florida, and searched his parents’ home in North Port, about 35 miles south of Sarasota.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Authorities said a bank robber was caught after they determined he had taken his getaway vehicle for a test drive from a car dealer. The Raleigh-based U.S. Attorney’s Office said in a news release that 68-year-old Glenn Alin Martinoff was sentenced to more than four years in prison on Thursday after previously pleading guilty to bank robbery. The news release said Martinoff entered a Wilmington bank in January wearing a mask and gloves and brandishing a large screwdriver. He robbed the location of more than $6,000, authorities said. Investigators using surveillance video determined his getaway car was for sale at a nearby dealership. The news release said that authorities found out he had taken the car for a test drive to use as his getaway car. The news release said investigators found the cash and clothing worn during the robbery during a search of his apartment.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMakoti: The first car jumping attempt in five years by North Dakota’s version of Evil Knievel ended in disaster when the car driven by the man known as the Flying Farmer corkscrewed off the ramp and rolled. Authorities said John Smith, 57, was alert after the crash Saturday at a rural gravel pit and that he even tried to pull himself out of the car while talking to rescuers. He was eventually cut out and taken by a medical helicopter to a hospital, according to firefighters. The extent of his injuries wasn’t known. The crowd of about 300 spectators went silent when Smith crashed. Family members, including his daughters and wife of 34 years, Melinda, reacted emotionally, running to the mangled car, The Bismarck Tribune reported. Smith’s previous jump was in 2016, when he rose over towering flames to clear a burning trailer. Smith, who farms near Makoti, in western North Dakota, said he was inspired by the motorcycle daredevil Knievel while growing up. He has gained notoriety for his jumps at fairs and other attractions across the state. He has performed more than 100 jumps, even jumping on a frozen lake.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Gov. Mike DeWine’s top lobbyist, a man linked to an ongoing federal bribery investigation but never charged, resigned Friday after three years on the job. Legislative Director Dan McCarthy cited “the pace and grind” of the job and referred to predecessors who warned him against serving more than two years. “I know I’ve run quite a bit over my two year commitment but I think now is the right time to resign as your Legislative Director,” McCarthy wrote in his letter to DeWine. Federal prosecutors charged five individuals last year, including the then-House speaker, with orchestrating a $60 million bribery scheme to assure the 2019 passage of a bill bailing out two nuclear power plants. Prosecutors said the scheme also involved killing efforts to put a petition on the ballot to overturn the bailout. The power plants were operated at the time by a wholly-owned subsidiary of Akron-based FirstEnergy Corp. McCarthy is a former FirstEnergy lobbyist who was president of one of the dark money groups, Partners for Progress, which has been implicated in the alleged bribery scheme. McCarthy has said his actions were legal and DeWine’s office has said it has no indication McCarthy is a target of the investigation, which continues.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOkmulgee: Muscogee Nation voters have approved press protections for their tribe’s news enterprise. Citizens voted 1,914-596 last week to amend the tribe’s constitution to include press protections and mandate funding for Mvskoke Media, Indian Country Today reported. Although freedom of the press is guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution, many tribal nations lack such language in their constitutions. The Muscogee amendment allows the tribe’s news enterprise – which includes print, broadcast and digital operations – to operate “free from political interest or undue influence, harassment, censorship, control or restrictions from any department” of the tribe’s government. The effort traces to 2015, when the tribe passed the Free Press Act establishing independent media. Its governing body later repealed the law during an emergency meeting. Last year, tribal leaders unanimously restored the press freedoms by passing the Independent Muscogee (Creek) Press Act, which was viewed as a positive step.\n\nOregon\n\nNewberg: A school board has banned educators from displaying Black Lives Matter and gay pride symbols, prompting a torrent of recriminations and threats to boycott the town and its businesses. Newberg, a town of 25,000 residents situated 25 miles southwest of Portland in gorgeous wine country, has become an unlikely focal point of a fight between the left and right across the nation over schooling. The City Council has condemned the action by the Newberg School Board. So did members of color of the Oregon Legislature and House and Senate Democrats. The American Civil Liberties Union of Oregon is threatening to sue. The Oregon State Board of Education called on the school board to reverse course, saying student identities should be welcomed and affirmed. But the four conservative members of the seven-member board are digging in their heels. Member Brian Shannon, who proposed the ban, said lawmakers from Portland should keep out of the school district’s business and instead focus on Portland, where homelessness is an issue.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has joined a federal investigation of Pennsylvania’s largest pension fund and is seeking among other things records to determine whether improper “compensation and gifts” might have been offered staff, a newspaper reported. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that the commission is also seeking records earlier sought by the U.S. attorney’s office about what officials of the $64 billion Public School Employees’ Retirement System have called a mistake in calculating the fund’s long-term investment performance. The newspaper reported that the subpoena given to the school pension plan Friday was the first indication that investigators are looking into possible presents or money from investment advisers and consultants. State employees are forbidden from accepting such gifts under a ban imposed by Gov. Tom Wolf. The Securities and Exchange Commission pursues civil rather than criminal complaints and has broad power to impose fines, discipline financial players and order changes. Pension fund system spokesperson Steve Esack said Saturday that the fund had no comment on the SEC action, the newspaper said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The man authorities sid leads the Rhode Island chapter of the Hells Angels motorcycle club has turned down a plea deal that would have sent him to prison for five years, and will now take his chances at trial. Joseph Lancia, 30, of Smithfield told a judge Thursday that he would rather go to trial, WPRI-TV reported. He faces multiple criminal counts stemming from two incidents. In one case, he is charged with shooting at a truck in June 2019 being driven by a former Hells Angels prospect with whom he had a dispute. He is charged with felony assault and battery in that case. He is also charged with knocking someone unconscious with a punch outside a Providence strip club in March 2020. Prosecutors initially offered a deal that came with eight years in prison, but after speaking with the judge, the sentence was lowered to five. Assistant Attorney General Joseph McBurney said if Lancia is found guilty at trial on all counts, he faces 61 years behind bars. Lancia, who is out on bail, refused to comment outside of court.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSt. George: State transportation officials want to hear from the public about a project to widen part of Interstate 26 and improve one of the state’s key interchanges. The state is spending $19 million on preliminary engineering work to widen 22 miles of I-26 in Orangeburg, Berkeley and Dorchester counties. The project also will modernize I-26’s interchange with Interstate 95. The tight, curving off ramps often cause backups. The Department of Transportation is accepting comments about the project until Oct. 10 on its website. The project from Exit 165 to Exit 187 on I-26 will also improve interchanges and take other steps to make the highway safer. It is also part of a larger plan to have three lanes in each direction on I-26 from Charleston to Columbia by the end of the decade.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: A Missouri-based battery manufacturer has selected Rapid City for a factory complex that it said could employ up to 1,500 people. AEsir Technologies plans to construct four buildings. The first building will be a 150,000-square-foot manufacturing and distribution center capable of producing 1.2 million batteries annually. The company initially plans to hire 400 employees and expand to 1,200 to 1,500 employees. The first phase will cost about $90 million, with a total price tag of $300 million when all four phases of the development are finished, according to CEO Randy Moore. The company looked for an available labor force, an economic development incentive package and community support when searching for the ideal location for the new facility, Moore said. Twenty other communities were considered for the facility. Moore said easy access to rail, a state highway and Rapid City Regional Airport were also factors in the company’s decision to choose Rapid City. AEsir Technologies manufactures nickel zinc batteries that Moore said are two to three times more powerful than lithium ion batteries and last just as long. He said they use potassium hydroxide as the electrolyte, an active ingredient in soaps and shampoos, which makes the batteries environmentally friendly.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville:Tennessee Supreme Court Justice Cornelia Clark has died at the age of 71, the court announced Friday. She had been diagnosed with cancer. According to a news release, Clark died overnight after 16 years in her role, serving the longest tenure of her counterparts on the court while she was on the bench for more than 1,100 Supreme Court cases. Republican Gov. Bill Lee, who will select Clark’s replacement, called her a “trailblazer for women in the legal profession.” Clark was appointed to her seat in 2005 by former Democratic Gov. Phil Bredesen and served as chief justice from 2010 to 2012. Chief Justice Roger Page said Clark, better known as Connie, “loved the Tennessee judicial system and has made it better in immeasurable ways.” All but one of the remaining justices – Sharon Lee, whom Bredesen also appointed – were appointees of former Gov. Bill Haslam, signaling a likely shift further rightward for the court with an appointment by Lee. The Governor’s Council for Judicial Appointments will recommend three candidates to the governor, who will make his pick. The Legislature must confirm the selection.\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso:A group of 14 Mexican soldiers was detained Saturday after inadvertently crossing the border at the Bridge of the Americas in El Paso, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman said. The soldiers were returned to Mexico after being detained by CBP for about 5 hours. One of the soldiers was issued a civil fine for being in possession of a personal-use amount of marijuana, CBP said. The incident occurred shortly after midnight Saturday when CBP officers saw two Mexican military vehicles cross the international border line on the middle of the bridge, CBP said. The bridge is also known as Puente Internacional Córdova de las Américas and as the Puente Libre, or free bridge, because there is no bridge toll charge. CBP officers approached the military trucks and temporarily detained the soldiers and secured their weapons and equipment. Photos shared on social media showed soldiers sitting on the asphalt and a military pickup stopped near the CBP checkpoints at the foot of the bridge on the El Paso side. The soldiers told CBP that they did not realize they had entered U.S. territory. CBP contacted Mexican military leadership who soon arrived at the international bridge. Shortly before 5 a.m., all the soldiers, equipment and vehicles were returned to Mexico, CBP said. Similar border incidents have occurred over the years, often involving Mexican soldiers or federal police from other parts of Mexico who cross the borderline into the U.S. at the middle of the international bridges in El Paso.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The home arena of the NBA’s Utah Jazz announced Friday that it will require proof of vaccination against COVID-19 or a negative coronavirus test for all fans over the age of 12. Vivint Smart Home Arena, located in Salt Lake City, will require fans to present proof of vaccination or a negative coronavirus test taken within 72 hours of the event to enter the venue. Employees who work at the arena are required to be fully vaccinated. “As a community gathering place, we have a responsibility to protect our guests by putting health and safety standards in place,” Jim Olson, president of Vivint Arena and the Utah Jazz, said in a statement. “We believe this is the path forward to shut down this pandemic.” Guests under the age of 12 will be allowed inside the arena if they wear a mask at all times. Other guests are strongly encouraged to wear a face mask, but it is not mandatory.\n\nVermont\n\nWilliston: Three people were sent to a hospital with nonlife-threatening complaints Friday after being exposed to bear spray at a local hotel, the Williston Fire Department said. Emergency crews were sent to a local inn about 10:30 a.m. Friday after receiving a report that four employees were having difficulty breathing. The investigation determined a can of bear attack deterrent was left in one of the second floor rooms where it was accidentally discharged by housekeeping staff. Bear spray is stronger than police pepper spray. Officials said 30 people in the hotel were evacuated. Three people were taken to a hospital and a fourth was treated at the hotel and released. The firefighters ventilated the building. Occupants and staff of the hotel were able to reoccupy the building shortly after noon.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: The University of Virginia has announced plans for a new performing arts center funded by a $50 million donation. University President Jim Ryan said the gift is being made by Tessa Ader. The news release said the new center for dance, concerts, theater and other performances will be in the area known as the Emmet-Ivy corridor. “My late husband, Richard, and I long felt that a state-of-the-art performing arts center was needed by the University of Virginia,” Ader said in a statement to The Daily Progress. “I believe this new facility will be a wonderful asset to our community and am hopeful my gift will encourage others to come forward as well to make it a reality.” Although designs haven’t been completed, the university said the center will include a concert hall with more than 1,000 seats, a 150-seat recital hall and rehearsal studios. The center will also hold national touring artists. “The performing arts center will be a place that celebrates the arts as fundamental to the human condition, a university education and a democratic society,” Ryan said in the news release.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: An administrative law judge has recommended that a Native American tribe in Washington state once again be allowed to hunt gray whales – a major step in its decadeslong effort to resume the ancient practice. “This is a testament to what we’ve been saying all these years: that we’re doing everything we can to show we’re moving forward responsibly,” Patrick DePoe, vice chairman of the Makah Tribe on the remote northwestern tip of the Olympic Peninsula, said Friday. “We’re not doing this for commercial reasons. We’re doing it for spiritual and cultural reasons.” DePoe was in high school in the late 1990s when the Makah were last allowed to hunt whales – occasions that drew angry protests from animal rights activists, who sometimes threw smoke bombs at the whalers and sprayed fire extinguishers into their faces. Since then, the tribe’s attempts have been tied up in legal challenges and scientific review. A federal appeals court ruled in 2002 that the Makah needed a waiver under the Marine Mammal Protection Act; the tribe applied for one in 2005 but still hasn’t received one. On Thursday, nearly two years after he presided over a hearing on NOAA Fisheries’ proposal to approve the waiver, administrative law Judge George Jordan issued his 156-page recommendation to the U.S. Department of Commerce, finding that the tribal hunts would have no effect on the healthy overall population of the whales. The recommendation, along with a public comment period and further environmental analysis, will inform the department’s final decision, though no timeline for that has been set. As proposed, the waiver would allow the tribe to land up to 20 Eastern North Pacific gray whales over 10 years, with hunts timed to minimize the low chances of the hunters accidentally harpooning an endangered Western North Pacific gray whale.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice is urging residents who got the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine to get their booster shot, citing the rising number of hospitalizations involving vaccinated people. There were 16,223 active COVID-19 cases reported statewide on Friday, with 1,008 people being treated in a hospital, according to the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources. The number of fully vaccinated people who have been hospitalized has increased 20%, Justice said. “That tells us there’s a growing need, more and more and more, for people that are fully vaccinated to get their booster shot,” he said. He said booster shots are available, for the most part, for people age 18 and over who had their second Pfizer shot at least six months ago. Booster shots are not yet available for other vaccines. Justice also pleaded again for the unvaccinated to get the vaccine. He said 3,700 doses have been given since the last update, but that’s not enough. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, West Virginia ranks last among the states in doses administered per 100,000 population.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:North America’s oldest polar bear living in human care at the Milwaukee County Zoo has died, zoo officials said Saturday. The Journal Sentinel reported 36-year-old Snow Lilly was euthanized Friday because of her declining health and subsequent quality of life concerns. According to the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, the median life expectancy for polar bears in human care is about 23 years. A recent wellness exam found Snow Lilly had heart disease and was undergoing other age-related changes, the release said. Snow Lilly came to the Milwaukee County Zoo in 2005 from the Bronx Zoo. “Snow Lilly was a visitor favorite at the Zoo and considered one of the iconic animals in the population,” said Zoo Director Amos Morris in a statement. “She will be sorely missed by both staff and visitors.” In recent years, the zoo called on Snow Lilly to stand in for a groundhog and usher in spring at a Groundhog’s Day celebration in 2018. She also shared a birthday with Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Christian Yelich. A necropsy will be performed, as important information can continue to be collected from it and help other polar bears living in human care. Final necropsy results will be forthcoming in the upcoming months.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: Kristi Gabriel, 42, who survived a brush with death with COVID-19 but also lost her father and aunt to the disease, is pleading for the public to get vaccinated. “Even though I’ve gone through what I’ve gone through, some of my family still doesn’t agree with the vaccine,” she said. “And it’s shocking. It’s difficult to try to explain things to them. … I know there is a lot of misleading information out there and I know sources are trying to cut down on that, but you can’t eliminate them all. It’s unbelievable some of the fictitious stuff that’s out there and people are buying into.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/27"}]}

Modest homes are nestled into the bottomlands along a creek with gardens that grow corn and zucchini under a hot summer sun.\n\nThe first sign of the devastation above is a glimpse of a treeless mesa.\n\nAs Neece navigates his Ford F-150 pickup truck past an abandoned security booth, he drives into a barren expanse. The forest is gone, replaced by grasses. The tops and sides of entire mountains have been blasted away by dynamite.\n\nNeece stops at about 1,000 feet above the hollow to look at what is left of his mountain, where a coal mining company walked away and left sheer cliffs, exposed and dangerous, after miners gouged the black bituminous coal from the mountainside with huge earth-moving machines.\n\nNeece bought the mountain in 2012 as an investment in coal, just before the bottom fell out of the Eastern Kentucky coal industry in 2015. His tenant left behind nearly two miles of unstable rock-faced cliffs that Neece estimates are as tall as 250 feet.\n\nBy law, mining companies are supposed to remedy the damage they cause, a process known as contemporaneous reclamation. Slopes are supposed to be stabilized and returned to their original contour; rainfall needs to be managed; grasses or trees must be planted.\n\nNone of that happened.\n\nNow, Neece said, the property is both unsafe and basically worthless because he isn’t sure if or when, or even how, it will ever be reclaimed.\n\n“They never did nothing,” Neece said angrily of the now-bankrupt coal companies that sheared off the sides of his mountain. “You can’t use it for nothing.”\n\nHis experience is emblematic of coal’s accelerating demise in the United States and the environmental devastation its use has left behind.\n\nEnvironmental scientist Emily Bernhardt of Duke University said the damage would last “millennia.” A law professor in West Virginia, Pat McGinley, said there are coal areas in his state where “everything is contaminated, environments are wrecked and there’s no responsibility or no consequences.”\n\nThe damage is widespread:\n\nIn Pennsylvania, underground mine fires burn and iron-laden, acidic water pours into rivers from abandoned mine shafts.\n\nIn New Hampshire, the iconic sugar maple is threatened by soil damage lingering from coal-induced acid rain.\n\nIn Florida, a young mother obsesses over air and water pollution from a vast pile of coal ash stored by her local utility.\n\nAnd in Kentucky, the multi-billion dollar cost of reclaiming abandoned mines like Neece’s far exceeds the surety bonds left behind by an increasing number of bankrupt coal companies.\n\nAcross Appalachia, mountaintop removal and other forms of surface mining have scarred more than 2,300 square miles in Kentucky, West Virginia, Virginia and Tennessee.\n\nNationwide, over a million acres of land used by mines that are still operating, idle or abandoned need to be cleaned up and reclaimed — a job President Biden’s new $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill can only begin to address.\n\n“The size of this problem is absolutely massive,” said Eric Dixon, a researcher who has studied abandoned mine lands nationally.\n\nCoal is the dirtiest fossil fuel and has contributed more to global warming than either oil or gas. By one estimate, 46 percent of all man-made greenhouse gases spewed into the atmosphere since 1750 have come from coal, raising seas that threaten major cities and supercharging hurricanes.\n\nThe world has responded, albeit slowly.\n\nThe amount of U.S. electricity generated from coal dropped from 50 percent to 20 percent since 2005, though it’s projected to tick back to 23 percent this year. The European Union is moving even more quickly away from coal. And at the United Nations climate talks last month in Glasgow, 40 nations said they would phase out the use of coal.\n\nYet China and India, which burn two-thirds of the world’s coal, refused to make that pledge, as did the United States and Australia, a major coal exporter. And while Chinese President Xi Jinping said in September that China would stop building coal plants overseas, the nation continues to build coal plants domestically and still gets most of its electricity from coal.\n\nIn fact, China’s greenhouse gas emissions from coal alone exceed the total emissions of the United States.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General António Guterres has said ''accelerating the global phaseout of coal is the single most important step” toward meeting the Paris Agreement’s goal of keeping global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n\nAs this focus on coal has intensified, an international coalition of environmentalists and lawyers has begun a global campaign to make systemic, long-lasting environmental devastation like coal extraction an international crime called “ecocide” before the International Criminal Court, alongside genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and crimes of aggression.\n\nThe campaign’s future is uncertain. And even if ecocide were to become an international crime five or six years from now, it would have no legal bearing in the United States. The U.S. is not among the court’s 123 member nations, and coal mining has been expressly permitted, and promoted, by the U.S. government since its inception.\n\nBut those behind the campaign and many U.S. environmentalists say “ecocide” and the broad concept of crimes against nature provide a new and important moral framework for viewing widespread environmental damage as an affront to humanity.\n\nThe definition put forth by a panel of lawyers and legal scholars, convened by the Stop Ecocide Foundation earlier this year, evokes the devastation caused by coal mining. “Widespread” environmental harm, the lawyers wrote, “means damage which extends beyond a limited geographic area, crosses state boundaries, or is suffered by an entire ecosystem or species or a large number of human beings.”\n\n“Long-term” harm, they said, “means damage which is irreversible or which cannot be redressed through natural recovery within a reasonable period of time.”\n\nBernhardt, an ecosystem ecologist and biogeochemist who has been studying Appalachian strip mines and working to understand the long-term impacts of coal for nearly two decades, said blowing the tops off mountains fundamentally alters the planet.\n\n“We have actually changed the slope distribution of an entire ecoregion,” she said. “So it's a different shape than it was before. Water moves through it differently” and when it does, it picks up pollutants that could seep out “for decades if not centuries.\n\n“There are coal mines from the Roman Empire,” she said, “that are still emitting acid pollution.”\n\nIn Kentucky, part of a mountain removed\n\nThe land in eastern Kentucky that Tracy Neece leased for mining was first purchased by his grandfather in the 1930s. It’s surrounded by other strip mines.\n\nNeece said his decision to lease his mountain seemed like a good idea at the time. He is not opposed to strip mining if it’s done within the law and with proper reclamation, and he says he had every expectation the regulations would be followed.\n\nMining, he said, has “fed many families and provided a lot of jobs,” and surface mining can make more land accessible for hunting and other uses. On his property, he said, he wanted “to create some flat ground for house sites. Or you could run cattle on it.”\n\nSen. Manchin, a Democrat with family ties to the coal industry who is among coal mining’s staunchest defenders, frequently echoes a familiar refrain.\n\n“American coal miners are the backbone of our great nation,” Manchin said at a National Press Club appearance in April. “For generations, our coal miners have mined the coal that forged the steel that developed the tanks and ships, and the industries we know that ensure our country is the strongest in the world.”\n\nManchin has also almost single-handedly blocked much of President Biden’s climate agenda in Congress this year in an effort to give coal a lifeline in a carbon-constrained world by pressing for costly and unproven carbon capture technologies.\n\nBut West Virginia, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and all the other coal states have paid a high health and environmental price for the nation’s economic growth, and the costs are still piling up.\n\nIn hindsight, Neece said he wishes he had never signed a lease with James River Coal, and that Revelation, the bankrupt Blackjewel company that left the property in its current condition, had never taken over the James River lease after James River went bankrupt.\n\nAs it is, trespassers on all-terrain vehicles could now unknowingly drive off the top, Neece fears. Rocks could fall on homes down below. Rain could cause landslides.\n\n“They knew what they were doing,” Neece said of Revelation. “They just wanted to make a million dollars, you know, take everything they could and go. They had no intention of putting it back.”\n\nHe said he also feels let down by Kentucky state mining regulators, who allowed the mining to occur without contemporaneous reclamation.\n\nRecords show Kentucky issued multiple notices of violations between 2016 and 2019 for mining regulations, including failing to reclaim 10,000 feet of highwall left behind the miners.\n\nThe company also was cited for failing to maintain proper drainage to control sediment runoff and properly manage waste rock, called mine spoils, blasted from the hillside.\n\n“It is clear from what I have seen, looking at the enforcement records that go back to 2016, there was a huge problem on this permit,” said Mary Varson Cromer, deputy director of the Appalachian Citizens Law Center in nearby Whitesburg, Kentucky.\n\nFrom 2016 to the company’s bankruptcy in 2019, the state did “very little” to enforce its regulations beyond issuing violation notices, she said.\n\nKentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet spokesman John Mura said in a written statement the state was working to resolve the problems at the mine, which it considers “a high reclamation priority.”\n\nIn Kentucky, the state funds reclamation of bankrupt mines like the one on Neece’s property through bonds purchased by mining companies, or a shared risk bond pool funded by fees on the industry if the mining company bonds fall short. But the worst may now be happening.\n\nOverall, Kentucky’s reclamation liability ranges from $1.9 billion to $2.4 billion compared with company bonds of about $888 million, according to a July report by Appalachian Voices, an environmental group. Similar deficits exist in other coal states.\n\nOn Neece’s property alone, the state estimated the cost of reclamation of more than 300 acres to be $10 million, according to records filed in bankruptcy court. Yet the state only required about $1.7 million in reclamation bonds.\n\n“I think we all know, we are in a position here where we are upside down and we got probably more problems than we got money,” Commissioner Charles “Rusty” Justice said at a March meeting of the state’s Kentucky Reclamation Guaranty Fund Commission.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, coal mining’s long run\n\nA similar state of underfunded despair exists in northeast Pennsylvania’s Wyoming Valley, about 125 miles northwest of New York City, where coal mining fueled the industrial revolution in Boston, New York and Philadelphia.\n\nThe big mines have been gone for decades. But the industry left behind massive problems.\n\nAmong them:\n\nA 55-acre pile of toxic coal waste in Swoyersville.\n\nMillions of gallons of iron-laden, acidic water pouring out of the Old Forge Borehole near Scranton.\n\nA 15-acre underground mine fire near Olyphant that’s burned longer than many kids in town have been alive.\n\nAnd across the region, the ever-present risk of the collapsing underground mine timbers and the deadly surface cave-ins they can cause.\n\nCongress passed the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act in 1977 to address many of these problems. It established federal regulations for surface mining, required mine reclamation and set forth bonding requirements to make sure reclamation occurs if companies go bankrupt.\n\nIt also established the Abandoned Mine Land fund to address environmental damage from mines abandoned before 1977.\n\nSince then, some 978,000 acres and $7.9 billion worth of damage from mines left behind before 1977 have been cleaned up nationally, according to an April report from the Ohio River Valley Institute.\n\nBut another 850,000 acres of abandoned mine lands remain, and cleaning them up will cost another $18.3 billion to $24.4 billion — more than twice the official estimate from the federal government.\n\nThose costs are likely to grow to as much as $33.6 billion by 2050.\n\nThe vast majority of mines abandoned before 1977 are in Alabama, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia.\n\nPennsylvania has already spent $1.26 billion in grant funds since 1980 to reclaim thousands of abandoned coal mines, including eliminating more than 270 miles of dangerous “high walls” left behind by surface mining, according to state officials.\n\nPennsylvania tops the seven states with an estimated $8.5 billion in unmet reclamation needs, according to the Ohio River Valley Institute’s analysis of the federal government's abandoned mine land inventory.\n\nWest Virginia has $5 billion in needs; Kentucky, $1.2 billion.\n\nWhether or when these problems can be addressed largely depends on Congress. The main source of funding to address pre-1977 abandoned mine lands is a fund supported by coal-mining fees.\n\nThe bipartisan infrastructure bill President Biden signed in November reauthorized the mine fund, even while reducing the assessment on coal mining companies. It also directed $11 billion to assist in reclamation projects over the next 15 years — enough to take a bite out of the problem, but not solve it.\n\nStill, Pennsylvania is now looking to get an extra $250 million a year — an “unprecedented” amount, compared with the $56 million a year it has been getting for the last five years, said Brian Bradley, director of the Bureau of Abandoned Mine Reclamation in Pennsylvania's Department of Environmental Protection.\n\nSwoyersville\n\nIn Swoyersville, a historic mining community of about 5,000 just north of Wilkes-Barre, a massive pile of coal waste stands as tall as a 17-story building, surrounded on three sides by homes.\n\nThe dusty black material, enough to fill 26,000 rail cars, is left over from decades of coal mining by residents on the west side of the Susquehanna River.\n\nWinds send ash into nearby backyards. Rain falling on the pile pollutes local waterways and groundwater. Trespassers on all-terrain vehicles risk injuries. The pile is also a fire hazard.\n\nThere’s a plan to eliminate the pile in 10 to 20 years, but it depends on securing long-term financing from the abandoned mine fund or subsidies from the U.S. treasury.\n\nThe borough’s two-term mayor, Christopher Concert, said the pile is just not that big of a deal to many of his constituents. He recalls visiting relatives in Swoyersville in the winter as a child, 40 years ago, and sliding down the pile’s snow-covered banks.\n\nThat said, Concert called the coal mining waste, known locally as culm, “disgusting.”\n\n“We need it hauled away,” he said. “I am praying that our state representatives, our congressmen, our senators, make more money available to make sure that that gets done.”\n\nThe Old Forge Borehole\n\nThe Old Forge Borehole is half an hour’s drive north from Swoyersville. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers drilled the hole, 42-inches-wide and 170-feet-deep, in 1961, so water threatening people’s basements could drain out of abandoned underground mines.\n\nFor more than 60 years now, from an outlet near Scranton, there’s been an uncontrolled release of polluted mine water into the Lackawanna River just upstream from where it flows into the Susquehanna River.\n\nAt this one location, anyway, acid levels have finally declined to near normal, state officials said on a recent visit, but the outlet is still dumping thousands of pounds of iron into the river daily.\n\nIn dry weather, the mine water is traffic-cone orange and, along with water from another mine outlet nearby, discolors the Lackawanna and Susquehanna rivers for three miles. The river bottom and shoreline rocks along its path are blanketed in a coating of iron, wrecking habitat for fish and other aquatic life.\n\nOfficials are talking with private business interests to see whether there could be a commercial market for the iron, or even the potential for hydropower generation, said Bernie McGurl, executive director of the Lackawanna River Corridor Association.\n\nOtherwise, he said, it could take a thousand or even two thousand years for nature to clean up the mine water. Being an entrepreneur in the Wyoming Valley, he said, “means making money off the destruction left by coal.”\n\nOlyphant\n\nA half-hour north, near the town of Olyphant, a 15-acre fire in an underground coal mine vents a rotten egg smell through crevices and pipes. It has been burning for 17 years.\n\nAfter spending more than $25 million to contain the fire, state officials think they can extinguish the inferno by next year. It’s one of more than three-dozen mine fires the state had identified, as of last year.\n\nNationally, at least 7,000 acres of mine fires are burning, with an estimated cost of more than $1 billion to remediate.\n\nThis one, called the Dolph Mine Fire, started with burning trash on top of a culm pile, like the one in Swoyersville. The fire fell through to the mine below and has been burning ever since.\n\nBy 2008, the U.S. Office of Surface Mining and Reclamation had dug a 3,400-foot-long, 150-foot-deep trench to isolate the fire. Now, on a 75-acre footprint, contractors have constructed ponds and are filling them with water.\n\nTheir plan is to use surface mining techniques, including blasting and digging, to extinguish the fire by dousing it with water and foam. When exposed to the open air, it could burn up to 1,400 degrees. Their completion date: January 2023.\n\nIt’s tricky work, Bradley said. The contractor will be drilling into the culm pile and rock that overlays the old mine, putting explosives in holes to break up the rock and get down to the burning coal. The closer they get to the areas that have been burning, the hotter the rock will be and the more dangerous the work will be for the contractor.\n\n“So one challenge is always just dealing with explosives in holes that are already hot,” he said. They meet that challenge by cooling the rock before blasting.\n\nThe fire that started at the Dolph Mine is just the sort of worst-case situation that worries Henry Zielinski, vice president of generation and reclamation for the Northampton Generating Co., the parent company that is overseeing reclamation at the Swoyersville coal waste pile.\n\n“There is the potential that if this did catch on fire that you are not putting it out,” Zielinski said. “Maybe you are going to isolate it and let it burn.”\n\nLong-term questions about the viability of the cleanup — which depends on more government funding and burning the coal waste to produce electricity in marginally competitive plants — remain among skeptical residents.\n\n“They said it would take 20 years to clean up,” said Bill Smith, who lives a couple of blocks away from the pile and was outside on a sunny fall day, fixing his clothesline. While he said he is not bothered by the pile “because it’s always been here,” he also expects it to be around for a lot longer.\n\n“Guess what, it will take more than 20 years,” he said.\n\nIn New Hampshire, acid rain and recovery\n\nCharles Driscoll hikes up a leaf-strewn path in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in Woodstock, New Hampshire, where the recovery could take a century, or more. It’s a chilly, sunny October morning, with loon calls reverberating from nearby Mirror Lake.\n\nNearly all the sugar maple leaves have fallen to the ground, along with many from beech trees, creating a golden mat with splashes of red that feels soft underfoot.\n\nDriscoll runs Syracuse University’s Center for Environmental Systems Engineering and is a co-author of hundreds of scientific papers, many of them based at Hubbard Brook, one of the most studied forests in the world.\n\nHubbard Brook is where the pioneering ecologist Gene Likens in the 1960s co-discovered acid rain in North America and later, in 1974, co-identified fossil fuel combustion as its cause.\n\nIt was also here where Likens, Driscoll and others revealed how acid rain from burning coal had stripped away soil nutrients that are vital to the region’s most iconic tree species — the sugar maple — with its brilliant yellow, orange and red leaves in the fall and syrup production in the spring.\n\nWhen coal and other fossil fuels are burned, the emissions include sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides and can reach the ground as wet or dry depositions. They mix with water, oxygen and other chemicals to form sulfuric and nitric acid, and they can alter rain, fog or hail.\n\nThey can also land as particles and acidify water and soil that way.\n\nAcid rain was a key target of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, signed by President George H.W. Bush. The law dramatically lowered emissions of sulfur dioxide from coal-burning power plants that had done so much damage to lakes and forests in the Eastern United States.\n\nOther provisions required pollution controls for nitrogen oxides.\n\nAcid levels in rain and lakes have come down and fish populations that had been wiped out in some lakes have started to return. Curbing acid rain is considered a major bipartisan environmental accomplishment.\n\n“Sulfur deposition has decreased about 80 percent and acid rain has decreased about 80 percent,” Likens said in a Zoom interview. “So it is much, much improved, and that is a big success story.”\n\nBut both Driscoll and Likens say damaged soils and their lingering effects on sugar maples have a long journey to recovery, and may not make it. These soils are the product of thousands of years of weathering. Recovery, Likens says, could take “decades, maybe centuries.”\n\nDriscoll turns off the forest path and heads deeper into the woods, side-stepping fallen tree trunks and coming to a small opening where a cut in a hillside exposed a few feet of soil.\n\nHe scrapes at the soil, leaving a fresh cut, then kneels down to take a closer look and to poke at it with his finger.\n\n“In areas like the Adirondacks or like Hubbard Brook, the soils are derived from minerals that are very difficult to break down and they have very slow weathering rates,” Driscoll explained.\n\nThe soils are naturally acidic. “And so we think either based on historical measurements or based on model calculations, that acid rain has leached out a significant fraction, primarily calcium, but also magnesium. And so trees that need large amounts of those materials are challenged.”\n\nLike sugar maples, he says. The problem isn’t only at Hubbard Brook but on landscapes with similar soils in other areas of the Northeast and as far away as Germany and China.\n\nThe damage to the maple forest and individual trees is significant.\n\nThe phenomenon is often referred to as sugar maple syndrome. Particularly with older, big sugar maples, one branch or a couple branches will turn color early in the fall before the rest of the tree does. Then some of the upper branches will die back.\n\nOver “maybe four or five, or six years, then the upper part of the tree dies back, and then ultimately, the tree will succumb,” Likens said.\n\nIt’s not only the older trees that are affected. Young seedlings cannot get established, which has prevented sugar maples from reproducing.\n\nOne of the reasons these scientists are so confident about their conclusions is from an experiment they conducted in part of the Hubbard Brook forest in the late 1990s, following up on a 1996 paper published in the journal Science, on the long-term effects of acid rain on a forest ecosystem.\n\nStanding near a weir that was collecting and discharging water from a stream, with sensors to detect the flow and water chemistry, Driscoll explained what came next.\n\n“We got funding from the National Science Foundation, and so the plan was to add back the calcium that was lost from historical acid rain, and see how the ecosystem recovers. And so we did it. It was applied by helicopter.”\n\nIn all, some 40 tons of slow-release calcium pellets were dropped over a 29-acre watershed in October 1999, and the experiment has been running ever since.\n\nResults were soon obvious. The ferns and other plants growing on the ground became greener, a change first noticed by the late Yale University forest ecology professor Tom Siccama.\n\n“I thought he was crazy,” Driscoll recalled, but a check of the plants’ internal chemistry revealed higher chlorophyll content.\n\nThe observations have continued.\n\n“We saw that the seedlings for sugar maple, which were not really very prominent throughout the forest, were very prominent here,” in the watershed that had received the calcium, Driscoll said. “So immediately, we saw a generation of sugar maple, which had been shut down for years, just spring back like magic.\n\nHe added, “And the canopy trees, within a short period of time, they completely responded to it — their growth greatly improved.”\n\nBut that’s only on a small research plot.\n\nIt would be too costly and impractical and probably politically unacceptable to spread calcium from helicopters over large swaths of the Eastern United States in areas where acid rain damaged the soils.\n\nClimate change is another stressor for sugar maples, one that researchers across the region are watching closely. A 2018 report from the U.S. Forest Service, on New England and Northern New York forest vulnerabilities, found the quality of sugar maple habitat is projected to decline under a higher-end greenhouse gas scenario.\n\nBut it’s those soil deficiencies of calcium from acid rain, due in large part to burning coal, that could deliver the knock-out punch to sugar maples in forests like this one, with its poorer quality soils.\n\n“I think it's going to occur over decades,” Driscoll said of the sugar maple decline. “You have these large canopy trees, they're functioning, but they're just not functioning very well. And regeneration has completely stopped.\n\n“So there's no small maples to replace the canopy maples when they die out,” he said. “And the sugar maples are being displaced by American beech in the forest.”\n\nEventually, as the climate continues to warm, oak trees may take over, leaving this particular forest but a memory.\n\nIn Florida, coal ash and scrubber sludge\n\nTucked among scattered pine and cypress trees in Orlando, Florida, a 175-foot-tall mountain of coal ash looms as a stark, physical representation of this booming region's reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nIt sits beside two towering coal plants, their looming cylinder-shaped cooling towers sending curls of steam into the clouds from the most conspicuous part of the Orlando Utilities Commission's (OUC) sprawling east Orlando, energy-generating complex known as Stanton Energy Center.\n\nPiper Vargas is especially aware of the landfill. Vargas fears dust particles carried by the wind from the landfill six miles to the tidy blue lakeside home she shares with her husband, Oscar, and two sons: Max, 8, and Diego, 5.\n\nShe worries about what inhaling toxic particles might do to her family, especially her sons, and how it might affect groundwater, a vital freshwater resource in the area.\n\nCoal ash and other combustion wastes are what remains after coal is burned for electricity, and it contains toxic contaminants such as mercury, cadmium and arsenic that can pollute the air and groundwater and are associated with cancer and other health ailments.\n\nVargas' fears escalated into panic attacks, and she and her husband considered moving from their neighborhood, where the family enjoys working in their vegetable garden in the backyard and engaging in outdoor sports like soccer and tennis.\n\n\"My mind starts to go to those places like, 'Why do we still live here?'\" says Vargas, 38, a full-time mom who began homeschooling her kids just before the pandemic. \"They're not cleaning that up. Or they're still burning (coal) right now. They still have years left of burning it.\"\n\nAnd, she wonders, what exactly happens to all that coal ash, and “what they do with that toxic waste,” she says.\n\nOver the last century, as the U.S. increasingly relied on coal to power its economy, hundreds of power plants produced billions of tons of ash and other combustion wastes, including scrubber sludge.\n\nThe more air pollution utilities were required to scrub from their smokestack emissions to comply with clean-air rules, the more coal-burning wastes they made. As the controls kept pollutants out of the air, some became part of the ash, making it more toxic, including contaminants such as mercury, cadmium and arsenic, associated with cancer and other serious health effects.\n\nAll that coal-burning waste had to go somewhere.\n\nUtilities dumped it into watery, unlined pits called coal-ash ponds, piled it office-tower-high in landfills, sent it to public works departments to spread on icy winter roads, used it as a dirt alternative at construction sites for embankment or structural fill and disposed of it at old coal mines.\n\nFor 28 years, OUC dumped much of its coal-burning waste into its main landfill, covering about 90 acres.\n\nThat dumping stopped on Aug. 28, 2015, just 52 days before the first national regulations on the management of coal-burning wastes went into effect. The maneuver exempted the landfill from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s rules for environmental monitoring and, if contamination were to be found, from a requirement to take corrective actions.\n\nThose rules now only apply to a new, active cell next to the landfill that the utility uses and any future cells it fills with ash.\n\nRegardless, said OUC spokesman Tim Trudell, the utility recognizes its responsibility with coal.\n\n“We will continue to monitor that site for as long as it takes,” he said.\n\nOUC’s situation is not unique, according to environmental watchdogs. They say OUC’s actions took advantage of a widely used loophole that was written into EPA’s Coal Combustion Residuals Rule, passed in 2015 near the end of the Obama administration, after decades of battles among environmentalists, industry and the EPA during Democratic and Republican administrations.\n\nEPA, by exempting many ash disposal sites that had ceased receiving coal-burning waste by the time the rule went into effect that year, may have exempted as much as half of all of such waste ever generated in the United States, from Florida to Alaska, environmental groups estimate.\n\n“It’s not being monitored and therefore it’s not triggering corrective action requirements of the rule,\" said Lisa Evans, a senior attorney specializing in hazardous waste law at Earthjustice, a national environmental law organization. \"So you're going to have this poisonous legacy, which could last permanently at many, many sites.”\n\nEPA’s 2015 coal ash regulations were spurred by major disasters. One was near Knoxville on Dec. 22, 2008, when a levee that was holding a mountain of sodden ash suddenly broke loose from the Tennessee Valley Authority’s Kingston power plant.\n\nSome 300 acres were smothered. The ash spilled into two rivers. Three homes were destroyed, dozens more were damaged. In the years since, hundreds of cleanup workers fell ill and many have died.\n\nThen in 2014, tens of thousands of tons of coal ash spilled from a Duke Energy power plant into the Dan River at Eden, North Carolina, affecting 70 miles of the watershed downstream.\n\nFor decades, EPA had exempted coal ash from its ‘‘hazardous waste’’ definition, a result of a 1980 amendment added by the late U.S. Rep. Tom Bevill, D-Alabama, to the nation’s main law for regulating hazardous and solid waste. Bevill was a 15-term congressman known as the “King of Pork” for his ability to return federal dollars to his home state. He was also known for delivering for the fossil fuel industry.\n\nIn his Congressional testimony at the time, Bevill said the intent of his amendment was to curb pending EPA rules on fossil fuel wastes to protect the coal and electric utility industries from “unnecessary burdens” and high costs, and to “encourage coal as a primary source of domestic energy.” Fossil fuel wastes, Bevill argued to his Congressional colleagues, were not a “substantial hazard” to human health or the environment.\n\nThirty-five years later, despite having found dozens of examples across the country where coal ash had, or was likely to have, contaminated groundwater, polluted lakes or caused fish deformities, the EPA in 2015 sided with the coal and electric utilities industry, and again declined to deem coal-burning wastes as hazardous.\n\nEPA officials concluded the way it planned to regulate coal ash as a solid waste — a less rigorous category under the law — would be enough to prevent ash pile collapses, blowing ash dust and groundwater contamination. The officials also said their preferred strategy would give utilities “a practical approach” to managing its massive collection of coal-burning wastes.\n\nThe EPA has so far all but left enforcement of its coal ash regulations up to citizens, or states, resulting in a hodgepodge of contradictory and confusing activity.\n\nIn some states, like North Carolina and South Carolina after the Southern Environmental Law Center sued, essentially all ash ponds are being drained and dug out, their toxic sludge sent to modern landfills with protective liners. SELC and its partners have won other victories for ash pond cleanups in Virginia and Tennessee.\n\nIn other states, it’s been a mixed bag, with utilities being allowed to merely drain and cover their ash ponds, a practice known as “cap-in-place.”\n\n“The only way this becomes a public controversy,” said South Carolina’s Frank Holleman, a senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, “is either a local community group gets concerned and brings it to the attention of some environmental legal advocacy group, or the legal advocacy and environmental group learns about the problem and checks around and sees a local community that has a vague notion but isn’t quite sure what's going on. Or third, you have a catastrophe.”\n\nWhile the Trump administration, with its fossil-fuels agenda, was able to relax parts of the Obama-era rule, extending compliance deadlines and allowing utilities to request exemptions, other parts have remained, including requirements for utilities to monitor and report on groundwater conditions.\n\nWith all that monitoring, a better understanding of the scale of coal ash contamination across the country has emerged.\n\nA 2019 report by the Environmental Integrity Project and other advocacy groups revealed polluted groundwater was even more widespread than previously known. They found unsafe levels of toxic contaminants linked to more than nine out of every 10 coal-fired power plants with monitoring data.\n\nIn all, unsafe levels of contamination were reported in groundwater at sites in 39 states and Puerto Rico.\n\nIllinois has the most power plants with polluted ash storage sites with 16, followed by Texas, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, North Carolina and Missouri, all with more than 10.\n\nFlorida had nine power plants with polluted ash storage sites, including at the Stanton Energy Center, the report found.\n\nEnvironmental advocates are looking to the Biden administration to deny utilities’ requests for cleanup exemptions made to the Trump administration, to start using new enforcement authority that Congress gave the EPA over coal combustion wastes in 2016 and require cleanup of contamination caused by ash dumping that occurred before that rule went into effect.\n\nFor its part, the Biden administration this year decided to retain the Trump administration’s coal-ash rule revisions, saying that would be the “most environmentally protective course,” while promising to revisit coal-ash management in future rule-making.\n\nAn agency spokesperson also said the EPA is investigating compliance concerns and potential environmental risks as part of its relatively new enforcement authority over the coal combustion wastes.\n\nEvans, the Earthjustice attorney, has urged the agency to take a broad approach and close the loopholes and gaps in its regulations, to prevent long-term risks.\n\n“These coal plant sites that operated for nearly a century in some cases buried toxic waste all over,” Evans says. “As these sites are retired, and in order to make sure this isn’t a long toxic legacy, you have to deal with all the toxic sources.”\n\nAmy Green, a reporter with WMFE public radio, reported from Orlando.\n\nInsideClimate News is a Pulitzer Prize-winning, non-profit, non-partisan news organization dedicated to covering climate change, energy and the environment.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/01/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/24/europe/ukraine-russia-conflict-explainer-2-cmd-intl/index.html", "title": "What does Putin want in Ukraine?

Now the country is in the throes of war, with a humanitarian disaster unfolding.\n\nAfter months of military buildup and brinkmanship on Russia’s side of the border, Ukraine’s 44 million residents woke up to an all-out conflict on Thursday. Fighting has erupted in several cities across the country, including in the capital, Kyiv, and nearly a half a million people have fled to neighboring countries, according to the United Nations.\n\nRussia had been tightening its military grip around Ukraine since last year, amassing tens of thousands of soldiers, as well as equipment and artillery, on the country’s doorstep.\n\nBlack smoke rises from a military airport in Chuguyev near Kharkiv, the second-largest city in Ukraine, on Thursday. Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFrenzied diplomatic efforts early this year failed to avert the worst-case scenario. Now those troops are engaged in combat with Ukrainians for control of the country.\n\nThe escalation in a years-long conflict between the nations has now triggered the greatest security crisis in Europe since the Cold War. Russia’s attack on the country has also sparked an intense showdown between Western powers and Moscow.\n\nSo how did we get here? The picture on the ground is shifting rapidly, but here’s a breakdown of what we know.\n\nHow did Russia invade Ukraine?\n\nSeveral areas across Ukraine came under attack on Thursday morning after Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the start of a “special military operation” and warned of bloodshed unless Ukrainian forces lay down their arms.\n\nThe move came after months of speculation about what Moscow’s intentions were with the troops it had massed on the Ukrainian border. At least 150,000 Russian troops encircled the country on three sides, like a sickle, according to estimates from US and Ukrainian intelligence officials.\n\nIn late 2021 and early 2022, fears heightened as satellite images revealed new Russian deployments of troops, tanks, artillery and other equipment cropping up in multiple locations, including near eastern Ukraine, Crimea and Belarus, where its forces were participating in joint drills with Moscow’s closest international ally.\n\nSome of those forces began pouring across the border, crossing into Ukraine from the north in Belarus and to the south from Crimea, according to the Ukrainian State Border Service. Elsewhere, explosions rang out in multiple cities, including the capital Kyiv.\n\nMissile strikes and street fighting have raged in the days since. Military aged men have been ordered to stay in Ukraine, while countless others have fled westwards towards Poland or Romania.\n\nRussia’s larger and far better-equipped military has, faced determined resistance across the country, as ordinary Ukrainians and reservists have joined efforts to defend their families and homes, frustrating Moscow’s attempts.\n\nThat resistance has been “stiffer than expected” and Russia has had unexpected difficulties supplying its forces, two senior US officials with direct knowledge told CNN. On the battlefield, Russia is suffering heavier losses in personnel and armor and aircraft than expected. This is due in part to the fact that Ukrainian air defenses have performed better than pre-invasion US intelligence assessments had anticipated.\n\nBut US intelligence and defense officials closely tracking the Russian campaign say that Putin still holds a number of moves in reserve that could devastate the Ukrainian resistance.\n\nThe US and its allies have said they have no intention of sending troops into Ukraine, which is not a NATO member. But Ukraine has received assistance in other forms from Europe, the US and beyond, as the West united in condemnation of Putin’s move. NATO’s Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg condemned the Russian attack as a “grave breach of international law, and a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security.”\n\nAnd a raft of heavy sanctions have threatened to cripple Russia’s economy; Moscow has been virtually cut off from the Western financial apparatus and the value of its currency, the ruble, has tanked.\n\nThe coordinated assault came days after Putin announced that Moscow would officially recognize the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics (DNR and LNR), in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, ordering the deployment of Russian troops there in what was widely believed to be the opening salvo to a broader military confrontation.\n\nThe territory recognized by Putin extended beyond the areas controlled by pro-Russian separatists, raising red flags about Russia’s intended creep into Ukraine.\n\nWhat set the stage for the conflict?\n\nUkraine was a cornerstone of the Soviet Union until it voted overwhelmingly for independence in a democratic referendum in 1991, a milestone that turned out to be a death knell for the failing superpower.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO pushed eastward, bringing into the fold most of the Eastern European nations that had been in the Communist orbit. In 2004, NATO added the former Soviet Baltic republics Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Four years later, it declared its intention to offer membership to Ukraine some day in the distant future – crossing a red line for Russia.\n\nPutin has seen NATO’s expansion as an existential threat, and the prospect of Ukraine joining the Western military alliance a “hostile act” – a view he invoked in a televised speech on Thursday, saying that Ukraine’s aspiration to join the military alliance was a dire threat to Russia.\n\nIn interviews and speeches, Putin has previously emphasized his view that Ukraine is part of Russia, culturally, linguistically and politically. While some of the mostly Russian-speaking population in Ukraine’s east feel the same, a more nationalist, Ukrainian-speaking population in the west has historically supported greater integration with Europe.\n\nIn early 2014, mass protests in the capital Kyiv known as Euromaidan forced out a Russia-friendly president after he refused to sign an EU association agreement. Russia responded by annexing the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and fomenting a separatist rebellion in Ukraine’s east, which seized control of part of the Donbas region. Despite a ceasefire agreement in 2015, the two sides have not seen a stable peace, and the front line has barely moved since. Nearly 14,000 people have died in the conflict, and there are 1.5 million people internally displaced in Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian government.\n\nIn the eight years since, Moscow has been accused of engaging in hybrid warfare against Ukraine, using cyberattacks, economic pressure and propaganda to whip up discord. Those tactics have escalated in recent months, and in early February the State Department claimed Putin was preparing a false-flag operation to create “a pretext for an invasion.”\n\nWhat does Putin want?\n\nIn a lengthy essay penned in July 2021, Putin referred to Russians and Ukrainians as “one people,” and suggested the West had corrupted Ukraine and yanked it out of Russia’s orbit through a “forced change of identity.”\n\nThat type of historical revisionism was on full display in Putin’s emotional and grievance-packed address to the nation last Monday announcing his decision to recognize the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics, while casting doubt on Ukraine’s own sovereignty.\n\nBut Ukrainians, who in the last three decades have sought to align more closely with Western institutions like the European Union and NATO, have pushed back against the notion that they are little more than the West’s “puppet.”\n\nIn fact, Putin’s efforts to bring Ukraine back into Russia’s sphere have been met with a backlash, with several recent polls showing that a majority of Ukrainians now favor membership of the US-led transatlantic military alliance.\n\nIn December, Putin presented the US and NATO with a list of security demands. Chief among them was a guarantee that Ukraine will never enter NATO and that the alliance rolls back its military footprint in Eastern and Central Europe – proposals that the US and its allies have repeatedly said are non-starters.\n\nPutin indicated he was not interested in lengthy negotiations on the topic. “It is you who must give us guarantees, and you must do it immediately, right now,” he said at his annual news conference late last year. “Are we deploying missiles near the US border? No, we are not. It is the United States that has come to our home with its missiles and is already standing at our doorstep.”\n\nHigh-level talks between the West and Russia wrapped in January without any breakthroughs. The standoff left Europe’s leaders to engage in a frenzy of shuttle diplomacy, exploring whether a negotiating channel established between France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine to resolve the conflict in Ukraine’s east – known as the Normandy Format talks – could provide an avenue for calming the current crisis.\n\nIn a news conference with the new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on February 16, Putin repeated unsubstantiated claims that Ukraine is carrying out a “genocide” against Russian speakers in the Donbas region and called for the conflict to be resolved through the Minsk peace progress – echoing similar rhetoric that was used as a pretext for annexing Crimea.\n\nBut less than a week later, after Russia’s upper house of parliament approved the deployment of military forces outside the country on February 22, Putin told reporters that the Minsk agreements “no longer exist,” adding: “What is there to implement if we have recognized these two entities?”\n\nThe agreements, known as Minsk 1 and Minsk 2 – which were hammered out in the Belarusian capital in a bid to end a bloody in eastern Ukraine – have never been fully implemented, with key issues remaining unresolved.\n\nMoscow and Kyiv have long been at odds over key elements of the peace deal, the second of which was inked in 2015 and lays out a plan for reintegrating the two breakaway republics into Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently stated that he did not like a single point of the Minsk accords, which require dialogue on local elections in the Russian-backed separatist regions and – although unclear in what sequence – would also restore the Ukrainian government’s control over its eastern borders. Critics say the agreement could give Moscow undue sway over Ukrainian politics.\n\nPutin previously responded in blunt terms by saying that regardless of whether Zelensky likes the plan, it must be implemented. “Like it or don’t like it, it’s your duty, my beauty,” Putin said in a news conference alongside French President Emmanuel Macron. Zelensky, a former comedian and TV star, won a 2019 election in a landslide on promises to end the war in Donbas, but little has changed. Responding to a question about Putin’s stark, undiplomatic language, Zelensky responded in Russian, saying bluntly: “We are not his.”\n\nHow has Ukraine responded?\n\nPresident Zelensky previously downplayed the danger of all-out war with Russia, noting that the threat has existed for years and that Ukraine is prepared for military aggression. But on Thursday, as Russia launched an assault on his country, Zelensky made an emotional address directly to the Ukrainian people, declaring martial law in the country.\n\n“Russia began an attack on Ukraine today. Putin began war against Ukraine, against the entire democratic world. He wants to destroy my country, our country, everything we’ve been building, everything we are living for,” Zelensky said in a video message posted on his official Facebook page.\n\nAcross the country, residents have been preparing for the worst – packing emergency evacuation kits and taking time out of their weekends to train as reservists.\n\nUkraine’s government insists that Moscow cannot prevent Kyiv from building closer ties with NATO, or otherwise interfere in its domestic or foreign politics. “Russia cannot stop Ukraine from getting closer with NATO and has no right to have any say in relevant discussions,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement to CNN.\n\nZelensky has since requested Ukraine be admitted “urgently” to the European Union, and has implored Western leaders to help boost Ukrainian forces on the ground.\n\nDelegates from Ukraine and Russia held talks on Monday near the border of Belarus, a country which has assisted Putin’s invasion, and which Ukrainian officials fear could soon put its own boots on the ground in support of Russia.\n\nUkraine demanded a full Russian withdrawal in advance of those talks, but it is unclear whether the meetings will result in a Russian retreat. Zelensky downplayed the significance of the talks, which he did not attend in person. “I do not really believe in the result of this meeting, but let them try, so that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance,” he said Sunday,\n\nPeople in Quezon City, Philippines, light candles in the shape of a peace sign February 28 as they protest Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Ukraine views the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline – connecting Russian gas supplies directly to Germany – as a threat to its own security.\n\nNord Stream 2 is one of two pipelines that Russia has laid underwater in the Baltic Sea – in addition to its traditional land-based pipeline network that runs through eastern Europe, including Ukraine. Kyiv views the pipelines across Ukraine as an element of protection against invasion by Russia, since any military action could potentially disrupt the vital flow of gas to Europe.\n\nAfter requests from Zelensky and the US administration, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Tuesday that he would halt the certification of the pipeline following Putin’s decision to order troops into parts of eastern Ukraine.\n\nNord Stream 2 was just one of myriad challenges facing Zelensky’s government; the former actor, who played a president on Ukrainian television, had experienced a brutal baptism of fire into real-world politics since assuming office in 2019, thanks in part to the pandemic and ongoing tensions with Russia.\n\nBut in the days since the invasion, admiration for him has soared both inside and outside Ukraine; Zelensky refused to leave the country and has instead posted frequent videos from the streets of Kyiv, where he has been encouraging his fellow countrymen to resist Russian forces.", "authors": ["Eliza Mackintosh"], "publish_date": "2022/02/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/06/24/dc-statehood-redneck-rave-pathway-police-news-around-states/117199848/", "title": "DC statehood, Redneck Rave: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuscaloosa: The University of Alabama has modified some of the COVID-19 restrictions for summer commencement ceremonies scheduled for July 31 at Coleman Coliseum. According to a news release, masks will not be required for people in attendance who are fully vaccinated. For those who have not been fully vaccinated, face coverings will be required. Another change is that there will be no limit on the number of guests each graduate can invite, and no tickets will be required for entry. UA also recommends that groups of guests maintain social distancing of 3 feet. Hand sanitizing stations will be provided throughout the coliseum, and the building will be cleaned and sanitized between the 8:30 a.m. and noon ceremonies. More than 1,000 students are expected to receive their diplomas during the two July 31 ceremonies.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: State health officials say 361 cases of syphilis were reported in 2020, a 49% increase over the previous year. The numbers didn’t surprise Susan A. Jones, an Anchorage-based public health nurse consultant and the HIV/STD program manager with the state health department, who was involved with a report on the continuing syphilis outbreak. “In some ways, I’m surprised there aren’t more cases,” she told the Juneau Empire. Last year’s count included eight cases of congenital syphilis, which occurs when an infected mother passes the infection on to a newborn. Untreated syphilis can cause fetal death, and about 40% of untreated babies with the infection die, she said. Alaska’s syphilis outbreak was first declared in early 2018, and case counts have increased annually since. Jones said she’s worried about Alaska’s numbers in the future. “The pandemic drained much of our public health resources. I wouldn’t be surprised if our numbers surpassed this in 2021,” she said. The rise in cases indicates people are not seeking medical services, a situation exacerbated by pandemic-related concerns, Jones said. As the pandemic wanes, more people will seek services and get diagnosed, she said. Without treatment with antibiotics, syphilis can spread to the brain, nervous system or eyes, health officials said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Unprecedented shortages are delaying air conditioning repairs across Maricopa County during a record-breaking heat wave, forcing residents to pay for hotels, crash with friends and family, or risk their health by staying in indoor temperatures above 90 degrees. Long wait times for HVAC repairs can be dangerous as Arizona’s summers become hotter, and heat-related illnesses and deaths increase. At least 494 people across the state died of heat-related causes last year. A current parts shortage is driven by factories shutting down during the pandemic and by prices for materials rising due to tariffs and changes to product lines, said Mike Donley, president of Phoenix-based Donley A/C & Plumbing. Unfilled jobs have also affected local companies, he said. Other factors causing lags include an uptick in homeowners seeking renovations during the pandemic and extreme weather such as Texas’ February ice storms disrupting supply chains, according to Associated General Contractors of America. The Arizona Registrar of Contractors, which licenses HVAC companies, recently urged patience when dealing with delays. “From new home builds and pools to installing air conditioning units, both residential and commercial contractors alike have been struggling to get materials and find enough workers,” agency officials said.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state on Tuesday reported 485 new coronavirus cases – its biggest one-day jump in more than three months. The Department of Health said it was the biggest daily tally since 570 new cases March 5. Arkansas has recorded 346,180 total cases since the pandemic began last year. The state’s active cases, meaning ones that don’t include people who have died or recovered, rose by 251 to 2,570. Total COVID-19 deaths rose by eight to 5,884. Hospitalizations rose by four to 285. Arkansas in late March opened COVID-19 vaccines to everyone at least 16 years old and lifted its statewide mask mandate, and those as young as 12 are now eligible for shots, but the state has maintained one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country. Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson cited the latest case increase as he urged more people to get vaccinated to stop the spread of the virus. About 41% of the state’s population has received at least one dose of a vaccine, and about 33% have completed their vaccinations, according to the Centers for Disease Control. “Until we increase the number of shots, we will continue to have increased numbers of hospitalizations and new cases like we did today,” Hutchinson tweeted. “It is sad to see someone go to the hospital or die when it can be prevented.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Construction has started on an $898.6 million station that will directly connect Los Angeles International Airport to the region’s light rail and bus transportation systems, solving a decades-old problem. The Airport Metro Connector will connect with an automated people mover train being built to carry people to and from the airport’s terminals. A ceremony was held Monday to mark the start of construction. “This groundbreaking is a pivotal milestone in our effort to give residents and visitors alike real alternatives to sitting in traffic,” said Los Angeles City Councilman Mike Bonin, who is also on the board of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The station will have platforms to access Metro light rail trains, a bus plaza, a drop-off zone for travelers, a bicycle hub and commercial space. The airport is in the midst of a massive multibillion-dollar makeover.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A program that allows doctors, dentists, pharmacists and others to check a database before issuing prescriptions for certain drugs hasn’t stopped so-called doctor shopping for opioids and sedatives and requires legislation to compel prescribers to register with the database and to use it, according to the Office of the State Auditor. After examining Colorado’s Prescription Drug Monitoring Program within the Department of Regulatory Agencies, the office presented an audit to the Legislative Audit Committee on Monday. Created in 2008, the monitoring program is designed to collect data on certain prescriptions by pharmacies to stop patients from obtaining large amounts of opioids and dangerous combinations of drugs. Colorado Politics reports that overdose deaths from prescription opioids have risen from 246 in 2008 to 433 in 2019. A 2014 law requires pharmacists to submit information on dispensed controlled substances to the database. But the audit found there are no penalties for failing to do so. It recommended requiring prescribers to check the database before issuing opioid or benzodiazepine prescriptions; adding penalties to compel registration and use; enforcing limits on opioid prescriptions; and adding referrals to law enforcement or health care regulatory boards for those who don’t comply.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont on Tuesday signed a bill making Connecticut the 19th state to legalize recreational use of marijuana, which remains an illegal drug under federal law. People 21 and older will be allowed to possess and consume marijuana beginning July 1 under the new law, which also lays the groundwork for a new cannabis industry in the state and attempts to address racial inequities stemming from the nation’s war on drugs. “We had a chance to learn from others, and I think we’ve got it right here in the state of Connecticut,” said Lamont, a Democrat, referring to the multiyear effort to finally pass a legalization bill. “Maybe we weren’t the first, but we were the first, I think, to show that we can get it right.” The legislation received final approval from both chambers of the General Assembly last week during a special legislative session. “I think it will be the most comprehensive and best cannabis legalization bill in the country,” said House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford. The law allows those age 21 and up to possess or consume up to 1.5 ounces of “cannabis plant material” and up to 5 ounces in a locked container in a home or in the trunk or locked glove box in the person’s vehicle. Retail sales of recreational cannabis in Connecticut are not expected to begin until summer 2022, at the earliest.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Legislation from Delaware Democrats could allow the Delmar Police Department to unionize, a feat previously unattainable due to a “fluke of geography.” A union could help Delmar police negotiate a raise and attract officers to the department’s vacant positions. Teamsters Local 326, the union hoping to organize, is proposing to require two officers per shift. Many believe the April death of Police Cpl. Keith Heacook could have been prevented by the presence of another officer. Delmar, “the little town too big for one state,” has two separate municipal governments. The Delmar, Delaware, mayor and town council and the Delmar, Maryland, mayor and commissioners work together to govern the town. The Maryland side amended its charter to allow police to organize and collectively bargain in 2009. Delmar police officers last attempted to unionize in 2017, when they took their request to the quasi-judicial Delaware Public Employment Relations Board. The town of Delmar, Delaware, opposed their petition. According to a February 2020 special notice, the Delaware council opposed the petition in part was because it isn’t the exclusive employer of the officers, as required by state law. The Public Employment Relations Board agreed. A bill passed by the Senate on Tuesday would add clarifying language to the act.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Proponents of statehood for the district vowed Tuesday to keep pushing even though the prospects were dim as the bill began working its way through the Senate. “Our democracy is truly in the hands of this Senate,” Mayor Muriel Bowser told the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. “We will not quit until we achieve full democracy. … We will keep pushing until D.C.’s tragic disenfranchisement is rectified.” In Tuesday’s hearings on a bill that would make Washington, D.C., the 51st state, Democrats framed it as a long-standing injustice finally being made right. The nation’s capital has a larger population than Wyoming or Vermont, and its estimated 712,000 residents pay federal taxes, vote for president and serve in the armed forces, but they have no voting representation in Congress. Republicans, however, dismissed the bill as a cynical Democratic power play because the district votes solidly Democratic. They claim statehood was never the intention of the Founding Fathers and insist Congress doesn’t even have the power to change D.C.’s status. The bill proposes creating a 51st state, while a tiny sliver of land would remain as a federal district. Instead of the District of Columbia, the state would be known as Washington, Douglass Commonwealth – named after famed abolitionist Frederick Douglass, who lived in Washington from 1877 until his death in 1895. The bill comes as D.C. statehood is receiving unprecedented levels of popular and political support. It received a formal endorsement from the White House, which called Washington’s current status “an affront to the democratic values on which our Nation was founded.”\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Civics education will be expanded, including instruction about communist and totalitarian governments, and state universities will be prevented from quashing conservative ideology under bills Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed Tuesday. At a Lee County middle school, DeSantis signed three bills, two of which dealt with civics education, the other guaranteeing the freedom of expression at state universities. DeSantis said students need to be taught that communist and totalitarian governments are evil. “Why would somebody flee across shark-infested waters, say leaving from Cuba, to come to southern Florida?” DeSantis said. “It’s important that students understand that.” The law will require development of a K-12 civics curriculum that, among other things, would include “portraits in patriotism” that tell the personal stories of civic-mindedness, including “first-person accounts of victims of other nations’ governing philosophies who can compare those philosophies with those of the United States.” State university students will be required to pass a civic literacy assessment exam and take a course on civic literacy in order to graduate. The third bill protects free speech at state universities by saying the schools can’t shield students from accessing or observing ideas and opinions “they may find uncomfortable, unwelcome, disagreeable, or offensive.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Gov. Brian Kemp says he will end the state’s public health state of emergency July 1, more than 15 months after he initially declared it because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Republican governor made the announcement Tuesday, signing a fresh, final extension of the extraordinary powers granted to him by lawmakers. “Thanks to those efforts, more Georgians are getting vaccinated, our economic momentum is strong, and people are getting back to normal,” Kemp said in a statement. “We have emerged resilient, and I thank all Georgians for doing their part.” The move comes even as public health officials warn of the spread of the more infectious delta variant of the coronavirus. The governor says he will hold on to some extraordinary powers, saying he will issue a different kind of emergency order suspending state rules and regulations to help state agencies and businesses fully recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. This was the first use of Georgia’s public health emergency law. It grants Kemp sweeping powers to suspend laws and state regulations. He can use it to commandeer private property, take over hospitals, shut down schools, offer temporary housing and welfare payments, and take money directly from the state treasury without legislative authorization.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Uncertainty remains about when the state will drop its requirement for vaccinated travelers to have negative coronavirus test results so they can avoid quarantine after arriving in Hawaii. Lt. Gov. Josh Green wants the testing requirement for fully vaccinated travelers to end ahead of the July 4 holiday, but Gov. David Ige is reluctant and would not commit to dropping the travel tests Monday, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The Democratic governor said earlier this month that testing requirements for vaccinated domestic travelers would end once 60% of Hawaii residents are fully vaccinated. That figure has been slow to climb in recent weeks and currently stands at 57%. “We do anticipate crossing that 60% threshold,” Ige said. “It is hard to predict exactly when that would happen because of the fact that the pace of vaccinations is actually slowing, and the number of vaccines administered in the last week is significantly lower than the number of vaccines administered, for example, two weeks ago.” But Green, who is also a Democrat, said there could be confusion and conflict if the state doesn’t drop the requirements soon. “It’s just really important that Hawaii not get a black eye by being unclear,” Green said.\n\nIdaho\n\nIdaho Falls: The U.S. Department of Energy has awarded a new $6.4 billion contract to clean up nuclear waste at its sprawling site west of the city, which includes a national laboratory that does nuclear research. The Energy Department announced Friday that the 10-year Idaho Cleanup Project contract went to the Tullahoma, Tennessee-based Idaho Environmental Coalition, replacing Fluor Idaho. A 1995 settlement agreement between the Energy Department and the state requires nuclear waste to be cleaned up at the site that sits above a giant aquifer supplying water to farms and cities in the region. The department said it received five proposals, and the best value was from the Idaho Environmental Coalition, which includes Jacobs Technology Inc. and North Wind Portage. The 890-square-mile site includes the Idaho National Laboratory, which sits atop the Lake Erie-sized Snake River Plain Aquifer, which started becoming contaminated from the nuclear site in 1952, according to a U.S. Geological Survey report released last year. The report said contamination levels at all but a handful of nearly 180 wells are below acceptable standards for drinking water set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The report cited cleanup efforts at the site as helping to improve the aquifer.\n\nIllinois\n\nUrbana: The University of Illinois is requiring students attending classes in person this fall to be vaccinated against COVID-19 before stepping onto its three campuses, officials said Monday. In a mass email, University President Tim Killeen said the requirement for its campuses in Urbana-Champaign, Springfield and Chicago is consistent with the school’s own modeling of the risks associated with the spread of the coronavirus and its variants. “Throughout the COVID-19 crisis, students have helped make the University of Illinois System a model for the nation – a model of community, a model of safety and a model of pulling together for the common good,” Killeen said. “We look forward to their help in setting the standard again this fall, a semester that will restore most in-person instruction and many of the other traditional rhythms of campus life that COVID interrupted last year. Widespread vaccinations will help us do that.” Students who can’t be vaccinated because of their health or other reasons must follow each campus’ COVID-19 protocols, according to officials. Killeen said vaccination guidelines for faculty and staff are still being developed. The University of Chicago, DePaul and Northwestern are also requiring students to be vaccinated before they return to class. Illinois State University said it won’t require the shots.\n\nIndiana\n\nFranklin: The American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana filed a lawsuit against Mayor Steve Barnett on Tuesday claiming he violated a man’s First Amendment rights by blocking the man from his Facebook page. The suit, filed on behalf of former Indiana resident William Reynolds, claims Barnett was unjustified when he blocked Reynolds from viewing or commenting on his Facebook page after Reynolds repeatedly tagged Barnett in a video of the mayor participating in a Black Lives Matter protest in May 2020. The video features messages of inclusion and shows Barnett holding a colorful Black Lives Matter sign and leading a small crowd in a chant of “Black Lives Matter.” Reynolds tagged Barnett in the post in the Franklin Equity and Justice Coalition Facebook group, and Barnett “promptly” untagged himself, according to the lawsuit. When Reynolds again tagged Barnett on the same post, the mayor blocked Reynolds, preventing him from viewing or interacting with his page. “Mayor Barnett’s action in blocking Mr. Reynolds from viewing (Barnett’s) Facebook page was taken solely as a result of Mr. Reynolds’ decision to share true information concerning Mayor Barnett’s support for the Black Lives Matter movement and for the cause of racial justice,” the lawsuit says.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A judge has permanently blocked a state law requiring women to wait 24 hours before getting an abortion. In his order, filed Monday afternoon, District Court Judge Mitchell Turner held that the 2020 law is unconstitutional and cannot be enforced on two grounds: that the Legislature violated the “single-subject rule” of the Iowa Constitution when lawmakers passed the measure as an amendment to an unrelated bill and that the law violates a 2018 Iowa Supreme Court decision that protects abortion rights. The law was opposed in court by Planned Parenthood of the Heartland and the American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa. Turner had previously issued a temporary injunction blocking the law just before it was to take effect July 1, 2020. Monday’s order makes that injunction permanent. In his order, Turner also canceled a planned trial in the case, which was set for January. At a press conference Tuesday, Planned Parenthood North Central States Director of Public Affairs Jamie Burch Elliott said the law was “medically unnecessary and harmful” and would have effectively put abortion access out of reach for many people. Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican who signed the law last year, said she will appeal the ruling.\n\nKansas\n\nBelle Plaine: A civil rights group warned Uber Eats that its app profiles place transgender drivers at risk of harassment and violence, prompting the company to apologize Tuesday to a Topeka man and to resolve issues within the app that outed him. The move came after American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas released a letter it had sent to the food delivery service Monday on behalf of Laine Repic, a 41-year-old transgender man who has been driving for the company since April. The ACLU of Kansas contended that Uber Eats has forced Repic to have his app profile display his legal name, which he no longer uses and does not match his male gender presentation – effectively outing him as transgender. The ACLU noted that Repic has experienced harassment and ridicule as a result when he drops off food to customers, making him fearful for his safety. “Having to, like, drive around with that name following you everywhere from customers, it was nerve-wracking, and it was scary, and we shouldn’t have to be put in that position – especially when it was such a simple fix,” Repic said Tuesday in a phone interview. Repic said he reached out to the ACLU because he needed someone who would have his back, and Uber didn’t seem to support him.\n\nKentucky\n\nMammoth Cave: Dozens of people face criminal charges or suffered injuries during a five-day party billed as a “Redneck Rave.” Blue Holler Offroad Park in Edmonson County hosted the event last week that organizers said would feature “mud, music and mayhem,” the Lexington Herald-Leader reports. The crowd was estimated to be in the thousands, with attendees including some from outside Kentucky. Edmonson County Sheriff Shane Doyle told the newspaper 14 people were arrested, and another 34 were cited on criminal charges that ranged from assault and strangulation to drug and alcohol possession. Some who attended reported accidental injuries, including one person who was impaled by a log that pierced the floorboard of his vehicle, and others suffered lacerations, dislocated fingers and broken bones, Doyle said. Organizer Justin Stowers did not immediately respond to the newspaper when asked about the event but said in a Facebook post that it was “the biggest event we’ve ever done and with as many people and random things that popped up unexpectedly I feel like we all handled it very well,” the Herald-Leader reports. In addition to live music, the rave featured a football game and a demolition derby. Another event is scheduled in October.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Gov. John Bel Edwards’ rejection of legislation banning transgender athletes from participating on school sports teams is spurring talk that Republican lawmakers may try to hold Louisiana’s first veto session under its decades-old constitution. Republican House Speaker Clay Schexnayder announced Tuesday night that he wants such a mid-July session, giving the possibility of the historic gathering some momentum. But GOP Senate President Page Cortez hasn’t taken a public position, which could put the chances in doubt. It only takes a majority written vote of lawmakers in either the House or Senate to scrap a veto session in Louisiana. Plus, it’s unclear if lawmakers could hold the bipartisan coalition of votes together that would be needed to overturn the Democratic governor’s spurning of the transgender sports ban bill if the veto session were held. Edwards announced Tuesday that he struck down Franklinton Republican Sen. Beth Mizell’s bill prohibiting transgender athletes from competing on school sports teams of their identified gender, a measure that has been passed in several conservative states. “Discrimination is not a Louisiana value, and this bill was a solution in search of a problem that simply does not exist in Louisiana,” Edwards said in his veto announcement.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Legislators have passed a bill banning the intentional release of many balloons. The measure now awaits the signature of Gov. Janet Mills. Out of concern for balloons’ impact on the environment, the bill would create a fine for anyone who releases a large number of balloons on purpose, the Sun Journal reports. “It’s time to define intentional balloon releases as an act of littering so that people know how they are affecting the marine ecosystem,” Rep. Genevieve McDonald said when she introduced the bill, which was adopted earlier this month. First-time offenders who release between 16 and 24 balloons would be fined between $100 and $500 if Mills signs the proposal into law. Anyone who releases more than 24 balloons would face a fine of at least $500. The bill is not intended to punish the accidental release of a balloon by a child or someone else, the newspaper reports. It also exempts the release of balloons for scientific or meteorological purposes.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The health of the Chesapeake Bay improved to a grade of C in 2020, up from a C-minus in 2019, according to an annual report card by scientists. Individual indicators on the health of the nation’s largest estuary had mixed results in 2020, but the report released Tuesday by the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science found the overall baywide trend continues to improve over time. For the first time, the report card examined new indicators of watershed health including stewardship, protected lands, walkability and heat vulnerability. Scientists have been putting a focus on assessing not just the environment but also the social and economic factors that influence ecosystem health. Seven out of 15 regions showed significantly improving health trends, the report said. Dissolved oxygen and total nitrogen scores improved, while chlorophyll a and total phosphorus scores declined. Water clarity, benthic community – organisms in the bottom of the bay – and aquatic grass scores decreased slightly. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, UMCES said there was a monitoring gap from March to May. The effects of the pandemic on the ecosystem health of the bay are not yet known, besides a reduction in atmospheric nitrogen, which has a declining trend, continued by reduced travel during 2020.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: With no-excuse mail-in voting laws set to expire at the end of the month, state lawmakers need to hurry up and take action to extend those rights through the end of the year, Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin said Tuesday. Up to 21 cities and towns, including Boston, have preliminary municipal elections scheduled for Sept. 14, with another 13 cities scheduled to hold elections Sept. 21. Without an extension, the cities will be unable to let voters cast ballots by mail without having an excuse or to hold in-person early voting for their city elections, Galvin said in a letter to Senate President Karen Spilka and House Speaker Ronald Mariano, both Democrats. Several local elections scheduled for July will also be affected without a new law in place, Galvin said. “For budgetary and planning purposes these cities must have clarity,” Galvin, also a Democrat, wrote to both legislative leaders. “Urgent action is needed.” There’s significant support on Beacon Hill for extending the voting options that were adopted during the pandemic and proved popular with voters. Democratic Sen. Barry Finegold, co-chair of the Joint Committee on Election Laws, said he’s working with fellow lawmakers to make vote-by-mail and other election changes permanent in Massachusetts.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The city could use more trees – about 1.2 million more, according to American Forests. The Washington-based, nonprofit conservation organization on Tuesday published Tree Equity scores for 150,000 neighborhoods in 486 urbanized areas. Each score is based on how much tree canopy and surface temperatures align with the number of people living in a given area or neighborhood, income, employment, race, age and health factors. The scores indicate whether there are enough trees for everyone living in those areas to experience the health, economic and climate benefits that trees provide. Low-income, predominantly minority neighborhoods have fewer trees than wealthier, mostly white areas, according to Chris David, American Forests geographic information system and data science vice president. The premise of tree equity “helps cities identify where to target places that have been historically ignored,” David said. “Where the places are that lack trees historically have underserved people in poverty, people of color.” Trees improve the quality of life in neighborhoods by providing shade that reduces heat-related health issues. They also improve air quality by helping to reduce air pollution and create jobs involved in the care of trees, the nonprofit said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: Kids caught scootering, biking, skateboarding or riding anything else that would require a helmet could be awarded a free Dairy Queen kid’s cone this summer from participating police and sheriff’s departments as part of a statewide initiative funded by AAA. Stearns County Sheriff Steve Soyka said the initiative is designed to promote safety and foster trust with local law enforcement. Each of the county’s patrol officers received five to 10 certificates last month to give out randomly while on patrol, he said. Although he said the county doesn’t see an abnormally large number of severe bicycle accidents each year, he said wearing a helmet is always a good preventative measure. “If you can catch people when they’re doing things right, and you can reinforce that behavior, they’ll continue to carry on that positive behavior,” said Sauk Rapids police chief Perry Beise. “A bike helmet can save people from a lifelong head injury.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Four words on the state’s license plates have sparked a federal lawsuit. American Atheists, the Mississippi Humanist Association and three nonreligious residents filed a lawsuit Tuesday against the state over its “In God We Trust” license plate. The complaint accuses the Mississippi Commissioner of Revenue of violating the people’s freedom of speech and religion by forcing them to display the religious message on their personal vehicles. The license plate has included “In God We Trust” since 2019. The lawsuit claims car owners are forced to promote the religious statement or pay an additional fee for a specialty plate without it. “Every minute they spend on the streets of Mississippi, atheists are forced to act as a billboard for the state’s religious message,” said Geoffrey T. Blackwell, litigation counsel at American Atheists. “Some can avoid being a mouthpiece for the government by paying a penalty.” The lawsuit also claims that there are no alternatives to the plate for trailers, motorcycles, recreational vehicles, drivers with disabilities and custom plates. Gov. Tate Reeves, in a statement on Twitter, said he plans to defend the license plate’s motto. “I know Mississippi’s values are our strength…and I meant it when I said as Governor I would defend our values every single day!” he wrote.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: Jim Bakker and his southwestern Missouri church will pay restitution of $156,000 to settle a lawsuit that accuses the TV pastor of falsely claiming a health supplement could cure COVID-19. Court records show a settlement agreement that was filed Tuesday calls for refunds to people who paid money or gave contributions to obtain a product known as Silver Solution in the early days of the pandemic. The settlement also prohibits Bakker and Morningside Church Productions Inc. from advertising or selling Silver Solution “to diagnose, prevent, mitigate, treat or cure any disease or illness.” Bakker, in the agreement, does not admit wrongdoing. Republican Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt sued Bakker and Morningside in March 2020. Schmitt sought an injunction ordering Bakker to stop selling Silver Solution as a treatment for COVID-19 on his streaming TV program, The Jim Bakker Show. The lawsuit said Bakker and a guest made the cure claim during 11 episodes in February and March of 2020. Schmitt said in a news release Wednesday that Bakker has already made restitution to many consumers and must pay back another $90,000 to others. The consent agreement notes that during “The Jim Bakker Show,” Silver Solution was offered to those who agreed to contribute $80 to $125.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Yellowstone National Park visitors hoping to see its world-renowned geysers, wolves and bears can expect warmer temperatures and less snow as climate change alters the park’s environment, according to a report by U.S. and university researchers released Wednesday. Average temperatures in the Yellowstone region in recent decades were likely the warmest of the past 800,000 years, according to geologic studies. And average annual snowfall has decreased by nearly 2 feet since 1950. The changing climate could affect some of the park’s most iconic sites, including Old Faithful, a geyser famous for erupting at regular intervals. Past droughts have reduced the frequency of water shooting out of the popular geyser, meaning it could erupt less frequently as drought conditions become more common in the park, Bryan Shuman, a geology professor at the University of Wyoming, said during a news conference Wednesday. Temperatures in the region have increased by more than 2 degrees Fahrenheit since 1950 and are expected to increase by an additional 5 to 10 degrees by the end of the century, according to findings by scientists with the U.S. Geological Survey, Montana State University and the University of Wyoming. Communities in the surrounding area, including Bozeman, could see between 40 and 60 more days per year of temperatures above 90 degrees. And the changes are likely to affect tribes that have called the region home for millennia.\n\nNebraska\n\nOffutt Air Force Base: Offutt Air Force Base’s 55th Wing has a new leader – the first woman to command the 80-year-old reconnaissance unit. The Omaha World-Herald reports Col. Kristen Thompson took over command Tuesday, becoming the first woman among the 65 officers who have led the unit since it was established in 1941. She replaces Col. Gavin Marks, who was the first Black leader of the unit. Marks led the 55th Wing through a tumultuous time that included the early stages of recovery from the March 2019 floods and the COVID-19 pandemic. About 300 people, including Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts, attended the ceremony. Thompson, a 2001 graduate of the Air Force Academy, flew 600 combat hours in Iraq and Afghanistan. She was most recently commander of the 380th Expeditionary Operations Group at a base in United Arab Emirates.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The University of Nevada, Las Vegas is launching a new program to help hundreds of student-athletes find out how they could get compensated for the use of their name and likeness. KVVU-TV reports UNLV has established “The Vegas Effect,” which will assist athletes in navigating how to take advantage of name, image and likeness opportunities. The announcement comes after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously Monday that the NCAA can’t limit education-related benefits – like computers and paid internships – that colleges can offer their sports stars. The ruling could help open the door to further easing in the decades-old fight over paying student-athletes. “The Vegas Effect” program includes a platform to connect student-athletes with resources to help them build their personal brand. There are also ways to connect to on-campus resources for help with financial literacy, handling of taxes and career development. School officials say they created the program in anticipation of NCAA-approved legislation permitting college athletes to generate revenue for themselves. The measure will take effect next year.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Funds from the latest federal coronavirus aid package are going to support child care programs and workers, the state Department of Health and Human Services said Wednesday. Over the next 30 to 60 days, the department plans to launch stabilization grants to child care programs, workforce recruitment and retention efforts, and market rate increases for the New Hampshire Child Care Scholarship Program. Starting July 12, the grants will be open to all licensed and enrolled license-exempt child care providers. The scholarship market rate for tuition costs for enrolled families will increase as much as 10% for infants through preschoolers and an average of 40% for school-age children. The state also is increasing recruitment and retention efforts to increase the number of child care workers in centers, homes and after-school programs, including an internship program. “These programs will help ensure that residents who need access to child care in order to return to work will have as many options as possible,” said Christine Santaniello, associate commissioner of the department. “Child care programs have been essential since the first case of COVID-19 in New Hampshire.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nRandolph: A board of education has reversed itself following a public outcry and restored the names of holidays to its school calendar. The Randolph school board on Monday night voted 8-1 to overturn a decision made earlier this month to replace the names of holidays with “day off.” The panel also will create a committee to gain input from the public. Criticism began when the school board voted in May to refer to Columbus Day as Indigenous Peoples Day. Following complaints from Italian Americans, the board then voted to label holidays generically. Critics accused the board of bowing to so-called cancel culture. An online petition called for Superintendent Jennifer Fano and members of the school board to resign. The district issued a statement in which it said the actions were “misconstrued.” “The buck stops here with those of us seated in front of you, and we own it,” school board president Tammy MacKay said. “Neither the superintendent nor any other administrator, principal, teacher or other district employee had anything to do with those votes or decisions. To cast blame on any of them for what this board did is quite simply wrong.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A major business in the state’s burgeoning market for marijuana wants the state to refund millions of dollars in taxes that were levied in recent years on sales of medical marijuana but not against most prescription medications. Integrated cannabis provider Ultra Health said Tuesday that it has asked the state Supreme Court for the opportunity to provide arguments in a legal dispute between another medical marijuana company and the state Taxation and Revenue Department. New Mexico lawmakers and cannabis regulators made clear this year that a limited personal supply of medical cannabis will be available tax-free starting June 29. The provision is part of legislation signed in April by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham to legalize recreational marijuana sales by April 2022 and waive taxes on medical marijuana this year. “We are very glad the New Mexico Legislature had taken the initiative to include that clause for the deduction,” said Marissa Novel, chief marketing officer at Ultra Health. “What’s still up for debate is years worth of (past) medical cannabis activity.” In its Supreme Court filing, Ultra Health said it paid nearly $2.7 million in gross receipts taxes in 2020 alone on $39.5 million in sales.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: In-home COVID-19 shots are now available for all city residents, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Wednesday. “Anyone who’s sitting out there and thinking, ‘Wow, I’m ready, but I’d rather the vaccine be done right here in my home,’ go to nyc.gov/homevaccine, fill out the request, and we’ll send the vaccinators to your door,” the mayor said during an online briefing. City officials had already been offering the service to homebound residents and are expanding it as they try to entice more people to get COVID-19 vaccinations. “We are going to keep innovating new ways to get people the vaccine,” de Blasio said. The mayor said 9 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered in New York City so far.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Legislation that would raise the minimum age to get married from 14 to 16 cleared a state House committee Tuesday. The measure, which was approved unanimously by the Senate last month, also would prevent the young person’s spouse from being more than four years older. And 16- and 17-year-olds would need either written parental consent or a judge’s order to marry. Current law requires parental consent for 16- and 17-year-olds, and 14- and 15-year-olds can only marry if a pregnancy is involved and if a judge authorizes the marriage. There is no age-gap limit between the couple. Backers of the measure say North Carolina has become a destination for out-of-state couples involving an underage partner because of its rules, and that in turn can encourage child trafficking. They say the age-gap limit also would bring restrictions more in line with North Carolina’s statutory rape law. An estimated 8,800 minors were listed on North Carolina marriage license applications from 2000 to 2015, according to an analysis by the International Center for Research on Women. Bill supporters say too many of these young women end up living amid poverty and abuse.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A frequent political candidate is leading an effort to recall Republican Gov. Doug Burgum and Lt. Gov. Brent Sanford. Michael Coachman, who last year received just 10% of the vote in the GOP primary for governor, is alleging “contempt of the voters” and negligence by Burgum. Secretary of State Al Jaeger on Wednesday announced he approved for circulation a petition for the recall effort. Burgum’s spokesman, Mike Nowatzki, said the governor’s second-term victory last year “speaks for itself.” To hold a recall election, supporters of the idea need to collect more than 89,000 signatures, roughly 25% of those who voted in the last general election. Coachman is a retired U.S. Air Force veteran who lives in Larimore. He was previously an unsuccessful candidate for secretary of state in 2018 and for lieutenant governor in 2012 and 2016.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Gov. Mike DeWine made good on his promise Wednesday to professionalize policing in the state by introducing a college-to-law enforcement pathway program. The pilot program under the new state Office of Law Enforcement Recruitment is an effort by the Republican governor to both recruit more law enforcement officers as departures engulf agencies across the state and make sure the candidates who do apply are qualified. “This is not an easy time to be in law enforcement,” DeWine said at a briefing, surrounded by police chiefs, deputies and rank-and-file officers from across Ohio. “Failure to keep the ranks of law enforcement full has the potential to create a public safety crisis.” The objective of the new program, DeWine said, is to connect criminal justice programs from colleges and universities in Ohio to law enforcement agencies in the state, effectively creating a pipeline for college students to become officers. The announcement of the program comes as the reckoning over racial injustice that began after George Floyd’s killing last summer has shifted the public perception of police and their roles in the community. The result of that is low morale among rank-and-file officers, leading to more officers retiring and fewer people coming forward to serve, DeWine said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: Those responsible for a ransomware attack on the city last month are sharing some residents’ personal information online, city officials said. More than 18,000 city files, mostly police citations and internal police department files, have been posted on the dark web, the city said in a statement late Tuesday. Police citations include some personally identifiable information such as name, date of birth, address and driver’s license number but do not include Social Security numbers, officials said. Still, city officials are warning anyone who has filed a police report, received a police citation or shared personally identifiable information with the city to monitor their financial accounts and credit reports. They are also warning those people to alert credit and debit card companies and to change passwords to personal accounts. Last month, the city said no personal data had been accessed by the breach. Malware was initially detected May 6, the city said. Mayor G.T. Bynum said the hackers told the city to pay a ransom, but Tulsa didn’t pay. The city shut down much of its network to stop the malware from spreading. The primary effect of the shutdown was that most residents were prevented from paying their water bills because the city could not process credit or debit cards with computers inoperable.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Officials confirmed Tuesday that another COVID-19 outbreak at Multnomah County’s Inverness Jail has infected 25 people in custody in the past month. Those in custody at the Northeast Portland jail were not taken to their court appearances Monday because of the outbreak, according to written notices posted at the Mark O. Hatfield U.S. Courthouse. Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Chris Liedle told The Oregonian/OregonLive the outbreak started May 23 when a person lodged at Inverness who had been showing COVID-19 symptoms tested positive for the coronavirus. Liedle said almost all those who have since tested positive have had mild or no symptoms. One inmate was hospitalized, Liedle said, but is now back in jail. Liedle did not immediately specify the source of the outbreak. He said inmates are regularly offered COVID-19 vaccines, and the county has reduced its jail population by one-third and increased virus testing. The jail has had other COVID-19 outbreaks since the start of the pandemic. In April, 15 inmates who contracted COVID-19 while at Inverness sued the county and Sheriff Mike Reese, alleging the county failed to take proper safety precautions, denied inmates coronavirus testing, and mixed infected inmates and guards with those who were healthy.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A Republican rewrite of state election law that would mandate voter IDs, alter registration and ballot-counting deadlines, and give conservatives auditing procedures for which they have clamored passed the state House on Tuesday despite the Democratic governor’s veto threat. The lengthy and complex bill, crafted after 10 committee hearings on the subject earlier this year, was sent to the state Senate on a vote of 110-91. Rep. Margo Davidson, D-Delaware, dismissed its proposed security provisions by raising the specter of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol by those who supported former President Donald Trump’s baseless efforts to reverse his reelection defeat. “What a farce,” Davidson said. “We are advancing election security measures, so we say, by ignoring the facts and embracing actual fantasies.” Voters must have confidence that the system is fair, said Rep. Greg Rothman, R-Cumberland. “We know that democracy dies in darkness,” Rothman said. “Democracy will die without trust in the process.” The bill would establish a new county-issued voter ID that Rep. Tim Bonner, R-Mercer, said was not a burden or a way to suppress votes. But Democratic Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta of Philadelphia described the bill as “voter suppression in bad drag.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: To the relief of many, the state reopened public restrooms Wednesday at the Kennedy Plaza transit hub in Providence, which had been closed since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. The Rhode Island Public Transit Authority also recently reopened to the general public bathroom facilities at the Newport Transportation and Visitors Center and the Pawtucket Transit Center. “Reopening public restrooms at three busy transit facilities in our state is a necessary step to address public need as we re-emerge from the pandemic,” Gov. Daniel McKee said in a statement. The agency has kept the Kennedy Plaza bathrooms closed to the general public, citing the need to enforce a federal mask mandate and to provide bus drivers with their own facilities where they didn’t have to wait in line and in turn could keep buses running on schedule. RIPTA chief Scott Avedisian said the issue has been resolved. The city agreed on a plan that will accommodate the public need for the facilities while also making provisions for drivers by retrofitting restrooms at the nearby public skating rink for them. “We are happy to be moving forward on this issue,” Avedisian said, “and we appreciate the steps the city is taking.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state’s nearly $11 billion budget was sent to the governor’s desk Monday as lawmakers cut close the deadline to get the spending plan in place before it begins July 1. There is something for almost everyone in the budget, including raises for most state employees, teachers and law enforcement officers. It also includes money to expand the port in Charleston, repair college buildings, and place a police officer and nurse in every public school in the state. Lawmakers also have earmarked funds for dozens of local projects such as downtown renovations, lighthouse repairs and art programs. What passed Monday doesn’t include the $2.5 billion that lawmakers will control of the nearly $9 billion South Carolina is getting from federal COVID-19 relief. How to spend that money will be debated later this year. Gov. Henry McMaster has until the end of Saturday to decide if he wants to veto any individual items in the spending plan. The General Assembly plans to return June 29 to decide whether to override any potential vetoes.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The state’s oldest residents are seeing major gains from strong vaccination rates. The state has reported just three new coronavirus cases among people 80 and older this month. As of Tuesday, there was just one active infection in that age group, which has been the hardest-hit by COVID-19, with 1 in 5 of those who tested positive for the virus dying. Among those 70-79, the state has been seeing a new case every other day. The case fatality rate for that age group declines sharply, with just 6% having died. As of Tuesday, there were just eight active infections in that age group. Meanwhile, there hasn’t been a fatality reported among the state’s long-term care residents since May 28. The vaccination rate among older South Dakotans has been high: As of Monday, 91% of those 65 or older have received at least one dose, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, while 85% are fully vaccinated. According to Tuesday’s report from the South Dakota Department of Health, the seven-day average for new cases was 10. It hadn’t been that low since March 29, 2020, two weeks into the pandemic. But overall, the number of people seeking a COVID-19 vaccine continues to fall, with the state averaging just 465 newly vaccinated residents over the past seven days.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A panel of federal appellate judges on Tuesday reinstated a state law requiring first-time voters to appear in person to vote, reasoning in part that the COVID-19 pandemic is “unlikely to pose a serious threat during the next election cycle.” In a 2-1 decision, a 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel overturned a lower court’s ruling in September that blocked the restriction on absentee voting ahead of the 2020 general election. In October, a panel from the 6th Circuit decided to keep the preliminary injunction, with Judge Julia Smith Gibbons ruling that the court shouldn’t disrupt the new rules at that late stage in the election. In reinstating the requirement, the same judge wrote Tuesday that there is not a “reasonable expectation” that voters will again face the same kind of burdens they did during the fall 2020 election. “Fortunately, because of advancements in COVID-19 vaccinations and treatment since this case began, the COVID-19 pandemic is unlikely to pose a serious threat during the next election cycle,” the ruling said. The judge also said the legal standing to bring the case, through a member of the Tennessee NAACP, disappeared once the state Supreme Court separately rolled back another judge’s widespread expansion of a vote-by-mail option last year.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Republican Gov. Greg Abbott on Tuesday ordered lawmakers back to work in July, raising expectations of another attempt to pass new voting restrictions after Democrats blocked the GOP’s first try with a dramatic late-night walkout in May. However, Abbott did not reveal why he was ordering a special legislative session starting July 8, saying only in a two-sentence announcement that an agenda would come later. As governor, only Abbott can determine what issues lawmakers take up during a special session. But Abbott has previously made clear that he would bring lawmakers back to pass new election laws after Democrats in the Texas House of Representatives left the chamber one by one less than two hours before a midnight deadline over Memorial Day weekend, denying the GOP majority the quorum needed to pass what was one of the nation’s most restrictive voting measures. Democrats have vowed to continue fighting GOP efforts to reduce polling hours and voting access in Texas after staging the last-ditch revolt to stop the sweeping elections overhaul from reaching Abbott’s desk. None has called for a boycott of the special session, and the Republicans’ commanding majority means it’s likely that an elections bill will ultimately pass.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Zion National Park is warning tourists about the dangers of heat and toxic bacteria. With the ongoing drought and summer temperatures spiking to record highs, the park is asking visitors to be diligent about heat-related illnesses as search and rescue operations spike. During a Tuesday press event, Zion’s Chief Ranger Daniel Fagergren said there has been a noticeable uptick in 911 calls since Memorial Day weekend. “That’s the secret: being prepared, knowing your limitations and watching the weather,” he said. Fagregren said there were six heat-related injuries within a two-hour period on one recent weekend. Temperatures at Zion reached as high as 112 during last week’s heat waves. Fagergren said the Zion canyon is like a “parabola,” reflecting heat back into the canyon and increasing the temperature compared to nearby towns. In addition, toxic cyanobacteria are still present in Zion’s Virgin River, so officials are asking visitors to avoid the water – no matter how tempting it may be – and to keep an eye out for algal blooms. “It certainly complicates things, especially this time of year, as people gravitate toward the water,” Fagergren said.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state House on Wednesday voted to override Republican Gov. Phil Scott’s veto of separate bills that would change the municipal charters of the cities of Montpelier and Winooski to allow noncitizens to vote in local elections. The votes were 103 to 47 on both measures. “We have a rich history of Vermonters coming together in their cities, towns, and villages to work together and chart a path forward that works best for their communities,” House Speaker Jill Krowinski said in a statement. “These charters expand local voting rights to residents of these respective communities, and these decisions were made by the voters after robust discussion and deliberation.” The Democrat-controlled Senate is expected to take up the measure Thursday. Last November, voters in Winooski – considered one of the most diverse cities in northern New England – authorized noncitizens to vote in local elections if they were in the U.S. legally. In 2019, Montpelier passed a similar measure, but it did not pass the Legislature in 2020. In his veto message, Scott said noncitizen voting was an important issue that deserves further consideration but said a town-by-town approach to municipal voting creates inconsistency in election policy.\n\nVirginia\n\nLeesburg: One person was arrested and a second cited for trespassing after Loudoun County’s school board shut down public comment on proposed rules for the treatment of transgender students. Hundreds of people showed up at Tuesday’s meeting in Leesburg to voice their opinions, but the school board voted unanimously to close public comment after just a few speakers, citing unruly behavior from the audience. “Even after numerous attempts to ask for decorum, so everyone could speak, those attending insisted on continued interruptions in an attempt to delay and disrupt the proceeding,” school board Chair Brenda Sheridan said in a statement early Wednesday. “These politically motivated antics ought to end.” Critics of the school board accused its members of ignoring public sentiment. The proposed regulations would require that transgender students be addressed by their preferred name and pronoun and allow students to use the restroom associated with their preferred gender. School systems across Virginia are adopting similar regulations. But Loudoun has become a flashpoint in the debate. Conservative groups rallied to support an elementary school gym teacher who was suspended after he spoke at a school board meeting in opposition to the new rules. A judge has ordered his reinstatement, but the school board is appealing the ruling.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Five Black officers with the University of Washington Police Department have filed claims of racism against the department and are seeking $8 million in damages, alleging they were routinely insulted and demeaned by co-workers and supervisors. Some officers said they were disciplined and denied promotions because of their race, KOMO-TV reports. Officer Damien Taylor said a white supervisor referred to him as “ ‘(his) own negro’ on a call and later laughed at me when I confronted him about it.” Officer Karinn Young said that “a banana was put in front of my locker with a note reading, ‘Here’s your lunch, you ******* monkey.’ ” The officers said University of Washington Police Chief John Vinson, who is also Black, was repeatedly criticized by white officers for hiring too many Black people. “White officers called Chief Vinson the n-word on several occasions,” said Officer Russell Ellis said in the claim. Vinson was later reassigned to an administrative position at the university, KOMO-TV reports. University spokesperson Victor Balta said that the college is stunned by the allegations and that the institution has no record of complaints being filed about the issues.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nGlen Jean: The permanent home of the National Scout Jamboree will hold a four-day outdoor festival for the public in September. The Adventure On! Freedom Festival will take place Sept. 10-13 at the 14,000-acre Summit Bechtel Reserve in southern West Virginia, WVVA-TV reports. Among the events will be a free concert featuring the band Lonestar on Sept. 11 for first responders, active-duty or retired military, and law enforcement officers on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The event also will feature motor bike and electric bike racing, swimming, hiking, fishing, skateboarding, target shooting, camping and ziplines. Local vendors also will be allowed to sell their wares. Tickets can be purchased in advance.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Police would be prohibited from enforcing any future federal federal laws banning or restricting the use of guns under a bill the state Senate sent to Gov. Tony Evers on Wednesday. The proposal is part of a national wave of Republican-authored legislation intended to resist a push from President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats to tighten gun control laws. The U.S. Constitution dictates that federal law trumps conflicting state law, however, and many previous GOP proposals to thwart gun control laws have been found unconstitutional. Evers, a Democrat, almost certainly will veto the Wisconsin bill. Republicans are pushing forward anyway, knowing the attempt will please their base constituents. The Senate passed the bill on a voice vote Wednesday with no debate, sending the proposal to Evers. The Assembly approved the bill earlier this month.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The late world champion rodeo cowboy and country music singer Chris LeDoux has returned to Cheyenne Frontier Days in the form of a huge statue. The bronze featuring LeDoux on a bucking horse arrived Tuesday and was installed on a pedestal at the park where the annual rodeo and Western culture celebration takes place during the last two weeks of July, according to Frontier Days officials. The 125th anniversary Frontier Days will be dedicated to LeDoux. The statue will be dedicated in a ceremony July 23. LeDoux grew up in Cheyenne and performed both in the rodeo and onstage at Frontier Days. He won the 1976 National Finals Rodeo in Oklahoma City. He recorded 36 albums that sold more than 6 million copies. LeDoux died of cancer in 2005 at age 56. The coronavirus pandemic canceled last year’s Frontier Days for the first time in the event’s history.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/08/17/infected-minks-airport-layoffs-crawfish-farmers-news-around-states/113304530/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nOpelika: High schools are severely limiting attendance at football games this fall because of the coronavirus pandemic, and at least one canceled sports after deciding it wasn’t worth the risk to play. Opelika High School said it will cap attendance at about 30% of the stadium’s capacity of 8,000 so fans can maintain proper social distancing, and Gulf Shores said attendance at athletic events will be cut by 50%. Other schools are also announcing attendance reductions or still working on plans. The first football games are scheduled for this week, although some schools have delayed contests after players or staff tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19. The moves follow an announcement by state health officials on Thursday that fans can attend games despite the pandemic. The agency asked schools to limit crowds and require anyone in attendance to wear face masks and keep away from other people to avoid spreading the virus. In Dallas County, Ellwood Christian Academy decided to cancel its football, volleyball and soccer seasons rather than take a risk during the pandemic.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The food service provider for the Anchorage and Fairbanks airports will lay off more than 140 employees because of the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the organization said in a letter to state officials. The layoffs will consist of 123 workers from Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport and 19 at Fairbanks International Airport, the food service provider, HMSHost, said in letters to state employment officials. The layoffs at the Anchorage airport will affect businesses such as Starbucks, Cinnabon, Humpy’s Great Alaskan Alehouse, Norton Sound Seafood House, Alaska Doghaus, Cream, Mezzanine Bar, Anchorage Marketplace and Local Alaskan Rustic Marketplace, the Anchorage Daily News reported. “The COVID-19 pandemic has devastated the travel and restaurant industries, and unfortunately, HMSHost sits at the intersection of both,” the letter said. “Never in the history of aviation and the hospitality industry have we experienced such catastrophic customer traffic declines.” The Fairbanks layoffs will affect businesses such as The Local and Starbucks, HMSHost said. The workers were originally furloughed in March. The layoffs are expected to be permanent on Oct. 15, HMSHost said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:The Arizona Department of Health Services has approved a reopening plan for more than 20 gyms in the Phoenix area operated by EoS Fitness. The gyms will be some of the first to open their doors after the state announced a number of health benchmarks to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and guide the reopening of certain businesses. When the benchmarks were announced on Aug. 10, the spread of COVID-19 in Maricopa County was “substantial” by state guidelines and had not slowed to a safe threshold for opening gyms. Still, the state said it would consider plans for reopening that followed stricter safety policies than will be required when the benchmarks are met. The approved plan for EoS Fitness centers includes limiting occupancy to about 100 members, or 10% capacity. Saunas, steam rooms, hot tubs and basketball courts – places where people are likely to come in close contact – will stay closed, according to the company’s website. The gyms will have water refill stations as opposed to drinking fountains, and will space exercise equipment at least 6 feet apart. EoS Fitness said it would not hold group fitness classes until the spread of COVID-19 is downgraded to “moderate” in Maricopa County, per the health department benchmarks.\n\nArkansas\n\nPine Bluff:As of Thursday, Arkansas is sixth in the nation for COVID-19-related cases among inmates in state prisons, and Arkansas is ninth for most inmate deaths, according to data from the Marshall Project. Since March, The Marshall Project has been tracking how many people are being sickened and killed by COVID-19 in prisons and how widely it has spread across the nation and within each state. According to the Marshall Project there have been at least 4,665 cases of coronavirus reported among prisoners in Arkansas, with 3,883 prisoners recovered. Their report states there have been at least 34 COVID-19-related deaths. Since July, a continuous number of inmates have been announced as having died in various hospitals by the Arkansas Department of Corrections. Most recently, an inmate was pronounced dead on Saturday at CHI St. Vincent – Hot Springs. The inmate from the Ouachita River Correctional Unit was undergoing treatment for COVID-19-related symptoms. The inmate was in his late 50s and serving a sentence for criminal attempt at murder in the first degree. The Department of Corrections has extended suspension of inmate visitation until Sept. 1. The suspension includes all prisons and community correction centers, and it applies to regular and special visits.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A judge ordered immediate testing of all detainees and staff at an immigration detention center where COVID-19 was spreading for weeks while officials refused to test for the virus. Federal District Court Judge Vince Chhabria ordered the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency to conduct quick-result testing of everyone in the Mesa Verde ICE Processing Facility in Bakersfield, The Los Angeles Times reported. At least 54 of the 104 detained people remaining at the facility tested positive for the virus. Initial results from quick tests Saturday found 11 more positive cases, MacLean said. Chhabria’s order also directed about 140 staff members at Mesa Verde to be tested during their next shift, and weekly thereafter. The order followed results Friday showing nearly half of the detainees tested earlier in the week were positive for COVID-19. Deputy Public Defender Emi MacLean of the San Francisco public defender’s office said the judge cited the “deliberate indifference” of ICE and GEO Group, the private company managing the facility. The public defender’s office represents detainees at the facility in San Francisco Immigration Court.\n\nColorado\n\nRocky Ford:The 32nd Arkansas Valley Fair Board has canceled the 2020 Balloon Festival because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The festival was planned for Nov. 6-8 and has been rescheduled for Nov. 5-7, 2021. The festival was canceled to avoid adding more stress on attendees and participants, the board said in a news release. “We love our ballooning family and want everyone to be as safe as possible,” the statement said. “We considered many scenarios before coming to this decision. The strain of this pandemic has been difficult, and we do not want to put any more stress on our sponsors, pilots, or spectators.” For the last three decades, colorful and vibrant hot air balloons have filled the skies nearly every first week of November. Balloon pilots – professional fliers and often longtime thrill-seekers – have visited the Arkansas Valley and Rocky Ford where, weather conditions permitting, they would take to the skies. Pilots were usually happy to take locals and visitors up with them, too, where one could get a rare, expansive look at the valley.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Britain: Two Connecticut parents filed an appeal in state court challenging a Department of Education requirement that students returning to classrooms this fall wear facemasks. The appeal filed Friday in Superior Court in New Britain seeks to have the department rescind the requirement to wear face coverings and to issue an order stating that neither the department nor local school districts can impose such a requirement, according to the Hartford Courant. “The Defendants’ requirements regarding the use of face coverings, masks, and face shields in schools … place an unconstitutional burden and restriction on the Plaintiffs’ fundamental right to an education, and is a denial of their right to equal protection of the law,” according to the filing. An emailed response Saturday from the Department of Education and the Office of the Attorney General said: “We are reviewing the complaint and will respond in court. Masks keep people safe. Please wear your mask.” The parents named in the filing are Jenna Matos, whose children ages 5 and 7 attend a parochial school in Manchester, and Raena Ferguson of East Lyme, whose 14-year-old child attends the local high school. The parents were joined in the appeal by the Connecticut Freedom Alliance. The mask requirement was included in a plan the education department released this summer stipulating certain rules schools must follow if they open for in-person learning this fall.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth Beach:The 31st annual Sea Witch Festival has been postponed to Oct. 29-31 of next year amid concerns over the coronavirus pandemic, organizers announced Monday in a Rehoboth Beach-Dewey Beach Chamber of Commerce email. Organizers stated that COVID-19 regulations and mandates “cannot be met” for such an event. “Next year will be bigger & better than EVER, including more entertainment, more activities, and more FUN!!” they added. The Sea Witch Festival, which welcomes thousands of people to Rehoboth Beach each fall, is one of the latest crowd-drawing events in southern Delaware to be impacted by the pandemic. Last week, the Jazz Festival was also postponed to October 2021. The Sea Witch Festival is a weekend-long event that attracts visitors well after the summer season ends, making Monday’s announcement especially taxing on small businesses. Rehoboth Beach, like many resort towns along the Delaware coast and nationally, has taken an economic punch this summer season, with less visitors, an uptick in hotel cancellations and restaurants facing limited capacity and other strict COVID-19 regulations.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Asymptomatic spread of the coronavirus has been a major source of infections in the District, WUSA-TV reported, according to new data revealed by an analysis of the city’s contact tracing cases. In a presentation released Monday, DC Health offered lessons learned from an analysis of 971 confirmed cases of the coronavirus between July 31 and Aug. 13. According to DC Health, more than half of those surveyed, 51%, said they had not come into contact with a person diagnosed with COVID-19 during the exposure period. To illustrate this, DC Health offered several contact tracing case studies derived from the data, including one in which three branches of an extended family became infected with the virus after attending a birthday party together – despite none of the attendees showing symptoms until the day after the party. The presentation also found troubling reports about large gatherings that have continued to be held in the District. Of those surveyed, 145 people reported attending a large event during their exposure event. More than 60% of those indicated that some part of the event occurred indoors, and the same amount said social distancing wasn’t observed during the event. Also, of those surveyed, 102 said they have traveled during their exposure period, with air travel being far and away the most common (71%), followed by rideshare (33%).\n\nFlorida\n\nDaytona Beach:Ninety-three inmates at the Volusia County Branch Jail have tested positive for the coronavirus since July 31, according to a county spokesman. The jail began routinely testing all inmates on July 27 except for inmates who were booked and immediately bonded out, said spokesman Gary Davidson. Before that, the jail had only been testing inmates who exhibited symptoms, Davidson wrote in an email. Davidson provided statistics on Friday going back to July 27 showing that 1,128 inmates have been tested resulting in 93 positive results. Those 93 are in addition to 13 inmates who had tested positive by July 31 at the jail, Davidson wrote. Davidson said that all the inmates who have tested positive since July 27 were asymptomatic. “Because of the proactive testing measures, we’re now able to identify and isolate the inmates as necessary to help prevent further spread,” Davidson wrote. He said the jail has not had any coronavirus-related deaths and none of the inmates who has tested positive has been hospitalized. Jail staff are awaiting the results on about 275 tests; 1,033 inmates have tested negative.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Gov. Brian Kemp, who has opposed local mask mandates and even sued over one in Atlanta, has signed an executive order that allows local governments to enact mask requirements to help fight the coronavirus pandemic. As with previous orders, the one issued Saturday said residents and visitors of the state are “strongly encouraged” to wear face coverings when they are outside of their homes, except when eating, drinking or exercising outside. But unlike previous orders, this one allows local governments in counties that have reached a “threshold requirement” to require the wearing of masks on government-owned property. A county meets that threshold requirement if it has had 100 or more confirmed cases of COVID-19 per 100,000 people over the previous 14 days. Only two of Georgia’s 159 counties were below that threshold, according to data from the state Department of Public Health. Local mask mandates cannot result in fines, fees or penalties against private businesses or organizations, and penalties against individuals for non-compliance cannot included a fine greater than $50 and cannot include prison time, the order said. If people are not in compliance, local authorities must warn them “about the health risks posed by not wearing a face mask or face covering” prior to issuing a citation. Local mask requirements can’t be enforced on residential property and can only be enforced on private property, including businesses, if the owner or occupant consents to enforcement, the order said.\n\nHawaii\n\nKahului: Kahului Airport on Maui has completed its second phase of its thermal screening project meant to fight the spread of the coronavirus. The screening uses thermal imaging and facial recognition technology to pinpoint people with a temperature of 100.4 degrees or higher. Dual lens cameras have been installed at all arrival gates and TSA checkpoints in the airport. When Phase 3 is completed, the cameras will be able to track travelers with high body temperatures so contact tracers can stop and screen them before they leave the airport, The Maui News reported. Maui Airports District Manager Marvin Moniz said he expects Phase 3 to be completed before the end of the year. The technology is being implemented at all five of Hawaii’s main airports. In response to growing privacy concerns, Moniz said the images are erased every 30 minutes. There are also signs throughout the airport that alert travelers about the thermal screening cameras. “It’s not recorded, it’s just like a queue,” said Maui District Assistant Airport Superintendent Larry Miller. “It’s not permanently stored.” Moniz said the airport is using the system to flag people, even before the third phase starts. He said personnel from the American Medical Response and the Kahului Airport Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting Unit are tasked with testing passengers who are flagged for high temperatures. He said those who have been flagged so far using the cameras include a person who had a kidney infection and another with an ear infection.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A group that had been collecting online signatures for an education initiative called off the effort Thursday following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling against them late last month. The court case remains active, but it’s back at the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and not likely to wrap up with enough time left to get the initiative on the ballot. Reclaim Idaho contended it should be allowed to collect online signatures during the pandemic. The initiative would have raised $170 million for K-12 education by raising taxes on corporations and individuals making $250,000 or more annually. “This is an initiative that promised to save Idaho from deep cuts to the K-12 budget, and it’s an initiative that the vast majority of Idahoans support,” said Luke Mayville, co-founder of Reclaim Idaho, in a statement. The group backs initiatives and successfully got Medicaid expansion on the ballot several years ago that ultimately became law. Reclaim Idaho in the lawsuit filed in June said Republican Gov. Brad Little’s statewide stay-at-home order in late March because of the pandemic didn’t include exceptions for ballot initiative signature-gathering. The group said that violated the First Amendment-protected process of signature gathering, a form of political speech. Idaho does not allow online signatures for ballot initiatives. The state argued in court documents that allowing such signatures undermines the election process. Reclaim Idaho won in U.S. District Court and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, allowing online signature gathering. But the U.S. Supreme Court sided with Little, putting online signature gathering on hold and sending the case back to the appeals court to be decided on its merits.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced fresh restrictions Sunday for southwestern Illinois after a resurgence of COVID-19 cases. The rules, effective Tuesday, include limiting meetings and social events to the lesser of 25 people or 25% of overall room capacity and closing bars and casinos at 11 p.m. The restrictions follow three straight days of a positive test rate of 8% or higher. Illinois’ statewide average is 4.1%. “Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, I have made it clear that neither arbitrary dates on a calendar nor political pressure will dictate Illinois’ efforts to protect our people,” Pritzker said in a statement. “If the data shows we need to go backwards in our reopening, I won’t hesitate to tighten restrictions to protect our collective health.” The restrictions apply to seven counties, including Madison and St. Clair.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Arts, cultural and tourism organizations across the state can compete for a share of $10 million in aid intended to give a boost to groups impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. Lt. Gov. Suzanne Crouch has announced that qualifying organizations whose normal operations have been disrupted by COVID-19 are eligible for the state grants, which are funded by the federal CARES Act. “The arts and cultural sector adds vibrancy and depth to Hoosiers’ lives and is a significant factor in the health of Indiana’s tourism economy,” Crouch said. The funding will be jointly awarded by the Indiana Destination Development Corp. and the Indiana Arts Commission, The (Northwest Indiana) Times reported. Indiana-based nonprofit organizations can apply for the funds through the Indiana Arts Commission website at in.gov/arts/2567.htm. The application deadline is Sept. 8.Lewis Ricci, executive director of the state arts commission, said the funding “will help preserve the arts and cultural community assets that our citizens value.” “In cities, towns and counties both urban and rural, big and small, the arts play a vital role in economy, quality of life, and community identity,” Ricci said.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:Another three people with COVID-19 have died and there have been an additional 395 confirmed cases, the state reported Monday. There have been a total of 978 COVID-19-related deaths in the state. The state has a total of 52,616 confirmed cases of coronavirus, an increase of 395 since Sunday. Of those tested Sunday, 11.8% were positive. Since the state started tracking the positivity rate, 9.4% of people who have been tested were positive.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Teachers who quit because they don’t feel safe returning to teaching in-person classes during the pandemic might have to pay their school districts up to $10,000 for backing out of their contracts. Penalties for quitting or resigning are meant to help districts find replacement teachers, but schools must prove that their penalty fee is based on the cost of replacing that teacher and not just an arbitrary amount designed to punish teachers. Educators said heading back to school seemed a lot safer before the resignation deadlines a few months ago when the coronavirus outbreak appeared nearly under control, KMUW-FM reported. The state had reported its lowest number of new coronavirus cases in two months and businesses were slowly reopening. Some educators said it’s unfair to charge teachers for escaping their contracts if the situation has changed and they no longer feel safe returning to the classroom. Marcus Baltzell, head of communications for the Kansas National Education Association, said forcing teachers to pay could just lead to more teachers quitting. “You can claw back as much money as you want, but if you’re not careful, then what you end up with is a district with no teachers,” he said. Usually districts ask for about $2,000, depending on how late a teacher leaves. But some districts do more. Emporia Public Schools is asking for $5,000 if a teacher resigns after August. The Syracuse school district near the Colorado border asks for $10,000.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear raised concerns about tightening supplies of testing materials and personal protective equipment in the fight against COVID-19. The Bluegrass State has built reserve supplies of some PPE and is in better shape than most states to deal with shortages of testing materials, Beshear said. “I believe that in Kentucky, we are in a much better place because of our local partnerships,” the Democratic governor told reporters. “But I will warn everybody that we’re starting to see the market tighten in both testing supplies, which are at a very difficult level, and PPE. It’s getting harder and harder, once again, to get certain items of PPE.” His concerns about the availability of crucial supplies come as Kentucky recorded its highest number of coronavirus cases in a single week. The state had 4,333 reported cases last week, Beshear said. He’s hoping the state has reached a “new plateau” in weekly cases.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Crawfish farmers are now eligible for a $16 billion coronavirus aid program run by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Crawfish are among scores of commodities added to the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program announced in May. Louisiana’s congressional delegation, state Agriculture and Forestry Commissioner Mike Strain, the Louisiana Farm Bureau Federation and the LSU AgCenter have been pushing to add farmed crawfish to the list. “For generations, crawfish have brought Louisianans together to celebrate the change in seasons, our faith, our families, and our heritage,” Louisiana’s U.S. senators and representatives said in a July 6 letter to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue. “While the social impact of the loss of these celebrations on the people of Louisiana can never be quantified, the economic loss to the State is estimated at over $146 million for 2020.” Program details are available at www.farmers.gov/cfap.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Maine’s community banks are getting credit for swiftly funneling aid to businesses through the Paycheck Protection Program. Although national banks prioritized large businesses, Maine banks helped small businesses stabilize and the economy with hundreds of millions of dollars of forgivable loans, the Portland Press Herald reported. More than 46% of Paycheck Protection Program loans over $150,000 were made by just six locally owned banks, according to data from the U.S. Small Business Administration. National banks were far less active in PPP lending in Maine. The top 10 national PPP lenders, including TD Bank, KeyBank, Bank of America and Chase Bank, provided just 13% of loans under $150,000, and about 17% of larger loans in the state. “I think everyone realized that the goal was to get as many of those loans approved and in the system as quickly as possible,” said Kim Donnelly, director of business banking at Gorham Savings Bank. To date, about 28,300 loans worth more than $2.2 billion have been made to Maine employers. The vast majority of loans are below $150,000. The loans could be forgiven if businesses meet certain spending and employment thresholds. Loan balances that aren’t forgiven could be repaid over up to five years at 1% interest.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis:The Maryland Department of Health will keep the results of rapid antigen tests separate from those of more accurate molecular tests in its official count of COVID-19 cases, a state health official said. The antigen tests, which are the centerpiece of Gov. Larry Hogan’s interstate compact to expand COVID-19 testing, can offer results in 15 to 20 minutes, rather than days. But they are also less sensitive than the standard molecular tests, known as PCR tests, experts said. The use of antigen tests in Maryland is limited, said Dennis Schrader, chief operating officer and Medicaid director for the Maryland Department of Health. The rapid tests will form the next phase of testing, he said – one that is focused on fast, high-volume screening. Because the antigen tests will focus more on screening than on diagnosis, he said, the results from those tests will be tracked separately from the results of PCR tests. Schrader said the antigen tests also will not be used to calculate the state’s positivity rate, a key metric that measures what percentage of COVID-19 test results are positive.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The city’s Museum of Science and a top Harvard University health expert have teamed to make it easier for anyone anywhere in the world to get answers to questions about the coronavirus pandemic. The interactive exhibit, featuring Dr. Ashish Jha and using StoryFile’s conversational video artificial intelligence technology, was unveiled Monday, the museum said in a statement. “ Ask a Virtual Expert: COVID Conversations with Dr. Jha “ allows the curious on-site and remotely to ask a digital image of Jha a multitude of questions about COVID-19. The answers are based on Jha’s responses to more than 550 questions. The museum’s goal is to make complex scientific topics accessible, President Tim Ritchie said in a statement. “The suite of COVID exhibit content we present in the museum and online – especially the opportunity to have a “personal” conversation with an AI version of one of the world’s leading public health scientists – does just that,” he said. Jha is a professor of global health at Harvard and director of the Harvard Global Health Institute. “Collaborating with the Museum of Science on this experience was, for me, an extraordinary opportunity to reach people – children and adults alike – with fact-based information about health policy, disease transmission, the importance of masks and social distancing and global efforts to combat COVID-19,” he said in a statement.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A state employee who was accused of stabbing a man after a face-mask dispute and was fatally shot by a sheriff’s deputy had been reprimanded for three separate work incidents from 2017 to 2018, according to state personnel filings. Michigan Department of Transportation employee Sean Ruis, 43, was disciplined following interactions with colleagues, according to The Detroit News. The newspaper cites filings it obtained through a public records request. Ruis had worked at the agency for 12 years. In a March 2017 incident, he was issued a notice of reprimand for approaching a coworker and questioning him about his use of leave. “You had been previously instructed, multiple times, by your supervisor and by labor relations, that the employee’s use of leave is confidential,” the notice said. “You continued to confront this coworker even after he had informed you that you were harassing him.” Ruis, 43, was shot last month near Lansing after a stabbing inside a Quality Dairy store. Authorities alleged he stabbed a 77-year-old man after being approached about not wearing a mask. The victim, John Duncan III, was left in critical condition and later died, family members said. Later, a sheriff’s deputy shot Ruiz when he tried to attack. He was holding a screwdriver and knives, authorities said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSauk Rapids:Students in the Sauk Rapids-Rice district will return to classrooms for the 2020-21 school year, but how a school day will work and which students can return first could be different between buildings and grade levels. Although the school board voted 6-1 at a special meeting Thursday to begin the school year with in-person learning for all students, the first weeks of classes might not see every student return all at once. “The biggest piece, from my perspective, is giving our staff and our students time to understand what our new normal is,” Superintendent Brad Bergstrom said at the meeting. “What we need to do at the elementary level, time-wise, may look a little different than what we need to do at the secondary level,” Bergstrom said, “and I think that we may need more than one week to do that in some circumstances.” The specific plans for reopening each building and grade level will fall to building administrators with guidance from the district, based on factors like the size of the building’s spaces and ability to allow for social distancing. All students might not return to school at the same time, Bergstrom said after the meeting. In a normal school year, he said, ninth- and sixth-graders begin the school year earlier than other students to get acclimated and transition to a new building. Mark Hauck was the only board member to vote against the in-person plan with building-specific slow starts.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Fall sports and extracurricular activities for students in Mississippi’s second-largest school district have been canceled amid concerns surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. Jackson Public Schools announced the decision Friday, The Clarion Ledger reported. “I know how disappointing the cancellation of sports and extracurricular activities may be for students, coaches and parents, but the school district must make decisions that make safety our top priority,” Daryl Jones, the district’s athletic director, said in a news release. “As we will not be able to host competitions with teams in a way that we can comply with the guidance from all levels of government and health officials, we must put safety first.” In the district’s announcement, alternative methods of developing student-athletes were outlined. Seniors can create highlight videos to introduce themselves to college coaches, officials said. Small group workout sessions emphasizing technique and skill development can also be conducted and there will be a winter showcase for senior student-athletes. Small group lessons will be held for band members and small-group tumbling assistance and training will be available for cheerleaders, the district said. The district cited Hinds County’s “hot spot” designation by Gov. Tate Reeves and Mississippi’s high positivity testing rate in making its decision. It also referred to the decision by Power 5 college conferences like the Big Ten and Pac 12 to not play sports this fall.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A security guard who was beaten in a confrontation over facemasks opened fire early Saturday and wounded one of his attackers. St. Louis Police said the shooting happened around 2:30 a.m. after the guard told three men they couldn’t be inside a Shell gas station because they weren’t wearing masks. The city is requiring masks to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The men left but kept the door open and taunted the guard, police said. When the guard ordered the men to leave the property, they surrounded him and began punching him in the face. One of the suspects grabbed the guard’s baton and struck him several times. The guard then shot at the suspects, hitting one of the men in the abdomen, police said. That man was dropped off at a hospital where he was listed in critical but stable condition. The other two suspects fled.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls:The number of COVID-19 cases in Montana dipped to 43 on Monday, a 53% drop and tying the lowest figure reported in 22 days. In north-central Montana, Cascade and Phillips counties reported one each. The total number of confirmed reports is now 5,792. Of those, 4,162 have recovered and 1,548 remain active, according to covid19.mt.gov. There are 92 people who are still hospitalized out of 330 total hospitalizations. The number of deaths remained at 82. The number of cases from Saturday, reported Sunday, was 92. There were 120 on Friday, 132 on Thursday and 142 on Wednesday, according to covid19.mt.gov. The last time 43 cases was reported was July 26. The lowest before that was 37 on July 5. Flathead County reported 15 cases, Yellowstone County had 11, Big Horn had 10 and Carbon had two, the state reported. Cascade, Gallatin, Madison, Missoula and Phillips counties each had one.\n\nNebraska\n\nWayne: Two Wayne State College professors said they are frustrated that their requests to teach remotely this fall were denied. Longtime history professor Don Hickey, 76, said he hired an attorney after college officials rejected his request. “This is a scandal to us – that they’re playing hardball with senior faculty and putting them at risk,” Hickey said. After Hickey told administrators he would teach his classes remotely whether they approved or not he was told his classes would be taught on campus by other faculty members. Hickey has taught at the school since 1978. A request by another Wayne State history faculty member, Joseph Weixelman, 63, also was rejected. Weixelman said he has multiple sclerosis and that medications for that disease suppress the immune system, which could make him more susceptible to severe illness from the COVID-19 virus. “I feel scared,” said Weixelman, who plans to teach his courses on campus. “With my age and a preexisting condition, I’m not sure I would make it through” a bout with COVID-19. A spokeswoman for the Nebraska State College System said fewer than 20 professors requested accommodations for teaching this fall under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Spokeswoman Judi Yorges said she wasn’t sure how many requests were granted. Yorges said in a statement that decisions “have been made with the best interests of our students and staff in mind. It is unfortunate if these efforts are misrepresented as ‘playing hardball.’ ”\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: In a letter to state officials, the food service provider at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas said it will lay off 940 employees. HMSHost sent a letter to the Nevada Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation about the decisions last Tuesday. The group also said that any workers that were furloughed and not scheduled to return to work by Oct. 15 will also be let go. Most of the layoffs are for those working as fast food clerks, restaurant hosts, baristas, bartenders and servers. Food and retail outlets at the airport have been severely affected by the pandemic, which has greatly diminished air travel. Although some outlets at McCarran have reopened with limited hours, many remain closed. “HMSHost continues to see an unprecedented decline in traffic in airports and on the motorways,” the company’s letter said. “The COVID-19 pandemic has devastated the travel and restaurant industries and, unfortunately, HMSHost sits at the crossroads of both. Never in the history of aviation and the hospitality industry, have we experienced such catastrophic customer traffic declines.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: When the coronavirus pandemic shut down schools and museums, the Aviation Museum of New Hampshire used its flight simulator to bring children on a virtual trip around the world in a Douglas DC-3, which is credited with helping the allies win World War II. “Every segment was a learning adventure in which we discussed the physics of flight, in which we discussed the culture and the history and the geography of the areas that we were flying over,” said Jeffrey Rapsis, the museum’s executive director. WMUR-TV reported that the museum celebrated the end of the remote learning program Saturday by displaying one of the 21 passenger propeller planes. Hundreds turned out, wearing masks to get a close look.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton:The state has a shortage of nearly 3,000 physicians, according to the New Jersey Physician Task Force of the New Jersey Council of Teaching Hospitals. And that shortage could become critically worse if COVID-19 restrictions have a serious impact on medical school students who have to accumulate clinical hours for their accreditation. The deans of Rowan University’s two medical schools are asking Gov. Phil Murphy to create a task force to address the threat of a projected physician shortage. Unless accrediting bodies, government agencies, hospital associations and medical regulators come together to address a possible threat to clinical hours and accreditation, those numbers exacerbate the physician shortage, said Dr. Thomas A. Cavalieri, dean of Rowan’s School of Osteopathic Medicine in Stratford, and Dr. Annette Reboli, dean of Cooper Medical School of Rowan University in Camden. “All these groups are stakeholders in this and need to come together to see to it that the medical schools are getting what they need in order to produce a physician workforce at the state and national level,” Cavalieri said. “If not, there’s a lot at risk. If we don’t address this issue, and we get hit with another pandemic, there will be a serious shortfall of appropriately trained physicians to respond.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nJemez Springs: A popular music camp in New Mexico is canceling its summer program for the first time in more than 60 years because of COVID-19. KRQE-TV reported organizers for the Hummingbird Music Camp in Jemez Springs recently made the decision as the state remains under health orders because of the virus. Camp Director Teena King said organizers had no choice but to cancel the rest of the 2020 summer season. “It hurt our hearts. We were so prepared to figure it out and go forward,” King said. King said she is keeping her business afloat by renting out the cabins on the camp’s property to families.\n\nNew York\n\nCanandaigua:After a late start to the summer season at the Kershaw Park beach because of the coronavirus pandemic, summer will be coming to an end earlier than usual at the city’s popular swimming area. The last day of swimming will be Saturday, about two weeks before the traditional Labor Day closing, according to City Manager John Goodwin. “I know it’s two weeks early, but unfortunately, we don’t have the staffing,” Goodwin said. The beach typically opens Memorial Day weekend, but that didn’t happen until June this year because of the pandemic. Noting that Ontario County’s Deep Run beach on Canandaigua Lake did not open this summer, Goodwin said “we were fortunate to get the staff to run all of July and most of August.” The city cannot allow swimmers to “swim at your own risk” – which is allowed on private properties such as hotels – because it is not permitted at public parks in New York, Goodwin said. In previous years, the tail end of the summer swim season has also brought beach closures as a result of blue-green algae blooms.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nChapel Hill: Another cluster of positive COVID-19 cases within student housing was announced Sunday at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The disclosure of cases within the Hinton James dormitory building marks the fourth such cluster – defined as five or more cases in close proximity – since the semester began Aug. 10 at the state’s flagship public university campus. The other three have occurred within an on-campus dormitory, private student housing and a fraternity house. As with the other clusters, the individuals testing positive in the Hinton James cluster are being isolated and receiving medical monitoring. Contact tracing is also happening.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: All North Dakota counties are aiming to have in-person voting as an option during the general election, a reversal from the June primary when all polling places were closed statewide amid the coronavirus outbreak. “Everyone is really moving ahead on in-person voting,” Donnell Preskey Hushka, executive director of the North Dakota County Auditors Association, said Monday. Election officials in the state’s 53 counties are “determining how many polling places they want or need.” Gov. Doug Burgum, at the request of the group, signed an executive order in March waiving the requirement that counties have at least one physical polling site for the June election, while allowing counties to conduct the primary election entirely by mail. Burgum stopped short of mandating that all polling places close during the state’s June election, despite being urged by county auditors to do so. The governor said he wanted to give counties the option of having open polling places, if they wanted. Hushka said county auditors, who serve as local election officials, have more time to plan for the upcoming election. More personal protective equipment also is available now for election workers and voters, she said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Among the voices of athletes, parents and coaches clamoring for high school sports to proceed during the coronavirus pandemic is a booster with one of the state’s highest-profile platforms: Republican Lt. Gov. Jon Husted. Husted, a former University of Dayton football player, is working with Ohio’s high school sports oversight organization to develop a plan. He has been outspoken on his personal Twitter account in recent days that sports should go forward. Those tweets come as GOP Gov. Mike DeWine was expected to announce his order governing sports Tuesday – a plan that appears to leave a lot of decision-making to local officials. “What’s the greater risk to people under age 25, canceling in-person learning & extracurriculars (sports) to protect them from COVID or leaving it to chance how they’ll fill this time?” Husted tweeted on Aug. 10 to his more than 25,500 followers. “You can’t take these things away from young people & expect good (health, academic, life) results.” DeWine hinted last week that fall sports, including football and soccer, could go forward with limits and based on local decisions by parents, schools and health officials.\n\nOklahoma\n\nStillwater: Women living at an off-campus sorority house at Oklahoma State University have been placed in isolation and are prohibited from leaving the house after 23 of them tested positive for COVID-19, university officials confirmed Monday. “Due to the nature of this situation, the entire chapter house is in isolation or quarantine and will be prohibited from leaving the facility,” the university said in a statement. “One member of the sorority who lives elsewhere is among those who tested positive and will also remain in isolation.” A widely circulated video showed dozens of students without masks packed into a Stillwater nightclub over the weekend. “As a student, I’m frustrated as hell,” said Ryan Novozinsky, an OSU junior from Allentown, New Jersey, and the editor of the student newspaper. “These are people I have to interact with. People will tell you this age group isn’t affected, but there’s always outliers with diseases, and there will be professors they interact with, starting today, that won’t be able to fight this off.” OSU has a combination of in-person and online courses, and students, staff and faculty are required to wear masks indoors and outdoors where social distancing isn’t possible. The city of Stillwater also has a mandate that masks be worn inside businesses, but police Capt. Kyle Gibbs said the department doesn’t typically respond to reports of mask violations.\n\nOregon\n\nOntario: A person imprisoned at the Snake River Correctional Institution died Wednesday after contracting COVID-19, officials said. The death marks the second of an inmate who tested positive for the virus in custody of the Oregon Department of Corrections, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported. The person who died, a man between the ages of 60 and 70, was tested last Tuesday, officials said. His test results came back Friday confirming that he had contracted the virus. The Department of Corrections did not release the man’s name or exact cause of death. The state generally discloses the deceased person’s name, county of conviction and length of sentence, but officials have changed that practice for inmates who contract the virus. The first inmate to succumb to the disease in the state, a man between 50 and 60 years old, died at the Oregon State Penitentiary in Salem in May.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state plans to launch a coronavirus exposure-notification app in early September to more quickly break chains of transmission by using the new technology to notify people who might have been exposed, officials said. The state has a $1.9 million contract to deploy and maintain the app with software developer NearForm Ltd, the Ireland-based company whose app has been downloaded by more than one-fourth of that country’s residents. The app is based on smartphone technology developed by Apple and Google, and will undergo a pilot project next week, using state government employees and public health students, staff and faculty, officials told the Associated Press. The app will be interoperable with the state of Delaware’s app, and it also is expected to be interoperable with those of two other states, although Pennsylvania state officials declined to name those states because they are still in discussions with the app developer. It’s use will be limited to people 18 and over. It is similar to the app rolled out by Virginia earlier this month, when it became the first U.S. state to use new pandemic technology created by Apple and Google. North Dakota and Wyoming have also launched an app using the Apple-Google technology in recent days, and a number of other states are interested in it, Google has said. It is designed to automatically notify people if they might have been exposed to the coronavirus, and state officials said the app does not store location information, personal information or the identify of anyone who is in close enough range to possibly be exposed. It relies on Bluetooth wireless technology to detect when someone who downloaded the app has spent time near another app user who later tests positive for the virus.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state launched an online portal to help adults seeking training and work during and after the coronavirus pandemic connect with educational opportunities. The program, RI Reconnect, is a partnership between the state Office of the Postsecondary Commissioner and a grant from the Lumina Foundation. “With RI Reconnect, adult students are matched with a navigator who will work with them to identify and meet their goals, whether that’s earning a certificate, a license for a trade, or finishing a college degree,” Tammy Vargas Warner, the agency’s assistant commissioner, said in a statement Monday.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state Senate is coming back into session in two weeks to mull over possible election law updates necessitated by the coronavirus outbreak. In a news release Monday, Senate President Harvey Peeler said state senators would return Sept. 2 to “make plans to protect the voter and the vote” given that the pandemic continues in the run up to the November general election. “If the COVID-19 pandemic is still prevalent in our state, the Senate must make plans to protect the voter and the vote,” Peeler said. “We don’t know what the situation will be like in November, but we need to prepare for safe and secure voting.” State lawmakers had already been slated to return in mid-September, purportedly to discuss possible election tweaks, among other issues. House Majority Leader Gary Simrill said Monday that chamber would stick to its plans to return Sept. 15, not earlier. Ahead of the state’s June primary elections, state lawmakers in May agreed to several changes including universal absentee voting and a waiver of the witness requirement for absentee ballots. Referencing the “bipartisan manner” in which those issues were handled, Peeler wrote he was “hopeful we can do it again and return later in September to address the remaining legislative business.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:Mayor Paul TenHaken said a mask mandate for Sioux Falls is possible if cases continue to rise but said the city is in a good position with COVID-19 hospitalizations as schools prepare to open in the area. TenHaken, who said he was “so proud” of how Sioux Falls has responded in the five months since a COVID-19 case was confirmed in the city, spoke positively about where the city is, noting that an increase in the city’s rate of positive cases over the past three months had not been met with an equal increase in hospitalizations. TenHaken was joined by officials from Avera and Sanford on Monday to provide an update on the city’s response to the pandemic. With school starting soon – TenHaken noted his children are heading back this week – the mayor said the leaders of districts and schools have “nearly impossible jobs right now,” and asked the community as a whole to work together to keep transmission down – and to be prepared for when, inevitably, there are COVID-19 cases in schools.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A state lawmaker who was criticized for not wearing a mask at a Republican party dinner has been hospitalized, and colleagues said he has the coronavirus. Rep. Mike Carter tweeted Monday morning that he’s feeling better but expects ups and downs during his recovery. Carter, an Ooltewah Republican, was getting treatment for COVID-19 on Sunday in the intensive care unit of Erlanger hospital, his colleagues told the Chattanooga Times Free Press. “Our friend and colleague is battling COVID, and he is in ICU in Erlanger and we covet your prayers and so does he,” said House Republican Caucus Chairman Jeremy Faison. He said he and Carter texted each other earlier in the day. Carter attended a July 31 Hamilton County Lincoln Day dinner where a number of prominent Republicans were criticized for not wearing masks or social-distancing. He posted a photo of himself with U.S. Senate nominee Bill Hagerty, neither of them wearing a mask, and later tweeted in response to criticism that guidelines don’t require mask-wearing while dining. When the local health department announced on Aug. 5 there was a virus exposure at the event, Hagerty’s campaign said the candidate tested negative for the coronavirus. Carter chairs the House Civil Justice Committee, but was absent during last week’s special legislative session.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin:The Central Texas Food Bank will distribute free food using its mobile food pantries to help those who are facing increased food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic from 8 to 11 a.m. Thursday at Nelson Field in Austin and Saturday at Del Valle High School in Del Valle. Attendees will receive one box of assorted produce, 1 to 2 gallons of milk, one protein box weighing 8 to 20 pounds containing pork or chicken products and/or an emergency box of shelf-stable items. To adhere to social distancing requirements, pickup will only be available to those in vehicles. No walk-ups will be allowed. For more information, visit centraltexasfoodbank.org.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Officials on Monday confirmed the first U.S. cases of mink infected with the coronavirus following outbreaks in Europe. Five infected minks have been identified at two farms in Utah, the Department of Agriculture announced. Testing began after the farms reported unusually high mortality rates among the small animals prized for their fur. The Utah mink farms have also reported cases among workers. Infected humans can spread the virus to animals during close contact, but there is no current evidence that animals spread the disease to humans, authorities said. The impacted farms in Utah have been quarantined to stop the spread of the virus. Scientists believe the coronavirus that first infected people in China initially came from an animal source, probably bats, and later spread from person to person. Some animals, including cats and dogs, have picked up the coronavirus from people as it spread around the world. Scientists are studying outbreaks in Denmark, Spain and the Netherlands and exploring whether workers could have caught the virus from minks and, if so, how much of a further threat that type of transmission might pose. More than 1 million minks were killed on Dutch farms with outbreaks to prevent the spread of the disease.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington:Dwindling sales because of the COVID-19 pandemic have prompted Nepali Dumpling House in Burlington’s Old North End to close at the end of the month. The only bright side for her customers, owner Sabitra Phuyel said, is “everything is on sale” at the family operated deli and store. Her business, which opened in 2016, sells clothing, food, toys, household items and groceries, as well as takeout meals. The going-out-of-business sale will end on Aug. 31, as will Phuyel’s lease. Phuyel said she plans to put everything that remains, with the exception of perishables, in storage in the off-chance that she (or someone else) might revive the business one day.\n\nVirginia\n\nFarmville: Two outside experts will be allowed to inspect an immigration detention center in Virginia that has seen the worst coronavirus outbreak at any such facility in the nation, a federal judge said during a virtual hearing Monday. U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema agreed to a request from attorneys of inmates who have filed a lawsuit over conditions to allow a medical expert to conduct an inspection at the private facility in Farmville. Brinkema also agreed to a request from attorneys representing those running the facility to bring in one of their own experts. The judge instructed attorneys on both sides to draft an order allowing the visit. She could sign it as early as Monday afternoon. The visit could occur as early as this week. More than 80% of the center’s 300 detainees have tested positive for the virus, and one of those detained has died. Last week, the judge ordered immigration authorities to halt transfers into the detention center. She also excoriated U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for accepting 74 transfers from facilities in Florida and Arizona. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sent in its own team to inspect the facility last week. Dr. Homer Venters, the expert hired by the inmates’ attorneys, wrote in recently filed court documents that he attended a debrief provided by the CDC after its team visited the facility. Based on CDC observations, Venters wrote that it was difficult to maintain social distancing in some areas of the facility. He also wrote that staff do not use personal protective equipment appropriately and that many staff had exhibited symptoms of COVID-19 and continued working. Jeffrey Crawford, the director of Immigration Centers of America-Farmville, responded in his own filing. “CDC officials stated that ICA Farmville was largely in compliance with CDC recommendations, with only a few minor operational recommendations offered at that time, all of which I intend to implement at the facility,” he wrote.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The State Department of Health on Sunday reported 576 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 15 deaths. King County continues to have the highest numbers in the state, with 17,623 cases and 694 deaths. Yakima County is second, with 10,625 cases and 221 deaths. Pierce is third with 6,150 cases. Statewide totals from the illness caused by the coronavirus are at 67,461 cases and 1,781 deaths, up from 66,885 cases and 1,766 deaths on Friday. Thirty-seven people with confirmed COVID-19 cases were admitted to Washington state hospitals on Aug. 8, the most recent date with complete data. Late March had two days with 88 people admitted, the highest numbers to date during the pandemic. The total number of tests conducted is temporarily unavailable, according to the DOH. On Aug. 8, 6,394 specimens were collected statewide, with 5.4% testing positive. The average positive test rate for the seven days prior was 7%.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A recently released color-coding system for West Virginia public schools to stay open during the coronavirus pandemic is being tweaked to focus more on community spread, Gov. Jim Justice said Monday. The model will still use four colors to classify the status of each county’s school system based on the seven-day average of new daily cases per 100,000 people. The colors range from minimal community transmission in green, moderate transmission in yellow, higher transmission in orange and substantial transmission in red. Schools in counties that have an orange or red coding will not be allowed to have athletic competitions, and red counties must suspend in-person instruction and activate remote learning plans, Justice said. The change will now count each employee of a nursing home or prison who contracts the virus as one case. Before, employees were counted as half of a case. The reason for the change reflects the thinking that those people go out into the community, potentially advancing the spread of the virus, officials said. The color-coding map is based on a Harvard University model. But Dr. Clay Marsh, West Virginia’s coronavirus czar, said the Harvard model does not separate congregate and community spread of virus cases. “We live in such a a small population state,” Marsh said. “We have basically decided we will just look at what is the community spread.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:Temperatures in at least one Wisconsin prison have reached at least 87 degrees this summer, intensifying health concerns in prisons, already considered among the most dangerous environments during the coronavirus pandemic. Gov. Tony Evers has opted not to consider any clemency requests from inmates, and corrections officials have rejected nearly all applications for early release based on health conditions. Already overcrowded, the population in state-run prisons is rising again after months of decline, though still down since the beginning of the year. More than 21,000 adults are held in buildings designed to house fewer than 18,000. Inmates and their family members have reported troubling conditions, including poor ventilation, high temperatures and the impossibility of social distancing. In at least one facility, staff are forcing inmates to keep doors closed to restrict airflow in response to coronavirus risk. The American Civil Liberties Union has called on Evers to reduce the incarcerated population before further spread of the virus. More than 300 inmates in state prisons have been infected and 21 cases remain active. Outbreaks have been worse in other states’ prisons.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: The coronavirus pandemic has local high school musicians marching to a different drummer. That was evident during the morning hours of weeklong band camps for Campbell County and Thunder Basin high schools as band members practiced the fundamentals without their instruments. Whether shaking off rust for the seniors or introducing freshmen to high school marching band for the first time, the young musicians began the new band year marking time to a far-from-familiar cadence. The bands are the first high school activity returning to a semblance of normalcy for the upcoming school year. Fall sports practices began Monday. This fact registered with Thunder Basin band director Steve Schofield, and it was not something he takes lightly, the Gillette News Record reported. “I wouldn’t say it’s nervousness, but it’s a pretty heavy responsibility,” Schofield said. “We could really screw this up for everybody. If my band was to end up with half of them sick or whatever, then that could make people question whether schools should be opening up. So what I told the kids when we started was we have to be extremely serious about this.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/08/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/06/21/slavery-reckonings-radio-citys-return-marijuana-movements-news-around-states/117129826/", "title": "Slavery reckonings, Radio City's return: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: Descendants of the white Alabama businessman who financed the voyage of the last slave ship to land in the United States more than 160 years ago have agreed to sell a building that will become a hub for Africatown USA, the community settled by the freed Africans after the Civil War. A long-closed credit union building owned by relatives of Timothy Meaher will open within weeks as a food bank and as home of the Africatown Redevelopment Corp., officials told a news conference Thursday. The family sold the brick building to the city for $50,000, well below its appraised value of $300,000. The family, which tax records show owns millions of dollars’ worth of land around Mobile, issued a statement that described selling the building as a way “to give back to the community.” Mayor Sandy Stimpson said he contacted a representative of the family about acquiring the property in Africatown, located just a few miles north of downtown Mobile. Large parts of the once-vibrant community are blighted, but the area has received new attention since the wreckage of the slave ship, Clotilda, was found in 2018. Community leaders are now trying to revitalize the area with a museum and other attractions that could bring visitors and an infusion of money into the area.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A special legislative session limped toward a bitter end Friday, with the threat of a partial government shutdown looming and Gov. Mike Dunleavy and House majority leaders sharply disagreeing over the adequacy of the budget passed by lawmakers last week. Dunleavy called the budget “defective,” pointing in particular to the House’s failure to get the two-thirds support for a procedural effective-date vote. His office said notices were sent to thousands of state workers warning of possible layoffs with the new fiscal year beginning July 1. He called another special session, set to begin Wednesday and again focus on the budget, shortly after the House held a brief floor session for which attendance was not mandatory Friday afternoon. House majority leaders were among those who criticized Dunleavy’s stance on the budget. House Speaker Louise Stutes characterized it as a needless choice and said Dunleavy has tools available to prevent shutting down parts of the government, including asking minority Republicans to change their votes to support the effective-date clause. Minority Republicans, who say they have felt marginalized and want to be included in talks on what pieces should be considered as part of a broader fiscal plan, take responsibility for their votes, House Minority Leader Cathy Tilton told reporters Friday.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: Researchers at the University of Arizona will be launching a study of how prone Hispanic children are to asthma in Tucson compared with their peers on the other side of the U.S.-Mexico border in Nogales, Sonora. The study will follow 500 pregnant women of Mexican descent in both cities and their newborns for the next five years to see how prevalent asthma is. Dr. Fernando Martinez, a principal investigator of the project and director of the University of Arizona Health Sciences Asthma and Airway Disease Research Center, said there is four times less asthma in Nogales, Sonora, than in Tucson, which is about an hour’s drive away. A study of teenagers in Nogales, Arizona, showed 16% had asthma compared with 4% to 6% of teens in the same age range just across the border in Nogales, Sonora. Mexicans who come to the United States also have less asthma than Mexican Americans, researchers have found. The Arizona Daily Star reports the University of Arizona study will look into how the risk of asthma is affected by the “hygiene hypothesis,” which suggests that a child’s reduced exposure to germs stunts the immune system’s ability to fight infectious organisms. The study was delayed due to COVID-19, but researchers plan to begin enrolling pregnant women in August and finish by August 2023.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A federal judge Friday refused to allow a man arrested after he was photographed sitting at a desk in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office during the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot to travel for a classic-car swap meet. U.S. District Judge Christopher R. Cooper rejected the request by Richard Barnett to loosen the 50-mile restriction on how far he can travel from his residence while he’s on home detention awaiting trial. Barnett’s attorney said the Gravette, Arkansas, man needed to be able to travel to make a living buying and selling classic cars. Petit Jean Mountain, where the car show was being held over the weekend, is 200 miles from Gravette. “The Court is not persuaded that the defendant cannot pursue gainful employment within a 50-mile radius of his home as permitted by the current conditions,” Cooper’s order said. Barnett, 61, was among supporters of President Donald Trump who stormed the Capitol as lawmakers assembled to certify Joe Biden’s victory over Trump. Prosecutors say Barnett was carrying a stun gun when he entered the building. Federal prosecutors opposed Barnett’s request and said his conduct while awaiting trial – including an interview with Russian State Television – indicated more conditions, not fewer, were needed.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Attorney General Rob Bonta launched new anti-human trafficking teams to apprehend perpetrators and support survivors Friday amid an alarming increase in labor and sexual exploitation statewide amid the coronavirus pandemic. California’s lockdown exacerbated problems with human trafficking, officials said Friday, and made it much harder for victims to escape and find housing and other services. Kay Buck, the chief executive officer for Los Angeles-based nonprofit Coalition to Abolish Slavery and Trafficking, called it “the most unforgettable and heart-wrenching year” as advocates saw a huge demand in services combined with a shortage of resources. In LA alone, the nonprofit saw a spike of 185% in urgent human trafficking cases during the pandemic, Buck said. Advocates in LA County see victims – many who come from Mexico and the Philippines – who were duped into thinking they would have a job in the U.S. but are instead sold into “modern-day slavery.” Actors and activists Mira Sorvino and Alyssa Milano; state Assemblyman Miguel Santiago; and Angela Guanzon, who escaped her trafficker and aided law enforcement in their prosecution, joined Bonta on Friday to implore Newsom and lawmakers to approve another $30 million in new grants over the next three years, doubling the funding level for the efforts.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra visited a mobile vaccine clinic near the city Friday to promote COVID-19 shots among underserved communities of color that have some of the nation’s lowest vaccination rates. He also met with Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, getting briefly interrupted by the governor’s dog, Gia, and another dog dashing through their closed-door session, giving the two a laugh. They discussed the state’s pandemic response and a new law creating a state-administered health insurance plan designed to reduce premiums and costs of care as well as get more people covered. Later, Becerra, the agency’s first Latino leader, and Democratic members of Colorado’s congressional delegation toured a mobile vaccine clinic focused on underserved communities in the Denver suburb of Aurora, which is nearly 30% Hispanic. It’s one of nine mobile units made from converted buses. While Hispanic people make up 20% of Colorado’s population, less than 10% have been vaccinated, according to the state’s vaccine dashboard. Democratic U.S. Rep. Jason Crow said many minorities and immigrants have trouble finding the time to get vaccinated while working multiple jobs, highlighting the need for the mobile resources. “Where you are, we will go. Donde tú estás, iremos nosotros,” Becerra said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state has become the first in the nation to make all prison phone calls free, addressing one of the biggest emotional and financial burdens faced by incarcerated men and women and their families as they try to stay in touch. The state has a prison contract with phone vendor Securus Technologies, which charges up to $5 for a 15-minute call – some of the highest phone rates in the country. Gov. Ned Lamont signed a bill into law Wednesday that allows incarcerated men, women and juveniles a minimum of 90 minutes a day of free calls. Supports said the change could go into effect as early as next month. “We’re on the right side of history,” said Democratic state Rep. Josh Elliott, one of the legislation’s supporters. “Corporations can no longer be allowed to exploit the love between incarcerated people and their families – not in our state, not on our watch.” Several more local jurisdictions in the U.S. have also taken steps to make prison and jail phone calls free, including New York City, San Francisco, San Diego and Los Angeles. “This historic legislation will change lives,” said Bianca Tylek, executive director of Worth Rises, which has been working with local advocates to slash prison phone costs. “It will keep food on the table for struggling families, children in contact with their parents, and our communities safer.”\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: President Joe Biden announced Saturday that Champ, the older of the family’s two dogs, had died “peacefully at home.” The German shepherd was 13. “He was our constant, cherished companion during the last 13 years and was adored by the entire Biden family,” Biden and first lady Jill Biden said in a statement posted to the president’s official Twitter account. The Bidens, who were spending the weekend at their home in Wilmington, got Champ from a breeder after Joe Biden was elected vice president in 2008. Champ was a fixture both at the vice president’s residence at the Naval Observatory and at the White House. In their statement, the Bidens said when Champ was young, “he was happiest chasing golf balls on the front lawn of the Naval Observatory,” and more recently he enjoyed “joining us as a comforting presence in meetings or sunning himself in the White House garden.” “In our most joyful moments and in our most grief-stricken days, he was there with us, sensitive to our every unspoken feeling and emotion,” the Bidens said. Champ’s passing leaves the Bidens with their younger German shepherd, Major, whom the family adopted from the Delaware Humane Society in 2018.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Residents getting their first dose of COVID-19 vaccine at select sites through the end of July will receive $51 gift cards and be entered for a chance to win free flights and other incentives, WUSA-TV reports. Mayor Muriel Bowser said Washington has reached 70% of adults having received at least one dose. While anyone can get a COVID-19 shot at district vaccination sites, the gift cards are only available to D.C. residents. Those between the ages of 12 and 17 must be accompanied by a guardian. Residents will receive the gift card after getting their shot. Additionally, Washingtonians getting their shots at Anacostia High School, Ron Brown High School or RISE Demonstration Center will be entered to win two round-trip American Airlines tickets to anywhere the airline flies, including international locations. Other prizes offered in a series of drawings starting Saturday include a new car, a year’s worth of groceries, and a one-year Metro pass. More information about the giveaways can be found at coronavirus.dc.gov/incentives. A full schedule of the days and hours of the current walk-up sites can be found at taketheshotdc.com.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: A federal judge on Friday ruled for the state in a lawsuit challenging a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention order making it difficult for cruise ships to resume sailing due to the coronavirus pandemic. U.S. District Judge Steven Merryday wrote in a 124-page decision that Florida would be harmed if the CDC order, which the state said effectively blocked most cruises, were to continue. The Tampa-based judge granted a preliminary injunction that prevents the CDC from enforcing the order pending further legal action on a broader lawsuit. “This order finds that Florida is highly likely to prevail on the merits of the claim that CDC’s conditional sailing order and the implementing orders exceed the authority delegated to the CDC,” Merryday wrote. Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody praised the decision in a statement. “Today’s ruling is a victory for the hardworking Floridians whose livelihoods depend on the cruise industry,” said Moody, a Republican. “The federal government does not, nor should it ever, have the authority to single out and lock down an entire industry indefinitely.” While the CDC could appeal, Merryday ordered both sides to return to mediation to attempt to work out a full solution – a previous attempt failed – and said the CDC could fashion a modification in which it would retain some public health authority.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Georgia’s secretary of state is making public a list of nearly 102,000 voters who will be removed from the rolls unless they act to preserve their registration. Republican Brad Raffensperger announced the list Friday, part of an every-other-year bid to remove voters who may have died or moved away. The state has about 7.8 million voters, and his office said the removals include about 67,000 voters who submitted a change-of-address form to the U.S. Postal Service, plus about 34,000 voters who had election mail returned. Voter purges in Georgia became a hot-button issue during the 2018 governor’s race between Democrat Stacey Abrams and Republican Brian Kemp. As secretary of state before being elected governor, Kemp oversaw aggressive voter purges during his tenure. More than 1.4 million voter registrations were canceled in Georgia between 2012 and 2018. In the current purge, election officials said, cancellation notices will be mailed, and those who respond within 40 days will have their registration switched back to active. Anyone who is removed could register again. On a monthly basis, the secretary of state been removing voters who were convicted of felonies or who died.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Civil rights activist the Rev. Al Sharpton is condemning the Honolulu Police Department for the fatal shooting of a Black man as various versions of what led to the death continue to emerge. “Lindani Myeni’s killing is yet another sensational racialization and criminalization of an innocent, unarmed black man at the hands of police not following the law and proper police procedures,” Sharpton said in a statement Thursday. Interim Honolulu Police Chief Rade Vanic said the police department is committed to public service, and these “are challenging times for police departments everywhere.” Sharpton weighed in on the April 14 shooting of Myeni after lawyers representing his widow in a wrongful-death lawsuit made public last week a doorbell video showing the 29-year-old arriving at a house, taking off his shoes and quickly leaving after his presence confused the occupants. Myeni repeatedly apologized to the couple. The lawsuit said he likely mistook the home for a temple next door that’s open to the public. Police responding to a 911 call shot him a short time later outside the house, with body camera footage showing an officer fired several gunshots before saying, “Police!” An attorney representing the homeowner and the tourists who were staying in the house said Myeni’s presence wasn’t as innocuous as lawyers for his wife portrayed.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The Northwestern Band of the Shoshone Nation is suing Gov. Brad Little and state wildlife officials in federal court, contending Idaho has wrongly denied the tribe hunting rights guaranteed by the 1868 Treaty of Fort Bridger. The lawsuit, filed in Idaho’s U.S. District Court last week, asks a judge to declare that the Northwestern Band is protected under the treaty. On its surface, the legal case could come down to whether one of the Native American leaders who signed the treaty was representing the Northwestern Band along with other bands of the Shoshone Nation and whether the Northwestern Band itself has remained a cohesive unit in the time since. But at the heart of the dispute is a dilemma faced by many Native American governments across the U.S. who sometimes find themselves at odds with game wardens, mining companies, water users or other groups as they try to preserve their use of the land they were promised in treaties signed centuries ago. Some Northwestern Band tribal members have faced criminal convictions after Idaho game wardens said they were hunting without tags. In 1997, two brothers were found guilty for hunting out of season in Idaho, though they had hunting tags issued by the Northwestern Band. Shane and Wayde Warner appealed their convictions, claiming rights under the Fort Bridger treaty.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The state is dangling millions of dollars in cash prizes and scholarships to encourage residents to get vaccinated, Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced Thursday. Illinois will offer $7 million in cash prizes and $3 million in scholarships through a new lottery open to all residents who have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Pritzker made the announcement at a community health center in Chicago’s Back of Yards neighborhood. Prizes will range from $100,000 to $1 million, and children can win a college savings plan worth $150,000. Names in Illinois’ vaccination database will be automatically eligible for the lottery. Participants will be required to have a shot by July 1. Weekly drawings will begin July 8. “ ‘All In For The Win’ is yet another way we’re working to ensure every single resident is protected from COVID-19,” Pritzker said. Nearly 67% of Illinois’ residents have received at least one vaccination dose, and a little over 50% have received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nIndiana\n\nBristol: A grain mill that opened more than 180 years ago in northern Indiana saw a sales boom during the pandemic after it opened a drive-thru for customers eager to buy freshly milled grains. The historic Bonneyville Mill was closed to visitors during the COVID-19 pandemic, like many Indiana businesses. But staff at the 1830s mill converted its original horse and wagon bay that farmers once used to deliver freshly harvested grain into a drive-thru for automobiles, which helped the mill along the Little Elkhart River rack up its most profitable year on record for grain sales, said Ronda DeCaire, director of the Elkhart County Parks system. “This was one of the few places in the Midwest where you could still buy flour and other freshly milled grains,” she told The Elkhart Truth. To prevent spreading the coronavirus, the mill’s staff used a pole with a bucket on its end to accept payments from drive-thru customers. Packages of flour and other milled grains were then handed to those customers through their car windows. “For the first time in over a hundred years, that wagon bay was busy again,” said Courtney Franke, the mill’s manager. DeCaire said the Bonneyville Mill is the oldest continuously operating grist mill in Indiana. It’s located just south of the Michigan border about 25 miles east of South Bend.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: A divided state Supreme Court on Friday banned police from searching people’s uncollected trash without a warrant, outlawing an investigative technique that had been used for decades. The court ruled 4-3 that officers commit an unreasonable search and seizure under the Iowa Constitution when they look for evidence of crimes in trash left for collection outside homes. The tactic amounts to an unconstitutional trespass on private property and violates citizens’ expectations of privacy, especially in cities that have ordinances barring residents from accessing others’ trash, Justice Christopher McDonald wrote for the majority. “We do not question the utility of warrantless trash grabs for the purposes of law enforcement, but the utility of warrantless activity is not the issue under our constitution,” he wrote, adding that “garbage contains intimate and private details of life.” The ruling overturned Iowa courts’ long adherence to a 1988 U.S. Supreme Court decision that found the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment does not prohibit the search of garbage outside one’s home. Just a small number of other states have limited trash searches by holding that their state constitutions provide greater protections than the U.S. Constitution against warrantless searches.\n\nKansas\n\nShawnee: A judge is beginning to evict tenants who are behind on rent in advance of the expiration of a federal moratorium that some experts predict will bring a tide of people being forced from homes nationwide. Johnson County Magistrate Judge Daniel Vokins said during a Zoom eviction hearing last week that he doesn’t think the moratorium, which was issued last year by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and expires at the end of the month, is enforceable. Eric Dunn, director of litigation for the National Housing Law Project, said he has heard of judges elsewhere – including in Florida, Georgia and North Carolina – ignoring the CDC moratorium but couldn’t say whether it’s been a widespread practice. The federal moratorium has kept many tenants owing back rent housed. More than 4 million people nationally say they fear being evicted or foreclosed upon in the months following its expiration, census data shows. Making matters worse, the tens of billions of dollars in federal emergency rental assistance that was supposed to solve the problem has not reached most tenants. “We thought 2021 was going to be better, and it is turning out to be just as bad,” said Denise Wall, 31, of the Kansas City suburb of Shawnee, who applied for rental aid in March but is still trying to find out whether she qualifies.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: With tourists flocking to distilleries, concerns about a pandemic hangover for the state’s world-famous bourbon industry are quickly evaporating. A $19 million tourist center that Heaven Hill Distillery opened just days ago in the heart of the state’s bourbon country is already overflowing, with reservations filling up quickly to learn about whiskey-making and sample its spirits, including its flagship Evan Williams whiskey. It’s a similar story for the numerous other distilleries in the region that last spring were temporarily closed to visitors because of the COVID-19 pandemic. More than a year later, the businesses are facing such overwhelming demand for tours that one industry official has started encouraging people to call ahead or check tour availability online before pulling off the highway. Starting last summer, some distilleries began allowing limited numbers of visitors in accordance with coronavirus restrictions. With capacity limits now lifted, the attractions are gearing up for a full resurgence of guests, many from outside Kentucky. “We saw it coming, but I don’t think we saw it coming this quick,” said Kentucky Distillers’ Association President Eric Gregory, who predicted bourbon tourism will quickly rebound to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The iconic bald cypress trees will be protected on state-owned property, after Gov. John Bel Edwards signed a new law banning the trees’ harvesting on more than 1million acres of state land. Rep. Neil Riser said he sponsored the bill – which won unanimous passage in the state House and Senate – to give nature time to reestablish dense stands of cypress that once covered vast tracts of land. “The cypress tree symbolizes Louisiana and the Mississippi Delta,” said Riser, R-Columbia. “I hope this new law will help people have a true appreciation of these trees’ majesty.” The new law doesn’t apply to cypress trees growing on privately owned land. Cypress trees grow throughout Louisiana’s swamps and can have lifespans of more than 1,000 years. The bald cypress was named the official Louisiana state tree in 1963. Riser said the forests will return on state-owned lands with protection, though it will take almost a century for the slow-growth trees to mature. “They will come back with Mother Nature as the manager and forester,” he said. In a twist, Riser was involved in harvesting the trees as a teenage logger in the 1970s when forests were being cleared for farmland. “I remember my dad telling me, ‘Take a look at this forest; one day it will all be gone,’ and it was,” he said.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The Legislature has approved an initial proposal that would allow four Native American tribes to build gambling businesses on their lands, in a reversal from years of resistance and laws that opposed Native ownership of casinos in the state. Breaking years of opposition against the bill, the House and Senate approved it with an overwhelming majority Thursday, the Portland Press Herald reports. Rep. Rena Newell, a nonvoting member of the Legislature who represents the Passamaquoddy Tribe, gave a speech following the approval of the bill, which she had pushed legislators to advance. The bill was only a small part of what the state could do for the tribes in Maine, she said. “Our ancestors watched from inside the bounds of our reservation as nontribal members got rich from cutting down our trees on our land, leaving us with little,” Newell said. The gambling legislation is one part of a series of changes the Legislature wants to amend the 1980 Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act. If these amendments are enacted, the revisions would restore some of the sovereignty that tribal leaders say they lost years ago, according to the Press Herald. Maine voters have rejected tribes’ past proposals but approved referendum questions that led to the establishment of two corporate-owned casinos.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state is awarding $10million to entertainment venues that struggled during the pandemic, including the Delmarva Shorebirds, the Maryland Theatre and the Maryland Symphony Orchestra, among others. The money will help stabilize businesses that had to shut down or drastically reduce their capacity as COVID-19 surged. As the state begins to emerge from the pandemic, the money will also help venues prepare for the busier fall arts season, said Nicholas Cohen, the executive director of Maryland Citizens for the Arts. “The arts season is a little quiet in the summer. It comes back in the fall,” Cohen said. “What this does is it helps float these venues until then, to really be like, ‘Here we are; we’re back; we’re maybe close to full capacity.’ ” The additional $10 million in state grants will go to more than 60 venues and organizations. For the nearly century-old Potomac Playmakers, the money will help maintain the nonprofit’s new home, which volunteer grant writer Greg Berezuk said the group moved into just before the pandemic shut everything down. “We got in there just before COVID. It’s a wonderful facility for an audience to enjoy a live performance, and we couldn’t use it,” Berezuk said. Fixed costs, such as the mortgage and utilities, had to be paid even without shows, he said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A union that represents about 800 city employees who have been working remotely during the pandemic has filed an unfair labor practices claim against acting Mayor Kim Janey’s administration for unilaterally ordering them back to the office. The Service Employees International Union Local 888 filed the complaint with the state Thursday, the Boston Herald reports. “The City refused in good faith to bargain about health and safety issues, family and childcare issues (especially single and low wage employees), and productivity issues (as the evidence will show that many of the job tasks have been accomplished at a higher rate due to the use of virtual meetings and technology),” the union wrote in the complaint. Janey this month ordered remote workers back in phases in late June and early July. “The city did not explain why the return to physical work locations was necessitated on the dates picked for reopening other than they have the right to do it,” the SEIU wrote. In response to the complaint, a city spokesperson said in a statement: “Mayor Janey remains committed to flexibility, as we fully restore vital services to Boston residents. We do not have further comment at this time on the pending litigation.”\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: People with a disability or a positive HIV test could not be discriminated against during the organ transplant process under legislation passed by the state House. Though the federal Americans with Disabilities Act bans discrimination on the basis of disability during the organ transplant process, organizations such as the National Down Syndrome Society say certain disability designations affect where a person sits on a transplant list, if they even get on a list at all. One bill passed by the House puts Michigan on the same path several states have taken, outlawing the denial of a transplant or lowering a person’s place on an organ waiting list because of their disability. However, no penalty for discrimination is listed in the bill. The other bill would allow patients with HIV to donate their organs to HIV-positive recipients. Both bills must be passed by the state Senate and signed by the governor in order to become law. Nationally, in 2013 the HIV Organ Policy Equity Act lifted a decades­long ban on transplanting HIV-infected organs into recipients. Current state law doesn’t allow Michigan residents to receive organs from individuals who test positive for HIV, so organs that test positive get shipped off to out-of-state recipients.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Staunch conservatives and advocates of legal marijuana have formed an unlikely alliance to pressure the Legislature to allow medical cannabis patients to own guns. The more than 35,000 patients in Minnesota’s program can’t own guns as the law now stands because the federal government classifies marijuana as an illicit drug, on par with heroin, and prohibits anyone who uses an “unlawful” substance from purchasing a firearm. So some gun-rights supporters and pro-legalization groups and legislators are lobbying during the special session to allow the Minnesota Department of Health to petition the federal government for an exemption. The change is being debated as part of the state’s public safety and health and human services budget bills. If their effort is successful, the Star Tribune of Minneapolis reports, Minnesota would be the first of 36 states that allow medical marijuana in some form to appeal directly to the federal government on behalf of its enrollees. The ranks of the state’s medical marijuana patients are expected to triple or quadruple over the next few years under a new law that liberalizes the state’s restrictive program to allow smokable marijuana instead of more expensive pills or liquid extracts.\n\nMississippi\n\nNatchez: The National Park Service on Friday accepted the city’s donation of land at a site that was once one of the largest slave markets in the United States. The federal agency eventually will develop exhibits that tell the history of Forks of the Road, where Black people were sold to work in slavery in Southern plantations from 1833 to 1863. The site in Natchez has had a sign and a small monument made of concrete and shackles. Officials have been working since 2005 on proposals to create a detailed memorial. More than 100 people watched Friday as the city donated nearly 3 acres to the park service in a ceremony that took place a day after President Joe Biden signed legislation to create a federal holiday for Juneteenth, which commemorates the end of slavery in the U.S. on the date when enslaved people in Texas got word of the Emancipation Proclamation. “As we commemorate the celebration of liberty, Juneteenth, and we gather to remember the system of enslavement and the oppression the proceeded this freedom, we acknowledge the tragic story of what happened here at Forks of the Road and within the city of Natchez,” said Lance Hatten, deputy regional director for the National Park Service. “When that truth is told and heard, the journey to healing and unity begins.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: Frustrated health officials in the area are imploring residents to get COVID-19 vaccinations as the faster-spreading delta variant of the coronavirus pushes case numbers and hospitalizations higher. Random testing of virus samples has determined that the delta variant, which is more infectious and potentially more deadly than other strains, has become dominant around Springfield and in much of southwest Missouri, said Kendra Findley, administrator of community health and epidemiology with Greene County. Administrators at the two largest hospitals serving the state’s southwestern region – Mercy and CoxHealth – are pleading with residents to get inoculated because COVID-19 patient loads are increasing at a rate they have not previously seen during the pandemic, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. In Greene County, 36% of the population has begun the vaccination process. In most surrounding counties, the figure is below 30%. Erik Frederick, chief administrative officer at Mercy Hospital Springfield, said hospitalizations averaged in the teens a month ago but reached 72 by Thursday. CoxHealth has seen similar numbers. Many of the new patients are young, healthy adults and pregnant women, he said. The delta variant “has become prevalent” across Missouri, state health officials said last week.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: Wildlife officials are seeking feedback on a proposal to expand fishing restrictions to protect declining brown trout populations. Biologists with Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks and the U.S. Geological Survey have tracked declining numbers of juvenile brown trout in southwest Montana rivers, including the Big Hole, Ruby, Boulder, Beaverhead, upper Yellowstone and upper Stillwater rivers, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports. Eric Roberts, fish management bureau chief with Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, said the trend is concerning because low numbers of younger fish indicate that older fish are not being replaced. Biologists are now gathering public comments on the proposed changes, which include seasonal fishing closures from September to May, catch-and-release requirements, and evening fishing restrictions from 2 p.m. to midnight daily. The changes could also apply to the rivers’ tributaries. Residents can submit comment online, by mail or by attending public meetings Tuesday and Wednesday. Department officials will then develop proposals to be considered in August. Roberts attributed the trout population decline, in part, to changing water temperatures and habitat alterations. He said there are long-term plans in place to address stream flows and enhance habitat.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Amtrak trains are once again rumbling through the state capital on a daily basis. The California Zephyr, which runs from Chicago to San Francisco, has resumed its pre-pandemic schedule of one eastbound and one westbound train stopping in Lincoln in the early hours of each day. ProRail Nebraska, a group of citizens that supports the continuation of passenger train service in the state, met the westbound train at the Lincoln Amtrak station on the first day of resumed daily service, May 24. According to ProRail’s District 1 director, Richard Schmeling, ProRail opposed the pause in daily service, lobbying Nebraska’s federal representatives to support Amtrak through the pandemic. Amtrak spokesman Marc Magliari said daily service was halted on many routes after the Senate declined to pass funding for the service during the pandemic. Now that legislation providing the funding has been passed and signed by the president, he said, Amtrak has resumed service at full capacity. “It enables us to be a better service in the 500 places we serve,” he told the Lincoln Journal Star. It also enabled Amtrak to recall more than 2,000 workers nationally that it put on furlough while service was decreased, Magliari said, including conductors, engineers and service people.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A new kind of jackpot is coming to the Silver State, Gov. Steve Sisolak said Thursday, but only for residents who’ve gotten a COVID-19 shot. The Democratic governor announced a broad effort to encourage reluctant or forgetful residents to get shots, adding his state to a growing list offering unconventional incentives to revive flatlining vaccination programs amid waning demand. Sisolak didn’t call it a lottery, instead terming the “Vax Nevada Days” prize program a raffle because entrants aren’t paying to participate, and vaccines are free. The program makes all residents who have received at least one dose of vaccine since December – along with military members and their dependents – automatically eligible to receive part of $5 million in prize money. Winners will be announced every Thursday for eight weeks beginning July 8. Students ages 12 to 17 can get college tuition credits worth $5,000 to $50,000. People 18 and up are eligible for prizes from $1,000 to $250,000. Among almost 2,000 winners, a $1 million grand prize winner will be announced Aug. 26. “If people are looking for reasons not to get vaccinated, they’re going to come up with one. I’m trying to give people 5 million reasons to get vaccinated,” Sisolak said, referencing the total cash prizes being offered.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHanover: Dartmouth College is providing up to $1 million to encourage students to move off campus to ease a housing crunch this fall. Students can opt to have their names included in a one-time lottery for $5,000 to encourage as many as 200 returning students to live off campus, Mike Wooten, associate dean of residential life, said in an email to students who are on a housing waitlist. Dartmouth is shifting some of its larger doubles to triples and converting lounges to student rooms where possible, but that isn’t enough to alleviate the housing crunch, Wooten said in the email. “As expected, demand has exceeded our capacity,” he wrote. “Although this has been the case in prior years, interest in living on campus has understandably surged following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions.” Some students said the school should be trying harder to house them – or at least better communicate why it can’t. “It hasn’t been made clear of what actions they’ve taken to mitigate this other than the lottery,” David Millman, a sophomore, told WMUR-TV.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nPaterson: Landlords won’t be able to inquire about potential renters’ criminal histories under a new law Gov. Phil Murphy signed Friday. The Democratic governor signed the Fair Chance in Housing Act on what was the state’s first official celebration of Juneteenth as a paid holiday for state workers. “We must commit to both remembering the past and continuing to take action to ensure communities of color, especially Black Americans, achieve the full equity they deserve,” Murphy said in a statement. He also signed legislation making the third Friday in June a state holiday. June 19 – or Juneteenth – commemorates when word reached enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, that slavery had been abolished. President Joe Biden signed similar nationwide legislation Thursday. The new housing measure aims to eliminate housing instability that contributes to recidivism, according to the governor. The new law won’t apply in cases where federal law permits landlords to ask about certain criminal convictions.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said Friday that all remaining pandemic-related public health restrictions on commercial and day-to-day activity in the state will be lifted July 1, clearing the way for restaurants and other venues to operate without any capacity limits and for cities to plan in-person Fourth of July celebrations and other summer festivals. The Democratic governor made the declaration as state health officials continued to crunch the vaccination numbers following a push that included a multimillion-dollar sweepstakes, other cash incentives and offers that included free child care for those who needed it in order to get their shot. Lujan Grisham wanted at least 60% of residents 16 and up to be vaccinated two weeks ahead of the reopening. Her office said that vaccinations stood at 59.4% on Thursday but that health officials were waiting for more federal data to come in that would push the state closer to its goal. Still, the governor said in a statement that she had hoped the numbers would be higher by now. “The variants across the globe and in the U.S. present very serious risks to unvaccinated people, even young people,” she said. “We all, each of us, have the power to stop the serious illnesses and deaths: Get your shot. It’s safe. It works. It’s that simple.”\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Fifteen months after shuttering for the pandemic, Radio City Music Hall reopened its doors Saturday for the Tribeca Festival premiere of a new Dave Chappelle documentary for a full-capacity, fully vaccinated audience. The debut of “Dave Chappelle: This Time This Place,” which chronicles Chappelle’s pandemic stand-up series held in rural Ohio cornfields, marked the first time the hallowed hall was packed since closing in March 2020. The premiere Saturday evening, the closing night gala for the 20th Tribeca Festival, was seen as a symbolic reawakening of the arts in New York, where many of the world’s most famous stages – Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, Broadway theaters – remain dark. On Sunday, Madison Square Garden hosted its first full-capacity concert with the Foo Fighters. “Springsteen on Broadway” is set to resume performances June 26. After the Tribeca screening, Chappelle took the stage and paused for a moment to apologize for those who lost someone during the pandemic before signaling a note of revival. “But, man, let’s get up,” he said, before introducing a New York feast of hip-hop acts who performed according to their native borough, including Q-Tip, Talib Kweli, Fat Joe, A$AP Ferg, Redman, Ghostface Killah and De La Soul.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed gun-rights legislation Friday that would allow parishioners at more churches to be armed, marking the second year in a row that he’s blocked the idea. The legislation affirms that people going to religious services at a location where private schools or some charter schools also meet can carry handguns in full view or under clothing if they have a concealed weapons permit. There would be other limits. The Democratic governor said the measure, which cleared the Legislature this month, would endanger educators and children. State law otherwise prohibits guns on educational property for nearly everyone. “For the safety of students and teachers, North Carolina should keep guns off school grounds,” Cooper wrote in his veto message. The bill’s supporters contend these houses of worship where K-12 schools also are located are at a security disadvantage for their congregants compared to stand-alone churches. There are no such blanket prohibitions in these churches on carrying a pistol, provided the person has a purchase permit or concealed weapons permit. The bill also contains another provision that allows additional law enforcement employees – such as a civilian front desk worker at a police station – to carry a concealed weapon on the job if the police chief or sheriff allows.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State regulators have again extended a deadline for Meridian Energy Group to begin construction on its $1 billion oil refinery near Theodore Roosevelt National Park or risk losing its permit. Meridian’s permit from the state Department of Environmental Quality was set to expire June 12 unless construction had begun on the Davis Refinery. Earlier this month the company asked for an extension on that deadline, citing delays related to the coronavirus pandemic and litigation. Recent lawsuits against Meridian have called into question the company’s ability to pay workers, the Bismarck Tribune reports. Regulators granted an extension until Sept. 12 to start construction, a month short of what Meridian had requested. “The reasons seemed to make sense, and we thought, ‘We’ll give you guys the summer to hopefully work out your stuff and then start construction,’ ” state Environmental Engineer David Stroh said. “We requested an update from them in a little over a month so we could get a better feel for how things are progressing out there, knowing there’s a lot of attention to this facility.” Refinery opponents are concerned in part about its proximity to the national park. The North Dakota Supreme Court issued a pair of rulings last year clearing the way for the refinery to move forward.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: Some casinos and racinos could be left with losing tickets if the state Senate’s sports betting legislation giving professional teams priority for obtaining brick-and mortar sports book licenses is ultimately enacted. A bill approved Wednesday by the Senate and sent to the House for consideration assigns the 30 total sports books to counties based on population. If professional sports teams in Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati all decided to apply for licenses, casinos and racinos in Cuyahoga, Franklin and Hamilton counties would be shut out at the sports betting window of opportunity in the Senate’s bill. Cuyahoga County, which includes Cleveland, for example, has three professional sports teams as well as a downtown casino and a racino in the suburbs. Dan Reinhard, a senior vice president for the JACK Cleveland casino and a spokesperson for the casino and racino group Get Gaming Right Ohio, said Friday that the Senate bill “disrespects” casino employees. “An artificial cap that locks out gaming companies in the biggest, most populous counties doesn’t make a lot of sense,” he said. “We know how to do this. This is the business we’re in. We’re going to work with all parties to make sure this cap is dealt with.” The original Senate bill introduced in May excluded casinos and racinos altogether.\n\nOklahoma\n\nPryor: Electric vehicle company Canoo announced Thursday it has selected Pryor for its U.S. manufacturing facility, which is expected to employ 2,000 people. The Los Angeles-based company plans to build its factory on a 400-acre campus at the MidAmerica Industrial Park near Tulsa. It will include a paint and body shop, along with a general assembly plant, and is targeted to open in 2023. “Oklahoma has always been a pioneer in the energy industry, and this partnership with Canoo shows that our state is an innovation leader in electric vehicle technology,” Gov. Kevin Stitt said in a statement. “We are thrilled to partner with Canoo and Chairman and CEO Tony Aquila to provide high-paying jobs for Oklahomans and position America as the global leader for vehicle manufacturing for decades to come.” Aquila cited Oklahoma’s strategic location and business-friendly policies as reasons Oklahoma was selected. Tulsa was in the running last year for a Tesla electric vehicle manufacturing facility that ultimately went to Austin, Texas.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A second Republican in the state Senate is facing a recall effort after showing up to oppose a gun-control bill earlier this year. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports a Mount Vernon resident named Patrick Kopke-Hales has initiated a petition process that, if successful, could force a recall election against state Sen. Lynn Findley, R-Vale. Findley was one of six Republicans to attend a March 25 floor session, granting quorum to supermajority Democrats against the wishes of many gun-rights supporters. Though Findley spoke forcefully against Senate Bill 554 that day, Democrats passed the proposal to create new gun storage laws, ban guns in the Capitol and Portland International Airport, and allow Oregon schools and universities to implement their own bans. Senate Majority Leader Fred Girod is also facing a prospective recall because of SB 554’s passage, reflecting increasing pressure on Republicans to flee the Capitol over controversial bills after doing so to block climate change legislation in 2019 and 2020. The gun-control bill is currently the subject of a referendum effort that could give voters a final say on the law in November 2022. Findley said in a statement that “fighting for conservative values in Salem is my priority, not playing political games.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Consuewella Dotson Africa, a longtime member of the Black organization MOVE and mother of two children killed in the 1985 bombing of the group’s home, has died at age 67. A member of the MOVE family, Janine Africa, said Consuewella Africa had tested positive for the coronavirus when she went to a hospital around the beginning of the month but had largely recovered when doctors said last week that she was not getting enough oxygen. “Through the stress with everything that was happening, her body just could not fight to get the air in her lungs because she was too burnt out and tore down from the stress,” Janine Africa said. Africa’s death follows painful revelations in the past few months about the treatment of the remains of her two daughters who were killed in the police bombing of the organization’s Philadelphia home, where 11 members – including five children – were killed, and more than 60 homes were burnt to the ground. Her daughters, 14-year-old Katricia “Tree” and 12-year-old Zanetta “Netta,” died in the bombing while Consuewella Africa was in prison serving a 16-year-sentence for simple assault related to the city’s 1978 attempt to evict the group during which a police officer was killed. Consuewella Africa held the title “Minister of Confrontation” for MOVE, which identifies as both a family and an organization.\n\nRhode Island\n\nBristol: A town that was a center of the trans-Atlantic slave trade commemorated Juneteenth by unveiling a new marker recognizing its role in slavery. Officials on Saturday placed the first of two planned slavery markers in town at the Linden Place Museum, a mansion built in the 1800s by General George DeWolf, a prominent merchant and slave trader. Another medallion will be placed later this month at DeWolf Tavern. The markers are being installed at sites around the state connected to the trans-Atlantic slave trade by the Rhode Island Slave History Medallion project. They’ve been placed at Smith’s Castle in North Kingstown, Bowen’s Wharf in Newport, and Patriot’s Park in Portsmouth, according to organizers. Students and faculty from Roger Williams University planned to discuss their original research into the town’s slavery legacy. University officials say the work includes new information about the town’s lesser-known slave-trading families, as well as stories of enslaved Africans who lived and worked in town, such as Bristol Finney, a 19-year-old enslaved African who ran away from his owners. Saturday’s ceremony featured music and dance from a local African performance group, and the museum offered tours.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nDarlington: Historians are trying to shed light on five forgotten cemeteries in the state’s Pee Dee region. WMBF-TV reports the Darlington County Historical Commission and Clemson Professor Jim Frederick located the five graveyards near Dargan’s Pond on current Clemson property. The experts identified two African American cemeteries, two Native American burial grounds and a graveyard that dates back to the Revolutionary War. One of the sites is the cemetery of Cpt. William Standard, who was deeded land in Darlington County for his heroic service during the Revolutionary War. The pair of Native American burial grounds could date back more than 500 years. And one of the African American cemeteries is linked to one of the county’s oldest African American church congregations, the historians said. It started shortly after emancipation and was connected to the Pleasant Grove Baptist Church, where it was active until the church moved locations in the 1950s. “It relates to an African American congregation that is one of the oldest congregations in Darlington County,” he said. “They lost their connection in a very unique way, and I believe there’s three factors to that.” The historians say they are now working to identify individuals in the old church cemetery.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The union representing workers at a Smithfield Foods plant said Friday that its members have voted in favor of a new contract. Union leaders say the deal sends a message to the meatpacking industry that companies need to recognize the sacrifices its employees made during the coronavirus pandemic. The Smithfield plant was the nation’s most active hot spot for COVID-19 cases in the early weeks of the pandemic. Nearly 1,300 workers at the Sioux Falls pork processing plant tested positive for the virus, and four workers died. B.J. Motley, president of the Union Food and Commercial Workers Local 304A, said in a statement that the new contract includes fair pay, benefits and safety protections that workers have earned and deserve. “Ensuring these jobs continue to provide the good pay and benefits working families need is the best way for us to honor our country’s essential workers,” Motley said. The contract includes a base rate of $18.75 an hour, up from $17, and a $520 bonus. The union had voted earlier this month to authorize a strike after Motley said that Smithfield wanted the workers to pay more for health care and refused to increase pay to comparable rates of other meatpacking plants in the region.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A development that organizers say “is poised to become the second-largest Black-owned film studio in the United States” moved one step closer to fruition this month when the Land Use Control Board approved the zoning adjustments necessary to build BLP Film Studios, an 85-acre production facility in the Whitehaven neighborhood. “Our goal is to make Memphis the international epicenter for producing films and projects led by Black and brown creators on the production and directing side of those projects,” said Jason A. Farmer, 52, a former Marine and business executive who for the past few several years has been working to launch BLP, which he said would be eclipsed only by Tyler Perry’s facilities in Atlanta. Farmer said he believes BLP – the name is an acronym for Black Lens Productions – will attract investors as film and TV companies work to address the “diversity, equality and inclusion” concerns that have sparked debate within the entertainment industry. “Black and brown consumers are becoming more savvy,” he said, “and we find ourselves with none of the legacy production companies” that produce most of the high-profile content that brings customers to move theaters, cable channels and streaming service. He said groundbreaking is scheduled to begin in the fall.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Gov. Greg Abbott followed through on a threat Friday and vetoed the new state budget’s line item providing for legislative staff pay. The Republican governor had threatened the veto after a walkout by House Democrats in the final hours of the regular legislative session. The walkout denied a House quorum to vote on controversial voting restrictions that Abbott had prioritized. “Texans don’t run from a legislative fight, and they don’t walk away from unfinished business,” Abbott said in Friday’s veto message. “Funding should not be provided for those who quit their job early, leaving their state with unfinished business and exposing taxpayers to higher costs for an additional legislative session.” However, a summer special session already was expected so that the Legislature can redraw district lines for congressional, legislative and other government offices. The budget is to take effect Sept. 1. Abbott is expected to push the voting-restrictions bill again during the summer special session. Rep. Chris Turner, who chairs the House Democratic Caucus, engineered the walkout. In a statement Friday, he called Abbott’s veto “tyrannical” and the latest indication the Republican governor “is out of control.” The caucus is considering all of its options, Turner said, “including immediate legal options.”\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Home prices around the capital city jumped a staggering 31% over the past year in the latest sign of Utah’s housing crisis. Wasatch Front real estate agents have decried the dire lack of homes on the market as prices climb and sales bog down, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. Salt Lake County’s median price on a single-family home inched past the eye-catching $500,000 mark sometime in March and then reached $535,000 last month, new data shows. Average new home listings now draw 30 to 40 offers and sell in five days, the Salt Lake Board of Realtors said. The group said more construction is desperately needed to fill the gap. Nationwide, there’s a housing deficit of roughly 5.5 million units, according to an industry study that calls for ramping up the rate of U.S. homebuilding to add 2 million homes yearly over the next decade, compared with last year’s 1.3 million units built. In Utah, the shortfall is between 45,000 and 50,000 single-family homes, apartments and other housing types, with an especially serious need for more affordable homes accessible to residents making average wages.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The University of Vermont Food Systems Research Center is getting $11 million in federal funding to support its work researching the regional food system, from production agriculture to food security, UVM and U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy announced Friday. The center is a collaboration between the university and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Research Service, officials said. Vermonters turned to their local farms for food security when the pandemic struck, Leahy said in a statement. “Farms are an economic driver for our rural communities and local food is a defining feature of Vermont,” Leahy said. “We must continue to cultivate our food systems so our state can thrive and weather future emergencies.” USDA scientists are now being picked to work on campus with university researchers. “This is the first and only ARS research unit designed specifically to study diversified food systems and the smaller farms that contribute to those systems,” said UVM College of Agriculture and Life Sciences Dean Leslie Parise. “We are proud to be leading this work at UVM and believe there is much the rest of the world can learn from the successful small- and medium-sized farms that characterize Vermont agriculture.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: After twists and turns on the road to legalizing simple possession of marijuana, advocacy groups have been flooded with calls from people trying to understand exactly what will be allowed under state law as of July 1. Legislators initially voted in February to legalize possession of up to an ounce of cannabis for adult recreational use – but not until 2024, when retail sales would begin. An outcry ensued over the three-year wait before ending pot possession penalties, so in April the Legislature voted to move up legalization to this July 1. Adding to the confusion: Lawmakers included a “reenactment clause,” which means the General Assembly will have to vote again next year on major portions of the law, mainly to establish a regulatory framework for the legal pot marketplace. The process has resulted in some contradictions that may not get resolved until years after legalization begins. Sen. Adam Ebbin, one of the lead sponsors, said people “still need to be careful.” Possession of up to one ounce with no intent to distribute will become legal for those 21 and older. Adults will also be allowed to grow up to four plants per household. But not much else will change. Buying and selling marijuana will remain illegal until 2024, when retail sales are expected to begin. Smoking marijuana in public also remains against the law.\n\nWashington\n\nMount Vernon: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed listing a bird found in the North Cascades as threatened under the Endangered Species Act due to the likelihood that climate change will shrink its high-elevation habitat throughout the state. The Mount Rainier white-tailed ptarmigan is found in the Cascade Mountains from southern British Columbia to southern Washington, the Skagit Valley Herald reports. It is one of few animals that spend their entire lives on mountaintops. White-tailed ptarmigans move seasonally between snow-covered habitat and summer alpine meadows. As temperatures continue to warm, the region’s snowpack will decline. Alpine meadows may also be at risk as conditions move tree lines to higher elevations. “As the iconic alpine meadows of Washington diminish with climate change, this alpine bird … will be pushed out of the home it is specially adapted to,” U.S. Fish and Wildlife spokesperson Andrew LaValle said. The state Department of Fish & Wildlife lists the Mount Rainier white-tailed ptarmigan as a species of greatest concern and as highly vulnerable to climate change. The Fish and Wildlife Service proposal includes rules to protect the birds from types of intentional and unintentional harm and says a species recovery plan will be written after the listing becomes official.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice declared an end to the state’s indoor mask requirement Sunday as a $1 million winner was revealed in a drawing for residents who have received COVID-19 vaccines. Karen Foley of Mineral Wells won the top prize announced on a sweltering Father’s Day at the Capitol Complex during a celebration of the state’s 158th birthday. “Now we’re going to probably change somebody’s life in lots of ways,” Justice said before Foley’s name was announced. Prizes in separate drawings also held Sunday included custom pickup trucks, state park weekend trips, lifetime hunting and fishing licenses, and hunting rifles and shotguns. Two younger vaccinated residents won college scholarships, including tuition, room and board, and books. Justice announced a series of random drawings May 27. The deadline for Sunday’s drawing was last Wednesday, and the winners were drawn Thursday. More than 246,000 West Virginians had registered. The names of entrants who don’t win will be carried over week to week. Residents can still sign up for six other drawings, which will be held on Wednesdays from June 30 to Aug. 4. The final drawing will include a $1.588 million grand prize and a $588,000 second prize.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson joined in a Juneteenth Day celebration in his home state only to see his speech drowned out by a chorus of boos. Johnson made an appearance Saturday at a Republican Party booth in Milwaukee, where he drew a growing crowd once people recognized him. Some people swore at him and said: “We don’t want you here.” Last year Johnson blocked legislation to make Juneteenth a national holiday. Last week he relented while saying that “it still seems strange” that taxpayers should fund time off for federal employees to celebrate the end of slavery. The bill was quickly passed and signed by President Joe Biden. When asked what he thought of the boos Saturday, Johnson said: “This is unusual for Wisconsin. Most people in Wisconsin say, ‘You are in our prayers; we are praying for you.’ … But you got some people here that are just sort of nasty at some points.” One attendee, Robert Agnew, said he thought the reason for the taunting was that “Ron Johnson’s politics are not for us.”\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Supporters of two new marijuana ballot petitions say they’re optimistic about getting pot questions before voters next year, especially with growing support from conservatives in the deep-red state. Even so, they face daunting odds because of the difficulty of getting such initiatives on the ballot and failing to do so four years ago. The Legislature legalized hemp and hemp oil in 2019, but Wyoming is among a dwindling number of states that haven’t approved marijuana in some form. Thirty-six states now allow medical marijuana, and 17 have approved recreational marijuana, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. This time around, some Republicans are finding common cause with Democrats and others on marijuana. “It’s well past due,” state Rep. Mark Baker said. “If they’re successful in reaching the ballot and putting the question to the people, I do think it is going to be successful.” Baker, R-Green River, stepped down as director of the state chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws after being elected last year. Other outspoken supporters include a state representative who last year became the first Libertarian Party candidate elected to a U.S. statehouse in 20 years. One petition would seek to legalize marijuana for medical use. The other would decriminalize it.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/01/27/protest-prisons-skeleton-board-monarch-slump-news-around-states/41072781/", "title": "Protest for prisons, skeleton on board: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: The city will pay a $25,000 fine for obstructing the view of a Confederate monument, a judge ordered last week under the direction of the state Supreme Court. Circuit Judge Marshell Jackson Hatcher imposed the fine that had been ordered by the state’s high court. Justices in November ruled that Birmingham violated a state law protecting historic monuments and directed the circuit judge to enter an order declaring that Birmingham violated the 2017 Alabama Memorial Preservation Act and to fine the city $25,000. Alabama sued Birmingham in 2017 after municipal officials in the majority-black city erected a wooden box obscuring the inscriptions on a 52-foot-tall obelisk honoring Confederate veterans. The 2017 Alabama Memorial Preservation Act prohibits relocating, removing, altering or renaming public buildings, streets and memorials that have been standing for more than 40 years.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The Legislature failed to override more than $70 million in vetoes dealing with school construction projects and the state ferry system. Gov. Mike Dunleavy issued the vetoes last summer, after lawmakers had adjourned. The veto override session was announced late Thursday, with no clear indication of sufficient support. House Speaker Bryce Edgmon, an independent from Dillingham, said in a statement that Alaskans “deserve to know where their elected officials stand.” House Minority Leader Lance Pruitt, in response, said the vote “was about nothing more than creating material to use against other members in the next election cycle.” Lawmakers attempted to override a $5 million veto of funds for the ferry system and vetoes of funds for school debt reimbursement to municipalities and a construction fund for rural schools. The issues were considered as part of one vote.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A 62-year-old man was cited last week after trying to disguise a fake skeleton as a passenger just to use the HOV lane. The Arizona Department of Public Safety says a trooper pulled over the man Thursday after noticing he had placed a fake skeleton in the passenger’s front seat. The skeleton was sitting upright, wearing a hat and tied to the front seat. Department spokesman Raul Garcia said troopers cite about 7,000 HOV lane violators every year. Last April, a man was pulled over after driving in the HOV lane with a mannequin wearing a sweatshirt, baseball cap and sunglasses.\n\nArkansas\n\nSalem: Thieves have stolen the old school bell that hung at the top of the steps at the historic Old Main schoolhouse. Friends of Old Main Board of Directors member Ron Plumlee recently discovered the bell was missing while checking on maintenance at the old schoolhouse. The bolts holding the bell in place were apparently sawed off, Plumlee said. The theft is suspected to have required at least two people because of the bell’s size and weight, he said. The bell has been at the top of the steps for at least 70 years. The school was built in 1930 and is now operated by Friends of Old Main as a nonprofit activity center. The bell was brass with an inscription around the top and has many marks from ringing over the years. Anyone with information that might lead to the recovery of the bell or the apprehension of those responsible is asked to contact the Fulton County Sheriff’s Office at (870) 895-2601.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The western monarch butterfly population wintering along the state’s coast remains critically low for the second year in a row, according to an environmental group. The count of the orange-and-black insects by the Xerces Society, a nonprofit environmental organization that focuses on the conservation of invertebrates, recorded about 29,000 butterflies in its annual survey. That’s not much different from last year’s tally, when an all-time-low 27,000 monarchs were counted. By comparison, about 4.5 million monarch butterflies wintered in forested groves along the California coast in the 1980s. Scientists say the butterflies are at critically low levels in the western United States due to the destruction of their milkweed habitat along their migratory route as housing expands into their territory and use of pesticides and herbicides increases. Researchers also have noted the effect of climate change.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A research center at Colorado State University dedicated to studying the chemical compounds in hemp is expected to open this spring, school officials said Thursday. The announcement comes after the university received a $1.5 million donation from a Golden-based company that makes products out of CBD, a popular cannabis compound with unproven health claims. The money would be used to fund research, cover operating costs and purchase equipment, university officials said. The facility would allow faculty and undergraduate and graduate students to study the formulation of cannabinoids, separation efficiencies, efficacy testing and more, The Denver Post reports. Researchers at the facility would work in partnership with Panacea Life Sciences, a company founded by university alumna Leslie Buttorff that manufactures CBD products for people and pets.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: The state Department of Motor Vehicles will soon allow a nonbinary gender designation on driver’s licenses. Starting Monday, three gender options will be available for state-issued license and identification cards – male, female and nonbinary, denoted by the letter X, according to the New Haven Register. “We want to be sure that we’re fair for everyone, to respect people’s gender identity,” Deputy Commissioner Tony Guerrera said. Connecticut will be one of 12 states that allow nonbinary gender identification on driver’s licenses, he said. The move was one of the department’s top priorities when Guerrera and Commissioner Sibongile Magubane were appointed, he said. State Sen. Matt Lesser said Saturday that it would be important for people who identify as nonbinary and revenue-neutral for everyone else.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: The public needs to keep a safe distance from the seals that will be present along beaches and other waterways through April, according to the state’s official marine mammal and sea turtle stranding response organization. The MERR Institute recommends the public stay at least 150 feet from seals and always keep pets on a leash and at a safe distance because seals are wild animals that can bite if they feel threatened. It is common at this time of the year to see seals on area beaches, docks and other locations where they can rest, the Delaware State News reports. Four species of seals may visit Delaware. Oftentimes these animals are healthy, but at other times they may be suffering from illness or injury and in need of veterinary care, officials said. Anyone who encounters a seal is asked to contact MERR as soon as possible at (302) 228-5029. More information can be found on MERR’s website.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The public is invited to the coronation ceremony for the newly crowned Miss Black D.C. USA this Saturday, WUSA-TV reports. The pageant’s new titleholder, Amini Bonane, is a Harvard graduate student who says one of the reasons she competed for the crown was to expand her platform on mentoring and efforts to find missing women of color. She has a campaign called Find My Sister that’s dedicated to raising awareness. Her coronation ceremony will be coupled with a charity fundraiser for the cause. According to Black and Missing in America Inc., nearly 40% of missing people are persons of color. Bonane’s coronation ceremony and charity fundraiser will be held Saturday from 7:30 to 10 p.m. Mayor Muriel Bowser and other D.C. government officials and professionals are expected to attend the evening of networking, performances and philanthropy.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: Eighty Burmese pythons were caught during a 10-day pre-Super Bowl hunt, designed to raise awareness about the invasive species decimating the Everglades. Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission announced Saturday that 80 pythons were caught during the competition. Pro grand prize winner Mike Kimmel won an ATV for capturing eight pythons, and rookie grand prize winner Kristian Hernandez removed six pythons and also won an ATV. Pro grand prize winner Tom Rahill won $2,000 for bagging a 62-pound python. Several other cash prizes were also awarded. The game’s organizing committee worked with Florida to promote the Python Bowl. The pythons, which can grow to 20 feet, are descended from pets released starting five decades ago. Wildlife officials estimate the population may exceed 100,000. The big serpents have been devouring native mammal and bird populations.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens: Hundreds of people have shown their support for an armless street artist whose artwork, supplies and donation box were stolen near the University of Georgia. Nearly $42,000 had been raised online as of late Sunday for Michael Davenport, who is known in Athens for sketching the university’s bulldog mascot. He holds a pen in his mouth to create his art because he lost his arms as a child. Davenport, 53, said his belongings were stolen Jan. 15 when he took a break to use the restroom at a nearby business. Athens-Clarke police said detectives were looking to identify the suspect, seen on surveillance video in what appears to be a gold-colored minivan. Stephen Frazier, the general manager at Budget Host Inn in Athens, said he set up the online fundraising account in Davenport’s name. Davenport told WAGA-TV he plans to use the money for a truck to carry his supplies and for medical treatment for his leg, injured in an attack last year.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The Honolulu Medical Examiner’s Office has identified the remains of two people found in a burnt-out home where a man allegedly shot and killed two Honolulu police officers and attacked a neighbor before setting the house ablaze last weekend. Officials on Friday released a statement identifying the homeowner, Lois Ann Cain, 77, as one of the two people found in the house that was destroyed by fire in an upscale neighborhood near Waikiki Beach. A tenant, Jaroslav “Jerry” Hanel, is accused of shooting police who were responding to the home after he allegedly attacked and stabbed a woman who also lived in the house. Cain was in the process of evicting Hanel when the violence erupted Sunday. The medical examiner also identified the second set of remains but withheld a name pending notification of next of kin.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The number of residents who have signed up for Medicaid under the state’s voter-approved expanded coverage has passed 60,000. The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare posted updated numbers Thursday. The agency estimates 91,000 residents meet requirements. Coverage started Jan. 1, but enrollment is year-round. Those who sign up for Medicaid will be covered for doctor visits that occurred earlier in the same month. Voters authorized Medicaid expansion in 2018 with an initiative that passed with 61% of the vote after years of inaction by state lawmakers. But legislators in 2019 added restrictions requiring five waivers from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Waivers are required when states want to deviate from Medicaid rules. Federal officials have yet to approve any of Idaho’s requested waivers.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Marijuana was stolen last week from a box placed at Chicago’s Midway International Airport for travelers who dispose of their marijuana before they board a plane, police said Friday. The “marijuana amnesty boxes” were placed at Midway and O’Hare International Airport after it became legal this year to possess marijuana in Illinois. The boxes, owned by the Department of Aviation and serviced by the police, were installed so air travelers can be in compliance with federal law as well as the local laws at their destination. Police officers regularly empty the boxes, file a report for the items inside and dispose of any surrendered marijuana. “Tampering with them, or attempting to remove anything placed inside, is a crime,” said Chicago police spokesman Antony Gugliemi, who added that an investigation is underway.\n\nIndiana\n\nTaswell: The state’s newest nature preserve features dramatic limestone outcrops and a cave inhabited by rare animals adapted to life in total darkness. The Natural Resources Commission recently approved the creation of the Patoka Hills Nature Preserve, which spans nearly 27 acres in southern Indiana’s Crawford County. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources said the new preserve contains one of Indiana’s finest paleontological sites in a small cave that the agency calls “highly significant.” Staff from the Indiana State Museum have been excavating inside that cave since 1987, and their discoveries have shed light on Indiana’s past climate, plants and animals during the latter part of the last ice age. The DNR said the cave is also home to a springtail insect and a cave millipede, both of which lack eyes and pigmentation and are rare worldwide.\n\nIowa\n\nCouncil Bluffs: Leaders in western Iowa say lingering floodwaters and damage from last year’s Missouri River flooding have led them to again cancel Loessfest. The Council Bluffs City Council said Friday in a news release that restoration work on Tom Hanafan River’s Edge Park, which connects to neighboring Omaha, Nebraska, via the Bob Kerrey Pedestrian Bridge, can’t begin until after the spring thaw. There isn’t enough time between the thaw and the Memorial Day weekend event to get the work done, the council said. Loessfest was established in 2013 and has become the community’s traditional kick-off to summer. Last year, Loessfest was initially postponed to Labor Day weekend, then canceled altogether due to ongoing flooding. Other locations were considered before canceling this year’s festival, officials said. But it was ultimately decided that a critical component of Loessfest was its easy proximity to Omaha.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Local police are looking into using genetic genealogy databases to help solve cold murder and rape cases. Capt. Jeff Weible said the department isn’t ready to decide whether it will use the technique, which has revolutionized cold-case investigations across the U.S. while also raising legal and privacy concerns. But to help find out how the technique could be used, the department co-hosted a two-day training conference on it last week. The Wichita Eagle reports it drew more than 60 people from law enforcement agencies and other organizations across the state and nation to downtown Wichita. The conference’s co-host, Gene by Gene, is allowing law enforcement agencies to submit DNA samples and lab data files from certain kinds of cold cases. Gene by Gene then queries its DNA database, Family Tree DNA, for any matches that investigators can use to track down suspects or identify remains.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: State colleges and universities will ask for their first funding increase since the 2007-08 budget, lawmakers have been told. Aaron Thompson, president of the Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education, said public colleges will seek a 6.2% increase next fiscal year and an 8.8% increase in the 2022 fiscal year over current base funding levels. Thompson said he is not sure whether the budget Gov. Andy Beshear presents to the General Assembly on Tuesday will include the request but is optimistic. Kentucky has cut higher education funding in each two-year budget since 2008, leaving colleges and universities to increase tuition rates. Thompson told legislators that after more than a decade of higher education cuts, “we are down to the point where we are cutting into the bone.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Dozens of protesters marched from the site of the partially collapsed Hard Rock Hotel on the edge of the French Quarter to City Hall on Friday, demanding that something be done about the hotel and that the two bodies still inside be recovered. The Hard Rock Hotel was under construction when it partially collapsed Oct. 12, sending plumes of dust into the air, killing three people and injuring dozens. The bodies of two of the three workers who died are still inside what is left of the building, which city officials have decided to take down through implosion in March. People in the city were outraged last week when a tarp at the site shifted, exposing the remains of one of the workers who died. The tarp has since been replaced, but it sparked cries for greater accountability. City Council member Jason Williams addressed the crowd, specifically questioning why a worker who had been in the building when it collapsed was later deported.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Maine home sales surged at the end of 2019, which was a record-breaking year for real estate in the state. The Pine Tree State set records for sales volume and median sales price, the Portland Press Herald reports. Home buyers finished strong at the end of the year, as December sales increased 23% compared with the same month the previous year. Total sales for 2019 reached 18,140 homes, which was a 1.5% increase from the previous year, according to the Maine Association of Realtors. The median sales price increase 4.7% from the previous record of $215,000 to $225,000, the association said. One of the factors helping spur the increase in price is a lack of inventory in Maine. Houses also aren’t staying on the market very long.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Lawmakers hope to repeal “archaic” provisions in the state’s spousal defense for sex crimes and sodomy laws with the reintroduction of legislation this session. Lawmakers on Thursday expect to hear a Senate bill that would repeal the use of marriage as a defense to prosecution of some sex crimes, and last week the House introduced a bill that would repeal the crimes of sodomy and unnatural or perverted sexual practice. Under current state law, a person may not be prosecuted for first- or second-degree rape or third- or fourth-degree sexual offenses if the victim is the legal spouse of the assailant at the time of the offense. The bill’s lead sponsor, Sen. Susan Lee, D-Montgomery, told Capital News Service she thinks current law treats a spouse as property. “It’s really disrespectful, it’s wrong, and it’s antiquated,” Lee said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Lawmakers are planning to hold a public hearing this week for a sweeping bill filed by Republican Gov. Charlie Baker that would overhaul the state’s health care system. Baker said the bill would cut down the hidden costs that currently blindside consumers and would require walk-in clinics to treat low-income patients on Medicaid. He said the bill would also hold drug companies accountable for excessive prices and unjustified price increases, as well as support distressed community hospitals and community health centers. The hearing is scheduled for Tuesday at the Statehouse. When he unveiled the legislation in October, Baker said it would “address the challenges associated with supporting an aging population, individuals with a chronic illness, or those in need of behavioral health services.” The proposal would outlaw “surprise” bills for emergency room care and rein in certain hospital fees.\n\nMichigan\n\nGanges Township: The owners of a home along Lake Michigan decided to demolish it before nature did the job. Relentless waves and high water have scoured the lakeshore, destroying or threatening properties that have been in families for generations. Helen Curtis-Foster and family members decided to bring their house down in Allegan County’s Ganges Township, between Saugatuck and South Haven. The house was just feet away from the edge of a collapsing dune. “We really felt we were in the fight against time,” Curtis-Foster told MLive.com. “It was getting scary.” The demolition was completed last week, leaving only a cement pad. The job cost less than $20,000, Curtis-Foster said, compared to hundreds of thousands of dollars necessary to move the house or recover the pieces if it collapsed into the lake. The family plans to put a gazebo on the site.\n\nMinnesota\n\nRobbinsdale: A man scaled a fence at a hospital last month and shut off oxygen to the entire facility, according to a search warrant affidavit filed in Hennepin County. No charges have been filed in the Dec. 27 incident at North Memorial Hospital, and the search warrant affidavit filed Friday makes no mention of injuries. But the Star Tribune reports the document says the situation could have been deadly under different circumstances. Hospital spokeswoman Katy Sullivan says hospital officials quickly identified the issue and resolved it without harm to patients. According to the affidavit, after the oxygen was shut off, engineers detected a pressure drop in the hospital’s oxygen levels and discovered the vandalism. A 39-year-old man has been identified as a possible suspect. He was also seen inside the hospital the previous month unplugging computers and televisions.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Protesters outside the Capitol on Friday condemned conditions in state prisons where inmates have died violently in the past month. People with relatives in the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman said at a rally that some prison cells have no working lights or toilets, and inmates are given sparse meals sometimes served with cockroaches on the trays. “Parchman is a prison farm plantation,” said Jaribu Hill, a longtime Mississippi human-rights attorney. “Shut it down!” A few hundred protesters responded: “Shut it down! Shut it down!” Their voices echoed in downtown Jackson, but many of the state’s top policymakers were not in town to hear it. Most members of the Legislature left the Capitol on Thursday and won’t return until Monday. At least 10 inmates have died in Mississippi prisons since late December – most of them at Parchman. The rally Friday was organized by Team Roc, the charity affiliated with entertainment mogul Jay-Z’s company Roc Nation.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: The University of Missouri is tracking all new students on campus this semester through a cellphone app to learn whether they’re attending class. It’s a test expansion of a program the university has used for four years to track class attendance of freshmen student athletes and athletes in academic trouble. Supporters of the program say it helps attendance, which in turn improves students’ academic performance. Critics worry the university could someday add uses for the program that will violate student privacy, The Kansas City Star reports. The expanded use of the program began Tuesday on a test basis. Faculty volunteered to use the program in their classes, but students won’t have a choice about participating. Every student in the program will be told attendance is being monitored, said Jim Spain, vice provost for undergraduate studies. The university will help students who don’t have a phone participate.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: The University of Montana is working to learn from criticism after four white students won an essay contest about Martin Luther King Jr.’s legacy, the school said. A majority of the 1,000 comments posted on social media were critical of selecting only white students, The Missoulian reports. The contest sought submissions from students, faculty and staff on how they had worked to implement King’s legacy at the university. Only six submissions were received, all from white students, the university said. The university deleted the photos and names of the contest winners out of concern they could be targets of harassment, the school said. Many commenters noted the lack of people of color entering the contest may have indicated they did not believe it was a productive use of their time or energy. African-American Studies program head Tobin Miller Shearer and Murray Pierce, special assistant to the provost and adviser to the Black Student Union, speculated that many of the union members were likely busy planning the Black Solidarity Summit, the group’s upcoming keystone event.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The mayor wants voters to decide whether they’re willing to raise their property taxes to fund a long-term plan for improving city streets – often the objects of residents’ wrath and complaints. Mayor Jean Stothert announced Thursday that she will ask the City Council to put a $200 million bond issue on the May 12 ballot. It would cost owners $35 more a year in property taxes for every $100,000 in valuation. “We can stop the deterioration of our infrastructure,” Stothert said. “But it will take all of us to agree that it’s worth the expense.” The city spends $41 million a year on street repairs, she said, but needs to be spending at least $75 million a year. The $200 million in bond funding would cover only part of what’s needed, and Omaha would need a series of voter-approved bond issues to keep the initiative going, Stothert said. Councilman Pete Festersen said he thinks the street repairs need to be part of a comprehensive plan that improves public transit and bike and pedestrian infrastructure.\n\nNevada\n\nElko: The Silver Dollar Club, an iconic bar dating to the Prohibition era in one of the city’s oldest buildings, is closing after 86 years of stories and songs rooted in the Wild West days. Sam Horvitz, the club proprietor, told the Elko Daily Free Press he’s closing Jan. 30. “I’ve been waiting to buy the building for years now,” Horvitz posted Jan. 3 on his Facebook page, “and my faith and patience have finally run out.” The brick building was Elko’s first bank, founded in 1880. Henderson Bank moved in 1929 to a four-story building across the railroad tracks, and the old bank became a grocery store. Local historian Jan Petersen, director of the nearby Cowboy Arts and Gear Museum, said the building became a “soft drink” parlor during the Prohibition era of the 1920s. Robert “Doby Doc” Caudill, anticipating constitutional approval for the 21st Amendment repealing Prohibition in December 1933, opened the Silver Dollar Club a month earlier, in November 1933.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLangdon: A meeting house originally built in the early 1800s has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Georgian-style Langdon Meeting House was a two-story space that served both town and church functions. In order to comply with New Hampshire’s Toleration Act of 1819, which called for physical and financial separation of religious and government public spaces, the town sold 10 feet at the west end of the building and the second-story gallery space to the Universalist Society of Langdon in 1851. That year, a renovation partitioned the spaces and added a three-story Greek Revival steeple over the church entrance that included a belfry with louvered shutters and a 5-foot weathervane. Langdon residents have held their annual town meeting on the first floor from 1803 to the present, the longest-running record in the country.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A former top aide to Gov. Phil Murphy alerted him to allegedly inappropriate behavior by his former campaign manager, including “rank misogyny” and retaliation, according to documents released Sunday. The campaign manager, Brendan Gill, who is now one of Murphy’s closest advisers, also notified Murphy directly that he apologized to that aide for losing his temper and using “language and tone” he regretted, according to an email. The documents appear to contradict Murphy’s own words in an interview last year. When asked if he was personally aware of any incident of sexual harassment or complaints of a toxic work environment during the campaign, Murphy said: “Not that I know of. No.” Murphy was included on at least two emails that showed Gill had acted inappropriately. The campaign said it conducted an investigation and found that the behavior happened only once with the woman who made the allegation, Julie Roginsky, who left the campaign in July 2017.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Trappers now have to complete an education course, and new restrictions will be imposed on setting wildlife traps and snares around designated trailheads and on select tracts of public lands in New Mexico, under a measure adopted by the state Game Commission. State wildlife managers suggested they tried to strike a balance, but trappers argued that the changes will be burdensome, requiring them in some instances to walk a mile roundtrip to set a trap. Environmentalists also were displeased with the decision, calling the practice inhumane and indiscriminate. They had pushed for the commission to end trapping all together, saying pets and endangered species such as the Mexican gray wolf have been inadvertently caught. Trapping and snaring triggered emotionally charged debates during last year’s legislative session.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Some 85,000 artifacts that tell the story of the Chinese migration to the United States may have been lost in a fire that struck a building in the heart of Manhattan’s Chinatown, a museum official said Friday. The president of the Museum of Chinese in America told The New York Times most of the thousands of historic and artistic items in its collection were probably lost in the fire that started Thursday night and tore through a building where the museum’s acquisitions were stored. “One hundred percent of the museum’s collection, other than what is on view,” said Nancy Yao Maasbach, the president of the museum. She said the collection was one of a kind, and she was “just distraught” after receiving the news. The fire started in a former school that more recently housed a senior center, the Chen Dance Center and a number of community groups. The museum is nearby and stored its collection in the structure that was hit by fire.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nBakersville: The “world’s worst cat” is available for adoption at the Mitchell County Animal Rescue organization. The shelter about 55 miles northeast of Asheville is waiving adoption fees in the hope that someone will take the cat named Perdita off its hands. The group says on its Facebook page, “We thought she was sick. Turns out she’s just a jerk.” A tongue-in-cheek profile of the foul-tempered feline says her dislikes include “dogs, children, the Dixie Chicks, Disney movies, Christmas and last but NOT least … HUGS.” It says she likes lurking, pretending to be sick and “staring into your soul until you feel as if you may never be cheerful again … She’s single and ready to be socially awkward with a socially awkward human who understands personal space.” Her Facebook post has drawn thousands of “likes” – and a follow-up post indicated more than 50 applications to adopt her had already been submitted.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: State officials say it’s time for property owners in flood-prone areas of the Red River Valley to think about buying flood insurance. The push comes as early signs suggest a heightened risk of flooding this spring. The Red River Basin in eastern North Dakota has seen record precipitation totals for the fall and winter period starting Sept. 1, National Weather Service spokesman Greg Gust said Friday after the agency released its first flood outlook of the season. This year’s flood could be a top five event, although it’s still too early to predict hard numbers, and “much is left to be determined,” Gust said. The state Water Commission and Department of Emergency Services have scheduled flood preparation meetings this week in Fargo, Grand Forks and Jamestown that will focus on insuring homes and other structures.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state prison system wants to replace or renovate some of its high-security prisons in the near future, saying its current facilities for violent inmates are “functionally obsolete” and creating security risks for the agency, the Associated Press has learned. More low-security inmates are now being housed at community facilities instead of prisons at the same time more violent inmates are being housed in state prisons, and for longer terms, the Department of Rehabilitation and Correction said in its capital budget request to Gov. Mike DeWine. “Furthermore, this population is particularly violent and disruptive while in prison and requires unique programming needs,” the agency said in its budget documents. The agency wants approval for a two-year design study of its options, with construction possible by mid-2023.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Leaders in this conservative state say they are looking for more legislative progress for LGBTQ people this year after notable strides in 2019. Tulsa and Oklahoma City updated their personnel policies to ban discrimination against city employees based on gender identity or expression, The Oklahoman reports. Norman went further and became the first in the state to amend its civil rights ordinance to ban discrimination against LGBTQ people in housing, employment or public accommodations. Oklahoma City also elected its first openly gay council member, and the mayor declared the city’s first official Pride Week to celebrate LBGTQ accomplishments. Allie Shinn, executive director of Freedom Oklahoma, an advocacy organization for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights, said 2019 was a “landmark year.” A top priority in the upcoming legislative session is pushing for a ban on the widely discredited practice of “conversion therapy.”\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: U.S. Justice Department lawyers said Friday that they’ve found the Portland Police Bureau in substantial compliance with 190 reforms required as part of a city settlement adopted six years ago. The settlement came after a federal investigation determined officers used excessive force against people with mental illness. Now that a community oversight group is staffed and has met regularly for more than a year, the Justice Department said the city meets the settlement’s accountability requirements. The bureau also has instituted needed changes to its use-of-force policies, training, crisis intervention tactics and employee information system developed to identify officers with excessive complaints or uses of force, the Justice Department said in court documents. The community oversight group will discuss the Justice Department’s findings at a Tuesday meeting, according to the group’s co-chair Lakayana Drury.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nMount Carbon: A 44-acre community with fewer than 90 residents may soon end up absorbed by an adjacent city because there isn’t enough citizen interest to keep its government functioning. No one except the newly elected mayor of Mount Carbon showed up this month for a reorganizational meeting, The Morning Call of Allentown reports. The Schuylkill County borough’s fate has hung in the balance since last year, when all three council members quit and the borough secretary resigned. Retired railroad worker John Raess was elected mayor in November with two write-in votes. The newspaper said it is possible Mount Carbon might end up as part of the 15,000-resident city of Pottsville, a merger both communities would have to OK. Merging with Pottsville would mean higher taxes for Mount Carbon’s residents.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A lawmaker proposed letting legislators and other officials tint their windshields to shield them from unhappy constituents. Rep. Anastasia Williams, a Providence Democrat, introduced a bill Thursday that would carve out an exception for the state’s lawmakers and officials to travel around behind tinted glass, The Boston Globe reports. The bill would allow members of the General Assembly, state and municipal police officers, firefighters and state judges to be exempt from state law that says most car windows must allow 70% of the light in. “We have a lot of disgruntled individuals,” Williams said. “In the court system, law enforcement, and the General Assembly, we tend to get a bum rap, and we can face retaliation when we least expect it. When folks are on personal time, we are targeted.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nIsle of Palms: The owner of an island home is suing Airbnb, claiming it only reimbursed him for a “fraction” of the damages that a guest who threw a big party did to his home. In a federal lawsuit filed this week, Scott Shaw said the party left his home smelling of a mixture of marijuana, cigarettes, beer and vomit. Blood and vomit were found on the walls, towels and bedding, the lawsuit states. Shaw says he believes he is owed about $150,000 in both property and punitive damages. He did not say what the company paid him. He said Airbnb claims in its marketing materials that it guarantees up to $1 million reimbursement for property damage. “Airbnb’s ‘host guarantee’ is nothing close to any type of ‘guarantee’ and in fact it is false, misleading and deceptive,” the lawsuit says. The company says it plans to “vigorously defend against these allegations.” Shaw says aside from the smell, the guests also left holes in the walls and broke a staircase railing, door and countertop, among other things.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Gov. Kristi Noem says she has “concerns” about a bill in the House that would make it illegal for physicians to administer gender-change treatments to children under 16. But she declined Friday to offer full support or disapproval. The bill would allow for physicians who perform surgeries, administer hormone therapy or prescribe puberty-blocking medication to minors to be prosecuted with a misdemeanor. The Republican-dominated House will debate the bill this week. “When you take public policy and try to fill parenting gaps with more government, you have to be very careful about the precedent you’re setting,” Noem told reporters. Democrats and LGBT activists say the bill targets transgender children and could lead to an increase in suicides. Supporters, including many Republicans in the House, say the bill would prevent children from receiving ideologically motivated treatment that harms them.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state has become the latest to assure continued taxpayer funding of faith-based foster care and adoption agencies even if those organizations exclude LGBT families and others based on religious beliefs. Republican Gov. Bill Lee signed the bill Friday without fanfare or an official announcement, making it the first law to be implemented in Tennessee this year. Previously, Lee said he endorsed the law because he believed defending religious liberty “is very important.” The Republican has often cited his Christian faith throughout his first term as governor. The protections afforded to religious agencies have sparked criticism from the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee, which has raised legal concerns surrounding the proposal because it authorized the use of a “religious test to participate in a government program.”\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: The mayor and others say they will work to provide assistance to residents whose homes were damaged after a massive explosion at a warehouse that killed two workers and injured 20 others. Mayor Sylvester Turner on Saturday walked through the impacted neighborhoods in northwest Houston and spoke with residents who were cleaning up after Friday’s explosion. Cleanup and repair efforts continued Sunday. The explosion happened about 4:30 a.m. Friday inside a building at Watson Grinding and Manufacturing, which makes valves and provides thermal-spray coatings for equipment in various industries, authorities said. Employees Frank Flores and Gerardo Castorena were killed. More than 200 homes in surrounding neighborhoods were damaged as the force of the blast shattered windows, knocked down ceilings, bent garage doors and moved some homes off their foundations.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state’s unemployment rate is now the lowest ever recorded at 2.3%, which also ties for lowest among U.S. states, state officials said Friday. The milestone comes in December data released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. “The job market is humming along at a feverish pace and is absorbing as much labor as possible,” said Mark Knold, chief economist at the Utah Department of Workforce Services. Utah was also a leader in job creation for 2019, up about 3%. The fastest growth by percentage occurred in construction, education and health services, and leisure and hospitality services. Washington County had the biggest job growth, followed by Rich and Iron counties. The national unemployment rate was 3.5% in December. Utah tied Vermont and South Carolina for the lowest unemployment rate in the nation.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: A bill in the state would take vanity license plates into new territory with the introduction of emojis. State Rep. Rebecca White, a Democrat from Windsor, introduced the proposal to let drivers add one of six available emojis to their license plate, MyNBC5 reports. Her bill went before the Committee on Transportation last week. The symbols would not replace letters or numbers assigned by the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, nor those selected by a vehicle’s owner. At this point, it’s unclear what the new plates would would look like or what emojis would be allowed. Of the state’s current vanity plates, the most expensive for cars and trucks is the state conservation series, which carry a $26 annual fee.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: With a newly empowered Democratic majority at the General Assembly, abortion-rights advocates say the state has a chance to roll back decades of restrictions and become a “safe haven” for women in neighboring conservative states. Abortion-rights groups laid out their legislative priorities last week, emphasizing a measure to undo Republican-backed laws including a 24-hour waiting period before an abortion, as well a requirement that women seeking an abortion undergo an ultrasound and counseling. A Senate committee passed that bill Thursday morning, a day after a House committee advanced that chamber’s version. The bills, which are part of Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam’s legislative agenda, would also roll back the requirement that an abortion be provided by a physician, allowing nurse practitioners and physician assistants to perform them, and undo strict building code requirements on facilities where abortions are performed.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Seattle Public Schools has agreed to pay almost half a million dollars to resolve a claim involving a former student who said he was hospitalized after his elementary school released him to the wrong parent in 2010. The former student, then 8, was picked up by his father following an “incident” at the school and “seriously assaulted,” according to the settlement authorization document, which was unanimously approved by the Seattle School Board this week. The father was criminally charged and convicted after the incident, the document said. The former student and his mother filed a claim against the district in March, The Seattle Times reports. The district said the mother and former student will drop the claim in exchange for a $475,000 settlement, pending approval by King County Superior Court.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Marshall University is investigating three separate incidents of “hate graffiti” on its campus. A statement from the school said its police department is trying to identify who wrote the graffiti. Disciplinary action up to expulsion or dismissal could be taken if the incidents are linked back to a student or employee, the school said. The college didn’t specify what exactly was written but said two of the markings were found Thursday, and one was reported earlier this month. All three were found in restrooms on the Huntington campus. School staffers have since removed the graffiti. “This hate speech is against everything we stand for. We will do everything we can to identify the perpetrators,” President Jerome Gilbert said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nThree Lakes: A school district in northern Wisconsin has refurbished an old photography dark room into a place where the basic needs of its students are met. Teachers at the Three Lakes School District raised money to furnish the room with a washer and dryer to help students who might not have access to one at home. WJFW-TV reports special education teacher Nicole Lewis makes sure the room is stocked with personal essentials such as shampoo, soap, deodorant and toothbrushes. “Not many students, or adults for that matter, are able to concentrate and learn if those basic needs aren’t met,” Lewis said. “I think it’s one of those things that’s a necessity in a school.” The room is also stocked with spare clothing.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Grand Teton National Park stayed near its highest visitation levels in 2019, while Yellowstone National Park had its slowest tourism year since 2014, officials said. Grand Teton’s 2019 attendance trailed only 2018 for tourists visiting the park, The Jackson Hole News and Guide reports. A Grand Teton park spokeswoman credited increased visits during historically slow shoulder seasons, the periods between peak and off-peak seasons. Grand Teton attracted 3.4 million recreational visitors, a category excluding people who only passed through, such as commercial truckers, officials said. July was Grand Teton’s busiest month, with 776,000 visitors, while February, November and December saw fewer than 50,000 recreational visits each, officials said. Yellowstone, also in Wyoming, attracted slightly more than 4 million recreational visitors last year, a 2.3% decrease since 2018 and 5.6% decrease from the all-time high in 2016.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/06/15/silver-dollar-city-thunder-silenced-empty-vegas-buffets-news-around-states/111962742/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state prison system said that a third inmate has died after testing positive for COVID-19 as the number of cases among inmates and staff continued to rise. Clarence Shepherd, an 80-year-old inmate at St. Clair Correctional Facility, died Friday after testing positive for the new coronavirus, the Alabam Department of Corrections reported. The prison system said a total of 119 staff and contract workers and 28 inmates have tested positive for COVID-19 .Twenty-nine of those staff members have returned to work. Inmate advocates and health experts have expressed concerns that the state’s overcrowded prisons would become a breeding ground for a deadly outbreak and urged the state to make additional changes. The prison system has said it is taking precautions such as distributing masks to inmates and quarantining infirmaries and other areas where there have been positive cases. The St. Clair’s infirmary, where Shepherd was housed, is quarantined, the prison system said. The Alabama Department of Corrections wrote in a news release that the department extends its sympathies to the Shepherd family and his loved ones during this difficult time.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Alaska Permanent Fund dividend was completed at $992 for each resident and distribution is expected to begin early this year because of economic impacts caused by the coronavirus pandemic, state department officials said. The state Department of Revenue said payments are expected to begin July 1 instead of in October. Residents who receive their payments by direct deposit and have been cleared for the check by June 19 are expected to receive the first disbursement in July, department officials said. The Department of Revenue estimated about 90% of all applicants will receive their check by July 1. Paper checks will be mailed starting July 1 to residents without direct deposit, officials said. The state budget passed earlier this year called for about $680 million in spending, which amounted to just under $1,000 for each recipient after people applied. This is the smallest Alaska Permanent Fund dividend payout since 2013, when a $900 check was distributed, KTUU-TV reported. Legislators or the governor have set the dividend amount during the annual budget-making process since 2016. A 2017 decision by the state Supreme Court said a traditional dividend-payment formula that was used from 1982 through 2015 remains on file but is not binding, the Anchorage Daily New reported.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: In one of the nation’s COVID-19 hot spots, Gov. Doug Ducey is not requiring residents to wear masks in public, and it seems a good many people agree with him. In shopping malls, restaurants and the crowded bar scenes of Scottsdale and Tempe, most patrons have disdained the use of cloth face masks that health officials advocate to help slow the spread of virus. Robert Fowler, a truck driver in Phoenix, wears a mask as required for work but otherwise he goes about mask-free. “I’m not worried about it,” Fowler said while waiting for a table Thursday at Snooze A.M. Eatery, where the patio was full and only employees were seen donning face masks. Despite COVID-19 case numbers trending upward, Fowler has no plans to change. “Everybody’s going to get COVID one way or the other eventually,” he said. “People are gonna do what they want to do regardless.” In a red state with a Republican governor, the trend seems to be to follow President Donald Trump’s lead. Get the state reopened and keep the face masks in your pocket – that’s where Ducey kept his Thursday during a news conference in which he dismissed concerns that the dramatic increase in virus cases might overwhelm hospitals. The governor did say he recommended wearing masks when social distancing is impossible, but he has rarely been seen wearing one himself. Ducey wore one when he met last month with Trump, who wasn’t wearing one, at a Honeywell plant ramping up mask production.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: There are 548 new coronavirus cases in Arkansas and one additional deaths because of COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus, the Arkansas State Department of Health reported Saturday. There have been at least 12,095 confirmed cases and 177 deaths in the state, up from 1 1,547 cases reported Friday. The actual number of people who have contracted the virus is likely higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. A total of 7,863 residents have recovered from the illness, according to the department.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Some Californians will again be able to get a manicure, a new tattoo or enjoy a massage starting late this week under new state guidance issued Friday. But studios and salons won’t look the same when they do open. Workers and customers must wear face masks, adopt far more intense cleaning practices for shared reusable items like tweezers, and the services will be limited – no mouth or nose tattoos or piercings for now. The guidance on nail salons has been highly anticipated. The Professional Beauty Federation of California sued the state in May to reopen hair and nail salons. Hair salons were cleared to reopen several weeks ago. Gov. Gavin Newsom also sparked anger among some in the industry, including Vietnamese salon owners who own a majority of California’s salons, when he alleged California’s first case of the virus spreading in the community was linked to a nail salon. He declined to give details, citing privacy. The services can reopen starting June 19 in counties where health officials allow it. They join a long list of other businesses cleared to reopen in recent weeks, including hair salons, restaurants, churches and movie theaters. Most counties have been cleared to move forward, though infection rates and hospitalizations are climbing in some. The state is monitoring infection rates and hospitalizations in 11 counties. Beyond masks, nail salon workers should consider wearing face shields or goggles to protect their eyes and wear a new pair of disposable gloves for each customer. Salons should even consider putting plastic partitions with cutouts for hands between workers and customers. Salons should also no longer display nail polish bottles on a shelf and instead ask customers to choose a color from a palette that can be disinfected. Technicians should throw away nail files, buffers and other items after each use. Fred Jones, public policy director and legal counsel for the beauty federation, said he was pleased Newsom cleared the reopening but disappointed it took so long. He said he’s concerned some counties will delay.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The Colorado Tourism Office has launched a campaign urging people to practice safety measures and follow health guidelines when visiting the state during the coronavirus pandemic. Visitors are urged to keep their distance from each other and wear masks, in addition to normal guidelines asking people to stick to trails, respect wildlife and pick up after pets, The Denver Post reported. “We want to continue to make sure that the health and safety of both residents and visitors are the highest priority,” office spokeswoman Abby Leeper said. The office is working with the state health department on protocols and guidelines for businesses, communities and visitors to include in its “Care for Coloradans” campaign, Leeper said. The campaign also includes a new brochure and animated videos advising people how to dress for the weather and different altitudes and other helpful recommendations. The state previously discouraged any travelers from visiting the mountains because of concerns that smaller communities would not be able to respond to any outbreaks. “After the great sacrifices that have been made to protect our state, it’s vitally important to set clear expectations so we can maintain all the gains that have been made and stay on course to reopen Colorado’s tourism economy,” Director Cathy Ritter said. Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed an executive order June 1 on the transition from the statewide stay-at-home order to safer at home “or in the great outdoors.” The office welcomed the order as more people are now expected to spend more time outside.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state is allowing nursing homes to begin allowing some residents to meet with loved ones outside, wearing a mask and adhering to social distancing, months after Gov. Ned Lamont imposed a ban on most visits to help slow the spread of the new coronavirus. Nursing homes and assisted living facilities have been particularly hard hit during the pandemic because older people are among the most vulnerable to the virus – but limiting visits was hard on residents and families. “We know that the social and emotional connection is incredibly important,” said Connecticut Long Term Care Ombudsman Mairead Painter, during a Facebook chat with families this week. Although many of the more than 200 nursing homes across the state have begun to allow these limited visitations, still strict restrictions are in place, said Matthew Barrett, president and CEO of the Connecticut Association of Health Care Facilities and the Connecticut Center for Assisted Living. For example, families under most situations are not allowed inside the buildings. “It’s limited but it is an important step toward opening up visitation,” said Barrett, who said it’s still “much too early to say” when the more severe restrictions will be lifted.\n\nDelaware\n\nDewey Beach:Fourth of July fireworks are a go in Dewey Beach this summer, the only beach town that didn’t cancel or postpone festivities because of the coronavirus pandemic. Alex Pires, leader of the Highway One Group that owns local businesses like The Rusty Rudder and the Bottle & Cork, posted on Facebook Thursday night that fireworks were on after receiving a permit from the Delaware State Fire Marshal’s office. The permit shows that the 2020 fireworks will be held on July 4 on a barge out on the Rehoboth Bay near downtown Dewey. Pires said in an emailed statement that this is the fifth year his company has held free fireworks in the town and that organizers will work closely with police, state and local agencies and elected officials “to make sure folks maintain proper social distances.” Mayor Dale Cooke said the town has no role to play in approving the fireworks display because they’re set off from a barge on the bay, which is outside of town limits. It’s also run by Highway One, not the town itself. Fireworks displays, parades, concerts and other community events stretching into July have been canceled throughout much of Delaware in response to the pandemic, including being canceled in Dover, Rehoboth Beach and Bethany Beach. Lewes postponed its festivities until the fall.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:As protesters continue to crowd the streets of the District, a nonprofit set up free testing sites, so people can check to see if they have the new coronavirus, WUSA-TV reported. The nonprofit CORE, or Community Organized Relief Effort, set up the sites Friday and Saturday, after feeling inspired by the protests across the country. CORE brought the testing to the District for the first time last weekend, but plans to hold more next weekend and hopefully moving forward. “Protesting is our civic duty, and we feel that testing ourselves is as well,” Ann Lee, CORE’s CEO said. “We want to support our awesome amazing protesters out there really saving our republic, and we feel that this is our best way to do that.” Lee originally co-founded the organization with actor Sean Penn to “empower and support vulnerable communities, who have suffered from inequality, exclusion from opportunities, and institutionalized violence.” Now, they’re working to keep those communities healthy amid the pandemic. “Predominantly it’s low-income communities of color that are always the most vulnerable … so we see that there is a much bigger, much longer standing disaster that has been happening, which is racism,” Lee said. “Keeping protesters safe is for us keeping these communities safe that always get hit the hardest in all these disasters.”\n\nFlorida\n\nNaples:More than 80% of the people who live or work in Florida’s nursing homes and assisted living facilities have been tested for COVID-19 as the state approaches its goal of getting all of them tested. As of June 10, the Department of Health had coordinated on-site testing for 133,615 residents and staff of the state’s long-term care facilities. The department has shipped another 126,690 testing kits directly to facilities that indicated they could do the testing on their own. Combined, that means 81% of the 320,771 people who live or work in a long-term care facility have been tested, according to Department of Health data. According to the health department, 3,300 long-term care facilities have been tested, either by on-site strike teams or they were mailed kits. There are about 3,800 nursing homes and assisted living facilities in the state, according to Florida Agency for Health Care Administration records. The department has been shipping out about 4,000 test kits per day, excluding Sundays and holidays. Facility leaders said they can compel staff members to be tested, but residents can opt out if they choose. Long-term care providers serve the state’s most vulnerable population. About 85% of Florida’s COVID-19 deaths have been among those 65 and older, and nearly half have been connected with long-term care facilities.\n\nGeorgia\n\nStone Mountain: The Park Springs elder care facility just outside of Atlanta took the unusual approach of having roughly 70 employees shelter in place on campus to protect its residents from the new coronavirus. It lifted that restriction over the weekend, and employees headed home for the first time since March 30. Nursing homes – among the hardest-hit places by the pandemic –– have limited visitors and screened people for the virus. Park Springs’ administrators said they feared those strategies might not be enough to keep their more than 500 residents safe. But the staff lockdown was not a measure they could sustain forever, said Donna Moore, chief operating officer of the company that owns Park Springs. The return home Saturday was bittersweet for staff, who gathered at a lunch before their departures to share their experience. Some cried and hugged each other. The company gave each of them a plaque inscribed with their names and a record of their sacrifice: “COVID-19 Shelter-In-Place 2020.” “Sometimes I said, ‘I can’t do this,’ ” O’Neil Marriott, a maintenance technician, said. But he said the rest of the staff gave him support to stay. “I appreciate everyone in here because you really made me feel like family,” he said. The staff walked out to meet loved ones to music and applause from Park Springs’ administrators. Some had carts loaded with shopping bags of supplies they had brought to sustain them during the lockdown. Park Springs’ lockdown started after four employees and a resident tested positive for the virus. They all recovered. Since the lockdown, the facility has seen two additional cases – both residents. One of those residents – a 96-year-old dementia patient – was visited by her daughter and a caregiver after doctors said she had little time left to live and then tested positive. She later died. The other tested positive after requiring medical care off campus and recovered from the virus.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: International college students who were unable to return home at the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic remain in Hawaii with limited means to work and get food. Many foreign students were stranded in the state by health restrictions established to stop the spread of COVID-19 that shut down international travel and embassies, Hawaii Public Radio reported. Ann Hartman, dean of education at the East-West Center in Honolulu, said about 180 of the international educational organization’s students have remained, some living in the organization’s dormitories. Although the dorms provide shelter, other opportunities are sparse. “As international students, we are only allowed to work on campus, like coffee shops, or as graduate assistants, or bookstores and things like that,” said Uyanga Batzogs, a graduate fellow from Mongolia at the center located near the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Students are allowed to work 20 hours per week during the normal school year, and up to 40 hours during breaks in the academic schedule, Batzogs said. The pandemic caused the University of Hawaii system to stop lectures and restrict services. “With our campus closed, now, as international students, we can’t find the jobs or try to work full-time during summer break at all,” Batzogs said. Seru Tagivakatini from Fiji said students like him rely on a $600 a month stipend from the East-West Center for expenses and face challenges obtaining adequate food.\n\nIdaho\n\nIdaho: About 80,000 Idaho residents through early June have signed up for Medicaid under the state’s voter-approved expanded coverage, state officials said. Idaho Department of Health and Welfare officials said that the overall number of people signing up for Medicaid has also picked up as the economy has struggled with the coronavirus pandemic. About 345,000 residents, including those who signed up through the expansion, are now covered by Medicaid. That compares to about 286,000 of Idaho’s 1.75 million residents who were covered by Medicaid in early September. Voters authorized Medicaid expansion in 2018 with an initiative that passed with 61% of the vote after years of inaction by state lawmakers.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A network of military and veteran organizations is offering free wellness checks for veterans, service members and their families during the coronavirus pandemic. Illinois Joining Forces is a partnership between state and private groups, including the Illinois Department of Veterans’ Affairs, that helps service members and veterans navigate service providers through its Care Coordination Center. The center typically responds to requests for assistance on issues such as housing, employment or health care. Now people can request the center conduct wellness checks, either on an ongoing basis or a single check-in, for veterans, members of the military or their families. Brigadier General Ret. Stephen Curda, executive director of Illinois Joining Forces, said the pandemic has forced hundreds of thousands of people in Illinois to search for the help they need and navigate overwhelming options. “It is imperative that we meet them halfway – and in our view, it starts with a simple phone call,” Curda said.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Indiana entered Stage 4 of Gov. Eric Holcomb’s reopening plan Friday, allowing additional businesses to reopen and fill at higher capacities. But as the coronavirus pandemic carries on, Indiana State Health Commissioner Dr. Kristina Box still has reservations. “Just because you’re not positive today, doesn’t mean you won’t be tomorrow,” Box said. Stage 4 of the reopening plan means restaurants can open to 75% capacity. Bars, movie theaters, bowling alleys and other entertainment venues can welcome customers back at 50% capacity. Zoos, museums and similar sites can reopen, and gatherings of up to 250 people are allowed as long as attendees stay 6 feet apart. Unlike other parts of the state, Marion County won’t enter its next reopening stage until June 19, however, bcause of higher case numbers of the virus. Beginning Monday, OptumServe testing sites will also be open to anyone who lives in Indiana, Box said, regardless of whether they are high-risk or symptomatic.\n\nIowa\n\nJefferson: The Iowa Department of Transportation has temporarily closed two maintenance garages after an employee tested positive for the new coronavirus and had contact with two dozen colleagues, a spokeswoman said. The garages in Jefferson and Boone were closed Wednesday after all 24 employees who work at them were ordered to self-isolate for 14 days, DOT spokeswoman Andrea Henry said. Crews in both garages were working together on projects and had exposure to the infected employee, she said. Their work will be picked up by other crews in the area during the closures, she said. Henry said the agency sends employees home immediately once they test positive, and conducts contact tracing to identify anyone with whom they had contact. DOT then requires exposed employees to self-isolate for 14 days, and cleans and disinfects their workplaces. Henry said employees are placed on paid leave during their mandatory isolation periods if their job duties do not allow them to work from home. Henry said the Altoona garage was closed in May after a positive case there required 11 employees to be isolated. She said those employees have since returned to work.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A protester who attended a demonstration over the death of George Floyd in downtown Topeka last week has tested positive for the new coronavirus, health officials said. According to a news release from the Shawnee County Health Department, the person attended June 1 protests at the city’s Law Enforcement Center, The Topeka Capital-Journal reported. The department encourages anyone who attended protests that day to monitor themselves for COVID-19 symptoms. Meanwhile, the City-Cowley County Health Department on Friday said a 14 year old who tested positive for COVID-19 likely exposed people in Sedgwick and Cowley counties. The health department said the girl went to a sleepover and a public pool in Arkansas City before her test results came back positive June 10. The City-Cowley County Health Department ordered anyone who believes they might have been exposed to self-isolate for the next two days. The health department is offering free drive-through testing 1 p.m. to 4 p.m Monday at the Winfield Health Department office.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville:The Kentucky Derby Festival has canceled this year’s Pegasus Parade and fireworks display known as Thunder Over Louisville, saying it would not be responsible to let the events go on in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. The festival’s events were originally postponed until August and September leading up to the Sept. 5 Kentucky Derby in Louisville. Other events canceled for 2020 include the miniMarathon, the festival said Thursday. “As an organization that always puts public health and safety first, we know it would not be responsible for the Kentucky Derby Festival to put on events that attract crowds with not just hundreds, but hundreds of thousands of people,” said Matt Gibson, Kentucky Derby Festival president and CEO. This is the festival’s 65th year and the first time its traditional events have not been held in the spring.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLafayette:Coronavirus pandemic closings have cost Louisiana casinos hundreds of millions of dollars, and one chain has told the state it might lay off as many as 1,500 workers. Monthly revenue reports showed that casinos lost about $347 million during March and April, with another $90 million or more lost by video gaming establishments, The Advertiser reported. And, though Las Vegas-based Boyd Gaming Corp. hasn’t set actual totals, it has sent more than 1,500 employees at its five Louisiana casinos letters advising them that they might be laid off, spokesman David Strow said. The company’s notification to the Louisiana Gaming Control Board said layoffs are expected during the first two weeks in July, the newspaper reported. They include up to 414 workers at Sam’s Town Hotel and Casino in Shreveport, 354 at Delta Downs Racetrack in Vinton, 340 at Treasure Chest Casino in Kenner, 246 at Evangeline Downs Racetrack in Opelousas and 170 at Amelia Belle Casino in Amelia. Strow said in an email that he did not know current employee totals.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The first Mainer to receive transfusions of antibody-rich blood plasma said he remembers dreams of two groups chanting while he was on a ventilator for 18 days. Richard Stevenson said one group was chanting, “Let him die, let him die, let him die!” while the other chanted “Go Rich, go Rich, go Rich!” Stevenson, of Vinalhaven, told the Bangor Daily News that he credits his survival to the plasma transfusions at Mid Coast Hospital. He was the first person in Maine to get the experimental therapy. Stevenson said he believes he was exposed in December on an airplane long before the virus became widely known in the U.S. He never knew for sure whether he had COVID-19 then. But his symptoms returned, and he tested positive in March. He was weaned from the ventilator little more than a week after receiving plasma donated by COVID-19 survivors. “I’m the luckiest person on earth, is how I feel,” he said.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury:Red White and Boom, the city’s annual Fourth of July fireworks celebration, has been canceled for this year. The decision announced on a Facebook post was made because it would be difficult to maintain social distancing during the event to ensure guests’ health and safety amid the coronavirus pandemic. “We want to give our sincere thanks to everyone who has worked so hard to make the event happen and let you know how much we appreciate your time and effort. Fantastic Fireworks, our Sponsors, and our partners at the City and County level have assisted us up until the last minute to try to make the event happen,” the statement said. Although this year’s event is a no-go, organizers said they plan to be back in 2021 and “bigger and better than ever.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nAmherst: The University of Massachusetts won’t be holding its usual presentations at the Amherst campus’ Sunwheel for the summer solstice this year because of the coronavirus pandemic, but the public is still invited to visit the site at sunrise and sunset this week. Visitors should wear face coverings, employ social distancing and be prepared for the possibility of wet footing and mosquitoes, according to a statement from the university. At the solstice, the sun’s rising and setting positions barely change for more than a week, according to UMass Amherst astronomer Stephen Schneider. “From June 15 to 25, the shift of the sun will be less than one-fifth its own size. That’s barely detectable without astronomical instruments, so any of those days would be great to visit the Sunwheel to see the alignment of the standing stones with the rising or setting position of the sun,” he said. The astronomical start of summer is at 5:43 p.m. on June 20, the moment when the sun reaches its farthest northerly position in the sky, making that the longest day of the year. The UMass Amherst Sunwheel is located just south of the football stadium.\n\nMichigan\n\nYpsilanti: Eastern Michigan University is guaranteeing a single room on campus starting this fall for any enrolled student who wants one. The school announced its “EMU Single Room Guarantee” in response to physical distancing and other safety concerns because of the coronavirus pandemic. It’s for students living in campus residence halls who don’t want a roommate. Students who wish to have a roommate will continue to have that option. Single rooms typically cost approximately $2,500 a year more than a shared, double room, Eastern Michigan said. Under the new plan, the university is offering a credit to reduce the annual cost of a single room to $100 per month more than the cost of sharing a room. The credit provides an annual savings of $1,700 over the typical single room rate. “We have heard from many students and parents about this issue,” Eastern Michigan President James Smith said. “They question how students can practice safe physical distancing when they have a roommate in close proximity to them in a residence hall room. We understand a single room may not be for everyone, but we also know and have heard from many who desire such accommodations at this time.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The University of Minnesota’s Board of Regents on Friday approved a $4 billion operating budget for the coming fiscal year as well as a plan to help offset losses because of the coronavirus pandemic. The budget outline includes freezes on tuition, system-wide hiring and merit pay raises for all employees. Separately, regents approved an initiative for temporary employee pay cuts and furloughs to help make up for $35 million in room and board refunds after students were sent home for the spring semester. The fiscal year 2021 budget beginning July 1 assumes a return to “near normalcy” with the reopening of campus classrooms and facilities in the fall, the Star Tribune reported. University leaders have developed two contingency plans in case the pandemic worsens and the return of students is pushed deeper into the fall. The budget “provides a responsible, by no means definite, base level of operations from which potential contingency plans can be shaped,” President Joan Gabel said during a regents committee meeting. Gabel’s COVID-19 budget includes a 10% pay cut for Gabel and her cabinet.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson:The Mississippi Department of Education is offering options for how schools can offer classes starting in the fall semester, with consideration for social distancing and other safety guidelines because of the coronavirus pandemic. The department has released a plan giving school districts three options: a traditional schedule, a hybrid schedule and a virtual schedule. The plan “outlines a three-month timeline of strategies for superintendents and principals to consider to plan for the start of the 2020-21 school year” and is “intended to be used as a resource and starting point for districts to consider local needs in collaboration with stakeholders,” department spokeswoman Jean Cook told the Clarion Ledger. It will be updated in to adjust to changes with the COVID-19 pandemic, she said. Jason Harris, Columbia School District superintendent, is one of nine superintendents who worked with the state to create the plans. “This isn’t a ‘You must follow,’ ” Harris said. “This is just guidance that people can use as a reference when determining what is best for their district.” Harris said although his school district intends to have the traditional schedule, he knows some parents might not feel safe sending children to school. That’s when the hybrid schedule or virtual schedule could be used. So, for the upcoming school year, students who study from home would have the option of watching their teacher’s lesson from a classroom webcam. The lesson would be recorded and uploaded, giving the student the option to watch it later.\n\nMissouri\n\nBranson:The Silver Dollar City theme park opened its gates Saturday for the first time in 2020 after opening day was delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic. About 6,000 season pass holders made reservations to attend the park Saturday. A typical Saturday during the summer draws about 15,000. Season pass holders were the first allowed in the park on Saturday and Sunday; the park opened to the general public Monday for those who make reservations. About 8,000 to 10,000 are expected when the park opens for everyone. Those who enter have to wear a mask throughout the park except on water rides and while eating. Visitors are screened with COVID-19-related questions and temperatures are taken before they enter the park. Signs throughout encourage social distancing while reminding folks to keep their masks on. The park’s performers stay in character while wearing masks. Instead of buffet lines, food is delivered to the table. About every other table is closed in eating areas to keep visitors distanced from others. Carts on the rides are frequently stopped and sanitized. Indoor shows are closed, but there’s still music to be heard from the outdoor performances around every other corner. Saturday saw the opening of a new area called Rivertown that features Mystic River Falls –– a new water ride that has the tallest drop in the Western Hemisphere. The ride is still expected to open this summer.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov. Steve Bullock announced $8.7 million in federal funding for education interests.The funding comes from a U.S. Department of Education fund that gives governors the authority to distribute money to local education entities. This funding is separate from the state’s $1.25 billion coronavirus relief fund. Bullock urged residents to continue following public health guidelines to avoid the spread of the virus. He said he doesn’t expect the state will meet the guidelines to fully reopen anytime soon, especially because other states are seeing rising case numbers and hospitalizations.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The past 12 weeks at Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo & Aquarium have been perplexing for Dennis Pate, zoo director and CEO. On June 1, though, some semblance of normalcy returned when the zoo opened its gates with many changes and some cooperative weather. A few thousand visitors have strolled around the zoo each day since. The zoo has been open for nearly a week and looks much different amid the coronavirus pandemic. In a typical year, the zoo is open 364 – it’s closed only on Christmas Day. “It’s a step in the direction of normalcy,” Walter Jones, a zoo member who had three grandchildren with him Sunday, said of the reopening. And to be sure, the zoo is not back to normal yet. All indoor exhibits are closed, and visitors are funneled on a one-way walk around the zoo. More exhibits could open in the next two to three weeks, Pate said, depending on what visitor feedback is received and further evaluations of how the zoo can keep visitors safe. Along the one-way path are 50 hand-sanitizing stations, painted paw prints that visualize social distancing recommendations and concession stands with plastic shields between employees and visitors. Adhering to the state’s directed health measure, the zoo allows no more than 3,000 people in at a time. This week, zoo director and CEO Dennis Pate said, the zoo has seen from 1,500 people per day earlier in the week to just more than 3,000 people on Saturday. Pate described the zoo’s financial situation as “struggling mightily.” As a nonprofit, 91% of the zoo’s income comes from admissions, memberships and other sales.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The famous Las Vegas buffet has become a victim of the coronavirus pandemic, which shut down casinos statewide for nearly three months. Although casinos began to reopen June 4, the state has not yet given the green light for self-serve restaurants. With the highly contagious virus still circulating – it is usually transmitted by airborne respiratory droplets – the communal dining concept is facing serious challenges. At Red Rock Resort, a Station Casinos property, several restaurants reopened ahead of the rest of the property, but there was no timeline for reopening the popular Feast Buffet. Station Casinos is opening its properties in phases. Earlier this month, San Diego-based Garden Fresh Restaurants, owner of Souplantation and Sweet Tomatoes with several Las Vegas-area buffet restaurants, announced the closure of all 97 locations nationwide. Golden Corral, with locations in Las Vegas and Henderson, reopened earlier this month by serving customers cafeteria-style. But Donald Contursi, founder of Lip Smacking Foodie Tours, said it would be a mistake to assume the Las Vegas buffet is gone forever. “Health and safety is at the forefront now, but I believe that, if Las Vegas has been reinventing itself over and over all these years, it will find a way to reinvent the buffet to ensure its guests are safe,” Contursi said. Larry Rogers, manager of the Southern Nevada Health District’s food operations division, said a shift to cafeteria-style service or having a server take buffet orders at the table will likely become common for the foreseeable future.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A racetrack that violated state orders during the coronavirus pandemic will be allowed to reopen this weekend ahead of other similar businesses. Riverside Speedway in Groveton held races in late May despite being warned by police that doing so would violate the state’s order prohibiting large gatherings. After being told the state was planning legal action, the owner postponed the rest of the season and then sued Gov. Chris Sununu over the restrictions. A judge held a hearing on the speedway’s request for an emergency order blocking the restrictions Friday, a day after Sununu announced that racetracks would be allowed to reopen Monday. While the case proceeds, attorneys for both sides agreed that Riverside could hold races this weekend if it follows rules regarding limited capacity, social distancing and cleaning. Joe Bassett, general manager at Lee USA Speedway in Lee, said he doesn’t think it’s fair that Riverside is getting special treatment after violating the order. “But he’s between a rock and a hard place, as all short tracks are,” he said. “We have limited time in summer to make our money, yet we have bills 12 months of the year.” Bassett said his track will likely reopen June 19, though it will be a scramble. He asked fans to be patient. “I’ve got three weeks’ worth of planning to make it work in a week,” he said. “But we’ll get things rolling.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAsbury Park: The city backed off on its plans to offer indoor dining beginning Monday, in defiance of a state order. The City Council had authorized restaurants last week to offer indoor dining with restrictions beginning Monday, violating Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy’s executive order. After the state sued on Friday and a judge issued an order temporarily blocking the town’s attempt, Mayor John Moor and the council released a statement Friday night recommending that restaurants not serve diners indoors. “We are advising Asbury Park businesses not to open indoors as we had announced earlier this week, as opening indoors would violate the court order and could jeopardize your business’s liquor licenses” and subject businesses to fines and other penalties, the statement said. As part of the second phase of the state’s efforts to reopen its economy, Murphy has authorized outdoor dining and nonessential retail to resume Monday but hasn’t authorized indoor dining. Murphy said Friday he would crack down on businesses that weren’t in compliance. Asbury Park’s resolution would have permitted restaurants to host diners inside at 25% of the building’s capacity or 50 people, whichever is fewer. Murphy has not indicated when restaurants will be able to reopen for indoor seating, aside from saying he hoped it would be “sooner rather than later.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Albuquerque Public Schools, the state’s largest school district, has asked parents for feedback after announcing plans to provide an online school experience for all grades because of the coronavirus pandemic. “Families have definitely indicated that there is a desire for some families to keep their children home,” said Deborah Elder, the district’s innovation executive director. “We just don’t know how big that desire is.” The district expects to launch an online system to collect input through a form or survey on the all-online school experience idea, officials said. It is unclear when that system would launch. Submitted comments could help the district gauge how many children are expected to take part and how many teachers would need to prepare, Elder said. An online-only education is a new concept for the district, officials said, adding that it would likely rely on parents, especially for younger-aged students, but they recognize not every family would be able to do that. The district is considering other options as well to begin the school year, including traditional in-school learning and a possible combination of in-school and distance learning, officials said.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Upset by “rampant” violations of New York’s pandemic-fighting restrictions, Gov. Andrew Cuomo threatened Sunday to pull liquor licenses of scofflaw restaurants and even reinstate closings in areas where local governments fail to enforce rules. Manhattan and Long Island’s tony Hamptons were singled out as problem areas by Cuomo, who said the state has received 25,000 complaints of reopening violations. He said the violations endanger the state’s fragile progress in the fight against the new coronavirus as it slowly relaxes restrictions enacted in March. “We are not kidding around with this. You’re talking about jeopardizing people’s lives,” Cuomo said at his daily briefing. The warning comes a day after the Democractic governor reacted sternly to a short Twitter video from New York City of young people enjoying a warm day packed tightly on a city street, many without masks. New York officials are trying to avoid the fate of states seeing a surge in new cases after reopening. New York’s coronavirus-related hospitalizations are declining and the state recorded 23 deaths Saturday, the lowest one-day coronavirus death toll since the early days of the crisis.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nPine Hall: Stock car racing has turned into the leading battleground over COVID-19 crowd restrictions in North Carolina, as track owners have taken their fight to reopen to the streets and to court. But on Saturday, a protest at one race track attracted so few people that the demonstration was legal under the state’s restrictions. The News & Observer reported that at 311 Speedway in Stokes County, fewer than 25 people showed up to protest, despite a live band and a free cheeseburger and fries with a ticket purchase. Gov. Roy Cooper’s coronavirus restrictions limit outdoor gatherings to 25 people. Even as the race began about 7 p.m., the stands sat largely empty. By sundown, the stands had nearly filled – hundreds more fans than the 25 allowed. But the protest had fizzled.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: City officials are debating whether to ask voters in November if they should legalize fireworks within city limits. The Bismarck Tribune reported voters banned possession of fireworks within city limits in 1988 and affirmed that stance a year later. But Mayor Steve Bakken has proposed legalizing fireworks, saying families should be able to spend quality time together in the city during the coronavirus pandemic. “I think there is something we can do to clean this up a little bit and maybe relax some more statutes,” Bakken said during a city commission meeting. “People are looking for things to do with their families outside while social distancing, and shooting off fireworks fits that perfectly.” Commissioner Shawn Oban questioned why the commission was discussing legalizing fireworks when there has been no public demand for such a move. He also pointed to statistics showing a drop in police, fire and ambulance calls during the 1988 Fourth of July celebration after the ban was enacted. “I don’t see a hard enough ‘why’ to put it on the ballot,” he said. The commission planned to continue discussion after July 4.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati:A petition to remove the mask requirement at the Kings Island amusement park had more than 3,800 signatures Saturday morning, according to change.org. Those with season passes can return to the amusement park between July 2 and July 11, and the park will reopen to daily ticket holders on July 12. But the reopening comes with new protocols, officials said. Guests will be required to make online reservations, socially distance while at the park, take temperature checks upon entry and follow other safety measures – including wear a mask. Kings Island states on its website that all guests, associates and vendors will be required to wear masks when the park reopens. The petition stated wearing masks at the park will be difficult because of “the heat and humidity alone.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: There were 225 new coronavirus cases in Oklahoma but no additional deaths, the State Department of Health said Saturday. There have been at least 8,073 confirmed cases and 359 deaths in the state, up from 7,848 cases reported Friday. The actual number of people who have contracted a virus is likely higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. A total of 6,495 Oklahoma residents have recovered from the illness, according to the department. Health officials on Friday warned of a spike in coronavirus cases in the Tulsa linked to indoor events and urged people attending such gatherings to take precautions. The warning comes ahead of President Donald Trump’s scheduled campaign rally in the city.For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms that clear up within weeks. But for others, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, the highly contagious virus can cause severe symptoms and be fatal. The vast majority of people recover.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Gov. Kate Brown has asked for a list of names by June 22 of inmates eligible for possible release to limit the spread of COVID-19 in the state prison system. The state Department of Corrections was asked to perform a “case-by-case analysis” of inmates who are vulnerable to the coronavirus and meet the outlined criteria for possible commutation, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported. The criteria includes inmates who are particularly vulnerable, those who have not been convicted of a crime against another person and those who have served at least half of their sentences, department officials said. About 100 inmates were identified. “Given what we now know about the disease and its pervasiveness in our communities, it is appropriate to release individuals who face significant health challenges should they contract COVID-19,” said Brown, a Democrat. Studies show distancing is a challenge in prisons and jails because people live in close quarters. A 2018 study also showed Oregon has an aging prison population and houses the highest percentage of inmates over age 55 in the country.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf asked the Pennsylvania Supreme Court on Friday to intervene in his dispute with legislative Republicans who are trying to end pandemic restrictions he imposed in March to slow the spread of the new coronavirus. Republican majorities in the House and Senate, with a few Democrats in support, voted this week to end the state’s emergency disaster declaration that Wolf has used to shut down “nonlife-sustaining” businesses, ban large gatherings and order people to stay at home. Wolf asked the state’s high court to uphold the shutdown. He said that his gradual reopening plan is working, pointing to a downward trend in the number of new virus infections in Pennsylvania even as cases rise in nearly half the states. “Pennsylvania’s measured, phased process to reopen is successful because of its cautious approach that includes factors relying on science, the advice of health experts and that asks everyone to do something as simple as wearing a mask when inside or around others outside the home,” Wolf said in a news release. “We will continue to move forward cautiously.” Wolf has been easing restrictions in vast swaths of the state, including on Friday when he announced that another eight counties would be moving to the least restrictive “green” phase of his reopening plan. But gyms, barber shops, theaters and similar businesses in the state’s highly populated southeast corner remain closed, and many types of businesses statewide must abide by occupancy limits.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: About 2% of Rhode Island residents have been infected with the new coronavirus, with infection rates apparently higher among the state’s minority populations, according to a state Department of Health study. The numbers aligned with prior department data that found that people of color in the state have been disproportionately affected by the disease, Dr. Philip Chan, an infectious disease consultant at the department said during a remote news conference Friday. The state provided blood tests to 1,032 volunteers to see if they had signs of a past infection. Overall, 2.2% had antibodies, which the body produces to fight an infection. The rates appeared higher in blacks and Latinos/Hispanics, but the numbers of people tested in those groups was small. The numbers were unexpectedly low, but Chan credited that to the state’s “robust response” to the pandemic. The state randomly selected 5,000 households to get the test at one of several Stop & Shop supermarket locations. More than one person from some households received a test, conducted last month. The numbers can be used by the state to better direct resources to where they are needed most, Chan said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Bowling alleys can now reopen in South Carolina after being closed for nearly three months to reduce the risk of coronavirus infections, even though the state’s COVID-19 case load is seeing its largest increases since the pandemic began. Gov. Henry McMaster issued a seventh state of emergency declaration Thursday, lifting any virus-related restrictions on the number of people inside stores and opening bowling alleys. The guidelines suggest that operators ask bowlers to bring their own balls and shoes, use only every other lane to maintain social distancing, make hand sanitizer available and put disinfectant on surfaces bowlers could touch. The additional relaxing of COVID-19 restrictions comes even though the virus continues to spread in South Carolina, which set another state record Friday with 770 new COVID-19 infections reported. McMaster has said the onus of stopping the spread is now on individuals who should wear masks, practice social distancing and wash hands. He said the state can’t shut down businesses and require people to stay home again. The governor can only issue a state of emergency for 15-day increments. Some members of the General Assembly have said the law requires the governor to consult them after each increment, but McMaster said he doesn’t have to do that because each declaration is distinct and different.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: The City Council is deciding whether to leave business restrictions becauser of the coronavirus pandemic in place for another month or leave the option open to business owners. The council passed emergency restrictions at the end of April that required restaurants, bars and other businesses serving customers to engage in certain practices meant to slow the spread of the virus. That includes cutting capacity in half, configuring tables to meet social distancing guidelines and requiring face masks for food service workers. The council was scheduled to discuss the options Monday, the Rapid City Journal reported. If extended, the restrictions would stay in place until July 10. Meanwhile, state health department officials reported Saturday that a woman in her 50s from Pennington County was the 75th person in the state to die from the virus. It is the eighth COVID-19 death in the county, which includes Rapid City.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville:The Nashville Symphony board of directors decided Friday to suspend programs until August 2021 and furlough its music director and other full-time staff and dozens of musicians because of the coronavirus pandemic. The symphony has had to cancel or reschedule more than 65 concerts and events since March and projects losses from the pandemic to reach $8 million, nearly 30% of its annual income, it said in a news release. The board voted to furlough 79 musicians and 49 full-time staff members, including Music Director Giancarlo Guerrero, effective July 1.“First and foremost, we are dedicated to ensuring the safety and well-being of our patrons, along with our musicians, staff and volunteers, board Chairman Mark Peacock said in the release. “That means doing everything we can to prevent the spread of COVID-19. With operational costs totaling $2.3 million every month, we also face an enormous financial risk because of the continuing uncertainty caused by this pandemic.” Nashville Musicians Association President Dave Pomeroy said the local wants to help work out details of the orchestra’s safe return when the time comes.\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso:Protests against the killing of George Floyd were held in the city on May 31, June 3, June 10 and June 11. Protests in support of El Paso police officers were also held June 10. The local health authority recommends participants in those protests monitor their health closely. “I would recommend that those people that participated in the marches get tested between five to seven days after exposure if they are asymptomatic (without symptoms),” said City/County Health Authority Dr. Hector Ocaranza said in a statement. Testing should come sooner if a person develops symptoms for the virus, he said. Coronavirus symptoms include fever, cough and loss of taste and smell. Those who develop symptoms “should be tested as soon as possible because there is community spread so someone might have contracted the virus somewhere else before the marches and maybe started experiencing symptoms one or two days after the march,” Ocaranza said. “You must always listen to your body.” Gov. Greg Abbott has directed the Texas Division of Emergency Management to work with cities where there have been large-scale protests to expand testing at walk-up and drive-thru sites.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:Bicycling has become a major hit for St. George in the era of COVID-19, but it could extend far beyond pandemic times and become commonplace activity for residents in the future. “There are some big projects coming in the next few years that will huge for connectivity and will make it all the more accessible for people to solely ride bikes if they want to,” said Dannielle Larkin, a member of the city council. “Or just have it be an addition to their travel if they want to have a car and bike, it just gives options and is a great healthy alternative.” St. George has long been a destination for people who like to spend time outdoors. But with the introduction of COVID-19 on American shores earlier this year, it became clear that being outside and around others would become increasingly rare. So the people of St. George started hitting the streets with their bikes instead. “Bikes are the new toilet paper and it’s super awesome,” Red Rock Cycling Co. employee Logan Toomer said. “People are getting out and being active and it’s great to see.”\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Gov. Phil Scott expressed disappointment at the scale of the Legislature’s coronavirus-related economic recovery package as well as the pace at which lawmakers have moved on it. Three weeks ago, the Republican governor proposed a $400 million package of federal funds, including $310 million for small businesses, agriculture, housing and consumers. “We were inclusive in this work in hopes that it would move through the Legislature quickly and largely intact. Unfortunately, it doesn’t appear that it’s going to be the case as they’re only including about a third of the money we recommended,” he said. Instead, the Vermont House on Friday passed a package that would use just $93 million in federal funds allocated for the coronavirus response. It includes $50 million in emergency economic recovery grants to businesses, $20 million in grants to be distributed by local, regional, and state economic development organizations, and $23 million for the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board for grants to nonprofit housing partners, service organizations and for shelter facilities. The Legislature said other relief packages using the federal funds will follow. The Legislature did not use Scott’s plan because lawmakers found that some of the administration’s proposed uses for the funds were not authorized, and any loans made with the funds had to be paid back to the federal government by the end of December, a timeline that wouldn’t work for many businesses that did not want to take on more debt, House Speaker Mitzi Johnson’s office said.\n\nVirginia\n\nAlexandria: A medical supply company created by two political consultants during the coronavirus pandemic have filed a lawsuit alleging that officials at a Virginia bank caused the firm to lose a $600 million equipment order and ruined its reputation. The Washington Post reported that in the lawsuit filed in federal court in Alexandria on Friday, Blue Flame Medical LLC alleged that officers of Chain Bridge Bank improperly told California officials that the company might be “fraudulent,” prompting the state to suspend its contract with Blue Flame and demand return of a $450 million down payment. State and local officials across the country ran into a confusing international market as they sought to secure personal protective equipment this spring. The lawsuit alleges that the Republican consultants who founded Blue Flame – John Thomas and Michael Gula – suffered damage to their personal reputations as a result of the bank’s actions. Chain Bridge Bank rejected the claims. The bank “acted properly and fulfilled its legal and regulatory responsibilities,” spokesman Rich Danker said. Ethan Bearman, Blue Flame’s general counsel, said the lawsuit was the beginning of a process “of setting the record straight” about Blue Flame. He said the company “has persevered and completed deliveries to satisfied customers.”\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The Washington Department of Health said coronavirus infections are on the increase in the eastern and western sides of the state. The situation report said state epidemiologists have seen a particularly large increases in Benton, Yakima, Spokane and Franklin counties, but said the latest data through the end of May indicates likely increases in infections across the state. The results, the report said, included increases in coronavirus transmission over Memorial Day weekend, but not infections that might have occurred during recent protests that have drawn tens of thousands of people together in cities and towns across the state. The Seattle Times reported that Gov. Jay Inslee warned that the report indicates that “cases and deaths will soon increase substantially if COVID-19 continues to spread at the current levels.” Inslee said outbreaks in Benton, Franklin and Yakima counties are of “particular concern” and said he joined scientists and health and political leaders in those communities during a conference Saturday. The DOH report stated that six Washington counties – Yakima, Klickitat, Benton, Franklin, Spokane and Stevens – have not yet reached their peak number of COVID-19 cases.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A coronavirus outbreak at a church has caused at least 17 virus cases, prompting Gov. Jim Justice to call in the National Guard for decontamination work, state officials said Saturday. The Greenbrier County church has closed for 14 days, and health officials started contact tracing to try to contain the virus’s spread, the Department of Health and Human Resources said. It’s the most recent of five confirmed COVID-19 outbreaks at churches in West Virginia, officials said. “I want to strongly encourage all West Virginians, especially when in church settings, to follow the guidelines and use every other pew, maintain social distancing and please wear masks,” Justice said in a release. “A lot of the attendance at our churches are those that are elderly and at higher risk, so we are cautioning everyone to strictly follow our guidelines.” The governor warned that things “will only get rougher” if people don’t follow health guidelines until a vaccine becomes available. Justice ordered the National Guard to go immediately to the site to begin decontamination, the state said. The governor also directed officials to hold two additional free testing events in Greenbrier County. The other counties where coronavirus outbreaks have occurred in churches are Boone, Hampshire, Jefferson, and Marshall counties, state officials said. To protect the possibility of identifying people, they said, the churches will not be named by the health and human resources department.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:University of Wisconsin System officials are offering campuses guidelines for reopening this fall amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that the system released the guidelines Sunday. They include putting classes of more than 50 students online, having a plan if COVID-19 cases spike, reevaluating dorm and dining operations, using masks and keeping students that share classes together in the dorms. Rob Cramer, system vice president for administration, said the recommendations are broad so individual chancellors can decide how to handle reopening. Some UW schools said dorms will be open and be allowed to fill to capacity. Schools also are creating isolation areas where sick students would be quarantined but could still access their courses online and have food delivered to them. Mask requirements will vary from campus to campus. UW-Platteville Chancellor Dennis Shields told the Journal Sentinel that students who won’t wear masks might not be allowed to attend his university. UW-Madison has yet to announce any reopening plans. A UW-Madison spokesman told the Journal Sentinel that school might release something by next week.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The Legislature will not be meeting in a special session later this month after lawmakers said they completed work they needed to accomplish in response to immediate economic and social impacts caused by the coronavirus pandemic. House Speaker Steve Harshman and Senate President Drew Perkins said in a joint letter that an anticipated five-day special session expected in late June is no longer necessary, the Casper Star-Tribune reported. “We are confident the Governor will implement our legislative directives addressing the needs of the State without the Legislature meeting in the near term,” the letter said. The announcement came after several committees were working on proposals to address the impacts of COVID-19. The decision was made in part because of the lack of federal action, Harshman said, adding that another special session could be held either later this summer or in the fall depending on the state’s needs. Republican Gov. Mark Gordon’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/06/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/06/21/arthur-ashe-missing-marilyn-pacifier-eating-pup-news-around-states/39609687/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: A man wanted on drug and weapons charges has posted a video denying he fed methamphetamine to a so-called attack squirrel that he considers a pet. Mickey Paulk posted the video on his Facebook page Tuesday night as authorities continued searching for him. It shows him stroking a rodent that he indicates was the same one seized during a search and then released by authorities. “You can’t give squirrels meth; it would kill ’em. I’m pretty sure, (but) I’ve never tried it,” he said. Paulk said the squirrel was safe and not a threat to anyone. “The public isn’t in danger in any kind of way from the methed-out squirrel in the neighborhood,” he said with a laugh. He also said Wednesday that he was working with an attorney and relatives on a plan for turning himself in to authorities. Paulk said he had “a few loose ends to tie up,” including getting the squirrel to a temporary home in Tennessee.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Federal marine biologists for the first time have recorded singing by one of the rarest whales on the planet, the North Pacific right whale. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration researchers used moored acoustic recorders to capture repeated patterns of calls made by male North Pacific right whales. It’s the first time right whale songs in any population have been documented, NOAA Fisheries marine biologist Jessica Crance says. She spoke to southern right whale and North Atlantic right whale experts to confirm that singing had not previously been documented. Researchers detected four distinct songs over eight years at five locations in the Bering Sea off Alaska’s southwest coast, Crance says. Only about 30 of the animals remain. Whalers nearly wiped out the slow-moving whales, which remain buoyant after they are killed.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: State test scores are improving, but only by a few percentage points. Early AzMERIT standardized test results show small increases in the percentage of students passing the test in most grade levels in reading and math. But the scores still show more than half the students in most categories, including in third-grade reading, aren’t passing the test. Arizona’s education leaders introduced AzMERIT, an attempt at a reinvigorated state standardized test, in 2015. Schools have a lot riding on test scores. School letter grades are largely decided by test scores, and high-achieving schools get extra funding under the results-based funding program. This is also the first year high schools were able to opt out of the AzMERIT test and choose a different assessment over AzMERIT, such as the ACT and SAT exams.\n\nArkansas\n\nMountain Home: Hickory Park will get a splash of color this weekend thanks to Care Center Ministries of Mountain Home. Volunteers with the ministry will meet at 9:30 a.m. Saturday at the downtown park to paint the pavilion, park benches, some of the playground equipment and sidewalks. Anyone is welcome to come lend a hand Saturday morning, pastor Ty Cotter said. “We’ll have extra gloves, glasses and paint. They just need to show up,” he said. On June 1, Care Center Ministries representatives and civic leaders gathered at Hickory Park for a ceremony where the nonprofit “adopted” the care and upkeep of the facility. Saturday’s event will be the official kickoff of Care Center Ministry’s park stewardship, but volunteers have already been inside the park performing some landscaping work.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Officials say someone climbed a more than two-story-tall Hollywood public art piece and stole a statue of Marilyn Monroe. The statue depicting Monroe in her iconic pose from the 1955 film “The Seven Year Itch” went missing early Monday from the “Four Ladies of Hollywood” gazebo. Los Angeles Councilman Mitch O’Farrell says a witness saw someone climb the gazebo on the Hollywood Walk Fame and saw off the statue. Los Angeles police say investigators have recovered fingerprints from the gazebo. The gazebo, erected in 1994, pays tribute to women in film, with depictions of Dolores Del Rio, Dorothy Dandridge, Mae West and Anna May Wong making up the structure’s pillars. Monroe, whose real name was Norma Jeane Mortenson, died in 1962.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A report indicates the Mile High City had the highest increase in the nation in its violent crime rate last year, but crime remains low compared with the most violent large U.S. cities. The Denver Post reports the city recorded 629 violent crimes per 100,000 residents, resulting in a 9% increase between 2017 and 2018. The report by the Brennan Center for Justice shows the rates of homicides, rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults in the 25 most populous U.S. cities dropped 4% on average last year. Denver Police Deputy Chief Barb Archer says the department didn’t find a specific cause driving the violence. The department says all categories of crime have declined or stayed level for first five months of 2019.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont has signed legislation that increases the minimum age to purchase cigarettes and other tobacco products to 21. The bill signed into law Tuesday by the Democrat also prohibits the sale of electronic cigarettes and vaping products to anyone under 21. The new law takes effect Oct. 1. Harold Wimmer, president and CEO of the American Lung Association, says such “Tobacco 21” laws are “more important than ever” given the increase in youth e-cigarette use. He says adolescents and young adults are uniquely vulnerable to the effects of nicotine and nicotine addiction, making Connecticut’s legislation “an important, life-saving measure.” The law also bans smoking on the grounds of child care centers and schools. Critics say it violates the rights of adults ages 18 to 21.\n\nDelaware\n\nBethany Beach: As thousands of people flock to Dover for Firefly Music Festival, one of the world’s rarest fireflies is battling for survival at beaches in the state. The Bethany Beach firefly, a rare species found in only seven unique habitats along Delaware’s southern coast, lost one this year to new residential construction, according to a local scientist who has studied the species. At that new development, beach houses are being built on million-dollar lots in a wetland that had been identified as home to the state’s most dense population of the fireflies. “Imagine if you start losing the species, but you still have a Firefly Festival. That connection is lost,” said Tara Cornelisse, a senior scientist at the Center for Biological Diversity. “I look to it as a beacon of hope, if we can protect it.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: District of Columbia lawmakers voted to add $47 million in excess reserves from the Washington Convention and Sports Authority to the city’s fiscal 2020 budget. The Washington Post reports $24 million will go toward fixing the city’s dilapidated public housing complexes. The rest will upgrade 911 dispatch centers. Tuesday’s approval came after a weeks­long dispute over whether the funds could be redirected from the reserve. The District’s chief financial officer, Jeffrey S. DeWitt, argued that using the funds would violate obligations to bondholders who invested in the convention center. He threatened not to certify the budget if the council redirected the money. However, a spokesman for DeWitt said the issue had been resolved Monday evening. Advocates said the money would cover renovating at least 400 units.\n\nFlorida\n\nHolmes Beach: Police trying to find the rightful owner of a prosthetic ear that washed up on their beach got a happy phone call from South Carolina on Thursday. Holmes Beach Police Sgt. Brian Hall said a woman called saying the rubber ear that police posted on Facebook belongs to her husband. Hall said the Beaufort couple was vacationing in the Tampa Bay area when the man went swimming. She said he was trying to put the ear in his pocket for safekeeping when “a wave knocked it off his hand.” The police department posted a photo of the left ear, saying a local resident found it in the sand Saturday after the “World’s Strongest Man” contest on Anna Maria Island. Prosthetic ears can cost thousands of dollars. Hall said the department will mail it to South Carolina. “We will put it in box. I hope nobody sees it and freaks out,” he said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state is shifting its presidential primary to late March, leaving the group of states that vote on Super Tuesday. The primary has been set for March 24, three weeks after Super Tuesday is held March 3, which Georgia has joined in past election cycles. The date announced Wednesday by Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger could relegate the state’s voters to a less influential position in deciding each party’s nominee. But it will also give state and county election officials a bit of breathing room in a tight timeline to replace the state’s outdated touchscreen voting machines. New touchscreen machines are in the process of being acquired, and a vendor has yet to be selected.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The U.S. Navy will christen a new guided missile destroyer, the USS Daniel Inouye, during a ceremony this weekend. U.S. Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii will speak at Saturday’s ceremony in Bath, Maine. Inouye’s widow, Irene Hirano Inouye, will be the ship’s sponsor. The Arleigh Burke-class ship is being named after the war hero and politician who broke racial barriers in Congress. Inouye represented Hawaii in the U.S. Senate for a half-century until his death in 2012. He played key roles in congressional investigations of the Watergate and Iran-Contra scandals and served as chairman of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee. He received the Medal of Honor for bravery in World War II with the mostly Japanese-American 442nd Regimental Combat Team. He lost his right arm.\n\nIdaho\n\nMoscow: The University of Idaho has ordered a student who owns a beverage company to stop using the name “Vandal Beer.” The Moscow-Pullman Daily News reports university officials sent the letter, citing trademark infringement, to Vandal Beer owner R. Austin Nielsen earlier this week. The school’s mascot is the Vandals. Nielsen announced plans last week for his company to start producing the gold pale ale in Coeur d’Alene next month, with plans to release it in north-central Idaho retail stores in August. Nielsen said he pitched the Vandal Beer idea to the University of Idaho a while ago, but school officials told him he wasn’t allowed to use the Vandal name. He said he came up with the idea while he was a student in the university’s Idaho Entrepreneurs program. Nielsen has said he will donate a portion of all Vandal Beer sales to University of Idaho scholarships.\n\nIllinois\n\nWauconda: A Civil War reenactment at a northeastern Illinois forest preserve is back on after the event was temporarily canceled by a county official over questions of its value, as well as the use of the Confederate flag. The (Waukegan) News-Sun reports Lake County Forest Preserves District President Angelo Kyle announced Wednesday that Civil War Days will still be held July 13-14 at Lakewood Forest Preserve in Wauconda. Kyle noted contractual obligations for the event that’s been held for 27 years and can draw up to 3,000 people. The announcement comes two days after Kyle canceled the event over concerns about the reenactment not telling the victims’ perspective and featuring many Confederate flags. Wayne Carle, who helps plan the event, says the reenactors put on the show to keep history alive.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette: Purdue University is planning several events commemorating the upcoming 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing commanded by school alumnus Neil Armstrong. The university says events begin July 18 with a presentation on the landing by Apollo 11 flight director Gene Kranz, followed by a July 20 screening of “Armstrong,” a new documentary film featuring home videos shot by Armstrong and unseen footage from NASA. Purdue will host a special exhibition of items from its Armstrong archives July 19-20. Other July 20 events include children’s activities on the Purdue Mall and a lunar module landing celebration timed around the 4:17 p.m. touchdown ahead of Armstrong becoming the first person to walk on the moon. Armstrong, a 1955 Purdue graduate, died in 2012 at age 82.\n\nIowa\n\nSioux City: A company that’s been fined thousands of dollars for the stink coming from its plant has lost its lawsuit targeting the city’s odor ordinance. The Sioux City Journal reports Judge Leonard Strand of the U.S. District Court in Sioux City granted the city of Sibley’s motion for a summary judgment. Strand disagreed with Iowa Drying & Processing’s contention that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague. Iowa Drying & Processing had said the city’s enforcement unfairly targeted the company and interfered with its efforts to sell the plant, which had drawn residents’ complaints for years. One resident, Josh Harms, sued Sibley after city officials threatened legal action against him for saying on a website that Sibley smelled like “rancid dog food.” Strand ruled against the city in Harms’ case.\n\nKansas\n\nHutchinson: Hutchinson Zoo director Ryan VanZant says last month’s flooding covered more than one-third of the zoo. The Hutchinson News reports the zoo – except for the gift shop and train – has been closed since May 21 after consecutive storms caused water to rise at the zoo. VanZant said in a Facebook post Wednesday that five buildings and two playgrounds were affected by flood waters. He said staff moved animals to safety ahead of the rising water and built temporary housing where the animals are being kept while waiting for the water to recede and the cleanup to begin. A Facebook fundraiser has been started to help cleanup costs. The Hutchinson Friends of the Zoo says the goal is to raise $10,000 before Family Fun Day on Aug. 17.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A state agency says it has secured another $5 million federal grant to continue a program providing youth-support services. Kentucky’s Department for Behavioral Health, Developmental and Intellectual Disabilities says the latest grant will continue the program through March 2024. The Transition Age Youth Launching Realized Dreams program allows youth ages 16 to 25 to easily access quality, developmentally appropriate, youth-driven support services. Officials say the goal is to help participants achieve their goals and transition into adulthood successfully. Officials say available services include expedited assistance in locating housing, mental health services and substance-abuse treatment. Since 2014, the program has helped more than 1,900 youth. Officials say youth and young adults can visit one of Kentucky’s 20 drop-in sites to access behavioral health services.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Billions of mosquito lookalikes are showing up in the area, blanketing car windshields, littering the ground with little bodies and even scaring some folks. They’re aquatic midges, often called “blind mosquitoes.” They don’t bite, and they’re good for the environment, but they’re a nuisance. Entomologist Nick Delisi of the St. Tammany Mosquito Abatement District says that “they tend to emerge in the billions.” Sloshing down bug-spattered windshields has become such a chore that the manager of the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway says Motorist Assistance Patrol trucks on the 24-mile-long bridge have had to replenish their water almost daily. Mosquito control officials say they don’t plan to do anything to control the swarms because they die in less than a week and their larvae clean up waterways.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The Legislature sent a proposal to the governor Wednesday to ditch the state’s presidential caucuses for a primary system that would be the nation’s first to allow voters to rank candidates. The Democratic-led Senate approved funding the bill, which had already passed the House. It now heads to Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, who hasn’t taken a position. As the 2020 presidential primary season nears, Maine is among an increasingly small handful of states that still have caucuses, including Iowa, Nevada and Wyoming. If primaries are approved, Maine voters will use ranked-choice voting to indicate which candidates they want delegates to support. That could get hairy in the Democratic primary, where more than 20 people are running.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A memorial dedication, gun violence forum and moment of silence are among the events scheduled for the one-year anniversary of the attack on The Capital Gazette newspaper that killed five employees. Police say a man with a history of harassing people at the paper shot and killed the journalists June 28, 2018, in its Annapolis newsroom. The Capital Gazette reports the attack will be formally remembered next week with a concert, the unveiling of a memorial garden, a forum on gun violence and a moment of silence. The events also coincide with Maryland’s first statewide observance of Freedom of the Press Day. At 2:33 p.m. June 28 – the time the gunman entered the newsroom – Tribune properties across the country will take a moment of silence for the victims.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A veterinary hospital got quite a surprise recently when a family brought in their bulldog after he stopped eating. The Angell Animal Medical Center found 19 baby pacifiers in the dog’s stomach. It started in April when the Wellesley family noticed that their 3-year-old dog, Mortimer, started getting nauseated before meals. His owner, Emily Shanahan, brought Mortimer to the vet, who prescribed medicine to take care of the issue. But it didn’t help, and Mortimer eventually stopped eating entirely. Shanahan went to Angell, where they took an X-ray and discovered the pacifiers. Vets think Mortimer had been taking the pacifiers from Shanahan’s two children over the course of months. The pacifiers were removed without surgery, and Mortimer has fully recovered and is back at home.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has ordered state agencies to step up efforts to reduce phosphorus pollution and otherwise improve water quality in Lake Erie. Whitmer signed an executive directive Thursday instructing three state departments to support the initiative. The departments of Agriculture and Rural Development; Environment, Great Lakes and Energy; and Natural Resources will submit annual progress reports. Michigan adopted guidelines last year for making Lake Erie healthier, including cutting phosphorus loading into its western basin 40% by 2025. Whitmer’s directive puts a focus on lessening nutrient inflows from the Detroit River, the River Raisin and the Maumee River.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Peter: An invasion of gnats is presenting a risk to the health and lives of livestock in this southern Minnesota town. The Mankato Free Press reports that gnats cause weight loss and stress for any animal with their bites and by gathering around eyes and in airways. Brooke Knisley, who runs an organic produce farm with her husband in St. Peter, says one of her friends has lost 16 chickens to the gnats this year. Knisley says she’s trying to reduce the risk for her own flock by running fans in the chicken coop, hanging fly strips and placing vanilla-soaked rags near where the gnats congregate. Gnats are also an irritant for cattle and horses, and many owners are keeping their animals inside until the invasion passes.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Persistent flooding across wildlife management areas has decimated some wildlife habitats and food supplies, leading the state to allow supplemental deer feeding in Issaquena and Warren counties. The executive director of the state Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks says the deer stuck on a flooded levee have depleted their resources. Russ Walsh says the stressed deer are in bad shape. Resident Melissa Lyons raises two cattle on the levee and says that “the only things thriving are the buzzards.” She says the deer are starved and weak, and her husband recently removed 20 dead deer from their hay field. Supplemental feeding requires a wildlife agency permit that expires this fall.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: McDonald’s has started a trans-Atlantic barbecue feud with the introduction of a Kansas City-themed hamburger in the U.K. Outgoing Mayor Sly James said Tuesday that the fast-food chain should “stay in your lane” in a tweet that included a picture of what he says a “real” burger looks like. Kansas City is known for its style of dry-rubbed, slow-cooked meats drizzled in tomato-molasses sauce. Other Twitter users rushed to join the mocking after McDonald’s proclaimed “Yeehaw” as it promoted its “Kansas City Stack” on social media. Barbecue powerhouse Q39 kidded “Yeehaw, mate!” while Joe’s Kansas City Bar-B-Que retweeted a scathing critique of the burger along with a slew of various laughing emojis. McDonald’s says the bacon-topped burger is available until June 25, but not in America.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: AT&T has started dropping cellphone customers in the state’s northeast, citing customers’ regular data use outside its service area. The Billings Gazette reports the company began notifying customers earlier this year that they would lose their mobile coverage. AT&T spokeswoman Suzanne Trantow says the company can no longer be the primary provider for a “small number of customers who live or have a billing address outside our owned network coverage area.” She declined to give the specific area or the number of customers dropped. Verizon dropped the rural Montana customers in 2017, citing the costs of customers using data while roaming off its network. Scobey-based Nemont Telephone Cooperative has become the only provider for some parts of the region, but T-Mobile has been expanding operations.\n\nNebraska\n\nMcCook: Family Fun Nights have been scheduled for the summer at Red Willow State Recreation Area. The state Game and Parks Commission says a typical Family Fun Night begins at 6 p.m. with a meal provided by the park. Events start at 7 p.m. and include kayaking, fishing and archery. All equipment is provided. Just before dark, everyone heads back to the campfire to finish off the evening with s’mores. Family Fun Nights are scheduled for June 26, July 5 and 19, and Aug. 2. The park sits about 11 miles north of McCook, just west of U.S. Highway 83. A park entry permit is required.

The Las Vegas City Council approved the program in 2016 and voted Wednesday to activate it for a month. Anyone who is issued a fine between June 19 and July 19 can clear it by taking new, unwrapped school supplies to the city’s parking services offices on Main Street. The donation has to be made within 30 days of receiving a parking ticket. The supplies must be of value equal to or greater than the fine. A receipt also is required. The supplies will be given to the Teacher Exchange, which serves about 390 schools in southern Nevada. It’s part of the Public Education Foundation.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A committee of lawmakers has reached a compromise on changes to the state’s new work requirements for Medicaid recipients. The rules, which are just starting to take effect, require most recipients to spend at least 100 hours a month working, going to school or participating in community service. The House and Senate passed different versions of a bill to broaden the allowed exemptions and end the work requirements entirely if 500 people lost coverage. A committee reached a compromise Thursday to suspend, but not eliminate, coverage for noncompliance. The state would have until July 2021 to waive the requirements in several scenarios, including if the state is unable to contact all participants to explain the rules. The full Legislature will vote on the amended bill next week.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy has signed legislation requiring ride-hailing services to show additional identification after the March death of a University of South Carolina student who police say got into the car of an Uber impersonator. Among the new requirements is that ride-hailing services must issue two identifying markers to each driver. They must be displayed on the front windshield and rear window. Murphy, a Democrat, signed the legislation Thursday in Robbinsville, the hometown of Samantha “Sami” Josephson. The act is known as Sami’s Law. Police say Josephson got into the car of an Uber driver impersonator in Columbia, South Carolina. She was killed and her body dumped in the woods 65 miles away. A man has been charged with kidnapping and murder in the case.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLovington: Lea County has approved more than $5 million in upgrades to an airport in the heart of the state’s booming oil region. The Hobbs News-Sun reports the county commission gave the green light last week to improvements to the Lea County Regional Airport – most funded by federal and state grants. The improvements call for doubling the expansion of the holding area for flight patrons and renovating the apron area on the airside of the terminal. They also including upgrading a runway safety area and extending the primary runway. Officials say increased ridership is spurring the recommended improvements. The Lea County Regional Airport is located in Hobbs – a key city in the booming Permian Basin.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Artist Kehinde Wiley will unveil his first monumental public sculpture in Times Square this fall in response to Confederate statues nationwide. Times Square Arts, the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts and gallery owner Sean Kelly announced Thursday that the bronze “Rumors of War” sculpture features a young black man dressed in urban streetwear mounted atop a horse. The project originated when Wiley saw Confederate Gen. J.E.B. Stuart’s monument in Richmond, Virginia. Wiley is known for his paintings of black Americans and his commissioned portrait of President Barack Obama, displayed at the National Portrait Gallery. He says the new statue’s inspiration is war and “an engagement with violence.” “Rumors of War” will display in Times Square from Sept. 27 to December before finding a permanent home at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nOak Island: Advocates for sea turtles say a hefty fine is in store for whoever dug into a nest of loggerhead sea turtle eggs. The Oak Island Sea Turtle Protection Program says the nest was tampered with Monday. Sand was displaced from the covered hole, and it was burrowed into. The News & Observer reports none of the eggs were broken or harmed. But the group wants beachgoers to know that disturbing sea turtle nests carries a federal fine up to $50,000 and possible prison time. Last week, a woman was arrested in Miami after police said she stomped on sea turtle nests and poked them with a stake. Loggerhead turtles are protected under the Endangered Species Act.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state’s female prison population has reached capacity, leaving some inmates in the custody of counties. The Bismarck Tribune reports that the state’s female prison population reached capacity for the first time in May. Under 2017 legislation, county inmates are transferred to state prisons based on the severity of crimes, medical needs and other factors. Last week, only six of 12 inmates intended for movement from county to state were admitted. The statewide system for women has a daily average capacity of 224 inmates. Donnell Preskey, who represents the North Dakota Association of Counties, says a mechanism must be established to reimburse counties for the cost of holding inmates who should be in state facilities.\n\nOhio\n\nBrecksville: A national park that protects about a quarter of the Cuyahoga River is preparing to celebrate the river’s health 50 years after it infamously caught fire. A ceremonial torch traveling the length of the 85-mile-long river will make a stop in Cuyahoga Valley National Park on Friday afternoon on its way to Cleveland. The public event comes one day before the 50th anniversary of the June 22, 1969, fire. It will feature the passing of the Xtinguish Torch Fest torch along with music, poetry and the unveiling of a new sculpture. Speakers, including a regional director of the National Park Service, will outline efforts to restore the river from its abysmal earlier condition to a vibrant place for wildlife and outdoor recreation.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Jet engine maker Pratt & Whitney has announced plans to expand its operations at Tinker Air Force Base. Pratt & Whitney Vice President Kevin Kirkpatrick, Gov. Kevin Stitt and Mayor David Holt announced what is called a “multimillion-dollar investment” to expand its military aftermarket services at the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Complex based at Tinker. The project is also expected to add more than 100 jobs. Pratt & Whitney is a division of Farmington, Connecticut-based United Technologies Corp. and performs engine services and maintenance for the Air Force at Tinker.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Gov. Kate Brown deployed the state police Thursday to try to round up Republican lawmakers who fled the Capitol in an attempt to block a vote on a landmark climate plan that would be the second of its kind in the nation. Minority Republicans want the cap-and-trade proposal aimed at dramatically lowering the state’s greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 to be sent to the voters for approval instead of instituted by lawmakers. Negotiations with Democrats fell apart late Wednesday, prompting conservatives to pursue a walkout, said Kate Gillem, a spokeswoman for Senate Republicans. Some members have even left the state to avoid a vote, Gillem said. State police don’t have jurisdiction beyond state lines. Democrats have an 18-to-12 majority in the chamber but need 20 members present for a quorum.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: A mural by the artist who painted the official portrait of Michelle Obama is being dedicated in the city. Amy Sherald’s overall body of work represents everyday lives of black Americans. So it’s fitting that the 6-story-tall mural dedicated Thursday portrays Najee Spencer-Young, a 19-year-old participant in Philadelphia’s Mural Arts education program. Sherald tells the Philadelphia Inquirer she chose Spencer-Young during a class trip to her studio. The artist saw it as an opportunity to boost the self-esteem of the teenager and those who look like her. The mural depicts Spencer-Young in a black-and-white flower print trench coach and mustard yellow hat, looking confident and composed – and very imposing – against a bright blue background.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo signed a bill Wednesday to preserve federal abortion protections in state law. The Senate passed the bill and immediately transmitted it to the House, which resumed its session to pass it. Raimondo signed it in her office, calling it an “important, consequential bill.” “Fundamentally this bill is about health care,” she said. Rhode Island is one of the Democratic-led states taking steps to enshrine the right to an abortion should the U.S. Supreme Court ever overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. Raimondo said she wanted to sign quickly, in light of the uncertainty across the nation. The new law says the state will not restrict the right to an abortion prior to fetal viability or afterward if an abortion is necessary for the health or life of the mother.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A zoo plans to send off two African elephants in order to bring in Southern white rhinos. Riverbanks Zoo and Garden of Columbia announced Wednesday that 48-year-old Robin and 37-year-old Belle will soon join a larger herd. The zoo says the public can attend special activities before the elephants leave. The destination for the elephants hasn’t been determined. Zoo officials say 13 elephants have lived at Riverbanks since 1973. The zoo says there is a chance elephants will return in the future. Director of Animal Care and Welfare John Davis says the zoo hopes to add more space and manage a breeding group one day. Southern white rhinos haven’t lived at the zoo since 1989. The new exhibit is scheduled to open next year.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The Sioux Falls Freemasons and Architecture Inc. opened a time capsule Wednesday afternoon, revealing multiple artifacts the Masons had placed downtown nearly a hundred years ago. Lisa VandeVoort, business manager at Architecture Inc., said the time capsule – placed on June 6, 1924 – was opened as renovations were being done to the building. The Masons never specified a date to open the capsule, VandeVoort said, “so doing it during renovations made sense.” Dozens of items were removed from a box set in the building’s cornerstone, including a Masonic Bible, several editions of the Argus Leader and a typewritten copy of the address read during the time capsule ceremony 95 years ago. The capsule also included a sealed envelope with stamps from the time, as well as a handbook for new owners of telephones.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The three new eagles at Radnor Lake State Park’s Barbara J. Mapp Aviary Education Center are finally ready to meet the public. After months of park staff working to acclimate the eagles to their new environment, Radnor hosted a free open house Thursday, for American Eagle Day, for bird lovers to get at least a glimpse of the majestic creatures. “One of the long-term goals has been to have captive bald eagles (that could not be released back into the wild due to their injuries) in the aviary where visitors could interact with them,” Radnor Park manager Steve Ward said. The two bald eagles are housed in the park’s new $110,000 flighted aviary, a 38-foot-tall netted enclosure that gives the birds freedom of movement and protects them from other predatory wildlife within the natural area. The golden eagle has its own enclosure.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: A federal law enforcement official says the FBI received a call three years ago about the 22-year-old man who opened fire on a courthouse downtown. Brian Isaack Clyde was shot and killed Monday by security officers at the Earle Cabell Federal Building. There were no other serious injuries or deaths in the attack. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, says a member of Clyde’s family called a national tip line to say he was suicidal and had a fascination with guns. The official said the July 1, 2016, call expressed concern for Clyde but did not contain a specific threat and was therefore not investigated. It came while Clyde was enlisted in the U.S. Army. Clyde’s mother, Nubia Brede Solis, told The Dallas Morning News that his half-brother had called the FBI with concerns.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A state commission has agreed to provide a $21.4 million grant to a multicounty coalition for a proposed new 80-mile rail route to haul crude oil from eastern Utah to existing Union Pacific tracks northwest of Price in Carbon County. The Salt Lake Tribune reports that the Community Impact Board last week approved the funding for the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition for planning and environmental reviews. Supports say the planned Uinta Basin Railway would help Uintah and Duchesne counties develop their energy-dependent economies and reduce tanker traffic on highways. The coalition has contracted with the investment bank Drexel Hamilton, which will commit between $5 million and $15 million of its own funds, to raise private capital, commercialize the project and secure a partner to operate the rail line.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state Department of Fish and Wildlife is reminding people not to release aquarium fish into the wild. It is illegal to release the fish into Vermont waters. While most tropical fish are unlikely to become established in Vermont waters due to the cold weather, biologists say that if the aquarium fish survive and reproduce in the wild, they can be difficult – if not impossible – to control or eradicate. They can also cause changes in the native aquatic environment by competing with native species and introducing exotic parasites and diseases. Vermont biologists recently discovered goldfish, which are native to China, living in the sewer drains of Williston, which connect to public waters. Aquarium plants can also pose a threat if they are released into the wild.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The state plans to mark four centuries of black history with a new exhibit and a tribute to tennis star Arthur Ashe Jr. The exhibit begins with the 1619 arrival in Virginia of the first enslaved Africans in English North America and continues all the way to the present day. “Determined: The 400-Year Struggle for Black Equality” will open Saturday at the Virginia Museum of History & Culture in Richmond as the city officially dedicates Arthur Ashe Boulevard. Renowned civil rights activist Rep. John Lewis of Georgia will be the keynote speaker. The exhibit features dozens of artifacts to tell the story of black Virginians, including slavery-era restraints, an African-inspired banjo and a stool from a Richmond lunch counter where students held a sit-in to protest segregation.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The proof is in the pee. A new federally funded study has confirmed, not surprisingly, that marijuana use went up in the state after its first legal pot stores opened in 2014. In fact, consumption doubled over three years – a conclusion scientists reached after performing the decidedly unglamorous work of analyzing raw sewage. The researchers tested wastewater from Tacoma, a city whose drug-use trends tend to mirror those of Seattle, for a substance that is produced when people metabolize the active ingredient in pot. It is excreted in urine. The researchers said they can’t tell whether the increase in metabolites means more people are using weed or the same old users are consuming more of it. Another possible explanation is that the THC products sold legally in stores are more potent than what was commonly available on the black market.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: State agricultural officials are warning about a fungal disease that attacks boxwood shrubs. The Department of Agriculture says in a news release that boxwood blight has been detected on residential and commercial landscapes throughout the state. Boxwood blight produces dark brown leaf spots and causes rapid defoliation that sometimes kills young boxwoods. It’s found in more than two dozen states and was first detected in West Virginia on plants shipped from out-of-state nurseries in 2015. The statement says residents should buy shrubs from reputable nurseries and only buy plants that appear healthy. Gardeners and landscapers should sanitize gardening tools between different plantings of boxwoods.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state Assembly has approved a bill that would require online vendors like Amazon to collect and remit sales taxes from third-party sellers in perpetuity, a move that would trigger income tax cuts. Under the bill, revenue from the tax collections would be used to cover reductions in the lowest- and second-lowest income tax brackets. According to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, taxpayers could expect an average reduction of $27 for tax year 2019 and an average reduction of $59 in tax year 2020 under the new rates. The Assembly passed the bill Thursday afternoon on a voice vote. The measure goes next to the state Senate. Coupled with an income tax cut plan Republicans inserted in the state budget, taxpayers could expect a total annual reduction of $91 in 2019 and $124 in 2020.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Some rodeo circuit cowboys say they will boycott this year’s Cheyenne Frontier Days rodeo because of the new, tournament-style format the “Daddy of ’em All” adopted in roping and steer wrestling events. Under the new format, slack will now become a qualifying round to make it into the rodeo performances in steer roping, tie-down roping, team roping and steer wrestling. Each performance will see event winners and money paid out, and the contestants will start with a clean slate in the finals. Tie-down roper Hunter Herrin tells KGAB-AM the change means cowboys will compete more for less money. Cheyenne Frontier Days Rodeo Chairman Chad Mathews tells the Wyoming Tribune Eagle the new format means a better spectator experience and payouts to more contestants.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/07/17/saving-whales-manson-murder-house-news-around-states/39695071/", "title": "50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nPrattville:The law that allows Sunday alcohol sales from retail stores in the city with valid state-issued liquor licenses goes into effect Aug. 1. Sales will be allowed with no time constraints. The city council approved the move during the board’s Tuesday night meeting. The ordinance passed 6-0-1, with District 3 Councilwoman Denise Brown abstaining. She serves as executive director of the Autauga Interfaith Care Center, a nondenominational charity. Last year, the council approved off-premises Sunday sales in the Elmore County portion of Prattville, after the Elmore County Commission got Legislative approval to allow the sales.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Residents of rural parts of the state will be hit with rising energy costs after a statewide funding change. The state’s Energy Desk reported that the Legislature annually transfers money from state accounts into the Constitutional Budget Reserve. Officials say a $1 billion energy account used to offset costs for rural communities is included in the transfer known as “the sweep.” Lawmakers for the past 28 years have returned the funds, until this year, when they voted not to replenish the large savings account. Companies say homeowners’ bills could increase from an average of $80 up to thousands of dollars per month.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: The city’s Catholic leadership is planning to meet with local government officials about where the city can temporarily house migrants seeking asylum. The organization and county officials have a tentative agreement to move migrant families to unused portions of a Pima County juvenile detention center. Critics are opposed to placing migrants in any detention facility. Bishop Edward Weisenburger has said the hope is that migrants will feel safe and welcome as long as they are getting care.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The federal government says it will allocate an additional $7 million in funding over the next 10 years to expand internet access in rural areas of the state. The Federal Communications Commission announced Monday that the funds will provide broadband access to nearly 4,000 more rural homes and businesses. In May and June, the FCC authorized a total of $40.8 million in funding. About 15,000 more rural homes and businesses will be connected to the internet when the project is complete. The FCC says it will authorize more funding in the coming months. Providers will begin receiving money from the FCC this month.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: One of the houses where followers of Charles Manson committed notorious murders in 1969 is for sale. The home in the hilly Los Feliz district is where Leno and Rosemary LaBianca were slain the night after actress Sharon Tate and four others were murdered by Manson followers in Benedict Canyon. Redfin listing agent Robert Giambalvo tells the Los Angeles Times the two-bedroom home is priced at $1.98 million. The house has changed hands several times since 1969 and last sold in 1998.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins:Freight trains up to 3 miles long have been coming through the city with increasing frequency since January, according to a memo to City Council from traffic engineer Joe Olson. The “mega” trains, as Olson calls them, are in addition to regular train traffic on the BNSF Railway tracks that parallel College Avenue through much of the city. Typical trains are about a mile long. The biggest impact of a mega train is on traffic. Instead of blocking an intersection 3 to 4 minutes, like most trains, a mega train might take 15 minutes or more to pass through an intersection. Traffic backs up farther than usual and takes longer to recover. The most noticeable impacts are where the BNSF tracks cross College Avenue near Cherry Street, Olson’s memo noted. But impacts are felt all along the line, with several major east-west intersections blocked at the same time.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: The city is activating cooling centers for the public as it issues an excessive heat and humidity alert for the next several days. Mayor Toni Harp will start the alert at noon Wednesday while cooling centers will be open throughout the weekend and next week until further notice to provide relief from the excessive heat and humidity. Some of the cooling centers include libraries like the New Haven Public Library and the Fair Haven Branch Library. Public pools, senior centers, homeless shelters and city parks with “Splash pads,” which can be used for cooling off, will also be open.\n\nDelaware\n\nHarrington:When you’re expecting about 300,000 people for your 100th birthday party, you have to be creative when it comes to a birthday cake. That’s why the Delaware State Fair bought 30,000 packages of Tastykake Butterscotch Krimpets, which will be doled out each night to some festivalgoers as part of the fair’s centennial celebration. The 100th annual Delaware State Fair kicks off Thursday with a one-day adult admission price of $5, followed by nine more days of midway rides, decadent carnival foods, livestock competitions and entertainment ranging from Grammy Award winners to a demolition derby. General admission is $9 for adults all other days, $4 for children 6-12, and free for kids 5 and younger. More details are available online.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The leader of the D.C. Council is accused of trading roles and responsibilities to other council members in exchange for backing. The Washington Post reports Chair Phil Mendelson is accused of using the quid pro quo to pass a no-bid sports betting and lottery contract and block harsh penalties for a member accused of ethics violations. The allegations highlight the growing divide between the council’s older, moderate and mostly black leaders and more recently elected members, who are mostly white and younger than 50.\n\nFlorida\n\nGainesville: The Sunshine State is the top producer of watermelon in the United States, according to the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, which says Florida farmers sold 800 million pounds of watermelon last year. The largest growers are near Immokalee, Belle Glade, Arcadia and the Suwannee Valley, which produces a third of the state’s watermelon crop.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSt. Simons Island: A state biologist says beachgoers in Georgia helped keep about 30 pilot whales from stranding themselves on the shore. Clay George with the state Department of Natural Resources says the whales showed up Tuesday afternoon off the beach at St. Simons Island. Three whales beached themselves and died. But George says onlookers helped authorities wade into the water to prevent most of the whales from reaching the shore. George said harbor pilots spotted the whales in the nearby shipping channel, where he hoped they would follow the tide out to sea. George says the whales were likely confused as they usually stay more than 100 miles offshore. The American Cetacean Society says pilot whales are often involved in mass strandings partly because of their social nature.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Astronomers have indefinitely stopped looking through 13 existing telescopes at the summit of Mauna Kea while protesters block the road downslope to prevent the construction of a giant new observatory. Dozens of researchers around the world won’t be able to gather data and study the skies as a result. East Asian Observatory Deputy Director Jessica Dempsey says observations won’t resume until telescope staff have consistent access to the summit. The announcement came after Native Hawaiian protesters blocked the base of the road for a second day Tuesday. They oppose the $1.4 billion Thirty Meter Telescope out of concern it will harm an area some Native Hawaiians consider sacred. The new telescope is expected to be one of the world’s most advanced when it’s built.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Officials have approved a rewrite of the state’s 50-year-old mining law. Republican Gov. Brad Little and other members of the Idaho Land Board voted Tuesday to adopt rules intended to give mining companies the financial leeway to mine but also avoid leaving taxpayers paying for cleanup costs if a mining company goes bankrupt. The rules take effect immediately and come ahead of an Aug. 1 deadline set by the Legislature earlier this year. The Idaho Department of Lands plans to continue working on additional changes to the rules with public comments and bring them before lawmakers for their approval in the 2020 legislative session.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Officials with the Shedd Aquarium say a Beluga whale calf born less than two weeks ago is male. The aquarium’s animal care team confirmed the calf’s sex during a recent health exam. The baby whale and its mother are under 24-hour observation as the calf continues to grow and nurse. Aquarium officials say the data collected from the observation is shared with others who study wild beluga whale populations. The 38-year-old beluga, Mauyak, delivered earlier this month. Her calf was the first beluga calf at the lakefront aquarium in seven years.\n\nIndiana\n\nMichigan City: Witnesses say a toddler was rescued in Lake Michigan after he drifted away from his family on an inflatable duck. Dave Benjamin tells WBBM-TV that a boater finally grabbed the boy after the duck flipped over Monday, off Washington Beach in Michigan City. Benjamin tried to reach the boy on a paddleboard. He says there was a feeling of “exhaustion and high anxiety” as the child’s inflatable was carried away by the wind. The boy’s mother couldn’t immediately reach him.\n\nIowa\n\nDyersville: Officials say expansion by a Dubuque-based insurance broker is expected to bring more than 25 jobs to the city. The Telegraph Herald reports that Cottingham & Butler announced Monday that it will begin operating this fall in leased space that’s under construction. Cottingham & Butler’s Andy Butler says company officials have considered new locations as a way to accommodate current and future employees who live outside Dubuque. Cottingham & Butler employs 950 workers across 19 locations. About 650 work in the Dubuque area.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Attorney General Derek Schmidt says the U.S. Supreme Court’s fall docket includes three state cases, the first time that has happened in modern state history. Schmidt’s office will represent the state in all three cases. The first case to be heard this fall involves an appeal filed in a capital murder case filed by James Kraig Kahler, who killed four relatives in Burlingame in November 2009. Kahler argues Kansas law unconstitutionally prevented him from using an insanity defense. A second case arises from an identity theft case out of Johnson County and the third involves a Douglas County traffic stop. The Kansas Supreme Court overturned convictions in the last two cases, and the state is appealing.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: State officials say a company that specializes in CBD oil extraction and distillation plans to build a $6 million-plus manufacturing plant in Boyle County. Gov. Matt Bevin’s office says the venture will create up to 34 full-time jobs over a decade. State officials say the announcement by International Farmaceutical Extracts is the latest sign that Kentucky’s hemp industry is flourishing. Officials say the company plans to buy an existing facility in Danville for the operation. At full capacity, the plant will use hemp flowers from about 15,000 acres of local farms.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge:The state continues to sink with no help in sight, according to the latest National Geodetic Survey conducted with the help of Louisiana State University. New Orleans has fallen almost 6 inches since the first survey was conducted in 1989, but other cities farther north are also sinking. Alexandria dropped almost 2 inches during the past 30 years. Cliff Mugnier, LSU’s Chief of Geodesy, says the primary reason for the sinking is the levee system preventing the Mississippi River from flooding and depositing silt and sediment to replenish lost ground, although other factors like depleted groundwater aquifers can also contribute.\n\nMaine\n\nMadawaska: The state Forest Service is going to deploy wasps to help beat back an invasive pest species that can do damage to trees in the state. The service says the tiny, nonstinging wasps will be released Thursday to help control the emerald ash borer infestation in the state. It says the wasps feed in or on the borers by attacking their larvae under the bark of trees and parasitizing eggs on the surface of bark. The wasps will be released in Aroostook County in far northern Maine. The forest service says three species of wasps are being used in the pest control effort. The borer was located in Aroostook and York counties, at opposite ends of the state, in 2018.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: State regulators have scheduled two public comment hearings on a request by Washington Gas Light Company to increase its gas service rates by nearly $36 million. The Public Service Commission announced Monday it has scheduled a July 29 hearing in Rockville. It also announced an Aug. 6 public hearing in Largo. The PSC says that of the nearly $36 million rate-increase request, about $5 million is being collected through a system improvement surcharge. The Washington Gas application says a typical residential heating bill would increase by about 5%.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A power outage caused major problems on a Boston subway line. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority said in a tweet that there was “power problem” on the Blue Line at about 8 a.m. Wednesday near the Government Center station. It said shuttle buses were replacing service between the Maverick and Bowdoin stations. A spokesman says three trains were on the track at the time. One was at a station, and another was moved back to a station so passengers could disembark. A third train was just outside the Government Center stop and 200 passengers were safely evacuated. The cause of the power problem is under investigation.\n\nMichigan\n\nSault Ste. Marie: A Native American tribe is receiving $2 million in federal funds to help build a manufacturing and warehouse facility. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced the grant Tuesday for the tribe of Chippewa Indians. It will be matched with $350,000 in local funding. Officials say the Upper Peninsula tribe will own the 20,000-square-foot center. It will serve existing tribal manufacturers and entrepreneurs while helping attract new industries and business opportunities.\n\nMinnesota\n\nRochester: Former U.S. Sen. Norm Coleman says all visible traces of cancer have been removed from his lung during a seven-hour surgery at Mayo Clinic. Coleman posted on his Facebook page that the cancer “was more invasive than seen in earlier scans.” Coleman praised his team of doctors who said the surgery was challenging because of scar tissue from earlier radiation. Last August, Coleman learned that the throat and neck cancer he began battling in 2015 had spread to his lungs and was at the most advanced stage. Coleman underwent chemotherapy and intensive radiation and said the tumor was gone. A follow-up scan recently showed the cancer had returned. In Monday’s surgery, doctors planned to remove about a quarter of his lung, cutting the organ’s capacity by 15% to 20%.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson:Police say they have confiscated several baggies filled with marijuana-infused snacks at a “dispensary party.” News outlets report police arrested five people for possession of ecstasy and possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. Spokesman Sam Brown told outlets Tuesday that authorities were tipped off about the party, which is typical in states where marijuana is legal. The edibles included rice crispy treats and brownies worth about $3,000. A gun, bong and other paraphernalia were also confiscated.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Bayer is closing its crop science division headquarters in North Carolina and moving 500 jobs to the St. Louis area. Gov. Mike Parson announced the move Tuesday in his Capitol office. Lisa Safarian, Bayer’s commercial operations-North America president, says the German pharmaceutical and life sciences company is closing its crop science division headquarters in the Raleigh area and moving to the St. Louis suburb of Creve Coeur. Bayer will get more than $44 million in economic development incentives from the state if it meets job and investment promises. The company has agreed to $164 million in capital investments. It also pledged to keep 4,400 jobs in Missouri.\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: Nurses working for a state hospital system have voted to unionize. The Flathead Beacon reports nurses at Kalispell Regional Healthcare facilities voted last Thursday and Friday to set up a collective bargaining unit. The approximately 650 nurses in the system are being represented by the Service Employees International Union Healthcare 1199NW. The union says the new members will elect a bargaining committee that will survey members on their priorities for the contract negotiation. Hospital President and CEO Craig Lambrecht says in a statement that he was disappointed by the vote, but Kalispell Regional Healthcare will work with its employees during the bargaining process.\n\nNebraska\n\nChadron: A local chiropractor and a former high school track standout won top honors in the World Championship Buffalo Chip Throw contest during the 43rd annual Fur Trade Days celebration. Station KCSR reports that 35-year-old Eric Landen won the men’s title Saturday by tossing a piece of dried buffalo dung nearly 146 feet. Winning the women’s overall and 18-and-over titles was recently graduated Chadron High School track standout True Thorne with a throw of a little over 107 feet.\n\nNevada\n\nSparks: Thousands of homes were left without power for several hours after a dump truck downed a power line. More than 7,000 NV Energy customers suffered a power outage at about 8:45 a.m. Tuesday when the power line was knocked down while the truck was lifting its bed in a construction zone. NV Energy says about 1,660 remained without power Tuesday afternoon but all power was expected to be restored by the evening. The truck was operating in a construction zone on El Rancho Drive near Teglia’s Paradise Park. No injuries were reported.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state’s only VA medical center is scaling back the hours of its clinic and urging veterans to use a network of private urgent care facilities across the state. The move to shift away from an around-the-clock clinic in Manchester starting Aug. 30 comes as Veterans Affairs presses for the use of urgent care clinics nationwide. Eligible veterans can now use nine urgent care clinics that the VA contracts with in the state. The VA medical center will continue to offer a clinic at 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. seven days a week.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWest Milford: Swimming has been banned at another state lake because of the presence of a harmful algal bloom. State environmental officials on Tuesday closed swimming areas on Greenwood Lake, which stretches about nine miles between West Milford and Orange County in New York. The directive says people should avoid making contact with the lake’s water, but notes that boating is still allowed on the waterway. Officials say bacteria in the algae bloom can cause a skin rash, and people who consume the water can suffer abdominal pain, headaches, vomiting and other issues. It’s not clear how long the directive will remain in effect.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: State officials are warning horse owners to take precautions to keep their animals from contracting a virus that causes blister-like sores on the mouths of infected animals. The state livestock board says vesicular stomatitis cases have been confirmed in Valencia, Sandoval, Los Alamos and Santa Fe counties. State Veterinarian Ralph Zimmerman says officials aren’t ordering the cancellation of any events at this point, but they’re circulating a list of recommendations for fair and rodeo organizers and individual owners. That includes checking for sores, using fly spray and not sharing grooming equipment. There’s no specific treatment and there are no licensed vaccines for the virus.\n\nNew York\n\nQuogue: Police on Long Island are searching for a bald eagle that was stolen from a wildlife refuge. Police say the approximately 35-year-old male bald eagle was removed from its enclosure at the Quogue Wildlife Refuge sometime early Tuesday morning. Police say the eagle was sent to the facility in Suffolk County by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1988 after being injured. Its right wing is partially amputated and it is unable to fly. Officials say possession of a bald eagle, which is a federally protected species, is a federal offense punishable by fines and jail time. Anyone with information is asked to call the Quogue Village police department at 631-653-4791.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: An employee at a Valvoline Instant Oil Change has been fired, the company said, after creating a racist invoice that referred to the customer as Pocahontas. A photographed invoice circulating on social media lists the customer’s name as “poka honas” and the address as Raccoon Trail, a street that does not exist in Asheville. The date of the invoice is not visible, though the original Facebook post was published July 15. The customer’s identity is not publicly known. She is a person of color, according to the Facebook user who posted about the incident. The customer was not immediately available for a request for comment.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State officials say oil production in North Dakota held steady this spring. The state’s wells produced 1.39 million barrels of crude per day in May, just 800 per day more than in April. Despite the steady May numbers, North Dakota’s oil production is near the record set in January. And, the high level is creating some transportation challenges. Statewide, companies are flaring off 19% of all gas produced, higher than the 12% target.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati:Mosquitoes in the Greater Cincinnati area have tested positive for West Nile virus and officials are urging people to take precautions. The West Nile virus affects the central nervous system. It can be passed from mosquitoes to humans. Mosquitoes with the virus were recently trapped on Union Cemetery Road in Symmes Township, according to Hamilton County Public Health. Officials will be conducting surveillance activities in the area where the mosquitoes were collected. Staff will be looking for areas of standing water, applying larvicide and making sure swimming pools are operating properly. Health officials advise all Hamilton County residents drain all sources of water, including buckets, flowerpots, wading pools, birdbaths and pet bowls. They also suggest adding mosquito larvicide to areas of standing water that cannot be drained.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt says the Federal Emergency Management Agency has approved disaster assistance for 41 counties as a result of spring flooding and severe weather in the state. The storms produced historic flooding throughout the northern half of the state and spawned a tornado that struck near Tulsa International Airport on May 21. Stitt announced the approval Tuesday, saying it makes federal funding available for cities, counties, rural electric cooperatives and the state to repair infrastructure and other costs associated with the storm response. Stitt said damage estimates from the storms stand at $22 million.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:A pilot was treated and released from a hospital after crashing his plane Tuesday afternoon while attempting an emergency landing in a grassy field east of the city. Eugene Mitchell, 73, of Portland told deputies he experienced mechanical issues which led to the plane catching fire midflight while traveling from the Albany area to the Aurora Airport. Mitchell, an experienced pilot, suffered nonlife-threatening injuries. He was the only occupant of the plane, according to Sgt. Jeremy Landers with the Marion County Sheriff’s Office. The Federal Aviation Administration and National Traffic Safety Board were notified of the crash.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: An animal rescue group says someone strapped firecrackers to a cat’s front left paw with rubber bands and set them off, causing such severe injuries that the animal’s leg had to be amputated. Humane Animal Rescue says on its Facebook page that two good Samaritans brought the cat in over the weekend after finding it limping on the mangled and bloody leg. Based on how the wound had begun healing, officials at the rescue say the injury likely happened on the Fourth of July. Jamie Wilson, a director at the rescue, says there was barely any paw left and veterinarians determined the best course of action would be to remove the leg. The cat, who staffers have named Pickles, is on the mend and will be up for adoption soon.\n\nRhode Island\n\nWarwick: The City Council on Monday unanimously approved a resolution that would add $4 million to the schools’ budget to pay for 17 line items, including sports, teaching assistants, custodians, textbooks, and after-school programs. Sports were among several cuts the school committee made last month when it approved a $174 million budget. City Council President Steven Merolla said “enough with holding kids hostage.” The district has three high schools and nearly 20 schools total.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: The first contracts for construction of a major African American history museum in South Carolina have been awarded. The City Council unanimously approved spending $60 million on the contracts for the museum being built on Charleston’s waterfront on the site where thousands of slaves first landed in the United States. The International African American Museum has raised more than $90 million from governments and private entities. It plans to open in 2021.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:A slight uptick in heartworm disease among area pets raised a red flag last month with a national nonprofit that tracks parasites in pets and people. The city’s heartworm rate itself is small – just four heartworm cases reported in June – but the increase from May’s rate of just one case was enough to put Sioux Falls at the top of a list kept by the Companion Animal Parasite Council. The Oregon-based nonprofit uses data from two national veterinarian labs to track the prevalence of animal parasites in cats and dogs, and Sioux Falls ranked first in its “Top Ten Cities for Heartworm Disease.” The July report was released this week by the group, with Sioux Falls ranking first, followed by Rockford, Illinois; Cedar Rapids, Iowa and seven other communities across the United States.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state Department of Agriculture is warning homeowners about rhododendron plants infected with a pathogen that can kill a number of different plants, shrubs and trees. The department says anyone who has purchased a rhododendron from Walmart or Rural King since April should monitor the plants for leaf spots and dying branches or limbs. The warning comes after the U.S. Agriculture Department detected Phytophthora ramorum in rhododendron plants at a Dickson County store. The infected plants were part of a shipment that originated from nurseries in Washington state and Canada. The department is working to trace the plants, which were sent to 18 states.\n\nTexas\n\nMineral Wells: City leaders are abandoning a proposal that would have essentially banned abortions in their community. Mayor Christopher Perricone says he proposed making his town a “sanctuary city for the unborn” after the town of Waskom became the first in Texas to do so. But at a meeting Tuesday in Mineral Wells, about 50 miles west of Dallas, city leaders voted 5-2 to take no action at the recommendation of the city’s legal staff. The Star-Telegram reported that earlier Tuesday, the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas sent a letter to Mineral Wells council members warning that its proposal was unconstitutional. There are no abortion clinics in either Waskom or Mineral Wells, so the measures are largely symbolic.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A federal appeals court has upheld a ruling that found voting districts in San Juan County were racially gerrymandered and violated the rights of Navajo voters. The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver handed down the opinion Tuesday in the case that resulted in the election of the first majority-Navajo commission in San Juan County, which overlaps with the Navajo Nation. Republican commissioner Bruce Adams says in a statement he’s disappointed by the ruling. He says the new districts unfairly carve up the county’s largest city of Blanding, and he had hoped for a new solution. The opinion comes after U.S. District Judge Robert Shelby found in 2016 that the voting maps packed Democratic-leaning Navajo voters into just one of three districts in the sprawling county located near the Arizona border.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: State Public Safety Commissioner Tom Anderson is resigning at the end of the month. The office of Republican Gov. Phil Scott says Anderson is leaving July 31 to join his wife, who is working in Washington. Anderson took the job at Public Safety in January 2017, after Scott took office. Scott says Anderson has worked on a number of the governor’s priorities, including enhancing school safety, reducing supply of narcotics as part of the state’s response to the opioid epidemic and streamlining the permitting and licensure process, while upholding public safety standards.\n\nVirginia\n\nCraigsville:Craigsville Elementary School will not be closing soon, officials say. Rumors spread Tuesday that the elementary school might shutter in the next couple years, but Assistant Superintendent Doug Shifflett told The News Leader on Wednesday that wasn’t true. Shifflett directed The News Leader to Superintendent Eric Bond for comment, but Bond was out of town this week and unavailable for comment. Augusta County School Board member Nick Collins also said the rumor was not true to the best of his knowledge when reached by phone Tuesday.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: Hunters employed by the state have killed a radio-collared wolf that was preying on livestock in the Kettle River range of Ferry County. The adult male member of the OPT wolf pack was killed last Saturday after the pack was found to be repeatedly killing livestock. The Department of Fish and Wildlife has now entered an evaluation period to determine if killing the wolf will change the pack’s behavior. If it does not, the state can authorize the killing of more wolves in the pack. Conservation groups have complained that the state is too quick to kill wolves at the behest of ranchers.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nParkersburg: The federal government is suing a state mental health and substance abuse facility for the homeless, citing failures to provide documentation and numerous unanswered communications. The Gazette-Mail reports a lawsuit filed recently in federal court shows attorneys with U.S. Attorney Mike Stuart’s office want ownership of Integrated Community Services’ property returned to U.S. Health and Human Services. The nonprofit was given the land in 2006, mandating it give updates about its health services. The lawsuit accuses ICS officials of not filing annual reports that prove property use and not being reachable by HHS officials.\n\nWisconsin\n\nGreen Bay:Bar patrons can leave their vehicles parked overnight to avoid driving home drunk under a new initiative approved Tuesday by the City Council. The council voted unanimously to green-light the program, dubbed “Safe Park,” which will allow people to override overnight parking restrictions and leave their vehicles parked on city streets until the next day. Street parking in Green Bay is otherwise prohibited between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. “Safe Park” aims to prevent people from getting behind the wheel while intoxicated. The program was spearheaded by the Brown County Tavern League. To use “Safe Park,” people can obtain a voucher from a bartender to hang on their vehicle’s rearview mirror. Only bars that are Tavern League members can participate.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Wildlife watchers say a grizzly bear cub that was lingering alone near a mountain pass in the western part of the state has reunited with its mother. The Jackson Hole News & Guide reports the mother bear and cub, nicknamed Felicia and Pepper, were spotted together near Togwotee Pass on Tuesday. Onlookers had feared the cub was possibly orphaned after its mother wasn’t spotted with it. Cubs are not likely to survive on their own. Wildlife photographer Tom Mangelsen, who has been following the pair, previously said the mother and cub might have simply lost track of each other. Photographer Jack Bayles says the mother accepted the cub back and the cub has tried to nurse.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/10/01/mount-rushmore-big-tuna-duke-caboom-news-around-states/119005338/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: An eye surgeon is donating $95 million to the University of Alabama at Birmingham’s medical school in what officials said is the largest philanthropic pledge in the university’s history. University trustees announced the gift from Dr. Marnix Heersink on Tuesday. The medical school will be named for Heersink, and the money will be used to establish global health and biomedical innovation institutes, university officials said. An additional $5 million is being contributed by Triton Health Systems, bringing the total pledge to $100 million. The money will also help recruit and retain scientists and physicians in priority areas such as pulmonology, oncology and neurology through endowed chairs and professorships, officials said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A second hospital in Alaska has invoked crisis standards of care, allowing a committee of physicians to determine clinical decisions regarding patient treatment as the state continues to see a spike in COVID-19 cases. The Yukon Kuskokwim Health Corp. in Bethel announced the activation of the guidelines in a statement posted on its website Wednesday, the same day the facility was operating at capacity. The standards allow overwhelmed hospitals to modify their usual, expected level of care. Providence Alaska Medical Center in Anchorage, the state’s largest health care facility, earlier invoked the same guidelines. Health officials at the Bethel hospital said there might be delays transferring people to a referring hospital, along with expanded nurse-patient ratio and longer wait times for elective procedures such as colonoscopies and pediatric dental procedures. The decision to continue these types of elective procedures are made on a daily or weekly basis.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:Passenger rail service is one step closer to returning to Phoenix for the first time in 25 years as a federal infrastructure plan that would provide billions for rail gains traction in Congress. As part of a nationwide expansion, Amtrak is proposing to connect Tucson to Phoenix for the first time since 1996. The plan calls for extending the line through the West Valley, where it would then connect to Los Angeles. Phoenix is the largest city in the country without Amtrak service. Service never resumed after shutting down in June 1996 for a criminal investigation into the derailment of a train in western Arizona that killed a crewman and injured 78 people. Rail service runs from Tucson to Los Angeles through Maricopa, which is about 35 miles south of Phoenix. The plan has received support from mayors along the proposed line. About a dozen mayors from both political parties sent a letter on Tuesday to the state’s congressional delegation calling on lawmakers to provide funding to implement the new route. They said the route would diversify transportation options, connect the state’s two largest metropolitan areas and spur development along the line.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Lawmakers considered competing redistricting proposals that would divide the state’s most populous county between congressional seats on Wednesday. The House and Senate State Agencies and Governmental Affairs committees did not advance any proposals for redrawing districts as the Legislature reconvened to redraw the state’s four U.S. House boundaries. Both panels showed support for plans that would divide Pulaski County. One bill pending before the House committee would split the county, which includes the Little Rock area, between the 1st and 2nd congressional districts. Another before the Senate panel would split the county between the 2nd and 4th districts. Pulaski is part of the 2nd District, which Democrats have tried unsuccessfully to flip in recent elections. Republicans hold all four of the state’s congressional seats and majorities in both chambers of the Legislature. Proponents of splitting up Pulaski have said it makes sense given the county’s location in the state’s center and that it could prevent dividing up even more counties around the state. But Democrats in Pulaski County oppose the move, saying it would divide the community. Arkansas’ current congressional map divides up five counties.\n\nCalifornia\n\nDublin: Ray J. Garcia, the warden of the Federal Correctional Institute Dublin in California’s San Francisco Bay area, has been charged with sexually abusing an inmate, authorities said Wednesday. Garcia, 54, of Merced, allegedly groped at least one of his female wards, asked at least two inmates to strip naked for him and took and stored photographs of a naked inmate in a cell at the prison, according to a statement from the U.S. attorney’s office. Garcia also is accused of trying to deter a victim from reporting the abuse by telling her “that he was ‘close friends’ with the individual responsible for investigating allegations of misconduct by inmates and … that he could not be fired,” according to the statement. Garcia was associate warden at the all-female low-security lockup at the time of the alleged abuse, prosecutors said. He later became warden but was placed on leave in July and he was charged last week with sexual abuse of a ward. It’s the latest of at least three sexual abuse cases involving employees at FCI Dublin, located 20 miles southeast of Oakland.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A judge on Wednesday dismissed an attempt by a group of Denver police officers to block the city’s vaccine mandate from taking effect. In a lawsuit filed last week, seven officers claimed the city lacked the authority to impose the mandate under a local disaster emergency declared by Mayor Michael Hancock at the beginning of the pandemic. They noted Democratic Gov. Jared Polis rescinded his statewide emergency pandemic order in July. The officers said the city should have instead followed the more drawn-out process laid out in state law to impose regulations. However, Judge Shelley Gilman ruled that law applies only to state agencies. Under city law, the officers should have appealed the vaccine mandate, first issued on Aug. 2, to the health board before filing a lawsuit, she said. Since they did not, Gilman said she had no jurisdiction to decide the case and dismissed it, granting a request made by the city in its response to the lawsuit filed Tuesday.\n\nConnecticut\n\nCoventry: Uncertainty about the species of a massive catfish that was eaten before it could be vetted by authorities in August has led Connecticut to withdraw its awarding of a new state record. Connecticut Fish and Wildlife wrote in a Facebook post on Monday that because it was not able to examine the actual fish, authorities cannot confirm it was a white catfish. “Without the ability to examine the actual fish, identification is left to still images and videos, which have proven to be ambiguous and inconclusive to definitively identify the species of catfish in this case,” state Fish and Wildlife wrote, adding that it is not disputing the weight of the catch that was made on Aug. 21. Ben Tomkunas, 25, of Coventry, who caught the 21.3-pound fish, said he gave it to his grandfather the morning after he caught it and it was eaten. “I can’t believe that they think it’s OK to do this to someone,” Tomkunas told the Journal Inquirer. “It’s such an embarrassment.” It can be difficult to distinguish between white catfish and channel catfish, which are generally larger. The previous state record for a white catfish was 12.7 pounds. The International Game Fish Association has recorded the world record for a white catfish catch to be 19.3 pounds for a fish caught in 2005 in California.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A Wilmington officer has been placed on administrative duty after video circulating on social media showed him repeatedly banging a man’s head during an arrest, news outlets reported. The Wilmington Police Department said its Office of Professional Standards immediately launched an investigation into the Sept. 21 incident. A clip from a security video circulating online showed an officer shove a man in a convenience store, then grab his head and slam it twice into plexiglass before taking him down. “It shows clear abuse of power and unwarranted excessive force,” said Wilmington activist Coby Owens. “That’s 100% unacceptable.” Police said the patrol officer has been with the department for three years, but didn’t identify him. “The video of this incident is concerning and we will conduct a thorough investigation and take any necessary action to ensure all of our members adhere to the highest standards of service to our community,” police department spokesman David Karas said. Police were responding to a report that the man harassed daycare employees, Karas said. Court documents that the officer signed state that “after a brief physical struggle (that the man) attempted to physically resist, he was taken into custody.” He was charged with harassment, resisting arrest and other offenses.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Through Oct. 15, Metro customers will be able to save up to 50% on select passes, WUSA-TV reported. For the first time, Metro launched a sales event that will allow riders to purchase discounted passes with unlimited trips on Metrorail and Metrobus, whether they travel one day, one week or one month. During the sale, customers can purchase the one-, three-, and seven-day passes to use anytime. Monthly passes will be valid for use from Friday to Oct. 31, Metro said in a release. “This is a great way to come back to work, restaurants, theater, museums, sports events and outdoor activities this fall with a pass that lets you ride at a deep discount,” said Metro General Manager Paul J. Wiedefeld in a statement. “We have also enhanced cleaning on buses and trains and improved the ventilation, making it safer and now more affordable for customers to give Metro a try.” Along with fare and service improvements, Metro officials hope the pass sale will attract riders back to Metro following a dip in ridership because of the pandemic.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Myers:Florida’s grasshopper sparrow subspecies was the rarest bird in the continental U.S. just a few years ago, but a captive breeding program has numbers climbing. In the past three years, Audubon Florida has helped release almost 500 grasshopper sparrows from a captive breeding program. “It was scary because you have this bird you’ve raised in captivity and you just throw them out in the wild but it turned out that they did very well,” said Paul Gray, a bird expert and scientist with Audubon Florida. Grasshopper sparrows can be found from the Orlando area south to Lake Okeechobee – in Highlands, Okeechobee, Osceola and Polk counties. Males establish their territories from March to July by producing a series of calls, or songs, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Grasshopper sparrows build dome-shaped nests from grasses that are typically found beside or under a dwarf oak or saw palmetto. Breeding occurs throughout the year, and the grasshopper sparrow might nest upward of three times during a season. Three to five eggs are laid, with hatching taking place in 11 to 12 days. Like many endangered and threatened species in Florida, habitat loss is one of the top threats for the tiny sparrows. Grasshopper sparrow habitat can also be degraded when vegetation becomes overgrown (Florida’s landscape evolved with regular fires), or when invasive species work their way into the grasses and take over.\n\nGeorgia\n\nKingsland: A federal agency said it’s again delaying a final decision on whether to permit construction of a launchpad for commercial rockets on the Georgia coast. The Federal Aviation Administration now plans to issue a decision on Spaceport Camden by Nov. 3 “due to ongoing consultation efforts,” agency spokesman Steve Kulm said in a statement. Previously, the FAA had said it intended to make a final determination on the project by the end of July, then shifted its target date to the end of September. Camden County in Georgia’s coastal, southeast corner has spent nine years and $10 million seeking permission to build what would be the nation’s 13th licensed commercial spaceport. The proposal took a big step forward in June, when the FAA issued an environmental impact study that concluded building the spaceport would be its “preferred alternative.” The National Park Service and its parent agency, the U.S. Department of the Interior, pushed back over the summer. They disputed the FAA’s conclusion that the spaceport poses minimal risks or adverse impacts to Cumberland Island, a federally protected wilderness that lies along the proposed flight path for rockets 5 miles east of the launch site.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: More than 160 Oahu business operators have been cited, warned or arrested in the weeks since Honolulu imposed new COVID-19 safety rules, including requiring proof of vaccination or negative test results. Honolulu police have issued citations or made arrests in 44 cases since the new mandates went into effect Sept. 13, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. Police have also issued over 100 written warnings for a variety of violations and made an unspecified number of “verbal, non-written warnings.” City officials could not immediately break down the number of arrests versus citations because they are compiled together in the same records-keeping category, said Honolulu Police Department spokesperson Michelle Yu. But she said the majority were citations, and very few were arrests. The greatest number of arrests or citations – 17 – were for lack of face coverings, and 11 were for not following social or physical distances. Violations carry a maximum penalty of a year in jail and a fine of $5,000.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A coalition of journalists is asking an Idaho judge to hold the state’s lieutenant governor in contempt of court for refusing to turn over public documents despite the judge’s order that she do so. Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin, a Republican, was ordered more than a month ago to release the documents regarding her newly created Education Task Force, which was tasked with investigating alleged “indoctrination” in the state’s public school system. The order came in response to a lawsuit filed by the Idaho Press Club on behalf of several journalists who said McGeachin’s office wrongly denied their public records requests for the material. But McGeachin never released the public documents despite multiple attempts from the Idaho Press Club’s attorney, Wendy Olson, to get McGeachin to comply, according to court documents filed Wednesday. McGeachin earlier filed a motion asking the judge to reconsider the case, but then never filed the supporting documentation required by the judge. McGeachin did not immediately respond to a voice mail and email from the Associated Press requesting comment. The Idaho Press Club said in a prepared statement that it is “truly unfortunate” that the case reached the point where the organization had to file the contempt of court petition.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A northern Illinois man has died of rabies after apparently being bitten by a bat – the first human case of rabies in the state since 1954, health officials reported Tuesday. The diagnosis has been confirmed by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Illinois Department of Public Health said in a release. The man’s name was not released. Officials said he was in his 80s and lived in Lake County. He woke up in mid-August and found a bat on his neck. The bat was captured and later tested positive for rabies. The man declined to begin post-exposure rabies treatment, health officials said. The rabies virus attacks the central nervous system and causes disease and brain death. The man began experiencing neck pain, a headache, difficulty controlling his arms, finger numbness, difficulty speaking and other symptoms of the disease. A bat colony later was found in his home. “Sadly, this case underscores the importance of raising public awareness about the risk of rabies exposure in the United States,” Lake County Health Department Executive Director Mark Pfister said. “Rabies infections in people are rare in the United States, however, once symptoms begin, rabies is almost always fatal, making it vital that an exposed person receive appropriate treatment to prevent the onset of rabies as soon as possible.” Thirty bats have tested positive in Illinois this year for rabies, according to the health department.\n\nIndiana\n\nPortage: Preliminary tests indicated iron-contaminated wastewater that leaked from a northwestern Indiana steel plant into a Lake Michigan tributary presented no risk to public health, the Environmental Protection Agency said. U.S. Steel Midwest idled the plant in Portage, about 30 miles east of Chicago, as a precaution after it said a wastewater treatment facility experienced “an upset condition” that sent the rusty colored plume containing elevated levels of lead into the Burns Waterway on Sunday. The EPA said it tested surface water samples taken near the plant’s outfall. Federal and state agencies were continuing to investigate the cause of the discharge, possible Clean Water Act compliance issues and impacts to the environment, the agency said. The plant was back up and running Wednesday, according to The (Northwest Indiana) Times. Indiana Dunes National Park also closed all of its beaches and the Portage Lakefront and Riverwalk until further notice and Indiana American Water shut down its Ogden Dunes treatment facility, both as a precaution.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: Mayor Bruce Teague has “indefinitely extended” the city’s emergency order requiring masks in indoor gathering spots and when social distancing is not possible. The emergency order, first issued on Aug. 19, was set to expire Thursday. “We have to do what we can individually to protect ourselves, as well as everyone else,” Teague said. He said a number of factors went into his decision to extend the mandate indefinitely. He noted the prevalence of the delta variant and Johnson County’s high level of community transmission – a problem in all of Iowa’s 99 counties, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Face coverings will continue to be required in indoor public settings such as grocery and retail stores, pharmacies, restaurants and bars, movie theaters and houses of worship, among other locations in the city. Masks are also required when using public transportation, taxis or ride share. The order also requires masks be worn in public school buildings and in University of Iowa academic buildings and businesses offices. But UI administrators previously advised campus leaders that the mandate does not apply to them because of state law. And the Iowa City Community School District unanimously reinstated its own mask mandate earlier this month after a federal judge issued a restraining order barring the state from enforcing a law that prevents local school boards from issuing mask mandates.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Thousands of people turned out Wednesday to honor a Kansas priest as he was laid to rest 70 years after he died in a prisoner of war camp during the Korean War. Mourners filled Hartman Arena for a funeral service for the Rev. Emil Kapaun and later lined streets to watch his body being carried by a horse-drawn caisson from Veterans Memorial Park to the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, where he was interred. “We are here today to provide for father what was not provided for him 70 years ago, a mass of Christian burial,” Bishop Carl A. Kemme of the Wichita diocese told the crowd. Speakers extolled Kapaun’s Christian love and his courage during his days as a prisoner or war, which he spent providing comfort to his fellow soldiers. They also said it was appropriate that his body had finally returned to the state where he was born. Kapaun, an Army chaplain, was captured in 1950 near Unsan, North Korea, while tending to fellow soldiers. He died in May 1951 at the POW camp while continuing to minister to fellow prisoners. He was awarded the Medal of Honor in 2013. In 1993, the Catholic church named him a “Servant of God,” the first step of a lengthy process that could lead to canonization.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Statewide test results from last spring showed that less than half of students scored at the proficient or distinguished levels in many Kentucky schools. The tests scores were aimed at better understanding how students performed academically amid learning disruptions caused by COVID-19. State education officials cautioned the latest test scores can’t be compared with pre-pandemic scores. Students faced challenges as schools switched to remote learning for months because of the pandemic. “We knew these results would not be what we wanted to see, but the previous two school years saw extreme challenges,” state Education Commissioner Jason Glass said in a news release Wednesday. “We can use this information to address the gaps caused by COVID-19 disruptions and provide our students with the supports they need to be successful.” Because the pandemic affected many aspects of education in the past school year, the state Education Department received a waiver from federal accountability. As a result, school accountability indicators and ratings weren’t part of the 2020-2021 reporting.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Louisiana has recovered a missing lunar rock gifted to the state to commemorate the last manned U.S. mission to the moon after it turned up in the hands of a man who recycles wooden plaques. The rock from the 1972 Apollo 17 landing was in the possession of the Louisiana State Museum on Tuesday, The Advocate of Baton Rouge reported. It was returned to the state late last year by a Florida man who planned to use wood from the plaque that held it to repair a gun, according to the newspaper. But the recovery was not revealed until Monday when a journalist and space historian, Robert Pearlman, reported it in the online publication CollectSpace, The Advocate said. “As you can appreciate, I’m just happy that it is here now,” museum interim Director Steven Maklansky said. The lunar fragment was one of hundreds presented to states, territories and foreign nations in the early to mid-1970s by the administration of former President Richard Nixon. They included samples taken by Neil Armstrong and the Apollo 11 crew during the first moon landing in 1969. But many of them later went missing. Louisiana also had an Apollo 11 rock that was thought to be missing, but The Advocate discovered it was in storage at the Louisiana Art and Science Museum.\n\nMaine\n\nBelfast: A tuna weighing 600 pounds was donated to a Belfast soup kitchen for its meals last week by a lobster fishing crew that netted the fish. The crewmembers from J & J Lobster were catching bait near the coast when the massive bluefin tuna hit their net, the Bangor Daily News reported. “It was an adrenaline rush to say the least,” the owner of J & J Lobster, Jamie Steeves, told New England Cable News. The crew was not initially authorized to bring the tuna to shore, since they were fishing specifically for bait. But Steeves called the state Marine Patrol, which said it would allow the crew to bring the fish in if they could find a place to donate it. They reached out to the Belfast Soup Kitchen and its executive director, Cherie Merrill. “He cold-called, asking ‘Can you use a 600-pound tuna?’ ” Merrill told the Bangor Daily News. “I never say no to anything, but all I could picture was dropping this 600-pound fish off at the door.” Volunteers from the kitchen and J & J Lobster salvaged about 300 pounds of meat from the tuna. The first tuna steaks were served Tuesday.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A conservative Roman Catholic media outlet seeking to stage a rally during a U.S. bishops’ meeting in Baltimore claims city officials canceled the event because they disapproved of its religious message. The city said the gathering posed a threat to public safety, claiming the fringe group cheered on rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol in January. The event planners are asking a federal judge to decide whether the city is trampling on their First Amendment rights. U.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander scheduled a hearing Thursday on a lawsuit filed Sept. 13 by St. Michael’s Media against the city, Mayor Brandon Scott and City Solicitor James Shea. Michigan-based St. Michael’s Media, also known as Church Militant, is a tax-exempt nonprofit and digital media outlet. The group said it publishes news stories on its website about the Catholic Church and often criticizes church leadership. St. Michael’s planned to hold a “prayer rally” Nov. 16 at a city-owned waterfront pavilion. An event advertisement touted speeches by former President Donald Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon and activist Milo Yiannopoulos. In a court filing, the city said it instructed the contractor that manages the pavilion to cancel the event “out of a legitimate fear that it would incite violence in the heart of downtown Baltimore.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state Supreme Judicial Court rejected a claim that county jails across the state violated the due process rights of inmates during the coronavirus pandemic. The state public defenders agency and the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union argued the sheriffs who run the jails failed to implement regular across-the-board coronavirus testing, and they had not adequately followed an earlier court ruling to reduce their inmate populations, The Salem News reported. The Supreme Judicial Court in Tuesday’s decision acknowledged the risks COVID-19 posed to inmates, but said under the circumstances, the responses of the 13 county sheriffs “are not unreasonable.” The public defender’s agency, the Committee for Public Counsel Services, had no response to the decision, a spokesperson said.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: State lawmakers are poised to consider bipartisan bills aimed at helping potentially thousands of sex abuse victims sue for damages, including those molested by a University of Michigan sports physician. It is the second time since 2018 the Legislature might overhaul laws in the wake of a major abuse scandal. Similar legislation was enacted following the conviction of Larry Nassar, who sexually abused hundreds of female athletes under the guise of medical treatment, including at Michigan State University. Under the new measures, victims of the late Dr. Robert Anderson at the University of Michigan and others would get additional time to bring lawsuits that might be barred by a statute of limitations. Government entities could not use the immunity defense if they knew or should have known of an accused’s prior sexual misconduct and failed to intervene. Similar government immunity legislation stalled three years ago – after Michigan State agreed to a $500 million settlement for Nassar’s victims – amid pushback from universities, schools, municipalities, businesses and the Catholic Church over the financial implications of facing an unknown number of suits for old allegations. Opposition could form again.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: State wildlife officials said two Minnesota farms received deer from a Wisconsin farm where chronic wasting disease was detected last month. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources said the news was “extremely concerning” and the agency is “actively considering management responses” to the threat facing the state’s wild deer population. A recent report in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel said that the Wisconsin deer farm where the disease was detected sold nearly 400 deer to 40 farms across seven states in the past five years. Two of those farms were in Minnesota. One was at a now-defunct farm in Stillwater, which received two deer in 2016. Those deer were eventually transferred back to Wisconsin in 2019. Investigators are working to determine if those deer are still alive and have been tested, WCCO-TV reported. The other Minnesota farm to receive deer from the contaminated farm was in Clear Lake. Officials said the farm received three deer in 2017, two of which were killed earlier this year. The disease was not detected in them. The third deer is still alive and the owner is awaiting payment befoe making the animal available for testing. The Clear Lake farm’s entire herd is under quarantine.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Two street preachers who were convicted of misdemeanor simple assault for calling a woman a “Jezebel” and waving a Bible in a man’s face were released from jail Wednesday after a judge found they were being held under “grossly unreasonable” bond.The $500,000 appearance bond for each preacher was at least 500 times the amount recommended by the Mississippi Rules of Criminal Procedure for bail pending trial. “I’ve seen bonds set in rape cases, aggravated assault cases far more serious than this, and nowhere near half a million dollars,” said Judge Jess H. Dickinson, a retired Mississippi Supreme Court justice appointed to help with a backload of cases in Hinds County Court. Dickinson reduced the bond to $5,000 each. Allan Grant Siders and Bryan Peden, preachers for Church at Jackson, were convicted Sept. 22. Jackson Municipal Judge Jeffrey Reynolds sentenced Siders to six months and Peden to three months in jail. The men were preaching outside businesses in Jackson’s Fondren neighborhood when Jackson resident Matthew Camp said they shouted at him and his girlfriend repeatedly using a voice amplification system, calling her a “Jezebel” and calling them “filthy fornicators.” He said they waved a Bible in his face in a threatening way and yelled at him so closely that spit landed on his face.\n\nMissouri\n\nChesterfield: Racist graffiti found on school bathroom walls in suburban St. Louis that led to a mass student walkout last week was scrawled by a Black student, school district officials said. The student admitted to administrators to writing the graffiti in multiple bathrooms at Parkway Central High School, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. In a letter to students, their families and staff on Tuesday, Superintendent Keith Marty said the student’s race “does not diminish the hurt it caused or the negative impact it has on our entire community.” Marty said the vandalism was a significant violation of multiple codes of conduct and that the matter had been referred to law enforcement. He also said the student would face “severe disciplinary consequences,” but did not details what those would be. Hundreds of students at Parkway Central walked out of class in protest last Thursday, a day after the racial slurs were found in boys’ bathrooms in Parkway Central and Parkway North. District spokeswoman Cathy Kelly said officials were close to finding the person who wrote the graffiti at Parkway North. School officials do not believe the incidents are related.\n\nMontana\n\nBig Sky: Authorities said unauthorized drone flights over a Montana wildfire prevented firefighting aircraft from being used against the blaze burning in rugged terrain south of Big Sky. Custer Gallatin National Forest officials said the fire in the drainage for Upper Taylor Fork creek grew to more than 70 acres by Wednesday. Drones over the area forced officials to ground aircraft for safety twice since the fire was first reported Monday afternoon, forest spokesperson Marna Daley said. The lack of air support meant crews on the ground had to take a less direct approach to suppressing the fire, which allowed it to grow. About 40 personnel were working on the fire with more due to arrive.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A four-month police operation targeting gang activity in Omaha and surrounding communities led to more than 230 arrests and the seizure of dozens of guns and more than $800,000 worth of illegal narcotics, according to the U.S. Marshals Service. The service said in a news release Tuesday that Operation Triple Beam/Operation K.O. was conducted from May through August and was led by the U.S. Marshals Service’s Metro Fugitive Task Force and the Omaha and Lincoln police departments. In addition to 231 arrests, officers seized 86 guns, about 42 pounds of narcotics worth nearly $822,000, more than 800 fentanyl pills and about $49,000 in cash, according to the release. Officers also found three missing children and recovered two stolen vehicles. The operation was part of a national effort developed by the Marshals Service to reduce gang violence by arresting violent fugitives, gang members and those who have committed violent crimes.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A judge dismissed a trademark infringement lawsuit filed by Evel Knievel’s son a year ago against the Walt Disney Co. and movie company Pixar over a “Toy Story 4” daredevil character named Duke Caboom. “We’re obviously disappointed,” Kelly Knievel said in a Monday email. “We are considering our options” at the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. U.S. District Judge James Mahan in Las Vegas dismissed the case against Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures on Sept. 23. The judge wrote that although the Caboom character was “reminiscent” of Knievel, “Disney’s use of Evel Knievel’s likeness contains significant transformative elements” and is not a literal depiction. An email message from The Walt Disney Co. spokesman Jeffrey R. Epstein said he was traveling and unavailable for immediate comment. Kelly Knievel, head of Las Vegas-based K and K Promotions, had characterized the Caboom character as “a direct knock-off of the legend and historical significance” of Knievel’s father, the famous stunt motorcyclist who died in 2007 at 69 in Florida of lung disease. The lawsuit filed in September 2020 accused Disney and Pixar of intentionally modeling the “Toy Story 4” character on Knievel, whose stunts included motorcycle jumps in 1967 over the Caesars Palace fountain in Las Vegas – including a spectacular near-fatal crash – and in 1975 over a row of buses at Wembley Stadium in London.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Angry opponents of the Biden administration’s new vaccine mandate forced the postponement of Wednesday’s Executive Council meeting, further delaying a vote on $27 million in federal aid to boost New Hampshire’s vaccination efforts. The Republican-controlled council, a five-member panel that approves state contracts and nominations to courts and agencies, had voted this month to table a request from the state Department of Health and Human Services to spend federal pandemic relief money on a public health program manager and a dozen workers to promote the COVID-19 vaccine and address public concerns about it. Republican lawmakers on the Joint Legislative Fiscal Committee, which also must approve the request, have done the same. The request was back before the council on Wednesday, but the meeting in Manchester was called off after protesters moved around the room, shouting, “Shut it down,” according to video shared by WMUR-TV. After Councilor David Wheeler said state employees attending to answer questions about agenda items were in fear for the lives, one man shouted, “Mission accomplished!”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: A company that has received preliminary approval to build a wind farm off the southern coast of New Jersey is planning a second project. Atlantic Shores, a joint venture between EDF Renewables North America and Shell New Energies US, already has approval from New Jersey regulators to build a wind farm about 8.7 miles off the coast. But in a construction plan filed with the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Atlantic Shores revealed it is planning a second such project, one it has not publicly announced. That project could be considered in the next round of offshore wind project solicitations by New Jersey regulators in the third quarter of 2022. “Atlantic Shores’ second project, Project 2 … is being developed to support these future New Jersey solicitations,” the company wrote in its filing. The company has not said how many megawatts of power the second project might provide. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: New Mexico students will take the SAT in spring 2022 as the state phases in a pandemic-delayed testing requirement aimed at increasing participation that varies widely by racial and ethnic groups. Those disparities were stark this spring as high school students were offered the test but didn’t have to take it. There were deep differences in high school juniors’ participation according to racial and ethnic groups, with particularly low totals among Indigenous students, data released by New Mexico’s education department showed. The state had planned to require high school juniors to take the English and Math exams this spring, replacing previous statewide assessments. About a dozen states including Ohio and New Jersey require students to take the SAT or list it as one of the options to fulfill federal requirements for standardized testing. But the pandemic made it harder for students nationwide to take the SAT. Logistical complications from the virus spurred New Mexico to get a waiver from federal testing requirements. Exactly 25% of eligible high school juniors took the test this spring in New Mexico, according to data released by the state’s Public Education Department this week. The rate was far lower for Indigenous students, with only 11% of high school juniors in that group taking the test.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: The hit Broadway show “Aladdin” was canceled Wednesday night when breakthrough COVID-19 cases were reported within the musical’s company, a day after the show reopened following 18 months of being shuttered by the pandemic. It was a worrying sign for Broadway’s recovery. “Through our rigorous testing protocols, breakthrough COVID-19 cases have been detected within the company of ‘Aladdin’ at the New Amsterdam Theatre,” the show announced on social media. “Because the wellness and safety of our guests, cast and crew are our top priority, tonight’s performance, Wednesday, Sept. 29 , is canceled.” It was the first Broadway COVID-19 cancellation since shows resumed with Bruce Springsteen’s concert returning in July and “Pass Over” as the first play to debut in August. “Aladdin” said the status of future performances “will be updated.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Entertainer Nick Cannon is promising to pay off the loan debt of seven students at historically black colleges, including three in North Carolina, when they graduate. Cannon played host to students from Saint Augustine’s University, North Carolina A&T State University, Winston-Salem State University and other HBCUs on his nationally syndicated talk show Monday, The News & Observer of Raleigh reported. They spoke about the adversity they faced and their desire to attend college, particularly an HBCU. Cannon then told the students their outstanding college debt would be paid off when they graduate through a scholarship in partnership with the United Negro College Fund and the Thurgood Marshall College Fund. He is an alumnus of Howard University, an HBCU in the District of Columbia. Mackenzie Estrep, a senior at Saint Augustine’s University, is a first-generation high school graduate and college student who is working three jobs to help pay for tuition. Sharandica Midcalf, a student at Winston-Salem State University, was homeless and said a school counselor told her she didn’t have the grade-point average to get into college, which motivated her to succeed as a first-generation college student. Christian Kornegay talked about how he overcame a learning disability and got accepted to North Carolina A&T University, where he’s working to become a professional host and entertainer.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A cold front moving through the region has eased record-breaking heat this week in North Dakota. According to the National Weather Service, Tuesday’s reading of 100 in Dickinson appeared to be the latest in the year that the state has recorded a triple-digit temperature. The temperature in Dickson was 2 degrees higher that the city’s previous record, set in 1905. Bismarck also had a record high Tuesday of 98 degrees, 1 degree higher than the city’s 1905 record for the date. Hot weather also covered eastern North Dakota. Grand Forks eclipsed its century-old record with a high of 91 degrees, the Bismarck Tribune reported. A cold front returned temperatures in the region to more seasonable levels Wednesday with readings in the 50s, 60s and 70s. The latest drought briefing from the weather service said “October is favored for continued above-average temperatures” across the state.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus:Ohio's minimum wage will increase from $8.80 to $9.30 an hour for nontipped employees next year because of inflation. The minimum wage for tipped employees will increase from $4.40 to $4.65. The changes take effect Jan. 1 and apply to employees of businesses with annual gross receipts of more than $342,000 a year. A 2006 constitutional amendment ties annual increases in the rate to inflation. The Consumer Price Index increased by 5.8% over the 12-month period from Sept. 1, 2020 to Aug. 31. Next year's 50-cent increase is the largest in one year increase since the amendment raised the rate from $4.25 to $6.85 in 2007. For employees at smaller companies and 14- and 15-year-olds, the state minimum wage is the same as the federal wage, $7.25 an hour. Ohio is one of 18 states that makes automatic adjustments to the state minimum wage. Democrat-backed bills to raise the state wage to $15 per hour have failed to pass the GOP-controlled General Assembly.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTahlequah: The Oklahoma-based Cherokee Nation said it has reached 400,000 tribal citizens and expects to become the most populous indigenous tribe in the United States again. “In the coming months, Cherokee Nation Registration will be adding thousands more tribal citizens whose applications are already pending and awaiting verification, making the Cherokee Nation the largest tribe in the United States,” Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. said in a statement. In March, the Arizona-based Navajo Nation announced that it had become the nation’s most populous tribe when it reached a population of nearly 400,000 to surpass the Cherokee Nation, which then had about 392,000 citizens. However, the Cherokee Nation’s registration department has received up to 2,000 citizenship applications weekly since Hoskin announced a $2,000 COVID-19 assistance payment to all citizens and those approved as citizens by June 2022, according to the tribe. The applications for citizenship increased 10-fold from before the payment announcement, according to the tribe. Navajos also saw an enrollment increase as the tribe offered hardship assistance payments from last year’s federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, boosting the tribe’s rolls from about 306,000 to nearly 400,000 citizens.\n\nOregon\n\nNewberg: A school board that acted last month to ban educators from displaying Black Lives Matter and gay pride symbols has broadened the policy to prohibit district employees from displaying all types of political symbols. The move by the Newberg School Board last month to keep staff from displaying BLM or gay pride flags prompted strong criticism and threats to boycott the town of about 25,000 people southwest of Portland and its businesses. Oregon Public Broadcasting reported the board rescinded that rule Tuesday night and enacted a more sweeping policy banning any kind of political symbols, including those that support BLM or LGBTQ issues. “We need to get moving back toward education,” said Board Chair Dave Brown, who joined the majority in the 4-3 vote approving the new policy. “We’ve been derailed for quite a while.” The board’s initial move last month generated a backlash from Newberg city councilors and members of color of the Oregon Legislature. The Oregon State Board of Education called on the school board to reverse course, saying student identities should be welcomed and affirmed. Newberg School Board Vice Chair Brian Shannon said after Tuesday’s vote that it was time to move on. “This policy is so innocuous. It just says that teachers can’t display political symbols at work while they’re on school time,’ Shannon said. “I don’t want to spend five, six more minutes on this issue, let alone six more weeks.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state is mailing 375,000 holders of commercial driver’s licenses in a recruitment campaign meant to address a shortage of school bus drivers. The state has a little more than 42,000 school bus drivers, the smallest complement in five years and about 2,000 fewer than in 2017. The Department of Transportation will mail all current CDL holders about the need for bus drivers and inform them how they can get the right endorsement to operate a school bus, said Kurt Myers, PennDOT’s deputy secretary for driver and vehicle services. The state is hoping to address the shortage by appealing to drivers looking for work or seeking to supplement their income. “We want to do everything we possibly can to expand the number of individuals with school bus endorsements to be able to get our children to school. That’s the critical part of all of this,” Myers said. Schools across the nation are facing driver shortages, and many Pennsylvania districts are impacted, Myers said. PennDOT will also temporarily offer another day of CDL skills testing per week. The additional testing days will be held on Mondays for four consecutive weeks beginning Oct. 18.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNewport:Gustave White Sotheby's International Realty announced the sale of the 30,982-square-foot Miramar mansion at 646 Bellevue Ave., but did not include a sale price. The buyer was unrepresented by an agent, the release said. The property last sold in 2006 for $17.5 million, which at the time was the highest price paid for a single-family home in the city and perhaps in the state, according to a report in The Daily News. According to records in the Newport assessor's office, the estate consists of three properties – the mansion, a carriage house and a separate, vacant 1-acre oceanfront lot – on 7.2 acres of land. Streetcar magnate George Dunton Widener of Philadelphia commissioned noted architect Horace Trumbauer in the early 1900s to build his family a summer home in Newport. During the planning, Widener and his wife, Eleanor, and their son, Harry Elkins Widener, traveled to Europe. On the return trip, in 1912, the father and son went down with the Titanic, but Eleanor Widener survived. She later married Alexander Hamilton Jr., a Harvard professor and grandson of a Massachusetts governor, and completed Miramar in 1913-14. Miramar is the latest in Newport mansions to be sold. Clarendon Court, the former home of Claus and Sunny von Bulow at 626 Bellevue Ave., went earlier this month for $30 million, and Seaward estate at 339 Ocean Avenue was subdivided before being sold for $16 million.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: A man in a standoff with police shot and injured a police dog who bit him as officers tried to take him into custody, investigators said. The standoff at a Greenville home continued for a few more hours before Anthony Shay Hawthorne was arrested, Greenville County Sheriff Hobart Lewis said in a statement Thursday. The dog, named Nikos, was shot in a paw and the head, but should recover. Lewis said. Hawthorne, 44, was taken to a hospital to be treated for the dog bite and is charged with attempted murder, cruelty to a police dog and possession of a weapon during a violent crime, investigators said. The standoff started about 7 p.m. Wednesday when Hawthorne shot at his mother, then barricaded himself in his home, officials said. The police dog was shot when its handler sent it in to try and take Hawthorne into custody, Lewis said. A SWAT team entered the house about 8 hours after the standoff started and took Hawthorne into custody without any further problems, the sheriff said. Lewis praised the work of emergency veterinarians in treating the police dog. “The resiliency of Nikos in these early stages of this incident has been incredible and we are certainly pulling for him as he begins the process for recovery,” the sheriff said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Gov. Kristi Noem is again applying to hold a fireworks display over Mount Rushmore to celebrate Independence Day. The Department of Tourism submitted its application for a special use permit to the National Parks Service on Wednesday on behalf of Noem for fireworks next year. The Parks Service in March denied the state’s application for a fireworks display this year, citing safety concerns. South Dakota had been dealing with drought and wildfires that burned within the monument’s boundaries earlier this year, forcing the park to close for several days. Noem argued that if the fireworks were allowed, conditions would be monitored and organizers could cancel the show if the fire risk was too great. Local Native American tribes also opposed holding the celebration on land they hold as sacred and were concerned about the spread of COVID-19. Noem is in litigation with the U.S. Department of Interior over that rejection. “Despite their arbitrary decision to cancel the 2021 Fireworks Celebration, the Biden Administration has an opportunity to work with us to celebrate next year and for the years to come,” the Republican governor said in a statement. Noem successfully pushed for a return of the event in 2019 after a decadelong hiatus. It gave former President Donald Trump an opportunity to be featured in a patriotic display attended by thousands of people during the pandemic.\n\nTennessee\n\nKnoxville:A Knoxville special education teacher died from COVID-19, a medical examiner’s report has confirmed. Kelle Grady died Sept. 8 at the age of 48, the Knoxville News Sentinel reported. She was a teacher at A.L. Lotts Elementary School. Her obituary called her a “devoted teacher.” Grady died the same day as Knox County Schools bus driver Tammy Murphy, who was ill with COVID-19 for weeks and had been put on a ventilator. The Knox County Board of Education had declined to approve a mask mandate, but on Sept. 24, a federal judge ruled that Knox County Schools must implement masking to help protect children with health problems amid the pandemic. The same ruling also blocked an August executive order by Gov. Bill Lee allowing families to opt out of school mask mandates. It was one of three rulings blocking implementation of Lee’s executive order. The other two affect Williamson and Shelby counties.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: Three firefighters remained in critical condition after an explosion at an apartment complex in Dallas, authorities said. The blast happened Wednesday morning at the apartment complex where the firefighters were responding to a reported natural gas leak. A two-story building partially collapsed, and four firefighters and four civilians were injured. Dallas-Fire Rescue said late Wednesday that all four civilians were released from a hospital along with one of the firefighters. The building where the explosion occurred had 10 units and all of the residents were accounted for, authorities said. The structure was torn down later Wednesday because of safety issues and an investigation into the cause of the blast was ongoing. Dallas-Fire Rescue said natural gas was shut off for the entire complex because of the investigation and that displaced about 300 people. All buildings will be inspected in the complex before the residents return.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:Because of a cold front, a lot of the smoke from a wildfire in the Sequoia National Park is moving to Utah and becoming trapped in the atmosphere above the state's southwestern corner, said National Weather Service meteorologist, Mike Wessler. The forecast suggested winds on Tuesday night could help move some of that smoke toward Colorado, Wessler said, although at least some would stick around longer into the week. Western wildfires sent smoke into Utah throughout the summer, with the local air quality approaching dangerous levels in some places. The latest large set of fires is the KNP Complex, which is threatening Sequoia National Park, home to a forest of giant sequoias, the largest trees in the world, according to the National Park Service website. The giant sequoias, which grow along the west slope of the Sierra Nevada, can be as old as 3,400 years.\n\nVermont\n\nMarlboro: A Vermont music venue, Marlboro Music, has bought the college campus where it resides after 70 years without claim to the property. The president and chair of Marlboro Music, Christopher Serkin, said Tuesday that the purchase of the former Marlboro College was in its last stages. According to documents submitted to the town, Marlboro Music subsidiary Potash Hill paid $2.7 million to the college’s owner, Democracy Builders Fund 1, The Brattleboro Reformer reported. Serkin said Marlboro Music will continue its use of the campus for three months in the summer. It will also develop a process to determine the use of the now-empty college campus for the rest of the year. Before its closure, Marlboro College struggled to keep its doors open as enrollment dwindled and revenue dropped, the newspaper reported. In 2019, Marlboro College merged with Emerson College and closed its main campus.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: An enormous statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee was cut into pieces and hauled away from Richmond’s Monument Avenue three weeks ago, but plaintiffs who failed to block the removal want Virginia’s Supreme Court to reconsider its decision allowing it. Four property owners filed a request Wednesday with the high court for a rehearing, alleging the justices made “several fundamental errors” in their Sept. 2 decision, The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported. The unanimous ruling observed that “values change and public policy changes too” in a democracy. The court cited testimony from historians who said the enormous statue was erected in 1890 to honor the southern white citizenry’s defense of a pre-Civil War life that depended on slavery and the subjugation of Black people. Restoring the monument would be ideal for the plaintiffs, but attorney Patrick M. McSweeney said his clients “don’t think the state owns and controls the monument.” The state wants to keep the monument and land while disavowing promises made to obtain them. “Such a result allows the Commonwealth to take property without compensation,” the petition states.\n\nWashington\n\nBremerton:A 24-year-old North Kitsap man was charged with assault after biting off another man’s thumb during a fight that started as a group of friends were heading to a bar. The victim, 27, wrote in a statement included in Kitsap County Superior Court charging documents that he and the suspect were not getting along in the lead-up to the fight the night of Sept. 2, the Kitsap Sun reported. The victim said the suspect attacked him after he criticized him for being lazy before going into the bar. While on the ground, the victim said he tried to push the man’s face away but his left thumb went into the suspect’s mouth and he bite down. The suspect “continued to bite my thumb until he bit off the end,” the victim wrote. Medics collected the thumb from the roadway and they went to a hospital. The suspect told deputies that the victim turned the verbal argument into a fight by kicking him in the chest and that he “did not bite down very hard,” a deputy wrote. The victim had surgery but lost function from the first knuckle and permanently lost the tip of his thumb. The suspect was charged Tuesday with second-degree assault.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: West Virginia’s largest outdoor festival on the third-highest U.S. bridge next month was canceled Wednesday, a week after a group representing parachutists bailed out. The Bridge Day Commission voted unanimously to cancel the Oct. 16 event on the New River Gorge Bridge. Marcus Ellison, an organizer for a group of BASE jumpers, cited concerns about available health care in case of an emergency because of the coronavirus pandemic in announcing last week that the group would not participate. Some hospitals in southern West Virginia have been inundated in recent weeks with COVID-19 patients, with a few saying their intensive care units were at capacity. Ellison also was concerned there could be an insufficient number of bus drivers to transport BASE jumpers from the bottom to the top of the New River Gorge Bridge in Fayetteville on Oct. 16. BASE stands for building, antenna, span and Earth, the fixed objects from which jumpers leap.\n\nWisconsin\n\nFond Du Lac: Hundreds of people packed a Fond du Lac church to pay respects to police officer Joseph Kurer, 26, who died of coronavirus complications. Kurer died Sept. 22, just a day after his wife gave birth to their second child. At Holy Family Catholic Church, Kurer was remembered Wednesday as a servant and champion of justice. “We’re hurting. It’s not easy, we’re hurting. But we’ll make it through it. We’ll lean on each other and come through,” said Fond du Lac Police Lt. Erik Foster. Kurer also served in the Wisconsin National Guard and because of that, he received full military honors. A pair of Black Hawk helicopters flew over the crowd of mourners outside of the church following the funeral, WBAY-TV reported A long line of squad cars from law enforcement agencies across the state joined the procession as Kurer was taken past the police department one last time. Citizens lined the street to pay their respects to the officer and his family. The police department said Kurer contracted COVID-19 while working, so his death is classified as in the line of duty.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: The vaccine hesitancy in Gillette is emblematic of the live-free, mind-your-own-business mentality toward the pandemic that is dominant across conservative America at a time when the delta variant of the coronavirus is tearing through unvaccinated communities. For every 100 people spotted around town in Gillette, the number wearing masks can be counted on one hand. Among a group of six people on a smoke break downtown, all said they had too many concerns about the vaccine to mess with it. Down the street, a black shirt displayed in a storefront warned, “ATTENTION SNOWFLAKES: THIS IS NOT A SAFE PLACE.” Wyoming is the second-least vaccinated state as of Tuesday, behind only West Virginia. Only 23% of residents in Campbell County, where Gillette is, have been vaccinated, putting it among the bottom handful of places in the U.S.that have not cracked 25% with their COVID-19 immunization rates.

According to the Capital Weather Gang, an upper ridge is the technical term for an extensive zone of high pressure or heat dome.\n\nAlthough the World Meteorological Organization said \"it is premature to attribute the unusually early heat wave to climate change,\" extreme heat waves are among the clearest connections to human-caused climate change, numerous studies have indicated, including one from the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nIn fact, climate change made the European heat waves in the summer of 2003 at least twice as likely; the 2003 heat episode was the deadliest natural disaster in Europe in the last 50 years, with a death toll exceeding 30,000.\n\nThe heat wave in Europe follows extreme heat episodes in Australia, India, Pakistan and parts of the Middle East in 2019, the World Meteorological Organization said.\n\nGlobally, extreme heat events are responsible for more deaths annually than hurricanes, lightning, tornadoes, floods and earthquakes combined, a study in American Journal of Preventative Medicine said.\n\nEven more concerning is that Europe's five hottest summers since 1500 have all been in the 21st century, according to a climatology institute in Potsdam, Germany, the BBC said.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/21/us/summer-heat-records-us-oregon-texas-california-dg/index.html", "title": "More than 300 all-time heat records were broken in the US this ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThis summer hasn’t just seemed hotter than usual — data shows the long, lingering heat waves that blanketed much of the country were unprecedented as the climate crisis pushes temperatures into record territory.\n\nFrom June 1 through September 12, at least 356 all-time heat records from California to Maine from a subset of weather stations were tied or broken, according to a CNN analysis of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data. CNN examined the highest maximum and minimum temperatures collected by weather stations across the country with at least 30 years of data.\n\nAlthough large swaths of Texas and California endured triple-digit temperatures for several days in a row, the state that matched or exceeded the most heat records this summer was Oregon. The Beaver State registered all-time record heat 66 different times this summer, nearly 60 of them in July alone.\n\nAs sweltering as things may have felt during the day, the heat after the sun went down was even more unusual. In the lower 48 states, the nighttime lows this summer were the hottest on record. More than 70% of all the heat records tied or broken were for the hottest low temperature achieved during the day.\n\nIn addition to several high pressure systems across the West and Northeast, the greater number of nighttime records versus the daytime can be partly explained by the wet conditions in some parts of the country, according to Ahira Sanchez-Lugo, a climatologist at NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information.\n\n“Clouds help make the daytime temperatures a bit cooler since they help block the sun’s solar rays, while trapping the Earth’s heat during the night,” Sanchez-Lugo said.\n\nA North American monsoon was active in the southwest this summer and rain clouds have kept daytime high temperatures at bay and overnight low temperatures elevated, Sanchez-Lugo said. In New Mexico, for example, all 15 of the heat records tied or broken in July and August were for nighttime lows.\n\nWarming temperatures at night pose a particular threat to communities without air conditioning, such as those in metro areas in California and Oregon. More than half of residents in the San Francisco metro area lack air conditioning, according to the 2019 American Housing Survey. In San Antonio and Boston, which are located in more humid climates, the same is true of fewer than 10% of homes.\n\nHowever, the heat records broken in California and Oregon occurred in the inland mountain and desert regions, which are more sparsely populated. Although temperatures in the 90s and even 100s and 110s can occur in parts of metro Los Angeles, San Francisco and Portland, the biggest reason those cities have fewer air conditioned homes is because of much cooler ocean temperatures than on the Gulf and East Coasts.\n\n“The seabreeze almost always blows the cooler air over the ocean over land to keep coastal areas fairly mild,” said Ryan Littrell, a meteorologist at National Weather Service Los Angeles. “As a result, air conditioning is not needed the vast majority of the year.”\n\nAlthough areas closer to the coast are still getting warmer, the cool Pacific waters have helped dull the heat spikes experienced in places further inland. In downtown Los Angeles, the average high temperature has risen over the past 30 years by 0.7 degrees. Over that same time period, the average high in San Antonio has risen by 2.8 degrees, according to NOAA.\n\n“It is warmer here than the first half of the 20th century, but we still have the cool Pacific Ocean to help,” Littrell said.\n\nExtreme heat is already one of the deadliest weather phenomena, and scientists say heat is becoming more extreme and more frequent because of the planet-warming emissions from burning fossil fuels.\n\nScientists predict 50-year heat waves — those that are so extreme they would normally only be seen once every 50 years — will become much more frequent as the planet warms. The planet is already 1.2 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial times; at 4 degrees, the chance of a 50-year extreme-heat event will increase to nearly 80% each year.", "authors": ["Christopher Hickey"], "publish_date": "2022/09/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/06/us/extreme-heat-impact-us-west/index.html", "title": "How extreme heat and record high temperatures have impacted the ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nMore than 50 million people across the American West are under heat alerts Tuesday, as a prolonged heat wave continues to grip the region, prompting record high temperatures and upending daily life.\n\nCalifornians have been warned to prepare for rolling blackouts and asked to conserve energy. Wildfires have ripped across the state, killing at least four people while consuming thousands of acres and dozens of structures. And a hiker died while others were rescued in Arizona after suffering heat exhaustion.\n\nThese are just a handful of the impacts stemming from extreme heat, which scientists say is getting worse because of the human-caused climate crisis. Recent heat records have far outpaced cool records, with more than 300 all-time highs recorded this year, compared to just three all-time cool records.\n\nExtreme heat events are being pushed into unprecedented territory by planet-warming emissions, making the Pacific Northwest’s historic 2021 heat wave, for instance, “virtually impossible” without the climate crisis, scientists found.\n\nHere’s a look at some of the effects of recent weeks’ heat across the West.\n\nCalifornians brace for rolling blackouts\n\nResidents of the Golden State have been told to prepare for the possibility of power outages Tuesday evening as record demand threatens to outstrip the power supply while heat records are broken across the state.\n\nCalifornia Independent Operator System (Cal ISO), which oversees the power grid for most of the state, said it expects to reach a stage 3 emergency level by 5:30 p.m., when peak demand is expected to reach an all-time high. A stage 3 alert is the final step before rotating power outages are implemented.\n\nThe president of the operator of most of California’s power grid urged residents to conserve energy after 4 p.m., calling the efforts “absolutely essential,” per a news release Monday.\n\nForecasted demand “is at all-time record levels and the potential for rotating outages has increased significantly,” said Elliot Mainzer of the California Independent Systems Operator.\n\nAbout 9,500 Pacific Gas and Electric customers in the San Francisco Bay Area were without power as of 1 pm, according to utility spokesperson Deanna Contreras. That number was down from a peak of about 45,000 customers out of power Monday at 7 p.m.\n\nVehicles drive Friday past a sign on the 110 Freeway warning of extreme heat and urging energy conservation during a heat wave in downtown Los Angeles.

That followed 114 degrees Monday, the city’s hottest September day on record. San Francisco International Airport hit 97 degrees, a daily record, and that city remains under a heat advisory Tuesday.\n\nFurther south, Death Valley could hit 125 degrees Tuesday, which would tie its hottest September temperature on record. (Despite an unofficial reading of an even higher temperature, Death Valley on Friday officially only reached 124 degrees. And its September record is still short of Earth’s all-time record for the month: 126 degrees, set in 1950 in Mecca, California.)\n\nIf rotating outages occur this week in California, they would likely last at least 40 minutes each before power is restored for the first set of impacted customers and goes out for the next group. Utilities would try to keep outages as short as possible, Mainzer assured customers, but operators anticipate power supply deficits between 400 and 3,400 megawatts between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. Tuesday.\n\nOverall demand is forecast to hit 51,145 megawatts, higher than the previous record demand of 50,270 megawatts, set in July 2006.\n\nFish died in a Utah reservoir\n\nAnd California’s regional neighbors are toying with record high temperatures, too. Billings, Montana, also hit 100 degrees on Monday, the first time the city has hit 100 degrees twice in the same September.\n\nAnd Salt Lake City, Utah, hit 104 degrees Monday – the city’s hottest September day on record and its 32nd day in 2022 with temperatures of at least 100 degrees, another record.\n\nIn fact, temperatures have been so high in Utah this summer that wildlife biologists have attributed the heat and low water levels to the deaths of fish late last month: Roughly 80 kokanee salmon were confirmed dead on August 26 at Lost Creek Reservoir, about 70 miles northeast of Salt Lake City, according to Faith Jolley, a spokesperson for the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources, though she noted that was “quite a small amount of the total fish there.”\n\nStill, with “the recent heat wave and record number of hot days this summer and lower water levels, water temperatures at Lost Creek are just starting to reach the thermal maximum for what kokanee can tolerate,” Jolley said in an email.\n\nWater levels in lakes and reservoirs fall during a drought, she explained, and at a lower water level, those bodies of water heat more quickly. That’s bad for fish, Jolley said, because warm water holds less oxygen than cooler water. Together, the high temperatures and lack of oxygen can result in poor fish growth, disease and even death.\n\nBoats are seen in low water at the Antelope Point Marina in Lake Powell on the Colorado River in Page, Arizona, on September 4, 2022.

The fire ignited Monday afternoon and quickly burned 2,000 acres, destroying at least seven structures and damaging several more, per Cal Fire, and forcing the evacuations of at least 5,000 homes.\n\nFire officials have yet to identify those who died in the fire or the circumstances in which they perished.\n\nA vehicle burns Monday at a property ravaged by the Fairview Fire near Hemet, California.

Elsewhere, the Mountain Fire had burned another 11,700 acres.\n\nProlonged drought has left behind a “huge amount of dead fuel,” Cal Fire Battalion Chief Jon Heggie told CNN Sunday, calling the conditions “extremely dangerous.”\n\n“All these fires now have receptive fuel beds to burn,” he said. “Now, when anything gets started, it has that potential for exponential growth in a short period of time just because everything is so tinder dry.”\n\nVehicles and homes destroyed by the Mill Fire line a neighborhood Saturday in Weed, California.

Others, drivers of certain Ranger pickups, may have incorrectly installed air bags that may not deploy in a crash, putting passengers at risk.\n\nA Free Press investigation reviewed internal company documents, dealership memos, federal regulatory filings and court papers, showing that Ford fined some dealerships whose repair techs billed the automaker for replacing Takata air bags despite installing the devices incorrectly or not doing the work at all. A federal whistleblower complaint alleges Ford invited trouble by easing repair rules to allow low-skill techs to process the repairs quickly — a charge the automaker adamantly denies.\n\nDrivers left dealerships thinking their air bags were safe. Still, without a reinspection, they and their front-seat passengers have remained at risk of gruesome injury and even death every time they are on the road — illustrated by the case of a Texas woman who lost her left eye in a low-speed accident in 2020. Sara Mae Morgan settled a lawsuit with Ford in 2022 and the dealership in 2023. She described to the Free Press a variety of life-altering injuries from the accident in a Mustang whose owners had taken the car in for air bag replacement.\n\nPart of the problem is that no one — not the drivers, Ford, or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration — knows exactly which vehicles weren’t repaired correctly. Among the challenges is that Ford must track down current owners of vehicles as old as 2004 models and reinspect them.\n\n\"I can't sleep at night when I think of this,\" the whistleblower told the Free Press. \"It makes me physically ill.”\n\nFord told the Free Press it is committed to finding and repairing the vehicles in question and characterized the problem as isolated.\n\nMost of the vehicles — nearly 232,000 — are Ranger pickups, for which Ford issued a formal recall in 2023 because of the potential for incorrect passenger-side air bag installation. In this instance, Takata air bags were replaced, but those installed improperly may not deploy in a crash, leaving passengers at risk.\n\nAnother 41,600 Ford vehicles of various models “where we believe there could be issues with repairs” must be reinspected, Ford spokesman T.R. Reid told the Free Press. In those instances, Ford’s records show that air bag replacement was completed, but by technicians found to have cut corners on some recall work.\n\nThe whistleblower contends the numbers are much higher, based on information from dealers.\n\nThe problem was serious enough that Ford fined certain dealerships thousands of dollars after making the discovery. Ford will not reveal how many dealers were fined or how much, but Reid said the penalties “were substantial enough to get their attention and make clear that the behavior wasn’t acceptable.”\n\nPunishment for bad behavior\n\nA Ford document reviewed by the Free Press warned dealers of fines of $10,000 per violation, and dealers told the Free Press that some dealership fines reached six figures. One dealer, whom the Free Press is not naming to avoid compromising his relationship with Ford, called it a “money grab” intended to offset a slice of Ford’s massive recall costs.\n\nFord’s reinspection program for the nearly 42,000 vehicles, which is not listed as a formal safety recall, runs through March 2027, according to documents filed with federal safety regulators. Reid told the Free Press in early February about 11% of that work is done. He said only about 1.5% of the reinspections turned up Takata replacement problems.\n\nFord sold millions of the models from which the 41,600 was drawn, including Fusions, Edges, Mustangs and more. Reid said the company has found no reason to inspect a larger sampling of those models, even though he said during interviews and via email the 1.5% error rate may be close to normal for any repair.\n\n'A ticking time bomb'\n\nMichael Brooks, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety, said more vehicles should be reinspected.\n\n“I think Ford needs to go back and do a full audit to make sure no one has received a fake Takata repair, that they don’t miss anything,” Brooks said. “They need to find every vehicle that hasn’t received the correct fix. They’re the ones ultimately responsible. These are consumers who presented their vehicles for repair and they weren’t repaired.\n\n“After years of exposure, the failure rate of the air bags goes through the roof and becomes incredibly dangerous,” Brooks said. “If someone gets an incorrect repair, they’re going to be at risk. There’s no question. You literally have a ticking time bomb that can explode at any moment.”\n\nMost consumers know about Takata air bag recalls. But this issue is more insidious because consumers think they’ve taken care of the dangerous problem. Their vehicle repair records indicate the problem is fixed. But in reality, the danger worsens with every passing day as the air bags age.\n\nRisk of injury for at least 4,000 drivers\n\nThe repair failures are tied to the largest automotive recall in U.S. history, that of 67 million Takata air bag inflators, whose metal canisters degrade with age, heat and humidity and can, without warning, become bombs. Takata air bag explosions in the U.S. have killed 26 people and injured hundreds with sharp metal fragments to the face, neck and chest since the late 1990s.\n\nThe risk of death and deformity increases with time in the millions of vehicles still needing repair.\n\nFord was among 19 automakers required to recall vehicles using Takata air bags. In Ford’s case, that was nearly 4.4 million air bag inflators in an estimated 3.95 million vehicles, Ford spokeswoman Maria Buczkowski said.\n\nIn the reinspection programs, based on numbers Ford provided, about 60 of the reexamined vehicles have been found so far with flawed air bag replacements. If the 1.5% error rate holds for the 270,000 designated for reinspection, about 4,000 would be found with air bag flaws that were supposed to have been fixed.\n\nThe number is small, but each of those 4,000 vehicles holds the potential for devastating consequences — if incorrectly installed replacement air bags don't deploy or if unreplaced Takata devices explode.\n\nShe lost an eye\n\nIn June 2020, Morgan climbed into the passenger seat of a 2007 Ford Mustang, clipped her seat belt and settled in to ride with her boyfriend to her job as a waitress at Smithhart's Texas Grill, south of Houston. According to the lawsuit she filed and later settled, a minor fender bender at less than 14 mph triggered an air bag explosion that discharged shrapnel into her face.\n\nHer left eyeball is gone. Her right eye is damaged. She has hearing loss and tinnitus.\n\nIt shouldn’t have happened — the boyfriend’s family took the Mustang to a dealership in October 2018 to replace the defective Takata air bags. But the vehicle’s repair records, obtained by the Free Press, showed only the driver-side air bag was fixed.\n\n\"Now I have to see a counselor that helps me with my mental health, or PTSD, from the accident,” Morgan told the Free Press. “It's kind of gut-wrenching. I'm just trying to find a way to cope.\n\n\"It's like a feeling of grief, the way I feel when I look back. Just pain, honestly. And I'll have flashbacks.\"\n\nMorgan, now 23, of Pearland, Texas, said she lost count of her surgeries after a dozen. She takes medicine to sleep. She takes medicine for migraines. She takes medicine for depression now. She finds it difficult to be in public. She doesn't go underwater anymore, worried about protecting her eye socket.\n\n\"It was an air bag,” Morgan said, pausing. “That's what's supposed to protect you when you get in an accident. And it can seriously, drastically change your life in a matter of seconds.\"\n\nFord launches internal audit to crack down on wrongdoing\n\nAfter finding evidence of shoddy recall work, Ford in 2020 required specific dealers to audit certain safety repairs. Ford says the audit, called the Dealer Incomplete Recall Repair Process, was triggered when it discovered some technicians failed to complete door latch recall work for which they billed the automaker.\n\nThe audit also directed the dealers to review work on air bags and seat belt components, a company document shows. The audit focused on techs whose work was flagged; the company won’t say how many workers were involved.\n\nAs a result of the audit, Ford wrote to its roughly 3,000 Lincoln and Ford dealers on March 28, 2022, saying the company determined that vehicles claimed by dealers as repaired under the Takata air bag safety recalls may not have actually had the repairs.\n\nThat letter told dealers to inspect vehicles in the shop and ensure air bags are installed correctly. The reinspection was classified as a “quality inspection program,” which differs from a formal recall. An NHTSA representative said the quality inspection program “is an audit to ensure recall repairs, and it and other service programs were conducted as instructed. While there is no reporting requirement, Ford regularly updates the agency on the progress of such programs during meetings.”\n\nThe program includes 2004-11 Ranger pickups. In spring 2023, 2004-06 Rangers were formally recalled for air bag reinspection. Enough mistakes were found in Rangers during work that followed the March 2022 memo to prompt last year's recall.\n\nBeyond the Ranger, Ford’s 2022 memo said vehicles to be reinspected included select 2007-10 Ford Edges; 2006-12 Ford Fusions; 2005-06 Ford GTs; 2005-14 Ford Mustangs; 2007-10 Lincoln MKXs; 2006-12 Lincoln Zephyr/MKZs; and 2006-11 Mercury Milans.\n\nLetters went to affected vehicle owners in April 2022 saying, “A Ford Motor Company quality audit found that it is possible that the dealership technician who serviced your vehicle did not complete some of the repairs that the dealership submitted claims for.”\n\nThayne Hansen, Ford director of service engineering operations for the international markets group, referred to the rechecks as “the recall of a recall” in an interview with the Free Press.\n\nWhistleblower allegations challenge Ford's good faith\n\nA whistleblower complaint that outlines safety concerns, initially filed with federal safety regulators in 2019 and obtained by the Free Press, argues that the danger evolved, in part, from Ford’s decision to change training requirements for technicians.\n\nFord, which denies changing standards, and the whistleblower offer differing narratives of what happened:\n\nThe whistleblower — whom the Free Press is not naming because of the person’s concern about damaging their business relationship with Ford — alleges that in 2019, Ford moved to allow workers without adequate training to complete air bag repairs.\n\nA follow-up letter in July 2022 to top NHTSA officials from the whistleblower’s lawyer said, “Ford Motor Company intentionally caused bad actors and egregious actions by turning away from their own published policies.”\n\nTakata air bags were so common that, after their danger was discovered, they couldn’t be replaced quickly. NHTSA set a schedule that is still being completed, with 7.1 million of 67 million air bag inflators originally recalled still to be replaced, according to the NHTSA website.\n\nBy late 2018 — around the same period that the Ford Mustang that later injured Morgan was taken to the shop for air bag repair — Ford came under pressure from federal safety regulators to speed up its Takata repairs. Dealerships were already buried with recall and warranty work, with Ford second among automakers in recalls in 2017-18.\n\nThe Free Press obtained a November 2018 document from Ford to its dealers notifying them that a “new Service Dispatch Flexibility program will replace the current Technician Competency Performance Exemption program.”\n\n“Use the program to dispatch repair work to experienced/qualified Technicians that may not yet be certified,” the document said.\n\nTo catch up on Takata replacements, the whistleblower complaint argues, Ford eased its standards for who could do recall repairs, permitting “Quick Lane” workers who usually did routine work such as oil changes, tire rotation or brake pad replacement to now replace air bags.\n\nThat, the whistleblower contends, invited the sloppy work.\n\n'Guidelines are vague'\n\nFord argues that, contrary to the whistleblower’s assertion, the company did not change standards for who could replace Takata air bags. Reid and Buczkowski said the 2019 policy changes involved warranty work, which they separate from recall repairs.\n\nReid said in an email that “the technical requirements for performing recall service work have not changed from 2018 and forward.”\n\nDealers interviewed by the Free Press saw it differently.\n\n“Policy guidelines are vague enough that it’s not at all uncommon for the same vehicle to go into two different stores (dealerships) and one says it’s a warranty repair and the other store doesn’t. It’s a function of interpretation,” one longtime dealer told the Free Press, asking that the dealership name be withheld to avoid backlash from corporate headquarters.\n\n“Ford’s office of general counsel is over-the-top conservative. I’m guessing that somebody in warranty writes those recall instructions and sends them on to the office of general counsel and then anything that could possibly paint Ford into a corner gets taken out,” the dealer said.\n\nThree dealers in different parts of the U.S. told the Free Press that Ford technicians see doing warranty repair and recall or tech service bulletin work as all the same.\n\n“A Field Service Action is an overarching term that encompasses all that stuff,” one dealer said. \"Ford is the customer. Ford determines how much they get paid for it. And the techs don’t always agree with the process.\n\n“In all stores (dealerships) I’ve ever seen, technicians do the work, whatever it is; customer pay, insurance or warranty. If you asked a technician if a recall is warranty work, he’d say yes. That’s nine out of 10 techs. For both, Ford determines how long it takes, Ford tells them how to do it and Ford says what parts to use.”\n\nThe dealer, who echoed the whistleblower, said, “Techs fix things that need fixing. A recall is a warranty and a technical service bulletin is warranty. The door latch recall … all of a sudden Ford reduced reimbursement rates … Techs were upset, so they were shortcutting the job. I never thought they would do that in reference to Takata. … But there are obviously some seriously disgruntled techs out there.”\n\nFord cut rates to its repair techs in years leading up to the air bag repair backlog, which angered many techs and sparked an online change.org petition in November 2019 that collected 3,950 Ford tech signatures.\n\n“Next time your car is at a dealer for days, and you wonder why, it's because the few of us that remain cannot handle all of the work,” Ford dealership technician William Stox told the Free Press. “Cuts in our labor times, combined with warranty becoming 60-70% of our workload, have driven tech shortages that are occurring. … It's immoral, unethical.”\n\nFord: 'It's not that hard'\n\nFord says technical certification isn’t necessary for air bag repairs — and that any changes came under pressure from NHTSA to accept some added risk.\n\nFederal regulators urged automakers to be creative, “to go find ways to do things,” said Hansen, Ford's director of service engineering operations. “Under the guidance of the monitor from NHTSA, we were being encouraged — I will say encouraged would be a mild word — we were being encouraged to go and look at new ways … in regards to getting more repairs done.”\n\nReid said, “In order to get more customers in for assessments and necessary repairs more quickly, it required everybody, manufacturers and NHTSA, to think differently. And that’s what we did.”\n\nThe dealership employees who ordinarily did routine tasks would be working off illustrated, step-by-step instructions.\n\n“In 2019, we reminded (dealers) that recall repairs, directed repairs, could be done by any of their technicians,” Reid told the Free Press. “Recall repairs are structured, broken down in a way that make them relatively simple to do.\n\n“Because they’re not diagnosing a problem, they’re looking to make sure it’s installed correctly,” Reid said. “That can be shown with descriptions and graphics so they can identify whether it’s done right.”\n\nThe primary reason that Ford “reminded” the dealers of the protocol in 2019, Reid said, “is because they were starting to get backlogged on recall repairs generally.”\n\nFord reiterated to dealers that “any technician had the ability to do that,” Buczkowski said of air bag replacements. “These are actually not as complicated repairs as I think you’re being told by the dealers.”\n\nYet, regarding the 2004-06 Ranger pickups recalled last year, repair techs “didn’t follow the repair procedures that we had sent to them,” Buczkowski said. “They didn’t properly follow instructions.”\n\nHansen said the fixes involve simply replacing the inflator or entire air bag, if necessary, not servicing the air bag itself or the system that controls it.\n\n“If a person can follow directions, anyone can do it,” he said. “It’s not hard.”\n\n'Anytime I deal with an air bag, I take it very seriously'\n\nOthers say replacement of air bags, which they describe as deceptively complex electrical and chemical packets, requires expertise.\n\nStephen Ridella, then-director of vehicle crashworthiness research at NHTSA, cautioned in 2015 about the difficulty of Takata replacements. Ridella said during a webinar, \"these inflator parts are complex and unique ... only someone with specialized training should replace these parts.\"\n\nMichael Crossen is an automotive service excellence master certified technician at Consumer Reports and former master certified automotive technician at Mercedes-Benz.\n\n“The driver’s air bag is not terribly difficult to replace, provided you follow safety precautions,” Crossen told the Free Press. “The passenger air bag is definitely more difficult to replace. Most master technicians could replace the driver’s air bag in five to 10 minutes. A passenger air bag could take hours. You may have to remove pieces of the dashboard or the whole dashboard cover.\n\n“Any time I deal with an air bag, I take it very seriously. Air bags are maybe second only to seat belts in terms of crash safety. You need to make sure you don’t rush,” Crossen said. “If I were a customer, I would like to think the technician working on an important safety system in my vehicle has more experience than just oil changes.”\n\nWhat happens when an air bag deploys is complex. Sensors in vehicles detect collisions, and those sensors send an electric signal to the canister that contains a colorless salt known as sodium azide, and the electric signal detonates a small amount of an igniter compound, Joseph Merola, a chemistry professor and associate dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at Virginia Tech, wrote in Scientific American in 1999. The heat from this ignition starts the decomposition of the sodium azide, which is poisonous, and the generation of nitrogen gas to fill the air bag in seconds.\n\nCrossen told the Free Press in mid-February, \"When a dashboard air bag goes off, you usually have to replace the dashboard because it tears it apart. When an air bag goes off, it's a violent event.\"\n\nBrooks, with the Center for Auto Safety, said other automakers, including Toyota and Honda, have gone to extremes to ensure that they not only have achieved the highest recall repair rates possible but have told the owners of vehicles in some instances that they need to park the vehicles and not drive them until the air bags are replaced.\n\nToyota, Honda issue new safety recalls\n\nToyota issued a do-not-drive warning in January for 50,000 2003-05 vehicles, Brooks noted. “They know how dangerous this is. This isn’t one of those safety defects where there’s a one in 10,000 chance. Once those inflator chemicals are exposed, you’re looking at significant rates of failure. That’s why it’s so urgent to get these fixes done properly.\"\n\nIn May 2019, Honda recalled 19,000 vehicles after identifying a problem similar to Ford’s. The company told NHTSA, “A nationwide audit on the workmanship of vehicles repaired by service technicians no longer employed by Acura or Honda dealerships prior to May 2018” found that “passenger frontal air bag inflators may have been incorrectly installed at certain dealerships.” NHTSA’s safety bulletin at the time stated that air bag replacement should be performed only by \"skilled technicians who have the proper tools, equipment and training ...\"\n\nA service technician from Hoover, Alabama, posting on an internal Ford site in 2023, criticized the use of Quick Lane techs for repair work because air bag replacement requires more than “any trained monkey” can perform. And a senior master technician from Great Bend, Kansas, noted that Ford is allowing dealership managers to determine capability — but then face punishment later if there’s a problem. The Free Press reviewed the comments.\n\nNHTSA told the Free Press via email that regulators are working with the automaker to bring the safety issue into compliance through the 2022 quality inspection program. The agency said it does not acknowledge or discuss whistleblower complaints publicly or the potential status of an investigation. The whistleblower said they last had contact with regulators in 2022.\n\nFord jumps to the front in air bag replacement rates\n\nAfter telling dealers to be creative and use more personnel to handle Takata recall work, Ford's air bag replacements sped up significantly. The company attributed the surge in repairs to parts availability.\n\nBut problems emerged, leading to the March 2020 announcement of an audit program examining allegations of suspicious repairs performed by certain technicians.\n\nReid told the Free Press the audits first looked at door latch recall repairs, but turned up other issues that led to reexamining Takata air bag replacements and seat belt components.\n\nThat audit — called the Dealer Incomplete Recall Repair Process — turned up enough flawed repairs that the company launched its ongoing five-year reinspection program.\n\nFord won’t disclose the full results, but the Free Press reviewed a document that showed one dealer who, as part of the audit, inspected 137 vehicles and discovered 61 incomplete air bag repairs.\n\nThe larger audit was focused on technicians whose work had come under scrutiny.\n\nFord noted that, “In one outcome of that auditing, we learned that 98.5% of the Takata air bag replacements by those technicians were done correctly in the first place.”\n\nFord customers get tangled in bigger recall crisis backlog\n\nThe Takata recall and the reinspection program added work for an automaker swamped in recent years with billions of dollars in recall and warranty work, which not only causes a backlog at dealerships but because of Ford’s cap on reimbursement brings in less money than regular mechanic work.\n\nFord has issued far more recalls than its competitors. Some dealers warn customers to expect a monthslong wait for repair, with some even suggesting they go to a non-Ford shop, customers from different parts of the country told the Free Press.\n\nCertified technicians already were angry with the Ford mothership by the dawn of 2019 over 2017 limits on reimbursement for recall repairs. The whistleblower told the Free Press that wrongdoing related to these Takata repairs could have easily been predicted and prevented.\n\nIn March 2023, Ford sent a letter to dealers urging them — as it did in 2019 — \"to be creative in their approach to completing Takata air bag recall repairs.\" Ford referred dealers to examples of creative approaches, called the \"non-traditional repair approaches\" section in the dealer bulletin.\n\n“That may not be typically how they organized and handled service in their shops,” Reid said. “I suspect because dealers typically had the work done by their service technicians. They also were building, generally speaking, a backlog of warranty repairs that they couldn’t get through their shops because of capacity. … Ultimately, the delivery of service is up to the dealers. They know the people in the shop and they know their capabilities.”\n\n'No checks and balances' between Ford, dealerships\n\nAs the reinspection program continues, owners of the affected vehicles may be driving with an explosive device that can malfunction at any time.\n\nTwo Ford dealers told the Free Press many vehicle owners are numb to recall notices, they arrive so often from automakers now, and certainly the Takata warnings have faded to a dull hum after all these years.\n\nSara Mae Morgan reached a confidential settlement with Ford in 2022 and the dealership in February 2023, with the help of Houston trial lawyer Rob Ammons, who has done significant work involving air bags.\n\nIt was Ammons' client, Air Force Lt. Stephanie Erdman, who testified before Congress in 2014 after being blinded in one eye from air bag shrapnel while driving a 2002 Honda Civic. Today, Erdman is featured on the Ford website urging consumers to get their air bags fixed.\n\n\"We thought we succeeded in fixing this problem, but now we're learning there's no checks and balances between Ford and the dealerships,\" Ammons told the Free Press. \"The longer they’re (air bags) in the car, the more likely they are to have an uncontrolled deployment. This isn’t like a great wine that gets better with age.\"\n\nHe emphasized in mid-February, \"Unless we get all of these air bags out of these vehicles and replaced with safer ones, we're going to see more of these ruptures and catastrophic injuries.\"\n\nContact Phoebe Wall Howard: 313-618-1034 or phoward@freepress.com.

At least 1.5 million remain on the road and continue to torment their owners — and Ford.\n\nThe automaker pushed past company lawyers’ early safety questions and a veteran development engineer’s warning that the cars weren’t roadworthy, internal emails and documents show. Ford then declined, after the depth of the problem was obvious, to make an expensive change in the transmission technology.\n\nFREE PRESS INVESTIGATION: OUT OF GEAR\n\nInstead, the company kept trying to find a fix for the faulty transmission for five years while complaints and costs piled up. In the interim, Ford officials prepared talking points for dealers to tell customers that the cars operated normally when, in fact, internal documents are peppered with safety concerns and descriptions of the defects.\n\nThe automaker faces thousands of angry customers, including former loyalists who say they will never buy another Ford; hundreds of millions in repair costs, many times without actually fixing the cars; and litigation so serious the company this spring warned investors of the financial threat posed by defects in what Ford called its DPS6 transmission.\n\nApart from the legal risks, “Total quality related spending for DPS6 could reach $3 billion,” read a 2016 internal report that projected the costs through 2020.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday to the Free Press, Ford said conversations about \"challenges common to innovative new technology\" were \"normal exchanges.\" It said many customers were unaccustomed to the feel of the transmission and acknowledged that, \"After the new transmission was on the road, other problems developed. We acted quickly and determinedly to investigate the problems. ... While we eventually resolved the quality issues, the solutions were more complex and took longer than we expected. We regret the inconvenience and frustration that caused some consumers.\" It acknowledged discussion of switching to a different transmission and said it made choices based on what it thought \"best for customers.\"\n\nFord Focus recall:Automaker recalls 58,000 vehicles that could get deformed fuel tank\n\nTo understand what happened, the Free Press reviewed hundreds of pages of internal documents, emails and court filings from the past decade in which Ford engineers and managers discussed concerns and sought to control damage from the dual-clutch transmission, which enabled the company to tout gas mileage near 40 mpg on the highway.\n\nThe Free Press also analyzed consumer complaints to federal safety officials, finding accounts of 50 previously unreported injuries amid more than 4,300 entries about the unreliable transmissions. No deaths are publicly known to have been linked to the defect.\n\nFord’s position has consistently been that even if the cars slip out of gear while people are driving and they must coast to the side of the road, the cars don’t pose a safety risk because power steering, brakes, passenger restraints and other functions continue to work. Its statement to the Free Press for this story reiterated that \"vehicles in which DPS6 was installed were and remain safe.\"\n\nOthers believe the cars are dangerous, including thousands of vehicle owners, a leading consumer safety advocate and a longtime former Ford quality engineer who spoke to the Free Press. Federal regulators in 2014 conferred with Ford and declined to launch a formal investigation or order a recall of the transmissions.\n\nInternal discussions persisted at Ford for years, at times becoming heated. Consumer blowback came quickly, with the first complaints about the transmissions filed with the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration within months of the 2011 Fiesta going on sale. That model year Fiesta was the first vehicle with the DPS6, hitting the market in March 2010, followed by the 2012 Focus, which reached dealerships in March 2011.\n\nLawsuits on behalf of U.S. owners allege the company defrauded buyers. Ford denies the allegations, but made headlines after settling claims in Australia and Thailand.\n\n‘Lessons Learned’\n\nA high-level, confidential analysis by Ford in 2012 acknowledged rushing the cars to production, taking shortcuts to save money and apparently compromising quality protocols instituted with fanfare by then-CEO Alan Mulally. That review, obtained by the Free Press, also said the transmissions would be phased out and a different technology used going forward, but that didn’t happen. The Focus went out of production after the 2018 model year; the 2019 Fiesta is the last of the line.\n\nBy the time of the 2012 review, which was labeled “Lessons Learned,” Ford had sold more than half a million of the cars.\n\n“There is no fix at this time,” system testing engineer Tom Hamm wrote separately in an October 2012 email to four colleagues. “We have a task force working on the issue but they haven’t identified any fixes at this time.”\n\nAmong the documents the Free Press obtained is a presentation in which Ford told NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigations in 2014 that the problems occurred as vehicles aged. That contradicts internal emails, hundreds of consumer complaints about problems in both new and older cars, and an affidavit in 2018 by Ford’s North American powertrain quality manager saying part of the issue was with transmissions “not yet broken in.” The official also said in the affidavit that Ford learned of the problem in 2011.\n\nBut on Aug. 31, 2010, just six months before the 2012 Focus hit the market, product development engineer Tom Langeland emailed colleagues and supervisors describing “nasty launch judder” — intense vibration from a stop — that “did not clear up after many miles of driving.”\n\n“We also cannot achieve a driveable calibration that will get us to production,” he wrote. “The clutch torque delivery MUST BE IMPROVED.”\n\nT-boned in Saginaw\n\nFourteen months later, a Saginaw driver in a 2012 Focus that had been driven only 500 miles reported this to federal safety authorities: “I was stopped at a parking lot exit waiting to enter a thoroughfare, engine idling, with my foot lightly on the brake. Suddenly, the car accelerated forward, into the traffic lane, as though someone had pressed the accelerator pedal to the floor. I took a 45 mph T-bone on my driver’s side door.”\n\nThe driver reported that his “elderly wife suffered a severe heart bruising from the seat belt” and that he figured he was saved by the air bag.\n\nDozens of owners from throughout the country reached out to the Free Press to share their experiences:\n\n“What is it going to take? Does someone have to die before they get these cars fixed?” asked Carrie Armstrong, 42, of Hendersonville, Tennessee. “When I am on the interstate and almost get hit by a diesel truck just because my car will not accelerate and get into gear? I put my life in danger every day I get behind the wheel of this car just to go to work.”\n\nShe said she has taken her 2015 Focus to the dealership 10 times for repair. “I bought it new and it started acting up on me two months after I bought it. I thought, ‘I shouldn’t be having these transmission issues right now.’ ”\n\nShe added: “I’ve got a $5,000 car note left. It’s almost paid off. I’ve owned a Ford Escort, a Ford Explorer, a Ford Fusion and several Mustangs. I’ve put my trust in this company.”\n\nArmstrong’s repeated repairs are a common experience: Ford’s internal 2016 DPS6 update, marked “SECRET” on each page, notes that 350,000 of the cars “have already reached 3+ repairs in US.”\n\nLillian Karamanian, a retired clothing store owner from Troy, got rid of her 2011 Fiesta shortly after taking it for a repair. “I wanted to know if I would notice a difference on the surging, hesitation and lack of power. The response was that it would take at least 500 miles of aggressive driving in order to break in the fix and be able to notice a difference. I did everything I was supposed to do and nothing changed. It never got fixed. I kept thinking ‘this is crazy.’\"\n\nKyle McIlmurray, 30, a journalist from Grand Rapids, said his family has always been loyal to Ford. He bought his 2015 Focus new and started seeing transmission symptoms immediately. “I’m pressing on the gas, it’s not going. It’s sputtering. Eventually, it will catch for a rather rough acceleration. Thankfully, I’ve had no serious issues on the road. Sometimes it feels like the car isn’t gonna go, (or) the car is accelerating way faster than I want it to go.”\n\nLegal filings representing current and former owners claim that their 2012-16 Focus and 2011-16 Fiesta cars were prone to “shuddering, slipping, bucking, jerking, hesitation while changing gears, premature internal wear, delays in downshifting and, in some cases, sudden or delayed acceleration.”\n\nLawsuit:Ford hid Focus, Fiesta transmission problems — then blamed customers\n\nFord Explorer:Drivers complain of dizziness, nausea, vomiting\n\nMany owners, in their NHTSA complaints, pleaded with regulators to recall the cars.\n\nThe 2012-16 Focus and 2011-16 Fiesta equipped with the DPS6 have been the subject of 18 recalls for a range of defects, but none for transmission repair.\n\nFord has conducted customer service programs for updates and replacement parts and has extended the warranty on the transmissions. By late 2016, Ford documents show, “technical fixes to the Control Module and Clutch are in production and available for both vehicle assembly and service,” but supply of the parts was thousands short of what was needed for replacement. Some owners have gotten new DPS6 transmissions under warranty that have not solved the problems.\n\nFord Focus recall:Automaker recalls 58,000 vehicles that could get deformed fuel tank\n\nFord F-150:1.48 million pickups recalled due to crash concern\n\nInternal warnings\n\nMany within Ford foresaw the problems, according to materials obtained by the Free Press, which included 41 lawsuit exhibits filed in customer litigation. Thirty-one exhibits in that set of lawsuits remain out of public view.\n\nFord’s lawyers argued against making the documents public early this year, saying, in part, \"In fact, the 72 documents that … Plaintiffs propose to file highlight the fundamental deficiency in their Complaint: like the Complaint, these documents merely show that Ford — both before and after Plaintiffs purchased their vehicles — identified and addressed various issues of varying significance with the transmission.\"\n\nThe documents show that Ford lawyers told engineers in 2008 they were worried about the safety of the dual-clutch technology, which had encountered problems during early use by Volkswagen in Europe.\n\nFord would be putting this transmission into low-priced, high-volume vehicles for the first time. Corporate lawyers maintained, as noted repeatedly in emails by engineers obtained by the Free Press, that the transmissions’ tendency to slip out of gear, if combined with other conditions, would result in a “Severity 10” rating. That’s the worst possible rating under global engineering protocols designed to minimize risk and comply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards set by the U.S. government.\n\nThe cars and transmission technology were critical to Ford at the time. The vehicles were developed as the company lost more than $30 billion from 2006-08.\n\nThe coming recession would send General Motors and Chrysler to bankruptcy in 2009, with Ford surviving thanks to a $23 billion line of credit secured in late 2006, in Mulally’s early months as CEO. But Ford was hardly out of the woods. Sales of its cash cow, the F-Series pickup, had plummeted as gas prices surged and construction activity froze. Mulally told lenders he would cut costs and boost development of the fuel-efficient cars Americans needed at the time.\n\nA new presidential administration also turned up the pressure on all automakers, including Ford, to make their entire fleets more fuel-efficient. Before the new Fiesta and Focus would go to dealers, recently inaugurated President Barack Obama in May 2009 announced aggressive fuel-economy standards to require automakers to hit an average across their fleets of 35.5 mpg in 2016.\n\nFord promoted the DPS6 as offering the fuel economy and acceleration of a manual transmission with the operational ease of an automatic.\n\n“With gasoline already more than $4 per gallon in some American cities, the new fuel-saving dual dry-clutch Ford PowerShift six-speed automatic is the right transmission at the right time,” a March 2011 news release said as the new Focus went to dealers.\n\nProgram calibration manager George Herr, who responded with concern to Langeland’s email six months earlier that “we … cannot achieve a driveable calibration,” was quoted in the news release praising the technology, as was Piero Aversa, the program engineering manager, who was copied on Herr’s follow-ups.\n\n10 years of secrets\n\nResponding to lawyers’ concerns as the transmission was being developed, Ford quality supervisor Johann Kirchhoffer wrote in an email on June 27, 2008, that stalling “alone is not hazardous.”\n\n“We have evidence that VW had a recall of a number of transmissions with a potential ‘Unintended Neutral’ occurring with low volumes,” he continued. “We are pursuing any effort to reduce the occurrence of an ‘Unintended Neutral’ event to a so-called ‘Broadly Acceptable level.’”\n\n“Unintended neutral” refers to the transmission slipping out of gear.\n\nWhile lawyers acknowledged that the engineers might be able to reduce the defect’s severity rating, the legal “team has evidence that this event is customer safety critical and should be rated as an SEV 10 event losing power entirely,” Kirchhoffer wrote.\n\nHe did acknowledge that a no-warning “Neutral Event including an Engine Stall is hazardous with respect to customer perception.”\n\nOn Oct. 3, 2008, Ford engineer Greg Goodall wrote that a Severity 10 rating was “supported” by the Ford office of general counsel, vehicle safety and quality technical specialists.\n\n“Items are rated Severity 10 because no mechanism exists for customer warning prior to failure,” said the internal report, written 17 months before the release of the 2011 Fiesta.\n\nGoodall’s document proposed a technical solution, but it’s unclear from the documents available to the Free Press if the plan was used or how Ford resolved the legal questions. The coming years would show, though, that the so-called neutral events were not fixed.\n\nA month before the Focus went to dealers, Craig Renneker, then acting director of transmission and driveline engineering, emailed Richard Bonifas, a customer service manager at the Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne, where the cars were being built.\n\n“The 2012 Focus vehicles equipped with the DPS6 transmission may experience a shudder/shake on start up or when slowing to a stop … ship the vehicles to the dealers with the level of shudder we currently have and continue our efforts towards a permanent resolution ASAP,” Renneker wrote on Feb. 21, 2011. “That’s just my opinion and it’s not a popular one.”\n\nBut that’s what happened — and problems became immediately apparent. While problems had been reported with the 2011 Fiesta, they mushroomed with release of the Focus, which was more than 300 pounds heavier than the Fiesta and demanded more of the transmission.\n\nBuyers started flooding dealership repair departments, complaints hit the NHTSA website and Consumer Reports in October 2011 lowered Ford’s reliability rating, in part because of the transmission.\n\n“Ford’s drop can also be attributed to problems with new technologies … and the new automated-manual transmission used in the Fiesta and Focus,” the magazine said.\n\nMulally’s quality system\n\nFord was supposed to have a system in place to protect against such problems.\n\nMulally, who said he would benchmark Ford against Toyota, started a simple red-yellow-green system to boost the company’s quality. He earned media attention for using the system as part of his weekly management meetings to illustrate the status of projects. A green light meant things were on track; a yellow light indicated caution with a plan in place; a red light indicated a critical situation with corrective action needed.\n\nAt first, his direct reports suggested more green lights than he thought plausible, and as time went on, yellow and red lights emerged. The tactic, Mulally said at the time, was meant to foster candor and collaboration in place of competition and jockeying for promotion — and improve quality.\n\nBut the 2012 “Lessons Learned” review found that during development of the Fiesta, delayed decisions required engineers to work under compressed schedules, and they failed to meet a series of milestones. That led to late identification of noise, vibration, launch judder and “shift quality issues” that resulted in development of faulty hardware and software.\n\nThe review is attributed to top engineering and development officers, including Raj Nair, who was head of global product development and chief technical officer. He later ascended to president of Ford North America before leaving the company.\n\n“What is the cost of poor quality?” is the title of a page in the internal report, which notes “significant” action is required to “get to competitive quality levels.” An accompanying chart notes that the 2011 Focus — before use of the DPS6 — had 23 unhappy customers per 1,000 surveyed while the new 2012 Focus had 266 unhappy customers per 1,000 — after just three months of ownership.\n\nThe report noted “trade-offs” of performance in favor of cost and fuel economy. It said use of a dry clutch rather than a wet clutch led to harsh shifting and other issues.\n\nThe DPS6 is different from the automatic transmissions most people are used to, but it operates the same way: Shift to Drive or Reverse and go.\n\nThe guts of a dual-clutch transmission like the DPS6 are more like a manual than a conventional automatic transmission, but the driver does not have to shift gears. These transmissions can improve fuel economy and weigh less than a conventional automatic, key reasons Ford developed the DPS6.\n\nThe technology is widely used today, often by luxury brands and sports cars such as Porsche. There are two kinds of dual-clutch transmissions: wet-clutch and dry-clutch. The difference is whether oil lubricates the clutches. The DPS6 was a dry-clutch design, which leads to higher temperatures and potential performance problems, engineers say.\n\n‘Issues increased’\n\nFord’s 2012 review showed that things went south from the start. The transmission architecture was selected 12 months later than normal — “limiting up-front engineering development time, resulting in ‘open’ deliverables at key program milestones,” the report said, citing compression of program approval, prototype verification, launch readiness and mass production.\n\n“At each early checkpoint, it became more apparent” that the transmission systems for the 2011 Fiesta program “were not capable to meet customer expectations,” the review said.\n\nA page was devoted to milestone failures with 23 “red” alert issues related to calibration and “115 software changes required before launch” for the 2011 Fiesta.\n\nThe memo noted that as the project headed toward launch, “issues increased rather than declined.”\n\nThe 2012 report also said upgrades to the dual-clutch system “will not be pursued,” because of an agreement to change technology made that October.\n\nHowever, the report says alternatives would delay launch of future model years, add production and factory costs and reduce fuel economy, creating the risk Ford could run afoul of federal mpg requirements.\n\nThe change was not made, and Ford for years continued tweaking the DPS6, adjusting calibration, clutch materials and fixing a seal leak. Documents show that parts ran in short supply in late 2016 for the latest fix at that time.\n\n‘1-800 snitch line’\n\nAt issue, a quality control engineer with years of experience at Ford told the Free Press, was the high cost of substituting a different transmission in low-cost vehicles with a thin profit margin.\n\nUpper management was not informed of the unfolding crisis at the start in order to contain liability, said the engineer, who worked with Ford colleagues in 2010 trying to troubleshoot the situation.“People tried not to overly communicate how big the problems were.”\n\nThe engineer, who no longer works at Ford and requested anonymity out of concern it might jeopardize his career in the auto industry, said the company had previously identified transmission issues in high-profit trucks and disrupted everything to issue “stop ships to limit quality exposure” and fix those problems. The DPS6 transmission was treated differently.\n\nIn this case, the engineer said, design and release engineers, calibration development engineers, manufacturing engineers, customer service engineers and transmission engineers all knew the transmissions were bad but kept it quiet.\n\n“The quality office at Ford is a separate operation from product development. They’re supposed to take issues to the top floor,” the engineer said. “These vehicles never passed the tests. Work is supposed to be complete at FEC — Final Engineering Completion. It wasn’t. The quality operating system failed. Inputs from customers were ignored. Corrective actions weren’t effective.”\n\nHe added, “Everyone was worried about getting out of the manufacturing contracts. But it could’ve been done.\n\n“They had people complaining on launch teams, people hired to drive our vehicles. Vehicle manufacturing had been lied to by product engineering. You’re supposed to take corrective action. People did not fix the problems. They felt like it would hurt profits. They knew they had the fuel economy up and they couldn’t solve the root cause of the problem.”\n\nHe continued, “Everybody working on this project knew it had issues and they were afraid to call the 1-800 snitch line. We were all afraid to tell the truth.\n\n“You want to know why you don’t want to do anything about it? It’s work. It comes right back at you — drop everything you’re doing, work around the clock and you’re on the hook to explain what you’re doing and the weight of the company is on your shoulders and it’s incredibly stressful and intense. You face the repercussions of publishing recovery plans and explaining three times a day to upper levels of management. You have no time to do the rest of your job and you put your Superman cape on and fix things.”\n\nHe noted that some people involved were promoted. “This DPS6 situation didn’t impact anybody’s career.”\n\nPull to the side\n\nAs years wore on, Ford would make the case in emails, internal documents and an affidavit that if the steering, turn signals and other power worked in the car, then the situation couldn’t be considered dangerous. In theory, people could turn on a blinker and steer to the side of the highway if the car slipped into neutral at 70 mph.\n\nPatricia Smith, who lives in Tennessee, told the Free Press she had just that experience. In June, she said her 2013 Focus had been in the repair shop for six months. She was borrowing a car to get to her job as a store clerk; her husband works at a foundry.\n\n“Last time I drove (the Focus), I was going down the interstate between two trucks and it feels like the car goes into neutral on the freeway. You have to pull over to the side. It’s just not dependable,” she said.\n\nSimilar incidents have led to injury accidents, according to reports to federal regulators.\n\n“While driving 70 mph, the vehicle stalled and lost power,” the driver of a 2015 Focus reported to a NHTSA official. “As a result, another vehicle crashed into the contact’s vehicle” on July 1, 2016, in Ladera Ranch, California. A passenger sustained a neck injury from a seat belt, and the driver reported unspecified injuries and was taken to the hospital in an ambulance, the report says.\n\nThe Montclair, New Jersey, driver of a 2014 Focus with 1,145 miles on it reported to NHTSA: “On June 23, 2014, while traveling on the highway, the subject vehicle ‘stalled’ without warning, despite attempting to restart the vehicle, the driver was unable. The subject vehicle was struck from behind causing personal injury.”\n\n‘They made fun of me’\n\nFor years, Ford engineers and their supervisors exchanged emails confirming that a serious problem existed with no identifiable solution.\n\nMore than a dozen consumers told the Free Press that dealership mechanics told drivers they didn’t understand how the cars work or know how to properly operate them. Customers including Liliana Van Bibber, 53, a homemaker in Coppell, Texas, said when she went back to the dealership for repair of her 2013 Fiesta, “They made fun of me.”\n\nChristopher Myers, 31, an insurance agent from Jacksonville, Florida, said when he went to the car dealer with his 2013 Focus, “They told me I can’t drive.”\n\nIn reality, the problems had Ford’s attention.\n\nAfter a 2011 Fiesta was brought to a Hempstead, New York, service department for moving forward while in reverse, veteran Ford engineers David Lemke and Tom Hamm in Livonia exchanged emails, obtained by the Free Press, that were labeled “High” importance in early May 2011: “Tom … Make the call down there ASAP … find out more details. Ford Safety Office wants to get involved.”\n\nHamm, as a transmission testing engineer, emailed a colleague on May 10 to keep the dealership from pulling the transmission, to “hold off on the swap,” until it can be examined. “I wouldn’t be asking if it wasn’t a safety issue.”\n\nThe Free Press interviewed more than 80 consumers from all over the country in May and June who had called the paper after a story about DPS6 litigation. Many of the drivers are working-class buyers who can’t afford more expensive cars.\n\nEldon Cooper, 50, of Mountain Home, Arkansas, never imagined coming home from multiple tours of duty in the Mideast and then having to fight Ford. He bought his 2013 Focus to get to Veterans Administration appointments, being medically retired after 19 years.\n\n“I’ve waited for parts at least 63 days,” the U.S. Army veteran said in June. “Basically, we’re stuck with this car. You wouldn’t think you’d have transmission issues with a brand new car. At 34,000 miles, it had problems they never did diagnose.”\n\nDenny Robertson, 40, of Greenville, Texas, depends on his 2013 Fiesta to get to medical appointments too. “We’re on a set income. We’ve gone through hell.” His wife, an amputee, apologized for crying during the interview. “We’re trying to get to the point that we can save a little money, but since I had open heart surgery last year we have no savings and sink a little more down each month with medication costs.”\n\nCustomers say that while repairs often are covered by warranty, they are asked to pay for diagnoses they can’t afford. Many owners told the Free Press they have given up hope for a fix after multiple attempts.\n\nSecret crisis manual\n\nDealership service shops were inundated right away.\n\nMatt Trent, a Ford transmission manager in Livonia, emailed his team Dec. 5, 2012, that 1,400 Focus vehicles had been returned to dealerships with complaints.\n\nFord dealerships were forwarding pages and pages and pages of reports involving the Focus and Fiesta from across the country, chronicling transmission issues and customer frustrations, some even threatening to sue trying to get action.\n\nIn July 2013, Bob Thomas Ford in Hamden, Connecticut, reported that the owner of a new Focus “loves his vehicle but just wants it to run properly.” The customer pleads for someone to stop the bucking and jerking and demands Ford do something to fix the problem. “Customer wants to know if he is expected to wait until there is a class action suit to sue Ford.”\n\nThe company in 2014 extended the warranty on transmissions in the 2010-14 Fiesta and 2012-14 Focus, and created a six-page “talking points” guide to help dealers work with customers.\n\n“We will not proactively communicate with the press,” said the guide.\n\nSample questions and answers in the guide include:\n\nAre the affected vehicles safe to drive? Yes.\n\nWhy don’t you see this as a safety issue? Safety recalls are necessary when a defect poses an unreasonable risk of accidents or injuries.\n\nHave there been any accidents or injuries due to this condition? Ford does not expect any accidents to occur as a result of this condition.\n\nCustomers also were complaining to NHTSA, giving detailed accounts involving transmission failure, replacements needed after just a few miles, accidents and warnings of potential fatalities, including reports from members of Congress on behalf of constituents.\n\nSen. Johnny Isakson, a Georgia Republican, noted issues with a 2012 Focus. Rep. Joe Courtney, a Connecticut Democrat, a 2012 Fiesta. Sen. Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, a 2013 Focus. Former Rep. John Fleming, a Louisiana Republican now assistant secretary of commerce for economic development in the Trump administration, a 2013 Fiesta. Rep. Randy Neugebauer, a Texas Republican, a 2014 Focus. And Sen. Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican, a 2016 Focus.\n\nThe company had issued several letters urging people to go to their dealerships for adjustments.\n\nAt one point, separate emails show, a Ford team’s frustration boiled over:\n\n“This unit will need a new trans,” wrote David Snyder, a Ford supervisor, to the chief engineer for global product development, at 12:15 p.m. April 15, 2013.\n\nEngineers reply that the cause of the problem, in this case grinding, has not been identified.\n\n“So what is the customer to do?” Snyder asks the whole team by email the next day. “We have identified that the transmission has a defect, which would require the transmission to be replaced, I believe … how is the customer issue going to be resolved? Just tell the customer to live with the issue?”\n\n“When will we have a fix or TSB (technical service bulletin for customers)?” asked engineer Alberto Cruz, this time copying 11 people at the company.\n\nTransmission engineer Hamm forwarded Cruz’s question only to product engineer John Robarge just one minute later — at 8:15 a.m. April 25: “Can you tell me smart a**?”\n\nInternal emails show growing distress and urgency in early 2013.\n\n“I’m tired of looking like the bad guy for repairing all these DPS6 transmissions, when truthfully Ford’s the bad guy here,” said an email sent Feb. 22, 2013, from a Jacksonville, Florida, dealership. “Let’s be honest. Ford produces a horrible product and we trans guys get the wrath of it. My warranty clerk thinks I’m insane and it’s like pulling teeth to get paid for all the work we have to do on these things. The input shaft seals are only good for about 10K miles at best. And by replacing them as well as the clutch, the car’s only going to return again and again and again. I do 4 or 5 a week on average. ... I would love to know how Ford intends to fix this.”\n\nAlso in February 2013, a team of about 30 people “wholly devoted to working on the DPS6 transmission” was assembled to do a “deep dive,” working 10 hours a day, seven days a week, in Sterling Heights. The team comprised Ford engineers and personnel from the company that manufactured the transmission, Getrag, and others, according to a September 2018 affidavit from Christopher Kwasniewicz, currently North American powertrain quality manager. He was systems manager for the DPS6 from 2013-16.\n\n‘Too many to ignore’\n\nThe Free Press documented at least 4,377 complaints to NHTSA for the 2011-16 Fiesta and 2012-16 Focus transmissions — a high number for the consumer reporting system.\n\nFor context, complaints relating to these transmissions are nearly 50% higher in a shorter time period than complaints to NHTSA of dizziness and nausea from occupants of the 2010-18 Ford Explorer, which are the subject of a federal investigation.\n\nMany more complaints likely were filed based on transmission flaws. The Free Press analysis eliminated dozens of reports of engine stalling, even though Ford documents show that to be a DPS6 symptom, because of the possibility that the stall was related to a separate fuel system problem. Other complaints were excluded because they lacked sufficient detail to be sure they were transmission-related.\n\n“Four thousand complaints would certainly get our attention. That’s too many to ignore,” said Jason Levine, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, a consumer advocacy group. “Incidents involving an inability to accelerate suggests that the threat is not just to owners of these vehicles but others on the road. It suggests a callousness towards life. Fact is, unintentionally losing power on the highway can lead to crash deaths. It’s not good. It’s not safe.”\n\nHe was puzzled why the vehicles have not been recalled to fix the transmissions.\n\n“The law is specific where you don’t need to wait for a body count,” Levine said. “It may be we don’t know of further tragedies, not that there haven’t been some.”\n\nWhile Ford has maintained that the Focus and Fiesta transmission problem does not pose a safety risk, in June of this year, the company recalled 123,000 2013 F-150 trucks because of a transmission calibration issue. The vehicles had been reprogrammed as part of another recall, but the updates did not fully prevent such problems as an unintended downshift.\n\n“Depending on vehicle speed, an abrupt transmission downshift to first gear without warning could result in loss of vehicle control, increasing the risk of a crash,” Ford’s recall notice said.\n\nThing is, tracking injury and death is nearly impossible under these circumstances because a police officer is never going to diagnose a transmission issue, said Levine.\n\nSome Focus and Fiesta drivers reported neck injuries, bruised ribs and thousands of dollars in hospital bills to NHTSA. Again and again, owners wrote, “I was lucky I wasn’t killed.”\n\nReport to regulators\n\nIn 2014, the Office of Defects Investigations at NHTSA looked at the issue.\n\nThe Free Press obtained a letter dated Nov. 19, 2014, from Steve Kenner, Ford global director of automotive safety, to Kevin Vincent, NHTSA chief counsel. It said the company a week earlier provided an overview of information related to the DPS6 transmission “in the context of the agency’s recent questions concerning 2011 through 2015 model year Ford Focus and Fiesta vehicles.”\n\nThe memo refers to an online presentation also obtained by the Free Press whose participants from Ford included a senior research engineer, internal investigations manager, global automotive safety compliance assistant director, the transmission engineering manager and transportation quality supervisor.\n\nThe presentation to federal regulators offers information that appears to downplay the nature of the defect:\n\nThe report said the transmission issue “is a progressive condition” related to a vehicle’s age. But internal documents and NHTSA complaints show repeatedly that customers with new vehicles experienced problems.\n\nFord told regulators “multiple symptoms” consistently precede “complete loss of mobility.” Customer complaints do not support that characterization, Free Press interviews and the review of NHTSA records found. Ford told NHTSA it was developing software to provide an “overt” warning. A separate document obtained by the Free Press showed in fact that two company vice presidents were seeking approval from then-CEO Mark Fields, who succeeded Mulally in 2014, to “develop and test a software strategy” that “provides early warning to customers.” The software was to be released nine months later, in August 2015. The software “will more easily satisfy NHTSA’s requirements,” the approval request noted.\n\nThe change, which was to be in place five and a half years after the first car with a DPS6 went on sale, would not remedy the transmission problems; it was intended to warn drivers when their car was about to slip into neutral. A subsequent document showed that the warning was included in a service update.\n\nIn another part of the 2014 report to regulators, Ford said its engineers installed a transmission part from a customer’s car — a “mechatronic actuation module” — in a company fleet vehicle. This is what happened:\n\nEvent 1: Trans went to neutral at 40 mph. Coasted to a side street. Re-engaged after sitting for one or two minutes and moving the shift lever.\n\nEvent 2: Drove 3 more miles then turned into a parking lot. Trans went to neutral while driving in the parking lot. Stopped vehicle, shifted to Park, shifter then became locked in Park. After a few minutes, was able to shift out of Park and re-engage trans.\n\nEvent 3: Driving in the same parking lot trans went to neutral. Re-engaged after a minute or so.\n\nEvent 4: Drove on the road for 1 mile, trans went to neutral, coasted to a parking lot. Shut engine off and waited 20 minutes without trying to restart.\n\nEvent 5: Started engine, engine light was still on. Drove on highway, trans was shifting in and out of neutral with no movement of the shift lever. This would occur even at the stop lights. Continued to drive to interstate.\n\nEvent 6: Drove 5 miles, entered the interstate. After several miles at 60 mph trans went to neutral, coasted to the shoulder, stayed in neutral. Shifted to Park, turned engine off, immediately restarted and re-engaged.\n\nEvent 7: Drove a couple more miles and exited the interstate. On the exit ramp trans went to neutral, stayed in neutral. Shifted to Park, turned engine off, restarted and re-engaged. Drove back to the Ford parking lot.\n\nFord’s presentation highlighted that, despite the many problems, “mobility was consistently regained.”\n\nIn response to “Customer complaints of ‘no starts,’ ‘loss of gears’ and ‘loss of motion,’” the bottom of a page in the report notes: “Engine continues to run, power steering, power brake assist, electrical and restraint systems remain operational.”\n\nFord on Tuesday, in response to the Free Press asking whether a car losing acceleration is a safety problem, replied, \"You should contact NHTSA. ... They have looked at this issue quite thoroughly and have not (issued a recall) in this case. Nor have governing bodies in other markets.\"\n\nIn response to a Free Press inquiry about Fiesta and Focus transmissions, NHTSA said in June that it “conducted a pre-investigative review of the relevant information in 2014 and elected not to open an investigation. The agency has monitored the situation since that time.”\n\n$3 billion headache\n\nBehind the scenes, things continued to worsen for Ford.\n\n“While OGC (Ford’s office of general counsel) is resolving class actions, risks from consumer claims and regulatory investigations are growing,” said the “SECRET” December 2016 report from Bennie Fowler, group vice president of quality and new model launch, and Jim Vanslambrouck, a quality director. “Government agencies are investigating Ford for potential consumer fraud and whether the symptoms pose a safety concern.”\n\nSpending for the transmission “could reach $3 billion, including $1.1 billion approved to address customer satisfaction,” the December 2016 “DPS6 Update” said.\n\nFord devoted a page in the report to “litigation and government investigations,” noting that “consumer litigation is increasing in all regions.”\n\nPending U.S. lawsuits include:\n\nA class-action case based in federal court in Los Angeles covering 1.9 million owners and former owners. In these cases, members of the certified class are treated the same in each state and certain claims are capped according to the terms of the settlement. A $35 million settlement is under appeal in this case, with a consumer group arguing it’s a bad deal for owners. Opponents point out that an estimated 94% of the vehicles' owners will not qualify for relief based on negotiated conditions.\n\nA Michigan-based “mass action” filed in Wayne County District Court brought by 12,300 buyers who have opted out of the class action. In a mass action, the cases are combined, but each plaintiff must prove certain facts and can win individual damages that are not capped.\n\nAbout 970 individual lawsuits from across the country bundled together in federal court in Los Angeles. Dozens of these have been settled recently by Ford.\n\nAbout 110 coordinated lawsuits from across the country are bundled together in California Superior Court. Dozens of these also have been settled recently.\n\nLawyers who have negotiated with Ford say the company has offered settlements of more than $75,000 to individual plaintiffs in California, which is known for its strong consumer protection laws. They note Ford has lost its only trial to date on the matter in California, with a judgment of more than $700,000. The company conceded liability of more than $145,000 in damages, but challenged a fraud claim and lost.\n\nOverseas, Ford paid a fine of $10 million ($7.6 million U.S.) to the Australian government for the “unconscionable” mistreatment of consumers blamed as bad drivers when they complained of transmission issues.\n\n“Ford knew the symptoms of the quality issues with the vehicles were experienced intermittently, but required customers to demonstrate them on demand in the presence of a dealer in order for repairs to be undertaken,” Rod Sims, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman, said in April 2016.\n\nThat case involved about 10,500 customer complaints over Focus, Fiesta and some EcoSport models made from 2011-15 with DPS6 transmission.\n\nFord acknowledged that it “took too long to identify the issues” because the company was “overwhelmed with the volume of complaints.”\n\nThen in September 2018, the South Bangkok Civil Court handed down the first Thai class-action ruling of its kind, ordering Ford to pay 23 million baht (about $746,000 U.S.) to compensate 291 owners of Focus and Fiesta vehicles with defective transmissions, plus legal fees and other costs.\n\nFields ordered to testify\n\nIn April, lawyers for Fiesta and Focus owners in the Los Angeles-based litigation subpoenaed the deposition of former CEO Fields. His lawyers tried to block the testimony.\n\nBut U.S. Magistrate Judge Alicia Otazo-Reyes in Florida, where Fields lives, ordered in June that he be deposed. Plaintiffs contend he played a key role in what they allege was a cover-up and was a primary decision maker who attended crucial meetings and was involved in negotiations with Ford’s supplier, in which Ford claimed the transmission was defective.\n\n“Mark Fields is being deposed in our case because during the time he was head of the company, Ford concealed dangerous safety defects in Focus and Fiesta autos equipped with the DPS6 PowerShift Transmission that Ford could not fix,” said Michael Resnick, who is representing hundreds of car owners in California and is co-counsel in the Michigan case.\n\nFields, who was president of Ford’s Americas division when the Focus and Fiesta were developed, now is a senior adviser with the industrials team at TPG Capital, a global private equity firm. He is scheduled to testify in late July. An attorney for Fields did not respond to messages from the Free Press seeking comment.\n\nThe Free Press investigation could not determine whether Mulally, CEO from 2006-14, was directly involved in any of these decisions. Ford is fighting to keep confidential internal documents that plaintiffs’ lawyers believe could include Mulally. None of the documents or lawsuits available to the Free Press indicates when the board of directors was briefed about the transmissions or whether board members were involved in decisions to move ahead despite concerns.\n\nNow, the ongoing issues are among the challenges facing CEO Jim Hackett, who took the helm in 2017 with Fields’ departure.\n\n‘Ford’s silly stupid rules’\n\nWhile Ford was telling owners, prospective buyers, dealers, and domestic and foreign governmental agencies that transmission issues were “normal,” behind the scenes the company was fighting the supplier that manufactured the transmission.\n\nOn March 20, 2014, senior purchasing manager Thomas Miller wrote, “Our involvement is one focused only on manufacturing of the DPS6, not the design. Getrag … owns the design and Ford is not allowed to even have the component drawings for the DPS6. As Ford believes strongly this is a design failure, Getrag should reimburse Ford for 100% … we need to be clear where the responsibility lies.”\n\nIn the 2016 DPS6 update, Fowler, the VP of quality and new model launch, noted that a “seal and clutch settlement” with Getrag involved a $50 million payment that released the German supplier from claims as well as a $250 million maximum payout over 10 years related to a settlement among Ford, Getrag and another supplier. Getrag, now owned by Canada-based supplier Magna International after a bankruptcy, continues to have a 50-50 joint venture with Ford known as Getrag Ford Transmissions.\n\nMeanwhile, internal emails show that dealers tangled with Ford headquarters in September 2016, challenging whether the company was exercising good faith and expressed frustration over endless repairs. Dealers sent tech feedback to Ford service engineer Jeremiah Cannon:\n\n“I follow Ford’s silly stupid rules and when it comes back it’s on Ford,” wrote a tech. “When I get those stupid reprogram (technical service bulletins), I reprogram it and ship it, I don’t care if it’s fixed or not. Ford doesn’t want to spend money on proper verification of concern and verify concern was resolved and well I damn sure won’t spend my money or time to do it for them. NOT MY JOB.”\n\nYear after year, hundreds of millions of dollars are spent on repair costs that eat into Ford profits.\n\nSo it’s no surprise that Ford urged its team to cut costs associated with expensive warranty repairs.\n\n“We are working to reduce our warranty spend for the DPS6. As we look to every area to contribute, we should continue to challenge ourselves … to reduce the billable labor hours,” Renneker, the acting transmission and driveline engineering chief, wrote on Aug. 30, 2016.\n\nThat idea alarmed service engineer Cannon.\n\n“We ALWAYS look to skin the folks who are doing the repair as a way to save money due to a flawed component. … we are looking at a systemic issue that is only going to get worse.”\n\nRenneker replied later the same day: “I have to present to Bennie Fowler early next month on the steps we can take to reduce the — $700M warranty bill coming to us for DPS6.”\n\nTwo years earlier, Fowler had complained about repair costs in an email to powertrain purchasing and customer service managers. “Team, we will need your help to improve our fourth-quarter performance … everyone is getting rich off the dps6. This has cost us 3 dollars per share in stock price.”\n\n'It's a bad deal'\n\nIn April 2019, Ford warned shareholders of legal exposure in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. “We are currently a defendant in significant number of litigation matters relating to the performance of vehicles equipped with DPS6 transmissions,” said the last item on a 70-page document dated April 25 and signed by Cathy O’Callaghan, Ford vice president and controller. “We are a defendant in numerous actions in state and federal courts alleging damages based on state and federal consumer protection laws and breach of warranty obligations. Remedies under these statutes may include repurchase, civil penalties and plaintiff’s attorney fees. In some cases, plaintiffs also include an allegation of fraud.”\n\nFord and its customers are watching the U.S. Court of Appeals for a decision any day on whether the $35 million settlement in the class-action suit will survive a challenge by a consumer group that argued the amount is unfair. The proposed settlement caps cash payments at $2,325 per class member.\n\n“It’s a bad deal,” said Michael Kirkpatrick, an attorney for the nonprofit Public Citizen consumer advocacy group based in Washington, D.C., which intervened as an independent third party for free.\n\n“I don’t have access to what Ford knew or when they knew it,” he told the Free Press in June. “There is strong evidence that Ford knew of a defect and covered it up and continued to sell the vehicle. That’s the allegation in the class-action complaint, and that’s why we think the relief is inadequate. Not just a defect that manifested itself after sale, and the manufacturer had no reason to know and an obligation to just fix it. It’s a much more valuable case because of the fraud.”\n\nFord told the Free Press on May 9, regarding the proposed class-action settlement, “Ford is committed to providing our customers with top-quality vehicles. We continue to deny the allegations in this lawsuit but rather than continuing with the litigation, Ford entered into a settlement agreement with lawyers representing these plaintiffs. That settlement is fair and appropriate and we look forward to final court approval.”\n\nIf the pending class-action settlement is thrown out, Ford will be forced to restart negotiations or risk trial. If that happens, attorneys have said, Ford faces a potential $4 billion liability. And consumers who didn’t know about the case when it started years ago may become aware of the litigation and bring individual lawsuits.\n\nFord’s explanation\n\nOn Sept. 5, 2018, Kwasniewicz, the North American power train quality manager, signed an affidavit in the Michigan mass action that said he was systems manager for the DPS6 transmission from 2013-16. Among his statements:\n\n“In 2011, in the very early days of production of DPS6-equipped Focuses, Ford became aware of an issue pertaining to green clutches in DPS6 transmissions. Specifically, Ford became aware that clutches in DPS6 transmissions that were ‘green,’ or not yet broken in, were exhibiting rattle noises and first gear judder.”\n\n“After the launch of DPS6-equipped vehicles, Ford at times had difficulty determining whether some symptoms being complained of were caused by the transmission’s normal operation or by a quality issue or both,” he said.\n\nKwasniewicz also said, “After the vehicles accumulated even more mileage, beginning around 2014, customers reported concerns with transmission function, including intermittent starting problems, lack of power … and intermittent concerns of loss of transmission engagement while driving.”\n\nFord’s internal documents and NHTSA complaints show that many DPS6-equipped vehicles exhibited problems immediately.\n\nKwasniewicz also repeated Ford’s contention that the transmission troubles aren’t dangerous.\n\n“The DPS6 transmission has not demonstrated any pattern of safety-related failures, and Ford concluded that none of the quality issues associated with the PowerShift transmission pose a safety concern,” the affidavit said.\n\n‘I’m fighting back tears’\n\nFiesta and Focus owners watch and hope for the best.\n\nMichelle Hughes, 43, of Flint bought her 2012 Fiesta new to drive to work at a Saginaw hospital, where she cleans and sterilizes surgical instruments.\n\n“I loved my car, but the last two years, the transmission malfunction light has come on over and over again. I don’t have the money to go and have it looked at. You’re at a stop light and you push on the gas, sometimes it won’t go. You have to literally hold the gas down. But when the car finally goes, it's like a rocket taking off. I only drive it if I have no other choice, or can't find a ride to work. I don’t drive it on the expressway anymore. Now it overheats on top of everything else.”\n\nShe continued, “The lady asked what Ford could do to help me and I said I wanted them to just buy back my car or give me a different car. I don’t need anything fancy. Just dependable, so I can get to work and take care of my family. It’s OK for me to drive myself in a car I don’t feel safe in, but I don’t want my kids in that car. I’m fighting back tears, it’s overwhelming. I can lay down and I can cry or I can keep going. I’ll be damned if I’m going to let Ford get the best of me. But I bought my car brand new and paid cash with no financing. My mom passed away and I used the money she left me.”\n\nKen Stern, the Novi-based lawyer handling the mass action case, said consumers feel betrayed.\n\n“We’re witnessing a corporation overwhelmed by greed and, in its lust for a favorable balance sheet and profits, willing to lie and to abuse their loyal customers,” he said.\n\nWhy, some people wonder, have so many people reported problems while many have not. The engineer who attended months of early crisis resolution meetings when the Fiesta and Focus were first launched said that young drivers and people who have driven mostly used cars simply don’t recognize the transmission problems for what they are. Some cars have not exhibited the worst of the symptoms, and some irregularities are accepted as normal.\n\nUntil they’re not.\n\n“They’re nice little cars and they get good gas mileage,” said Jamie Booth, 51, of Mio who bought a used 2012 Focus last year to go to work as a caregiver for people with disabilities. Her daughter saved up for a 2012 Focus to commute to classes at Michigan State University in Lansing.\n\n“I didn’t realize my daughter Shelby was having issues with her transmission,” Booth said. “She didn’t realize what it was, that it was not accelerating like it should. Then she drove my car and said it does the same thing.\n\n“When you go to accelerate, it feels like the tires are spinning but they’re not moving. ... Honestly, I thought it was traction control. Like it was happening on ice. But now it’s still doing it in the summer. When I brought it to the Ford dealer, they said not to worry, it’s fine,” Booth told the Free Press.\n\nThe noise under the hood in her car was so loud that Booth thought “it almost sounded like something alive in the front of the car was trying to get out. The car wouldn’t start. We had a towing company get it. The transmission guy said he drove it 10 miles no problem and parked it. The next morning it wouldn’t start. The closest repair shop is almost two hours south of me. And my 23-year-old daughter is on I-96. The transmission is unpredictable but the dealer says everything is perfectly fine.”\n\nShe said they “put a new ‘brain’ in my daughter’s car that cost us $1,100.”\n\nRyan Karczeweki, 34, a business intelligence analyst from Royal Oak, said he’s getting ready to replace his clutch for the third time on a 2014 Focus. It would likely be more but he just can’t go to the dealership repair shop as much as needed.\n\n“I commute from home to Detroit for work. The engine starts sputtering,” he said. “I just want to pay off the car as quick as possible — I owe $9,200 — and get a new car. It is the focal point of my financial life, the top priority. This car has been a disaster, pretty much.”\n\nFrom launch to lawsuits: how it happened\n\nJune-October 2008: Engineers’ emails show that Ford lawyers are concerned about safety.\n\nBefore March 2010: As the 2011 Fiesta moved toward launch, transmission “issues increased rather than declined.”\n\nAug. 31, 2010: Engineer Tom Langeland emails a program boss and others six months before launch of 2012 Focus saying “we cannot achieve a driveable calibration.”\n\nOct. 29, 2010: First of what would be more than 4,300 complaints to NHTSA about the DPS6.\n\nFebruary 2011: Transmission and driveline director tells factory he wants to ship the vehicles to dealers and continue working on a solution to defects.\n\nMarch 14, 2011: 2012 Focus goes to dealerships; news release calls it the “right transmission at the right time.”\n\nAugust 2012: High-level review finds “At each early checkpoint, it became more apparent” that the transmission systems “were not capable to meet customer expectations.”\n\nAugust 2012: Separately, an engineer emails “We have no fix.”\n\nOct. 13, 2014: VP of Quality Bennie Fowler says the transmission “has cost us 3 dollars per share in the stock price.”\n\nNovember 2014: Federal regulators get a web presentation from Ford on DPS6 defects. They decline to order a recall.\n\nDecember 2016: Ford report says 350,000 of the affected vehicles “have already reached 3+ repairs in US.”\n\nDecember 2016: Ford expects costs from the DPS6 flaws to be $3 billion.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/recalls/2024/03/04/car-recall-check-toyota-jeep-hyundai-ford/72818896007/", "title": "Check car recalls: Toyota, Jeep, Ford, Kia, Ram among 1.4M recalled", "text": "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued multiple recalls last week, including notices for more than 380,000 Toyota Tacoma trucks and more than 300,000 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUVs, all for increased crash risks.\n\nAre you looking to see if any recalls were issued on your vehicle?

Emboldened by the recent election of state schools Superintendent Ryan Walters, the pastors believed the time was right to push the boundaries on the separation of church and state.\n\nCalling itself the Oklahoma Advisory Council on Founding Principles, the group finalized a list of goals in March, which included having all students “learn of their accountability to the Creator” and that classroom prayer “will lead to better educational outcomes in Oklahoma,” according to a copy obtained by The Oklahoman.\n\nImplementing any of these ideas would likely draw a legal challenge. But that would all be part of the plan.\n\nThe group listed its top priority as having one of the legal challenges to its efforts reach the U.S. Supreme Court, where they \"overturn the ill-advised and unconstitutional 1962 Engel vs. Vitale decision,\" a reference to the court's ruling that school-sponsored prayer violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.\n\nOn Thursday, Walters endorsed the Oklahoma Advisory Council on Founding Principles and said he supported their desire for daily prayer in school and a public display of the Ten Commandments in every classroom.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nWalters, a Republican, called the separation of church and state a “false narrative” that needs to be changed.\n\nPoliticians in Oklahoma have long promoted ways to insert Christianity into government and public life, sometimes as an easy way to drum up headlines and votes. But some conservatives across the country increasingly believe the political and legal climate is now more amendable to dismantling the separation of church and state, especially after recent decisions by the current U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n“It is very alarming,” said Tamya Cox-Touré, executive director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma. “We are seeing a trend regarding Superintendent Walters and the lack of separation of church and state.”\n\nWhile Walters took no action on Thursday to try and enforce the council's recommendations, he said proposed laws and regulations would soon follow.\n\n“We are looking at all options (to see) how we can ensure that religious liberty is protected in our schools,” Walters said.\n\nMore:Matt Langston sticks to playbook as top adviser for state superintendent Ryan Walters\n\nCourt has struck down past attempts to display Ten Commandments\n\nRepublicans in Texas this year proposed a bill to require a Ten Commandments display in each classroom, believing a legal challenge before the U.S. Supreme Court would go in their favor. The bill passed the Texas state Senate but died in the House.\n\nTexas lawmakers said they were encouraged by last year’s U.S. Supreme Court decision that allowed a Washington high school football coach to lead team prayers after each game.\n\nOklahoma lawmakers tried to display the Ten Commandments outside the state Capitol in 2015, but the Oklahoma Supreme Court struck down the effort.\n\nOklahoma’s constitution says no public money should be used to benefit or support a church or religion.\n\nIn 2016, Oklahoma voters defeated a state question that sought to remove the ban on public dollars for religious purposes.\n\n“We have a strong state constitution regarding that taxpayer money should not be going to support religious activities, which makes me confident the (Oklahoma) Supreme Court would reject this effort,” Cox-Touré said about Walters wanting the Ten Commandments in every classroom.\n\nBut some believe the Oklahoma Supreme Court might now be willing to allow religious displays.\n\nOf the seven justices that voted to remove the Ten Commandments from the state Capitol in 2015, three have since been replaced, and two of the new justices were appointed by Gov. Kevin Stitt, whose appointees have trended more conservative.\n\nThe question of tax dollars for religious purposes is also playing out in the state’s recent approval of a Catholic charter school, a decision many believe will end up before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nChristian nationalism is the goal of some council members\n\nSome members of the Oklahoma Advisory Council on Founding Principles, which Walters said was independent of the state Department of Education, have openly pushed for the state and federal government to embrace evangelical Christianity.\n\nOne of its members, Jackson Lahmeyer, is a Tulsa pastor who unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate last year and has started an organization called “Pastors for Trump.” Lahmeyer has openly supported Christian nationalism, believing the nation’s laws should be rooted in Christian values.\n\n“We are at war in this country; it is a spiritual war between good and evil,” Lahmeyer said last year.\n\nEnid pastor Wade Burleson, another council member who praised Walters at Thursday’s school board meeting, believes all Oklahoma students should learn 10 virtues, including \"faith.\"\n\n\"To the degree our children are trained in these virtues in the public classrooms of America is the degree to which we will safeguard freedom,\" Burleson wrote on his website in April.\n\nWhen Walters presented the council's recommendations at Thursday’s board meeting, he handed out a list of committee members, including Masood Abdul-Haqq of Oklahoma City, a Muslim writer and community leader. Some people at the board meeting pointed to Abdul-Haqq's inclusion as proof the council was not solely focused on Christianity.\n\nAbdul-Haqq did not respond to The Oklahoman’s request for comment about being a member, but he resigned from the council on Friday.\n\n“After careful consideration and consultation with my advisors, I decided that it was in my best interest not to participate in this committee after the meeting I attended in April,” Abdul-Haqq wrote in a resignation letter first reported by KOKH Fox 25.\n\nReporters asked Walters after Thursday's meeting what he thought about a Muslim prayer rug being displayed in a classroom. The superintendent would not directly answer the question.\n\n“These are the types of questions we want to make sure and answer,\" Walters said. \"We want to make sure the state isn't sponsoring atheism by rejecting any other signs of faith inside the school.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/editorials/2023/04/27/editorial-lawmakers-consider-bills-that-ignotexas-legislature-ignores-separation-of-church-and-state/70148560007/", "title": "Editorial: Legislature should not impose Christianity on Texas students", "text": "Austin American-Statesman Editorial Board\n\nLt.

Seidel\n\nThe Texas House is seeking to impose biblical law on the state’s public schools.\n\nHB 307, currently pending in the House, is attempting to smuggle the Ten Commandments back into Texas classrooms. The key portion reads, “The board of trustees of an independent school district may not prohibit the posting of a copy of the Ten Commandments in a prominent location in a district classroom.” The bill has 15 co-sponsors (all Republicans, all white, all Christian nationalists, and all but one male) and was voted favorably out of committee in the run-up to Easter weekend.\n\nThe relatively mild language of the bill conceals its potential impact. The legislators settled on this milquetoast version, which stops short of mandating Ten Commandment displays, for a simple reason: Such displays are illegal. Exhibiting the Ten Commandments, which begin “I am the Lord your God . . . you shall have no other gods before me,” in public schools violates the First Amendment. The Supreme Court settled this back in 1980, stating that the “pre-eminent purpose for posting the Ten Commandments on schoolroom walls is plainly religious in nature” and is “therefore, unconstitutional.”\n\nDisplaying the decalogue in public schools violates the First Amendment, and so do many of the commandments themselves. The injunctions “I am the Lord your God” and “Have no other gods before me” infringe the core constitutional principle of religious freedom. “Don’t take the Lord’s name in vain” breaches the First Amendment’s protection of free speech, as does the command not to make or worship images or idols.\n\nIn addition to un-American precepts, the Ten Commandments contain some truly immoral rules. If their parents exercise their constitutionally protected religious freedom to worship whatever deity they like, the punishment for violating that idol-banning command penalizes innocent children “to the third and fourth generation.” The Tenth Commandment’s ban on coveting hits a trifecta of condoning slavery, treating women as chattel, and criminalizing thought.\n\nThe bill is also bad economic policy. All proposed bills come with a fiscal note. This one says: “No significant fiscal implication to the state is anticipated.” That’s probably true: The state itself won’t be sued when a school district displays the decalogue, but the school district quite certainly will. And the district will quite certainly lose — badly — and have to pay the legal fees for the other side. Those fees that can easily reach half a million dollars — certainly a significant fiscal impact.\n\nHB 307 is an attempt to use the machinery of the state to impose religion on a captive audience of children. That is precisely what our Constitution prohibits. The Texas House should do the right thing and cast a vote for the Constitution by voting against HB 307.\n\nSeidel is a constitutional attorney working at the Freedom From Religion Foundation who specializes in the legal relationship between state and church.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/religion/2016/04/11/what-legal-hurdles-could-tennessee-face-if-bible-bill-becomes-law/82750094/", "title": "What legal hurdles could Tennessee face if Bible bill becomes law", "text": "Holly Meyer\n\nUSA TODAY NETWORK – Tennessee\n\nThe bill would make the Bible the official book of Tennessee.\n\nThe bill does not specify what version of the Bible would become the official book.\n\nGov. Bill Haslam has until April 19 to decide whether he will sign or veto the Bible bill.\n\nA legal challenge is expected if the bill becomes law.\n\nLawsuits could follow if the Bible becomes Tennessee's official state book, but the full impact of adding the holy book to the state symbol list is not clear.\n\nIf the measure becomes law, the Bible would join the raccoon, the Barrett M82 sniper rifle and more than 50 other symbols and honors the state legislature has granted official status to over the years. But the items have a mostly passive presence across the state.\n\nSome, like the state flag and nickname, permeate Tennessee communities, while others hide in plain sight, like the mockingbird and passionflower patterns in the carpet on the second floor of Nashville Public Library's main branch. Information on each of them is printed in the state government manual known as the Tennessee Blue Book, and some but not all are incorporated into first-grade public school curriculum.\n\nSenators narrowly approved the Bible measure April 5, sending it to Gov. Bill Haslam’s desk. Haslam, who previously called the measure \"disrespectful,\" has until April 19 to make a decision. If he opts for a veto, it would be only his fourth as governor. But lawmakers need only a simple majority to overturn a veto. If he does nothing, the Bible will become the official state book.\n\nBarrett M82 sniper rifle becomes official state rifle\n\nIf Tennessee becomes the first state in the nation to recognize the Bible as its official book, it also could become the first state in the U.S. to be sued for it.\n\nAttorney General Herbert Slatery issued an opinion last year suggesting the measure would violate separation of church and state provisions in the federal and state constitutions.\n\n“Irrespective of the legislation’s actual purpose, common sense compels the conclusion that designation of the Bible as the official state book in practice and effect conveys a message of endorsement,\" the opinion states.\n\nThe measure originated in the 2015 legislative session as a simple two-sentence bill, but morphed into multiple pages that emphasize the economic and historical impact of the Bible in an attempt to alleviate potential constitutional concerns. It does not specify which of the countless versions of the Bible would be the official state book.\n\nHaslam still weighing options on Bible bill\n\nSome legal experts agree with Slatery. Steven K. Green, a Willamette University law professor and director of the Center for Religion, Law and Democracy in Salem, Ore., said the state would be showing a preference for a particular religion if the Bible becomes the state book, and Slatery's opinion explains that is prohibited by the state constitution and the federal establishment clause.\n\n\"It also indicates endorsement of religion,\" Green said by email.\n\nBut for someone to successfully sue, Green thinks the measure needs to be applied in some fashion, like using the Bible in public schools, displaying a placard of it in a government building, putting it on letterhead or on the side of a police vehicle. Simply knowing the Bible has been made the official book or encountering news reports about it typically wouldn't provide sufficient enough legal standing — demonstration of harm caused by the law — to bring a suit in federal court, he said.\n\n\"Generally, a plaintiff would need to encounter the state's promotion of the Bible before there could be a lawsuit. At least that situation would be a more successful suit,\" Green said.\n\nIn Tennessee, students create a visual representation of official state symbols and write an opinion essay explaining if the items were good choices, Sara Heyburn, executive director of the Tennessee State Board of Education, said in an email. But whether they’re placed in the classroom is a local district decision, she said.\n\nThe board of education plans to wait until the legislative session ends to review any laws that will impact schools, including if the Bible bill becomes state law.\n\nLegal fight\n\nRumblings of a constitutional showdown are already being heard. Legal organizations have lined up on either side of the debate, and a handful have already said they would consider legal action or have committed to defending against a lawsuit.\n\nAmong those that would consider a suit is the Wisconsin-based Freedom from Religion Foundation, which focuses on separation of church and state issues. While the organization would rather the bill not become law, the Freedom from Religion Foundation has received several pleas for help from its Tennessee members and doesn't think there would be a shortage of litigants, said Annie Laurie Gaylor, a founder and president of the foundation.\n\nIt's too early to say what the legal standing would be to bring the suit, she said.\n\n\"Standing is always the barrier and the courtroom doors have been slammed shut left and right, making it more and more difficult. I think encountering the news stories, reading the bill, being turned into political outsiders in their own community. It's an establishment of religion,\" Gaylor said.\n\nThe Liberty Counsel, a Florida-based nonprofit organization that represented Kentucky clerk Kim Davis after she refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, disagrees. The group has already offered its legal defense services pro bono if the state faces a lawsuit and doesn't want to go to court.\n\nThe Liberty Counsel doesn't see making the Bible the official state book any more of an affront to the constitution than picking a state animal. No one would be required to buy a Bible, read it or consume what it says if it becomes the state book, said Roger Gannam, senior litigation counsel for Liberty Counsel.\n\n\"The constitution requires government neutrality toward religion, but it doesn't require the government to pretend religion doesn't exist,\" Gannam said. \"There'd be no denying its influence on the foundations of Tennessee law and political thought. So to say that the Bible is the state book is nowhere near the same thing as saying Christianity or Judaism is the state religion.\"\n\nSimilar legal fights have played out in Tennessee. In 2002, the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee sued for the removal of the Ten Commandments from a Rutherford County Courthouse display. The county settled the lawsuit and agreed to pay $50,000 in legal fees. The ACLU has been outspoken on the Bible bill and urged Haslam to veto it, according to a statement released Monday.\n\n\"Tennesseans come from a range of faith traditions, and the government cannot favor one religious belief over another, nor decide what people should believe,” said Hedy Weinberg, executive director of the ACLU's Tennessee chapter. “We have confidence in the governor that he understands that this legislation raises constitutional problems and we are hopeful that he will choose to veto it.\"\n\nWeinberg said that if the bill were to become law, the ACLU would \"take whatever legal action is necessary to protect the religious freedom for all Tennesseans.\"\n\nFormer lawmaker David Fowler, who serves as president of the Family Action Council of Tennessee, said that while every piece of legislation has the potential for a lawsuit by some aggrieved party, the Bible bill faces a greater threat because of its very nature.\n\nBut Fowler remains firm in his belief that the law would be constitutional given the amended version of it. Fowler said he respects the attorney general but disagrees with those who cite Slatery's opinion as an effort to prove whether the legislation would be unconstitutional.\n\n\"I would argue that perhaps no other state could pass a bill like this for the reasons Tennessee did,\" he said, noting that the language of the now-amended legislation includes references to the fact that several Bible publishers, including Gideons International, have their headquarters in Nashville.\n\nDiffering opinions\n\nFights over religion in the public realm are nothing new. Green, who wrote “Inventing a Christian America: The Myth of the Religious Founding,” said the prevalence of challenges ebbs and flows, but they are often promoted by conservative, religious talk show hosts and organizations.\n\nGreen said he thinks people want to emphasize the Bible or the Ten Commandments because it sends a message about the dominance of Christianity within the culture. He said they want to push back on what they see as encroaching secularism.\n\n\"Religion is such an easily available trump card,\" Green said. \"It becomes a proxy for so many other things and to a degree much of this area of the law is symbolic.\"\n\nThe divisive legislation has gained national attention, but has support among registered voters in Tennessee. Earlier this month before lawmakers sent the bill to the governor's desk, 67 percent of the 513 people surveyed by icitizen said they supported or strongly supported the bill. The margin of error is plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. The survey was conducted online with icitizen users and supplemented with an opt-in online sample.\n\nLike the attorneys, Christian leaders fall into both camps. Franklin Graham, the son of evangelist Billy Graham, commended lawmakers' decision in a Facebook post and said he hopes Haslam signs it into law. Bishop Richard Stika, of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Knoxville, told the independent Catholic news site Crux that if the Bible becomes the official state book it could cause division within the state, and that the state should respect all faiths and not put one above the other. Some non-Christians and nonreligious also have expressed opposition to the measure.\n\nWeakley County Commissioner Dennis Doster, who also is a Baptist pastor, said he would vote to make the Bible the state book if it was up to him, but he doesn’t think giving it an official status will have much of an impact. Dresden, a city in Weakley County, celebrates a state symbol each year with its Tennessee Iris Festival.\n\n“People are already doing what they think is right,\" Doster said. \"This is not going to change anything.\"\n\nBut the legislation bothers Lee C. Camp, a theology professor at Lipscomb University, as a Christian and as a Tennessee resident. Camp penned a blog post for Huffington Post called “A biblical argument (sort of) in opposition to the Bible as Tennessee’s state book.”\n\n“It simply stirs up all sorts of unnecessary hostility and misunderstanding and arguments that are completely distracting from questions about the common good,” Camp said in an interview with The Tennessean.\n\nStaff writers Joel Ebert, Dave Boucher and Jason Gonzales contributed to this report.\n\nReach Holly Meyer at 615-259-8241 and on Twitter @HollyAMeyer.\n\nNext steps\n\nGov. Bill Haslam has until April 19 to either sign the legislation that would make the Bible the official state book or veto it. If he does nothing, the bill automatically becomes law. The state legislature can override a veto with a simple majority. Republican lawmakers Rep. Jerry Sexton of Bean Station and Sen.

Advertiser\n\nSenate approved the measure last month\n\nAmendment would have to be approved by voters\n\nBill would cover %22historically significant displays%22 that may also have religious significance\n\nMONTGOMERY, Ala. -- A House committee approved a constitutional amendment Wednesday that would authorize governments and schools to display the Ten Commandments, but an American Civil Liberties Union attorney said the law can't \"trump the Constitution.\"\n\nThe legislation, sponsored by GOP Sen. Gerald Dial would allow public schools and public bodies to display \"historically significant displays which reflect the foundations of the rule of law in America, notwithstanding that such displays may also have religious significance.\"\n\nThe Senate approved the measure last month 23-1. The committee approved the amendment on a voice vote; it now goes to the House of Representatives. If approved there, the amendment would go to voters in 2014.\n\nAs introduced, the bill explicitly authorized the display of the Ten Commandments. Dial said at a meeting of the House Constitution, Campaigns and Elections committee that the language was changed in an attempt to stave off potential lawsuits.\n\n\"That would certainly result in us going to court, because of challenges based on religious content,\" he said.\n\nAfter the meeting, Dial said he hoped the measure would defend local communities that wanted to display the Ten Commandments.\n\n\"We changed to historically significant religious documents,\" he said. \"That would include the Ten Commandments, that would include the Pledge of Allegiance, you could even display a coin that said 'In God We Trust' in your building and not worry about being sued by someone.\"\n\nDial argued that the Ten Commandments would be considered a \"historically significant\" document, claiming the Founding Fathers had implemented it in the creation of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nBut the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a similar argument made in Stone v. Graham, a 1980 decision that struck down a Kentucky statute requiring the Ten Commandments to be displayed in public school classrooms.\n\nThe Kentucky statute required displays of the Ten Commandments to include language saying the \"secular application\" of the Ten Commandments \"is clearly seen in its adoption as the fundamental legal code of Western Civilization and the Common Law of the United States.\" The Supreme Court said the Ten Commandments were a \"sacred text,\" and that \"no legislative recitation of a supposed secular purpose can blind us to that fact.\"\n\n\"The Commandments do not confine themselves to arguably secular matters, such as honoring one's parents, killing or murder,\" the court wrote. \"Rather, the first part of the Commandments concerns the religious duties of believers: Worshipping the Lord God alone, avoiding idolatry, not using the Lord's name in vain, and observing the Sabbath Day.\"\n\nThe historically significant context, Dial said afterward, would not authorize the display of other religious documents, such as the Quran.\n\nCurrent Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore brought the public display of the Ten Commandments to the forefront during a legal and political fight over him displaying the Commandments on a more than 2-ton granite monument he had placed in the state judicial building.\n\nMoore originally was removed from office almost a decade ago for refusing a federal judge's order to remove the monument, which also depicted other historic documents.

Or, even in Gilgamesh We Trust (Gilgamesh, according to legend was two-thirds god and one-third man — if you can wrap your head around that).\n\nThat’s the trouble with the new bill being pushed by state Rep.

DJ Johnson of Owensboro and Wesley Morgan of Richmond, would create state regulations for public high schools wanting to offer elective social studies courses on Hebrew scriptures and the Bible. Doing so would familiarize students with biblical characters and narratives that are “prerequisites to understanding contemporary society and culture,” the bill reads.\n\nUnder the bill, HB128, all school districts would be expected to maintain “religious neutrality” and accommodate “diverse religious views.”\n\n“Whether you believe that it’s the word of God or you think it’s complete fiction, you can’t deny the impact it’s had on our culture,” Johnson said of the Bible. Students deserve access to a class devoted to its study, he said.\n\n►RELATED: 'Bible literacy': How can it be taught?\n\n►READ MORE: JCPS teacher created 'atmosphere of despair'\n\nTo be sure, public schools in Kentucky are already free to study the Bible and other religious texts, provided instruction is strictly academic and isn't a \"ruse to promote religious beliefs,\" according to the Kentucky Department of Education. In fact, some schools have offered Bible literacy classes in the past as an English elective, department spokeswoman Nancy Rodriguez said in an email. But Johnson said the regulations would allow everyone at the state and local levels to be on the same page.\n\nJim Potash, president of the Kentucky Secular Society, which supports the separation of church and state, said in theory, it'd be fine for schools to offer a class that delves into the contents of the Bible for academic purposes. But given that Gov. Matt Bevin recently declared 2017 the \"Year of the Bible,\" he said, he worries about how such a bill would actually play out.\n\n“I don’t think it really would be just teaching about religion,\" Potash said. \"I think I’d have to worry about them actually preaching religion.”\n\nPotash said he would prefer to see schools teach about the Bible in the context of a comparative course, in which students learned about other religious texts, such as the Quran. The bill does not mention the study of other religious texts.\n\nJohnson said he doesn't foresee this bill causing problems, as long as First Amendment-compliant curriculum and proper training are available. \"I believe in the professionalism of teachers,\" he said.\n\nMark Chancey, a professor at Southern Methodist University who has studied the issues raised by Bible courses in public schools, said these courses can be valuable for students but can also prove problematic for educators. It's easy for even experienced and well-meaning teachers to \"misstep\" if proper training and curriculum are absent, he said.\n\n►MORE: JCPS, LMPD investigate alleged assault on bus\n\n►MORE: UK wins lawsuit against its student newspaper\n\n\"We want to take (the texts) seriously as sources from that time period without treating them uncritically as straightforward history,\" Chancey said. \"That’s a delicate dance because the minute teachers begin treating the Bible as straightforward, completely unproblematic history, they’ve slipped into making theological claims.”\n\nLawmakers across the country have made a push to encourage the creation of Bible literacy courses in recent years. Since 2000, more than a third of states have tried to pass some sort of legislation supporting Bible courses, and six states have been successful, Chancey said. Last year's national Republican Party platform also called for more laws like these.\n\nIt's difficult to know how many public schools across the country offer Bible courses because there are no reliable statistics available, and nobody is keeping track, Chancey said, but he estimates that the number of courses taught nationwide each year, from kindergarten through 12th grade, is somewhere \"in the low hundreds.\"\n\nKentucky lawmakers have tried to push similar bills in the past, including last year, when the bill breezed through the Republican-controlled Senate but died in the Democratic-controlled House.\n\nThe General Assembly reconvenes Feb. 7.\n\nTeaching – not preaching – the Bible in public schools\n\nSchools can teach about the Bible, as long as instruction does not violate the Establishment clause of the First Amendment, which prevents public schools from establishing a particular religion.\n\nIf a public school chooses to offer study of the Bible, it should be in the context of a literature course, not a devotional study, according to the Society of Biblical Literature.\n\nHere's the difference.\n\nBible literacy courses:\n\nfocus on academic study of the Bible, using comparative literature, historical study and other methods to determine what the text may have meant in its original context\n\ndelve into the Bible as a work penned by multiple authors, written over a long period of time\n\nhave goals similar to any literature course – including familiarizing students with themes, characters and narratives of the Bible, as well as its impact on history and culture\n\nDevotional study:\n\naccepts that the text is divinely authored or divinely inspired\n\naims to help the reader determine how to live according to religious principles\n\nReporter Kirsten Clark can be reached at 502-582-4144.

The 88th legislative session is ending amid Republican infighting and a seismic scandal: the effort to impeach Attorney General Ken Paxton for corruption and abuses of power that, frankly, have been on public display for years.\n\nA reckoning for Paxton has been long overdue. Texans deserve an attorney general who isn’tunder indictment, who isn’tunder federal investigation, who isn’t sullied by too many controversies to count.\n\nBut that is a low bar. Texans deserve a lot more than that. And they should have gotten more out of this session.\n\nYes, the state budget includes $12.3 billion in new money for property tax cuts, although it’s too soon to say what that will mean for the typical Texan. Notably, the spending plan includes billions of dollars for behavioral health care facilities, funds to support broadband and water infrastructure, and raises for state employees.\n\nBut the budget brings no raises at this time for teachers — even as they keep leaving the profession in alarming numbers — because public education funds are mired in a high-stakes showdown over private school vouchers.\n\nNor does the budget include any bump in the pensions for state government retirees, even though they haven’t had a cost-of-living adjustment in more than two decades. The inaction is beyond disappointing.\n\n“Many state retirees actually feel fear and anxiety” with a stagnant pension strained by high inflation, Tyler Sheldon, legislative director for the Texas State Employees Union, told me.\n\nAnd while lawmakers finally expanded Medicaid coverage for new moms from a paltry two months to a full year after giving birth — improving support in a state where pregnancy complications and deaths after childbirth are on the rise — the Legislature still refused the broader expansion of Medicaid embraced by 40 other states.\n\nAny talk of providing access to essential health care for 1.7 million Texans, helping them live healthier and more productive lives, remains a nonstarter at the Capitol.\n\nA more intrusive state government\n\nOne could argue that Texas Republicans are the party of limited government, and this budget reflects that.\n\nIn many policy fights outside of the budget, however, GOP lawmakers were pushing for a state government that is more muscular, more intrusive.\n\nA state government that polices the border, which is a federal responsibility.\n\nA state government that blocks cities from regulating issues related to labor, the environment or finance.\n\nA state government that tells school librarians what can be on the shelves and tells teachers what can be in their lessons.\n\nA state government that makes the deeply personal medical decisions that should belong to parents, from handling agonizing pregnancy complications to pausing puberty for teens grappling with their identity.\n\nA state government that sees drag queens, tenured professors and diversity programs as threats — because alternative viewpoints are dangerous! — yet access to military-grade weaponry remains unfettered and shattered bodies from mass shootings pile up.\n\nLawmakers even tried this session to inject religion into public schools, although (mercifully) the House did not vote on Senate proposals to place the Ten Commandments in every classroom and provide Scripture study time at every school.\n\nStill, under a bill headed to the governor’s desk, public schools will be able to bring in religious chaplains (no training or certification required) to counsel students (no parental consent required). So much for all the GOP angst about “indoctrination” in schools.\n\nDealing with the scandal at hand\n\nNow we wrap up this session with the spectacle of the first Texas impeachment of an elected official in nearly half a century, targeting an attorney general stalked by scandal yet surprisingly impervious to it.\n\nThe 20 articles of impeachment described Paxton using the powers of his office to protect a powerful donor, shield himself from accountability and attack the whistleblowers who reported the alleged misconduct to the feds.\n\nFor years, Paxton’s legal problems were his own. This past week, they became the Legislature’s headache, and in the words of the House Committee on General Investigating, a “long-standing pattern of abuse of office and public trust” that lawmakers could no longer ignore.\n\nThe waning days of the 88th Legislature have been tangled up in Paxton’s plight. Beyond this controversial end to the session, though, so much of the work that Texans needed — on health care, on public safety, on issues touching everyday lives — will remain unfinished.\n\nGrumet is the Statesman’s Metro columnist.

When the pandemic shut down Ewers’ operations, she furloughed 80 percent of her employees and cut millions of dollars from her budget.\n\n“After doing all of that, we still have a shortfall — a gap — of $5 million,” Ewers said.\n\nA hundred miles away in York, Lyn Bergdoll had few employees to lay off because she runs a community theater and, like others across the country, actors, set designers and choreographers all work voluntarily.\n\nBergdoll, the executive director of the Belmont Theatre, and one other full-time employee along with two part-timers have used the pandemic period to reorganize and build pieces of the theater's operations and raise funds. Ticket sales from about 25,000 patrons usually help to pay the bills, but not this year, and like many arts organizations, not for the foreseeable future.\n\n“Even though we are a non-profit … you have to run the theater like a business,” said Bergdoll, the executive director. “Even though a 501(c)3 gives you the tax benefit, that doesn’t mean you don’t have to pay the electric bill.”\n\nPennsylvania's creative industries lost more than 97,000 jobs and $4.4 billion in sales between April and July this year, according to a study by the Brookings Institute, released in August.\n\n“The pandemic has created damaging and lasting impacts on the arts and culture sector,” said Norah Johnson, director of external affairs and public awareness for the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts. “As a big industry that was one of the first to close and inevitably will be one of the last to fully re-open, this has translated into a tremendous amount of value lost in terms of the sector’s contributions to Pennsylvania’s economy.”\n\nThe economics of the shutdown, when viewed on a national scale, are staggering:\n\nNon-profit arts and cultural organizations lost about $13.1 billion by mid-September, according to Americans for the Arts.\n\nWith 96% of organizations canceling events, that meant a loss of 355 million admissions and counting.\n\nThe ripple effect meant $11.2 billion in lost audience spending at local businesses.\n\nLosing more than money\n\nThe playwright and poet Oscar Wilde once said: “I regard the theatre as the greatest of all art forms, the most immediate way in which a human being can share with another the sense of what it is to be a human being.\"\n\nBeyond the funds that lay a foundation for the arts, what fell through the pandemic hole immediately was live creative expression. No audiences larger than 25, no shows, no live choirs, no dramatic plays, no symphony orchestras.\n\nAlong with that went the connections that audiences feel being there in person — experiencing it with one another.\n\n\"I hear from people who are missing that very much — watching the production and socializing with others at the production. It’s being a part of something else that connects you to people in so many different ways,\" she said.\n\nThe arts is about \"making magic,\" according to Priscilla Luce, interim president and CEO of the Greater Philadelphia Cultural Alliance, an association with 460 large, medium and small members in Philadelphia and five surrounding counties.\n\n\"When the arts is removed, as we have had to experience during the COVID-19 shutdown, something irreplaceable is taken out of the community, and it’s vital that the arts be functioning, be strong, be supported at every level within the community,\" she said. \"We can’t have a society without the arts.\"\n\nReaching the masses\n\nVirtually no stages, regardless of size or prestige, are immune to this crisis; even the Metropolitan Opera in New York City made waves with its September announcement cancelling its 2020-21 season.\n\nThe lack of organizational and audience spending has also caused $4.2 billion in lost government revenue and the loss of support for 725,000 jobs, according to the Americans for Arts report.\n\n“Yes, people love music, they love comedy and it’s what people do in their leisure time, but these are small mom-and-pop businesses that have contributed so much to their communities, not just by being an arts magnet but by being the trigger for economic activity for all the businesses around them,” said Audrey Fix Schaefer, communications director for the National Independent Venue Association.\n\nBusiness models within the arts community had no choice but to morph into something new, Johnson said.\n\n“Every day, characteristically nimble and new modes of delivery emerge, whether through galleries, arts councils, or arts and culture organizations of a variety of size and disciplines. Virtual dance and music performances on Zoom, writing workshops via GoToMeeting, drive-in concerts, and the creation of online galleries out of physical art spaces are just a few examples of this,” Johnson said.\n\nIn May, the Pocono Arts Council sponsored a “Drive-By-Art,” exhibition, in which 12 artists from throughout Monroe County participated, said Susan Randall, executive director of the council.\n\nArtists showcased their pieces on fence posts, lawns and driveways, and the arts council published a map so that both locals and visitors could view and purchase art. As a gesture of goodwill, the arts council did not ask for commission from the artists involved in the event.\n\nAt the council's gallery in Stroudsburg, physical shows have returned, and throughout the state, more galleries are opening their doors with limited guests and reservations often required in advance.\n\n“We’re really trying to keep doing what we should be doing for the community ... just in different ways,\" Randall said.\n\nBut virtual shows for the performing arts continue.\n\nIn York, the Belmont will share ghost stories in October to an online audience, and a virtual concert is planned Dec. 4-6.\n\nThe mayor of Milford in Pike County said technology has helped saved the arts, at least at a local level.\n\n“The real strength in a community to me is not something that you necessarily see or recognize when you drive through a town. It’s the social capital, it’s the networks, the friendships and the relationships,” said mayor Sean Strub. “While the pandemic has gotten in the way of a lot of those because people can’t gather or convene, it’s created a bunch of new ones. There’s all sorts of people who have Zoom relationships that never did before, and that’s going to be with us even when we get back to sort of normal.”\n\nThe price that arts organizations pay is that those digital shows have primarily been free, and so they face more uncertainty in their future.\n\nAs they weigh the question of when audiences and performers feel safe returning to live shows, they also wonder if their free performances during the pandemic may make tickets a tougher sell.\n\nThe price of entry\n\nFor York's Belmont Theatre, ticket sales represent about 40% of its budget, which makes fundraising a significant part of Bergdoll's job.\n\nOn the other hand, the Kimmel Center has a revenue formula that's unusual: Ticket sales — from about 1.2 million patrons, pre-pandemic — represent 93% of Kimmel’s $55 million-plus budget; the remainder comes from donations, Ewers said.\n\nThe formula changed several years ago because the center was competing for dollars with some of its resident companies, Ewers said, but with the pandemic's impact, fundraising will need to fill the gaps.\n\nArts organizations are looking to government leaders to help as well.\n\n\"We would very much hope that our elected officials will understand the critical importance of the arts and culture sector to the life we live, and the happy life we live, in our state. Just imagine in the eastern part of the state, arts and culture has a $3.4 billion impact on the economics of the City of Philadelphia alone,\" said Luce, of the Greater Philadelphia Cultural Alliance. \"I think it’s very, very important that arts and culture in this state be understood to play a fundamentally critical role in our lives as Pennsylvanians.\"\n\nLeadership:Cal Weary—Yorker with a New Yorker soul—persevered after back-to-back program shutdowns\n\nWhere to go:Here are the biggest shows, concerts and museum showings this fall\n\nNIVA, a national coalition of more than 2,800 independent venues and promoters, reported in late August that 90% of venues were “a few months” away from shuttering permanently without federal funding. NIVA is supporting legislative efforts including the Save Our Stages Act, which would establish a $10 billion grant program for venue operators, promoters and talent representatives.\n\n“If these businesses go bankrupt through no fault of their own and get boarded up and then those businesses that moved to that neighborhood to be there for that foot traffic, then they start to go like dominoes,” said Schaefer. “We are an economic trigger and multiplier.”\n\nIn an effort to rally public support, We Make Events North America, a united front of industry professionals, lit more than 2,000 venues across the country in red light on Sept. 1 in an event dubbed Red Alert. We Make Events’ goals include the installation of the RESTART Act, extending the Paycheck Protection program and establishing a Small Business Administration loan program in a COVID-19 relief package.\n\nThe coalition is also working for the extension and expansion of pandemic unemployment assistance for self-employed and part-time workers.\n\nWhen will the show go on?\n\nBroadway closed earlier this year, declaring it would reopen in January, but as the date nears, arts venues are skeptical. Until a vaccine is available and patrons feel safe, the stages will remain dark.\n\n“When there is a vaccine, the arts will flourish, but it will be different,” Ewers said.\n\nPatrons and artists will return at their own pace, she said, when they feel safe. Protective equipment and safeguards will cost the Kimmel Center millions of dollars, but to see the curtain rise again will make it all worthwhile.\n\nThey all anticipate that day.\n\n\"People will have to take their time to become comfortable in these venues,\" Luce said. \"When that happens, when a vaccine is available, it can’t happen fast enough.\"\n\nBergdoll said: \"It’s going to be really emotional.\"\n\nKim Strong can be reached at kstrong@gannett.com.

The House Natural Resources Committee approved the measure July 17, sponsored by its chairman, Democratic Rep. Raul Grijalva of Arizona. There is no companion bill in the Senate. The Obama administration put about 1,562 square miles outside the boundaries of Grand Canyon National Park off-limits to new hard rock mining claims until 2032. The bill would make it permanent. Republicans have opposed the measure, saying mining would bring jobs and much-needed revenue to the region. No uranium mines are open in Arizona.

In Little Rock, the entertainment district covers a four-block area downtown and is in effect for limited hours on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, and on certain holidays. The Legislature passed a measure this year allowing the entertainment districts in the state.\n\nCalifornia\n\nBig Bear Lake: A young bald eagle that the public watched hatch online in a Southern California mountain nest has finally made its first flight. San Bernardino National Forest spokesman Zach Behrens says the juvenile male let out a call at 6:19 a.m. Tuesday and flew off the screen. Bald eagles typically make an inaugural flight between 10 and 12 weeks of age, but this one waited until he was 14 weeks old. Forest Service biologist robin Eliason says the bird will stay close to his parents over a few months to learn hunting skills and then will likely leave the area. The eagle’s mother laid two eggs in the nest near Big Bear Lake in March and two eaglets hatched in April. The nest cam showed one eaglet died during a late winter storm on Memorial Day weekend.\n\nColorado\n\nLyons: A surveillance camera filmed a bear attempting to take and open a dumpster at a local marijuana dispensary. The Daily Camera reports that Colorado Parks and Wildlife Northeast Region posted the video on its Twitter account Tuesday. Agency spokesman Jason Clay says the bear was captured on video at The Bud Depot in Lyons just before midnight July 17. The video shows the bear pulling the large metal trash bin out of an enclosed area and unsuccessfully attempting to open its top lid in the town 44 miles northwest of Denver. “It tries to take the bear-resistant dumpster home with him, but cannot,” the Parks and Wildlife social media post says. “No reward for this bear.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: A roughly 300-pound bronze church bell and a pile of scrap metal have been reported stolen from the site of a Russian Orthodox Church scheduled for demolition this week. Project manager Albert Well tells the Republican-American that scrap metal and the lightest of three bronze bells that once hung in Nativity of the Holy Virgin Mary Russian Orthodox Church were stolen in late June. Well says the bell was stolen from a padlocked shipping container. The bells, stained glass windows and other items were removed for the demolition and could be used in other churches. Well estimates the bell is worth thousands as an artifact. Police estimate the bronze and the stolen scrap metal is worth $500. Officials are investigating.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Officials say high levels of a worrisome class of manmade chemicals have been detected in four private wells near Dover Air Force Base. Officials said in a news release July 14 that they had been notified about the elevated levels of per- and polyfluoroalykyl substances, or PFAS, by the U.S. Air Force and Dover Air Force Base. Wells at the base have PFAS levels above a federal health advisory limit, and testing of nearby private wells has been ongoing. According to the news release, the four wells provide water to a shopping center with five businesses, two residences and an office building. The owners have been notified, and the base has provided bottled water. The widely used compounds are linked to a variety of health issues and have come under intense federal and state scrutiny in recent years.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Family, friends and the Southeast D.C. community held a vigil Tuesday for 11-year-old Karon Brown, who was shot and killed on July 18, WUSA-TV reports. Brown was supposed to be at football practice the night he was shot and killed. Dozens of people came out to Stanton Elementary to remember his life. “ Brown’s football coach, Julian Lewis, briefly addressed the crowd. “Karon did touch my heart in a special way,” Lewis said. “He was always smiling...I don’t care what he was doing, there was a smile.” Tony McClam, 29, is accused of killing Brown. He was arrestested and charged with first-degree murder while armed, according to The Washington Post. McClam’s next hearing is scheduled for Aug. 2.\n\nFlorida\n\nMelbourne: Two juvenile green turtles named Don King and Kazoo are back in their natural habitat after rehabilitating at an area zoo. Brevard Zoo spokesman Elliott Zirulnik said in a news release that the turtles were released into the Indian River Lagoon on Tuesday. Zirulnik says Don King arrived at the zoo’s Sea Turtle Healing Center on March 29 with a fractured front flipper and a healed fracture to the skull. He was also covered in barnacles. Kazoo was brought in on May 27 after he was found floating and lethargic at Cocoa Riverfront Park. He says they were both treated with nutritional support and medication.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: A federal judge has dismissed a legal challenge to a tax Georgia’s oldest city imposes on guided tours. U.S. District Court Judge William T. Moore Jr. ruled Monday he lacks jurisdiction over whether Savannah unfairly burdens tour guides with the $1-per-adult customer tax. He said the issue belongs in state courts. The tax challenge was part of a 2014 lawsuit that also claimed Savannah violated tour guides’ free-speech rights by requiring them to pass a written history test to obtain a license. Moore ruled in the tour guides’ favor on that issue in May, though Savannah had scrapped the licensing ordinance in 2015. The tour tax helps pay for maintenance on Savannah’s historic monuments. Tour guides say it’s unfair because other businesses that profit from tourism don’t pay it.\n\nHawaii\n\nLihue: A frayed 17-year-old cable was to blame for a widespread power outage. The Garden Island reported Tuesday that Kauai Island Utility Cooperative discovered the cause Monday and plans to repair the cable by Friday. Officials say the cable was connected to the company’s largest collection of generators and resulted in an almost three-hour outage across Kauai. The company says several other units were down at its Port Allen Generation Station for scheduled maintenance, but that repairs have been delayed until custom-made replacement parts can be shipped from the U.S. mainland. The company says a newly functioning diesel generator should supplement some power until repairs are complete, but that consumers should still conserve energy. Officials say uncooperative weather could slow the repair process.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The City Council has approved three ordinances designed to address safety and other issues arising from the growing use of e-scooters In the state’s largest city. The Idaho Statesman reports that the scooters arrived in Boise in October, and the city now has 750 scooters split among three companies: Bird, Lime and Spin. In nine months, users have traveled nearly half a million miles, and each scooter averages almost four rides per day. One change approved by the Council affects speed limits. Boise limits speed to 15 mph, but the new ordinances will make riders slow to below 5 mph in congested areas, public plazas or other geofenced areas. A second change affects reckless riders. Each scooter will get an ID number to help people identify reckless users and report them to the companies. A third change penalizes vandalism. If a rider knowingly defaces public or private property open to the public with tire marks, that person would be guilty of a misdemeanor\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The University of Illinois at Chicago has opened a $43 million engineering facility. The university held a ribbon-cutting ceremony Monday at the 57,500-square-foot Engineering Innovation Building. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot joined university President Tim Killeen and other officials, as well as students and faculty, for the event. The university says enrollment in engineering programs has skyrocketed. The College of Engineering now has an enrollment of more than 5,000 students. That’s almost double what it was a decade ago.UIC Chancellor Michael Amiridis says the facility will help attract top academic talent and strengthen ties with local business and industry. Among the building’s features is a high-bay structural research lab, where researchers and government agencies can test large-scale structural components such as roads and bridges.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette:Purdue University will start issuing new student identification cards with a change aimed at ensuring that the cards comply with state law. The university announced Tuesday that new ID cards will be available in August with an expiration date six years from the day a card is issued. That information wasn’t on Purdue’s previous student IDs, but The Journal & Courier reports that it’s required under Indiana’s voter ID law that took effect in 2008. Tippecanoe County’s election board had determined that using Purdue records to check whether students are enrolled met the state’s voter ID requirements. But in May, county Clerk Julie Roush questioned whether the county’s arrangement with Purdue truly complied with the law. Roush said Tuesday she’s grateful Purdue was working with the county on a solution.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City:Another round of state spending cuts means Iowa Public Radio will have to ramp up its fundraising efforts this year and rely even more on the generosity of its listeners and sponsors. IPR will receive nearly $71,000 less from Iowa public universities this year – a roughly 8% cut from last year – under a recommended budget proposed to Iowa Board of Regents this week. The cut is yet another in a series of incremental reductions in government funding for public radio in the state, though IPR leadership says the organization is still on a growth path. Government funding – from the Iowa Board of Regents, state appropriations and the federal government – makes up around 21% of IPR's operating income, which is expected to reach $8.3 million this year.\n\nKansas\n\nOlathe: A Kansas City suburb is allowing people to pay their parking fines with school supplies. KMBC-TV reports that the city of Olathe is offering the option through Aug. 16. Items that are being sought include No. 2 pencils, 1- and 3-inch three-ring binders and single-subject spiral notebooks. People who want to take advantage of the offer can bring in the supplies and a receipt. City officials say the offer isn’t valid for commercial parking violations and only up to $50 in school supplies can be donated per person.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville:Kentucky Peerless Distilling Company announced Wednesday morning that it will be selling the second batch of its Peerless Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey starting on Aug. 3. The company's distillery in downtown Louisville will open at 9 a.m. that day, according to a press release. After announcing it would be releasing its first bourbon since 1917 to the public on June 22, Kentucky Peerless said it sold out of all of its bottles in less than a day. If you want to get some of the company's bourbon this time around, you'll have to act quick: Kentucky Peerless will have just under 500 bottles available for purchase, according to company spokesperson Tara Bowling. Started in 1889 by Henry Kraver, the great-granfather of CEO Corky Taylor, the Peerless brand was once the state's second-largest bourbon distillery. The company produced about 200 barrels of rye whiskey and bourbon per day until 1917, when Kraver closed the facility at the onset of World War I. The Taylor family resurrected the brand in 2015 with the opening of a new distillery in downtown Louisville. Bottles will sell for $79 a pop, Bowling said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A chicken producer is planning a $47 million expansion of its Louisiana operations, creating a new feed mill and upgrades to its hatchery and processing plant. House of Raeford Farms CEO Bob Johnson announced the plans Tuesday in a news release from Gov. John Bel Edwards’ office. The northwest Louisiana expansions are expected to create 118 jobs. The North Carolina-based company says it will spend $41 million to build a feed mill in Lincoln Parish, replacing and doubling the capacity of an older mill, and $6 million on improvements to Bienville Parish facilities. The company distributes chicken products to grocery stores, schools and other businesses, packaged under its own label and other private labels. Louisiana is giving the company $1.5 million for the projects, along with tax breaks.\n\nMaine\n\nBangor: State environmental managers say more than 1,000 Atlantic salmon have returned to the Penobscot River this year for the first time since 2011. Department of Marine Resources scientist Jason Valliere says the total of returning salmon was 1,059 in the middle of July. The returns of salmon to the Penobscot generates a lot of attention from conservationists because the fish are considered endangered by the federal government. The Bangor Daily News reports less than 700 salmon were counted at the Milford Dam fish lift last year. This year’s total of returns is tentative and subject to change according to the state. Returns to the river have fluctuated over the years. It’s the most important U.S. river for Atlantic salmon, which return to a handful of rivers to spawn.\n\nMaryland\n\nPocomoke City:The Police Department is warning businesses to be vigilant about counterfeit money that has been circulating in the area. Police received several complaints of counterfeit $100 bills Monday, including one at a bank, according to a Facebook post from the Police Department. The bills passed tests using a counterfeit detector pen and counting machines, according to the post. Capt. Rich Kaiser with the Salisbury Police Department said there has been one report of a fake $100 used at Aldi on Dagsboro Road in Salisbury over the weekend. Business owners are asked to call police immediately if anyone tries to pass them a bill matching the description. Try to obtain as much information on the individual or individuals attempting to pass the bill as possible. Anyone with information is asked to contact the Pocomoke City Police Department at 410-957-1600.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nYarmouth: High winds and one radar-confirmed tornado ripped off a hotel roof, downed trees that blocked roads and knocked out power to thousands on Cape Cod on Tuesday during the peak of tourist season. A tornado struck Yarmouth just after noon, according to the National Weather Service, which along with the state Emergency Management Agency sent a survey team to the scene to assess the damage and the tornado’s strength. A wind gust of 90 mph was reported in Barnstable, according to the weather service. There were no reports of injuries. The Cape Sands Inn in Yarmouth was condemned by building inspectors after its roof was ripped off and deposited in the back of the building. Guests were being relocated to other hotels. Electric utility Eversource reported about 50,000 power outages across the state, most on Cape Cod, with Chatham, Dennis and Harwich the hardest hit. More than 90% of customers in Harwich and Chatham lost power at one point.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: State Attorney General Dana Nessel is opposing a federal plan to drop gray wolves from the endangered species list. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says the wolf has recovered in the Lower 48 states and no longer needs federal protection. More than 5,000 live in the contiguous U.S., including roughly 660 in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. The service wants to turn management of the species over to the states. In comments submitted recently, Nessel says the Fish and Wildlife Service has tried repeatedly to remove wolves from the protected list without providing adequate justification. She says eliminating the federal shield would lead to renewed hunting and could imperil the species. Wolves in the Lower 48 were hunted, trapped and poisoned to near-extinction before legal protection was granted in the 1970s.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: An Uber driver ferried two sisters 200 miles to their aunt’s 100th birthday party. Kerry Maggard and Deb Eggers were flying from San Antonio to Sioux Falls, South Dakota, with a connecting flight in Minneapolis. But bad weather forced their flight from San Antonio to land in Madison, Wisconsin, and they missed their connecting flight in Minneapolis. No other flights were available. So the sisters turned to Uber and noticed the driver name that popped up on the ride-sharing app – Jesus Florentino. Maggard told KARE-TV when that popped up, “I thought God has a sense of humor.” Florentino didn’t realize the length of the trip when he pulled up, but agreed to drive. Uber charged Maggard $216 for the trip. She tipped Florentino another $54.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Casino revenues sprinted ahead in Mississippi in June, powered by a strong performance at Gulf Coast gambling halls. Figures show gamblers lost $182 million in June, 7% more than in the same month in 2018. That includes $1.6 million in sports betting revenue at casinos. The 12 coastal casinos saw June revenue rise 12% to $109 million, continuing a strong run that began in spring 2018. The 14 river casinos saw revenue rise less than 1% from June 2018 to $72 million. It’s the 10th increase in 11 months for a region hard-hit by competition. The increase comes despite Tunica County casinos that closed in January and May. Statewide revenue is up 4% over the last 12 months. The numbers exclude Choctaw Indian casinos, which don’t report to the state.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: A great horned owl named Athena has been released into the wild after spending three months growing to full maturity in a state animal rehabilitation program. The Columbia Missourian reports that a group of about 10 people gathered Tuesday at the Three Creeks Conservation Area near Columbia as a wooden crate containing Athena was unloaded from a car. When Athena finally came out of her crate, she flew to a nearby tree, where she perched for a few seconds before taking off. Athena was too young to care for herself when she was found alone in April. That’s when the Raptor Rehabilitation Project got involved. Volunteer and University of Missouri veterinary student Rebecca Belter says Athena had “no great love for humans,” which made her a great candidate for release.\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: Three northwestern Montana communities along the Kootenai River are seeking stronger protections from the hazardous contaminants that flow downstream from mines in Canada. The Flathead Beacon reports that leaders in Libby, Troy and Eureka wrote to Gov. Steve Bullock that their economies depend on the water quality of rivers and lakes that are being compromised by pollution from British Columbia coal mines. The leaders want state and federal officials to fund better long-term water quality monitoring and to adopt a strict water quality standard for selenium. The mineral is toxic at elevated levels, and concentrations in northwestern Montana already exceed the threshold identified in the national regulatory standards\n\nNebraska\n\nNorfolk: Brian King knows a little bit about sweet instrumetns after making his own colorful custom guitar build a few months ago. The process involved taking apart a new Fender guitar, creating a mold from it, then adding three bags of plain M&M’s and epoxy to the mold. After the epoxy mix hardened, he cut out holes and added an epoxy topcoat for extra shine and protection. Finally, he drilled holes for the guitar neck and reassembled the guitar. The guitar build took about 80 hours in total, he said, especially taking curing time into consideration. He completed it over the course of about three weeks, the Norfolk Daily News reported. Assembly took place in his garage workshop, which includes all the equipment he needs, as well as some car projects he has done. Also helping with the effort? His three children, who assisted by counting M&M’s and mixing epoxy. The sweet creation is fully functional, but you might not want to play it standing up – the guitar is at least eight times heavier than the original, King said. It was inspired by a similar build with Jawbreakers candies that he saw on the internet.\n\nNevada\n\nReno:Boaters in Northern Nevada are drowning at an alarming rate this year. With the apparent drowning of a kayaker in Washoe Lake on July 17, six Nevadans have drowned in boating accidents this year – a figure that approximately matches the Silver State's average of six to seven boating-related drowning accidents per year. Out of those six deaths, five have been in Northern Nevada, according to the Nevada Department of Wildlife. Aaron Meier, the boating education coordinator for the Nevada Department of Wildlife, says there is a common thread between nearly all of this year's deaths – people who drowned were not wearing life jackets. Nevada law mandates that boaters at least carry a life jacket with them on the vessel, including kayaks, canoes and stand-up paddle boards.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHebron: A summer camp founded in 1903 has been put on the National Register of Historic Places. Camp Mowglis, in Hebron, is described as the first U.S. summer camp dedicated to boys under 14. It was founded by Elizabeth Ford Holt, who also founded nearby Camp Redcroft for girls. Each camp provides activities drawn from the outdoors and nature. Camp Mowglis takes its name from the lead character from Rudyard Kipling’s “The Jungle Book,” published in 1894. Kipling, who gave permission for the camp name, maintained a lifelong interest in the camp. The camp’s lodge, outdoor chapel, craft shop, ice house, woodshed, pump house, chapel, rifle range, assembly hall, tennis courts and athletic fields contribute to its historic significance. Most were built before World War II.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nEdison: Trains on New Jersey Transit’s Northeast Corridor line were delayed during the morning commute Wednesday because a car that became wedged under the passenger platform of a station was blocking one of the tracks. It’s not clear how the car became wedged under the eastbound platform of the station in Edison. It did not appear that anyone had been injured. The car apparently went through a chain link fence that separates the parking lot from the platform. The car also knocked over a sign. The incident caused delays of up to 30 minutes before the vehicle was removed. Officials say normal operations were expected to soon resume.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The U.S. Air Force is inviting the public to learn about the work being done to clean up jet fuel contamination at a base bordering the state’s largest city. The open house at Kirtland Air Force Base is scheduled for Thursday. Experts from the Air Force and the state Environment Department will be on hand to answer questions. A coalition of environmental groups has threatened to sue, saying the contamination is a danger to public health and the environment. The Air Force has spent $125 million cleaning up soil and water around the site, but the group is seeking an agreement that would establish a schedule with clear deadlines and penalties. The fuel leak was detected in 1999. It was believed to have been seeping into the ground for decades.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: A couple captured a 3-foot alligator in their local park and taped its mouth before calling the police to pick the animal up. Authorities believe the gator was an illegally owned pet that escaped. The New York Post reports that Staten Island resident Don Walters spotted the alligator in a park near his home on Tuesday. Walters had lived in Florida so he was familiar with alligators. He told the Post he threw bait at the reptile, then held its head while his wife, Kim, taped its mouth shut. The couple called 911 and police arrived and took the alligator to an animal care facility. The alligator’s capture comes days after a Long Island family spotted a baby alligator in their backyard pool.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nPittsboro: A rescue group says one of its lions has died after becoming overheated and suffering organ failure. Carolina Tiger Rescue wrote in a Tuesday Facebook post that the 17-year-old lion named Sheba wasn’t able to recover despite staff efforts. News outlets report a heat wave recently hit the East Coast, bringing with it temperatures above 90 degrees. The nonprofit cat sanctuary says on its website that it works to protect big cats in the wild and in captivity, taking in animals that have been confiscated, abandoned or in need of a new home. An earlier Facebook post by the group says Sheba was used in a cub petting practice in which cubs are taken at birth to be handled by humans for monetary gain.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state Health Department is warning residents to avoid blue-green algae in two Morton County lakes. The agency issued the blue-green algae advisories Tuesday for Harmon Lake and Sweetbriar Lake. Hot summer weather contributes to the production of the algae that’s also known as cyanobacteria. People and animals who ingest affected water can get sick and even die. There’s no known antidote for toxins blue-green algae can produce. People are urged to avoid water that looks discolored or scummy or has a foul odor.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus:This year's Ohio State Fair butter display honors the 50th anniversary of the first moon landing and Ohio's own Neil Armstrong. The sculptures – featuring the whole Apollo 11 crew and the usual cow and calf– are made from more than 2,200 pounds of butter. The butter display includes a life-size sculpture of Armstrong standing next to the lunar module Eagle and saluting the American flag after planting it on the moon’s surface. The display also includes a butter sculpture of the entire spacecraft crew: Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins and the traditional butter cow and calf, according to a statement from American Dairy Association Mideast. To make the display, five sculptures worked in a 46-degree cooler for about 400 of the 500 hours it took to complete the display.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A group seeking a statewide vote on whether to expand Medicaid to tens of thousands of low-income Oklahomans is organizing volunteers after receiving the date for when they can begin gathering signatures. The group Oklahomans Decide Healthcare said Wednesday they’ve been notified by state officials that the 90-day signature gathering window will begin on July 31. Supporters will need to gather nearly 178,000 signatures from registered voters in order to get the question on the ballot. A spokeswoman for the group, Amber England, says they have been overwhelmed with volunteers from across the state seeking to circulate petitions. England says the group also is prepared to hire professional signature gatherers to ensure they qualify the question for the ballot. Oklahoma is one of 14 states that have not expanded Medicaid.\n\nOregon\n\nAshland: The Oregon Shakespeare Festival, a major tourist draw in southern Oregon, is exploring changes to its famous outdoor theater after losing millions because of smoky wildfire conditions in 2017 and 2018. The Daily Tidings reported Tuesday that the annual summer theater festival uses Ashland High School’s indoor theater when smoke shuts down its outdoor 1,190-seat outdoor venue. But the festival is looking for a long-term solution to volatile air quality as wildfires have forced it to shut down productions two years in a row. The festival lost $5.4 million during 2017 and 2018 seasons because of wildfires.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nOklahoma: The historic Belvedere Hotel collapsed early Wednesday as flames consumed the structure that was built in 1905 on Route 66 across from a railroad stop in Westmoreland County. The 28-room hotel was declared unsafe in 2017. Officials are saying the fire is suspicious because no one was living in the building and utilities were turned off. The fire marshal is investigating. No one was injured.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state has received a $60 million federal highway grant to make improvements to Interstate 95. The state’s congressional delegation says the Infrastructure for Rebuilding America grant will be used to replace and upgrade the northbound Providence Viaduct on the highway. The 1,300-foot-long viaduct, which was built in 1964, runs alongside the Providence Place Mall and carries about 220,000 vehicles per day. Democratic U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said in a statement that the grant will allow the state to make the viaduct safer and more convenient, and create construction jobs. Replacement of the southbound section was completed in 2017, but the northbound side remains structurally deficient.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nTega Cay: The city has removed a monument to police officers that included a Bible verse and a prayer after upsetting religious and secular residents. A resident complained about the religious references at a July 15 meeting. The city painted over the word “Lord” in several places on the monument and removed the Bible reference because they feared a possible lawsuit. Then The Herald of Rock Hill reports other residents complained about the alterations made to the monument donated by the Tega Cay Women’s Club. The city released a statement Tuesday saying it put the monument in storage for now while it seeks a possible solution to the dispute. Tega Cay is a well-off suburb of 10,000 people on a lake near Charlotte, North Caronia.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: When students return to public schools across the state this fall, there should be a new message displayed in a common area, a cafeteria, entryway or other prominent location. A state law that took effect this month requires all public schools in the state’s 149 districts to paint, stencil or otherwise display the national motto “In God We Trust.” The lawmakers who proposed the law said the requirement was meant to inspire patriotism in the state’s public schools. Associated School Boards of South Dakota executive director Wade Pogany says his group pushed to include language in the bill that directs the state’s attorney general to represent schools or districts that might be sued over the religious message at no cost.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: University of Tennessee athletic director Phillip Fulmer will serve as the honorary Peabody duckmaster in downtown Memphis on Aug. 9. The Peabody ducks perform a march along a red carpet from the Peabody Hotel lobby to their rooftop penthouse each day in a tradition that began in the 1930s. Fulmer will serve as the honorary duckmaster Aug. 9 before he joins new Tennessee Chancellor Donde Plowman at the Big Orange Gala that takes place in Memphis that night. Festivities at the Peabody Hotel begin at 5 p.m., though guests are encouraged to arrive 15 minutes early. The Big Orange Gala will start at 7 p.m. at Memphis Botanic Garden. The event raises scholarship funds for Shelby County students to attend the University of Tennessee.\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso:Plans are in the works to build gateway boulevards along Interstate 10 from downtown to near the Spaghetti Bowl in central El Paso and would require the acquisition of part of the downtown rail yard and might force some businesses to relocate. Gateways, or frontage roads, also are proposed to be built on both sides of I-10 from Executive Center Boulevard in west El Paso to downtown. Those likely won’t require property acquisitions because initial plans call for putting them on elevated bridges overlapping portions of I-10, says Hugo Hernandez, project manager for Reimagine I-10, TxDOT’s planning study of the highway through El Paso.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Residents gathered Wednesday to celebrate Utah’s history and recognize Mormon pioneers who trekked West in search of religious freedom. Pioneer Day is a beloved only-in-Utah holiday every July 24 that features parades, rodeos, fireworks and more. Hundreds of people camped outside Tuesday to stake out spots along the parade route in downtown Salt Lake City. Pioneer Day is so big, locals often refer to it as “the holiday.” It marks the date in 1847 when Brigham Young and other Mormon pioneers, many pulling handcarts, ended their treacherous journey across the country from Illinois and discovered the Salt Lake Valley. Many businesses and government offices close for the state holiday.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state’s top bear biologist says this summer’s nuisance bear problem is likely to ease in the next few weeks as berries and other natural foods ripen in the state’s forests. Meanwhile, Fish and Wildlife Biologist Forrest Hammond is continuing to urge people to keep food away from bears so they don’t associate people with food. The message comes after Vermont game wardens had to kill two bears in recent weeks. One of the bears had entered an Underhill home. In the other case, a bear was bothering hikers along the Appalachian Trail in southern Vermont. Hammond says experts are monitoring a number of other problem bears. He says biologists remember the case last year in New Hampshire when a woman was injured by a bear that had entered her home.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: A Confederate statue that became a rallying point for white nationalists was found vandalized Wednesday with an expletive against President Donald Trump. The profanity was graffitied on the base of the Gen. Robert E. Lee statue in white paint, TV station WVIR reported. Blue paint was also splattered around the base, according to the station. The city’s Parks and Recreation Department was notified to clean the statue, police spokesman Tyler Hawn said. Charlottesville, like other cities across the U.S., has been wrestling for years with what to do with Confederate monuments in its public spaces. A lawsuit over a statue-removal plan is ongoing and the figure of Lee on horseback has remained in place. The statue has been vandalized several times before.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympic National Park: Officials say 76 mountain goats were successfully moved from Olympic National Park and Olympic National Forest to the Cascade Mountains in July. Olympic National Park officials say 174 of the nonnative mammals have been rounded up and moved to the Cascades, where they belong, since September. Officials say five other goats died during capture efforts, three were euthanized because they were unfit for relocation, and one animal died in transit. Officials say four animals that could not be captured safely also were killed. Another round of goat relocation is planned for August. The Olympics have few natural salt licks. That makes it more likely goats there will be attracted to the sweat and urine of hikers, potentially endangering the hikers.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The Police Department has started a crime-solving partnership using a database that links shell casings to specific guns. The Police Department on Wednesday announced it is now using the National Integrated Ballistic Information Network. The database compares high-resolution images of shell casings to find markings unique to a certain weapon. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is providing the system at no cost to the city. Police Chief Opie Smith says in a news release the database “has already proven to be beneficial in linking cases that otherwise would not have any apparent connections.” The statement says a Charleston police detective who has been trained to use the system has been assigned to cases in which shell casings or firearms are recovered as evidence.\n\nWisconsin\n\nAltoona: Train fans are turning out to see the world’s largest operating steam locomotive. The 133-foot-long Big Boy No. 4014 is part of Union Pacific’s tour to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the transcontinental railroad. A crowd greeted the train and a historical exhibit on a rail car at the Union Pacific yard in Altoona on Tuesday. The restored engine is the only operating Big Boy locomotive of the 25 ever built. The Leader-Telegram reports the train began chugging eastward Wednesday morning.\n\nWyoming\n\nYellowstone National Park: Park officials say a bull bison tossed a 9-year-old girl into the air when the animal charged a group of about 50 tourists. Park officials say the bison rushed the group Monday after some of the tourists approached to within 5 to 10 feet of the animal over at least 20 minutes. The Odessa, Florida, girl was taken to Old Faithful Lodge by her family for treatment by emergency personnel. She was later taken to a clinic and released. Park officials did not disclose the extent of any injuries. The incident occurred near Observation Point Trail, in the area of Old Faithful Geyser. Injuries of tourists by bison and other wildlife occur regularly in Yellowstone, which gets about 4 million visitors annually.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/01/14/purple-haze-making-sausage-goodfellas-tavern-news-around-states/40996471/", "title": "Purple haze, making the sausage: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: A memorial to the missing and dead of the Korean War was in pieces Monday after a vehicle being pursued by police crashed into the monument and burned. Police in Spanish Fort, located across Mobile Bay from Mobile, told news outlets that officers there tried to question a man after seeing a suspicious truck outside a store early Sunday. The driver took off and headed westward, crashing through a gate at Battleship Memorial Park about 8 miles away. The vehicle then ran into the stone war memorial inside the park, breaking part of the display before it caught fire. Flames charred the memorial, and the driver escaped by running through the smoke and fog, police said.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A working group tasked with fixing a public safety program has completed a list of recommendations to send to state lawmakers after meeting in Anchorage last week. Lawmakers formed the working group last year to fix the Village Public Safety Officer program, which has dealt with budget cuts, high turnover and fluctuating job descriptions, Alaska’s Energy Desk reports. The working group has held eight meetings across the state to gather feedback before coming up with the recommendations, officials said. The biggest recommendation is to revise a state statute designating the program’s responsibilities, said Republican Rep. Chuck Kopp, who co-chairs the working group. The program was initially designed to assist with wildlife management and search-and-rescue efforts before it evolved into more policing and public safety efforts, Kopp said.\n\nArizona\n\nSnowflake: A surprising photo posted to Navajo County’s Facebook on Friday shows a bright purple sky over the town. The landscape, with shades of pink and purple across clouds in the sky and a blanket of white snow on the ground, looks more like a video game than real life. The hue is thanks to lights from nearby marijuana farm Copperstate Farms. It was visible for miles, according to the post. “The purple glow is a result of UV lights from nearby medical marijuana farm Copperstate Farms and the snow clouds overhead,” the post said. The area got 1 to 2 inches of snow over Thursday night and Friday morning, according to the National Weather Service in Flagstaff. Copperstate employed close to 200 people as of last April, growing marijuana in a large greenhouse that formerly grew tomatoes.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: A former Southern Arkansas University student has settled a lawsuit with the university in Magnolia alleging SAU acted with “deliberate indifference” when she reported being sexually assaulted in 2015. The woman filed a Title IX lawsuit in 2018 that said SAU began “reinvestigating” her allegations only after she transferred to another school in 2016 and hired an attorney. The Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports the woman will receive $55,000 and up to an additional $5,000 for legal expenses fees from SAU’s insurance company, according to a document provided to the newspaper by the university under Arkansas’ Freedom of Information Act. The woman and SAU filed a motion Thursday in federal court in Texarkana to dismiss her lawsuit.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLivermore: A pristine, 80-square-mile ranch within an hour’s drive of San Francisco is up for sale for the first time in 85 years, and California wants to acquire the property to create one of the largest state parks in decades. When Gov. Gavin Newsom announced his $222 billion proposed state budget Friday, he mentioned that he wants legislative leaders to dedicate $20 million from a one-time surplus to help purchase new public parkland. Newsom declined to say where the new park might be, suggesting the asking price could “go up” if he revealed details. For several days, 17 lawmakers in the San Francisco Bay Area have been urging Newsom to appropriate $20 million to help acquire and preserve the N3 Ranch near Livermore, the Los Angeles Times reports. If approved, the money would help complete a purchase package that includes a $30 million commitment from The Nature Conservancy and The Trust for Public Lands.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: In an effort to make the Denver Zoo accessible to all families in the state, the zoo has announced its free days for 2020. People can visit the Denver Zoo at no cost this Saturday; Sunday, Feb. 2; Thursday, April 9; Tuesday, Oct. 20; Tuesday, Nov. 10; and Saturday, Nov. 14. As free days are some of the busiest days at the zoo, guests are advised to arrive early, carpool or use public transportation. Individuals receiving food aid benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program can receive discounted tickets to the zoo now through April 30. Admission is $1 per person for up to 10 people for regular, daytime admission only.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state’s public health laboratory has begun testing newborn babies for the genetic disorder spinal muscular atrophy, complying with a new state law that took effect Jan. 1. The rare condition can lead to loss of nerve and muscle control, and it can ultimately be fatal. It’s estimated that SMA afflicts 1 in 11,000 Connecticut residents. State legislation passed in 2019 required the Department of Public Health to conduct newborn screening for the disorder, which was recently added to the Federal Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children’s Recommended Uniform Screening Panel. There are different types of SMA. Most children have SMA Type 1, which causes weakness and, without treatment, can deteriorate quickly and lead to death. There is no cure, but new treatments can slow or prevent symptoms from worsening.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Eager to lure more of Philadelphia’s young, educated and frequently carless workforce into Wilmington, several influential Delaware companies have been lobbying the state for more frequent express transit to and from that city, such as a new regional express bus or commuter rail option on Amtrak. Don Mell, JPMorgan Chase’s Delaware site leader, for years has called for more express trains to Wilmington and argued that better regional transit would boost the competitiveness of all of northern Delaware. But numerous logistical hurdles prevent the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority from adding to its Delaware service before early 2021, when a two-year construction project will commence. Consequently, Delaware businesses, transit planners and economic development officials have been looking at alternative ways to bring Philadelphia workers to Delaware, including what some have called a “super bus.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A mobile museum celebrating black hockey history has opened in a truck outside the Embassy of Canada, WUSA-TV reports. The museum recognizes today’s black players while also looking back at pioneers who helped shape National Hockey League history. Some of the highlights include a wall to recognize the league’s history makers and celebrate black achievements including the first black NHL player, first black captain and first black Hockey Hall of Fame inductee. The mobile museum launched in D.C. and will visit 14 cities across North America. The museum is equipped with interactive games and displays. A Capitals locker room installation was created specifically for the museum’s stop in the nation’s capital.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The 60-day legislative session that begins Tuesday will have lawmakers considering everything from coconut patties as the official state candy to a budget expected to exceed $90 billion. Lawmakers are also expected to address abortion rights, private gun sales and environmental issues such as the rise in sea level. While the budget is the only thing the Legislature is constitutionally required to pass each year, there are already about 3,000 bills filed, including about 1,600 that seek to stuff local projects into the budget. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has declared 2020 “the year of the teacher.” He’s proposing a $91.4 billion budget that includes $600 million to raise the minimum salary for teachers to $47,500 a year. It also includes $1 million to help eradicate pythons in the Everglades and elsewhere.\n\nGeorgia\n\nCedartown: Body camera video showing the moment an officer was hit by a train while on duty has been released by police. Polk County police officer Andy Anderson suffered a concussion, six broken ribs, a broken elbow and a broken shoulder bone in the collision near Rockmart on Tuesday, news outlets report. The moment of impact was recorded on a new kind of technology: a 360-degree body camera that gives a broader view of the officer’s location. Anderson was so focused on catching the suspect that he didn’t realize how close he was to the tracks, according to Polk County Police Chief Kenny Dodd. “We call that tunnel vision in law enforcement,” Dodd said. Anderson is expected to make a full recovery. He also got a call from Gov. Brian Kemp who said he was praying for the officer, Dodd told WAGA-TV. The suspect, Jayden Moats, 18, got away and hasn’t been arrested, police said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: The decommissioning process for one of the Mauna Kea telescopes to be removed in the coming decade remains on schedule. The Maunakea Management Board approved environmental assessments for the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory last month, The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports. The observatory is one of five telescopes scheduled to be dismantled in exchange for permitting the construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope on the Big Island. Demonstrators blocked access to the summit of Mauna Kea to prevent construction of the giant telescope from July through December. Demonstrators said the project could damage land considered sacred by some Native Hawaiians. The observatory remains on schedule to be removed by the end of 2021, said Doug Simons, a management board member.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Lawmakers on a state House panel on Monday approved changes to rules for the Idaho Commission on the Arts allowing the agency to participate in art therapy for wounded veterans, stroke victims and others. The House State Affairs Committee voted to approve the substantial change that deletes from the rules a prohibition on the commission participating in such activities. The change is part of massive cuts to the state’s administrative rules book undertaken by Republican Gov. Brad Little last year. Arts Commission Executive Director Michael Faison told lawmakers that art therapy has been proven to have substantial benefits. Faison, after the committee meeting, said he’s waiting for the Legislature to approve the rules before implementing a program for art therapy. Both the House and Senate will have to approve the changes.\n\nIllinois\n\nOregon: The Illinois landmark known as the Eternal Indian statue is finally complete after years of planning and fundraising. The scaffolding surrounding the sculpture, also known as Black Hawk, is being removed and should be completely taken down within two weeks, the Rockford Register Star reports. The city of Oregon is ready to celebrate the 109-year-old statue’s makeover, Mayor Ken Williams says. “We’ve received messages and comments from all over the country,” he says. “People who have visited the statue, people who used to live in the area, and they’ve followed the progress of what’s happened and the problems with the statue as it deteriorated. Now that it’s repaired and restored, it is very important to the community.” An unveiling ceremony is being planned for the spring.\n\nIndiana\n\nBloomington: Indiana University officials plan to toast the school’s bicentennial this month with the dedication of a new supercomputer, the inaugural chiming of a rare collection of bells and a speech by Academy Award-winning actress Viola Davis. The university’s Day of Commemoration events are scheduled for Jan. 20, the 200th anniversary of former Gov. Jonathan Jennings’ signing of a bill that led to the school’s founding in 1820. All three events are part of a daylong slate of activities to mark the date, including the unveiling of a replica of a giant ground sloth skeleton once housed on the school’s Bloomington campus. A dedication ceremony for the university’s new supercomputer, Big Red 200, will celebrate one of America’s fastest university-owned supercomputers. The bells of the Metz Bicentennial Grand Carillon, a 130-foot steel tower housed in an arboretum, will also ring for the first time.\n\nIowa\n\nManchester: A judge has ordered the owners of a closed-down roadside zoo to explain what happened to some animals that were supposed to be removed. In late November, Judge Monica Wittig found the Cricket Hollow Zoo near Manchester to be a nuisance and said the exotic animals at the site must be placed at accredited sanctuaries or zoos. Four plaintiffs sued to have the animals removed and the zoo owned by Pam and Tom Sellner closed. It had been operated since 2002 despite repeated complaints that animals were mistreated. In April, a federal appeals court upheld a district court ruling that the zoo violated the Endangered Species Act with its treatment of some animals. An attorney who represented Iowans in the lawsuit filed an affidavit requesting a contempt charge. It alleged several animals specifically mentioned in Wittig’s removal order – including five brown bears, two mountain lions, a fox, a wolf hybrid and a camel – could not be found.\n\nKansas\n\nShawnee: A former Kansas City area TV meteorologist has won a Kansas Senate seat being vacated by the retirement of one of the Legislature’s most conservative members. Mike Thompson, who served as chief meteorologist for WDAF until he retired in 2018, was chosen Saturday to replace retiring Republican Mary Pilcher-Cook. Thompson, of Shawnee, has said he plans to fill the remainder of Pilcher-Cook’s term and then run in the primary for a chance at a full four years in November 2020, the Kansas City Star reports. Earlier last year, two other candidates – Republican state Rep. Tom Cox and Shawnee City Councilwoman Lindsey Constance, a Democrat – said they planned to run for the seat.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: A University of Kentucky student gained some notoriety after a video went viral of him discussing the transgender bathroom issue with conservative personality Kaitlin Bennett, aka the Kent State “gun girl.” Now, Michael Hawse is using his newfound notoriety to raise money for pediatric cancer research. In the video, Bennett, media director for libertarian outlet Liberty Hangout – best known for posing with an AR-10 on Kent State University’s campus for graduation photos – asks Hawse what he thinks of putting urinals in women’s restrooms “for women who have penises and they just want to stand and pee?” “I think people (are) just making too big of a f---king deal about it,” Hawse responds. He finishes the interview by saying, “I care about people’s personal rights. They can do whatever they want.” Since the interaction, hundreds of thousands of people have seen the clip as it has made the rounds on Twitter. On Sunday, in a reply to one of his own tweets commenting on the video, Hawse posted a photo of his Venmo account and wrote that “anything sent will be donated to the DanceBlue Golden Matrix Fund benefiting pediatric cancer research.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nThibodaux: Faculty and students at Nicholls State University are growing plants that thrive in tough coastal conditions to help restore the state’s dwindling coast. “This is a long-term investment in producing seeds for the future,” university biology chair Quenton Fontenot told The Daily Comet. He said some past restoration projects used plants from different environments – and even species also native to Louisiana would die within four years. Nicholls Farm, south of the main campus, is now growing about 15 species of coastal plants and working with the state Department of Agriculture and Forestry to increase that number. Eventually the team hopes to have enough to supply restoration projects on barrier islands or marshes and businesses that can grow the plants.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state’s annual farming trade show is in session this week, and one of the busiest events will concern the state’s emerging hemp industry. The Maine Agricultural Trades Show is taking place at the Augusta Civic Center from Tuesday to Thursday. The state is encouraging hemp growers to attend the hemp growers seminar Thursday. Maine has more than 150 hemp growers, and the industry is grappling with rule changes from the state and federal level. The trade show is designed to promote collaboration in Maine’s agriculture industry. It takes place every January. Events scheduled to take place over the course of the show include meetings of the Maine Highland Cattle Association and the New England Emu Association. There are also sessions entitled “Local Food in Schools: Building Partnerships with School Nutrition Programs” and “Agritourism Opportunities for Maine Farms and Communities.”\n\nMaryland\n\nWestminster: Commissioners in Carroll County are looking to repeal a 2013 ordinance that made English the official language of the community. The Carroll County Board of Commissioners unanimously voted Thursday to hold a public hearing about undoing the law, The Carroll County Times reports. The ordinance requires all county documents, publications, hearing notices and public business to be written or conducted in English only, according to county attorney Tim Burke. It is preempted by federal and state laws that require certain government services to be accessible to the public in other languages. Burke told the commissioners he believed the intent of the ordinance was to avoid unnecessary translation costs and to “encourage assimilation” in the county, though he said the board isn’t aware of any cost savings from the measure.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The city is expanding its use of designated ride-hailing locations to drop off and pick up riders. Mayor Marty Walsh announced the installation of three ride-hailing drop off zones in the city’s busy South Boston Seaport. A similar program was created last year in the Fenway neighborhood. The goal is to improve safety while reducing traffic congestion linked to double parking by ride-hailing drivers. Acting Boston Transportation Department Commissioner Gregory Rooney said people stepping into traffic to enter or exit a vehicle are at risk of being hit by a motor vehicle or bicycle. Private passenger vehicles can also use the zones to pick up and drop off passengers. Vehicles are subject to a 5-minute limit, and drivers must stay with their cars. The zones are operational 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nMichigan\n\nJackson: A man who said he committed a crime so he could return to prison apparently killed himself in a 40-foot plunge, officials said. Mark Wilson, 59, died Wednesday at Egeler Reception & Guidance Center, where inmates typically are housed before getting a prison assignment, Corrections Department spokeswoman Holly Kramer said. In December, Wilson, who last lived in the Kalamazoo area, was sentenced to at least 25 years in prison for armed robbery, a punishment enhanced because of past convictions. Wilson last summer gave a note to a Hardee’s employee in Escanaba, indicating he was robbing the restaurant. Police said he stayed in the restroom until officers arrived. No one was hurt. “Somewhere along the road, your honor, I just seemed to have lost the ability to function normally with society,” Wilson told a Delta County judge, explaining why he wanted to return to prison. He was last released from prison in 2012.\n\nMinnesota\n\nDuluth: Union snowplow drivers in St. Louis County could go on strike as early as midnight Tuesday, as some snow is expected in the region. County officials have a contingency plan to keep roads plowed, but they are hoping they don’t have to use it. “We have supervisors from the Public Works Department and staff in other departments who are all licensed and qualified to use snowplows,” said St. Louis County spokeswoman Dana Kazel. “Public safety is our top priority, and we will get the roads plowed – but it’s a smaller workforce so (residents) will have to be patient.” Members of Teamsters Local 320 voted 117-8 on Saturday to reject the county’s final contract offer, citing issues over health care and accrued sick leave. Starting Tuesday, the union has a 20-day window in which members can go on strike. Teamsters local secretary-treasurer Brian Aldes would not say Monday when or if a strike would begin.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state’s Department of Environmental Quality is set to decide on whether a controversial new landfill will be allowed in a county that already has two other trash dumping sites. The meeting is scheduled for Tuesday morning, one hour ahead of incoming Gov. Tate Reeves’ inauguration ceremony. If approved, the site would be located in Ridgeland, adding a third landfill within Madison County’s lines. The waste company said a third site is needed as the others age. Ridgeland Alderman D.I. Smith, Mayor Gene McGee, and other city officials and community members have voiced opposition to the 89-acre site. Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba and former U.S. Sen. Trent Lott have also said they disapprove. NCL Waste said its Community Benefit Agreement with the North County Line Homeowners Association offers environmental, economic and educational benefits to those closest to the site.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Passengers at St. Louis Lambert International Airport could soon be able to speed up their check-in process using their fingerprints and the irises of their eyes. The city Airport Commission on Wednesday endorsed a contract with a New York-based company to bring its CLEAR biometric system to Lambert. The contract must still be approved by the city Board of Estimate and Apportionment. People willing to pay up to $179 a year to be identified by their fingerprints and irises would go through the screening at a CLEAR kiosk in the terminal and then be escorted to a special line leading to the Transportation Security Administration employee checking documents. They would then go through the normal security screening like all other passengers, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports.\n\nMontana\n\nClancy: For some lawmakers in Big Sky Country, it was an event that showcased the best of times and the wurst of times. About a dozen state legislators from both sides of the aisle in town for Legislative Week met Sunday in Clancy for a “How the Sausage Gets Made” get-together hosted once again by Jon Bennion, deputy attorney general, who put on a similar event in 2019. The size of the group had outgrown his house, so Sunday’s event was held at the Clancy United Methodist Church, Bennion said. His friend Matt Bitz also helped. The event plays off an adage attributed to German statesman Otto von Bismarck: “Laws are like sausages. It is better not to see them being made.” “I think that is total crap,” Bennion said Sunday as he prepped the elected officials and others to begin the process. “You actually can do both really well. It’s just that you have to know what you are doing and do it right.” The country needs more events that promote people who disagree getting together, he said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOgallala: The state Game and Parks Commission is considering limiting the number of visitors at Lake McConaughy and adjacent Lake Ogallala, where overcrowding has become a problem. The high number of visitors in 2018 and 2019 stretched public safety, basic sanitation services, shower facilities, campgrounds and parking areas in both western Nebraska recreation areas, the commission said. Proposed actions would be subject to approval of the commission and would go into effect before Memorial Day. They could include designating specific camping areas across both lakes; limiting the number of vehicles and occupants entering those areas; requiring reservations for all overnight camping; requiring reservations for available campsites, including all primitive and beach camping; and a 14-day occupancy limit at all campsites.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A Las Vegas Strip hotel-casino denied that O.J. Simpson was defamed when employees banned him from the property in 2017 and a celebrity news site reported the paroled former football hero had been drunk, disruptive and unruly. In recent court filings, the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas rejected Simpson’s argument that his reputation was damaged when unnamed hotel staff gave accounts cited in a TMZ report saying he was prohibited from returning after visits to a steakhouse and cocktail lounge. TMZ is not a defendant in the lawsuit that Simpson attorney Malcolm LaVergne filed in November in state court in Las Vegas. Nevada Property 1 LLC, corporate owner of the Cosmopolitan, filed its response Jan. 3, denying Simpson’s allegations. LaVergne filed a request Thursday for a judge to handle the case and not send it to arbitration. The document puts a probable jury award for Simpson at more than $50,000.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPortsmouth: Officials at Pease Air National Guard Base have announced the Air Force will conduct a study amid concerns about exposure to carcinogens at the base. The occupation health study will be conducted with assistance from the Air National Guard surgeon general. The study will examine personnel records of service members who were assigned to the base between January 1970 and December 2019 in order to determine if there was a higher incidence of cancer among those who were assigned to the guard base and the former Pease Air Force base. The announcement of the study comes after concerns were raised by a group of widows of men who served at the bases. Officials closed a well at the base in 2014 because of high levels of perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA. Exposure to high levels of the toxic chemical is linked to some forms of cancer.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nCherry Hill: At least 100 women from breweries across the Garden State will gather Feb.3 at Forgotten Boardwalk Brewing Co. to create a beer together. Brewers and other brewery team members from at least 34 of the state’s craft breweries will craft a 60-barrel Belgian Tripel, called The Strongest Woman on Earth, in what organizers say is the state’s largest beer collaboration ever. These members of the state’s expanding craft beer community include owners, tasting room managers, sales representatives and other brewery team members, according to Alexis Degan of Barrington, executive director of the New Jersey Brewers Association, which is organizing the daylong event with Forgotten Boardwalk. Women’s Brew Day is taking place a month before Women’s History Month, a time when Pink Boots chapters of women brewers throughout the country join in beer collaborations to highlight the role of women in the craft beer industry.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A scathing report that found dozens of issues with the Santa Fe Police Department’s handling and storage of evidence is just the beginning, attorneys say. An audit from a public safety consultant found that evidence for a sexual assault from 2015 “could not be located after a prolonged search,” the Santa Fe New Mexican reports. The audit also found that 40% of inventory for misdemeanor cases should be disposed because it was held past the statute of limitations. Chief Public Defender Bennett Baur said the report shows that police and prosecution practices have to be challenged around the state. Issues with the evidence room came to light after the department discovered it lost 11 pieces of evidence in the 2017 murder case of Selena Valencia. Her boyfriend, Christopher Garcia, was accused of fatally stabbing her.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A 190-year-old tavern where scenes from the movie “Goodfellas” were filmed will stay open thanks to a deal reached Friday by the bar’s owner and his landlord, city officials said. Mayor Bill de Blasio and the Queens Chamber of Commerce announced “a handshake agreement” between Loycent Gordon, the owner of Neir’s Tavern, and property owners Ken and Henry Shi. Gordon announced last week that Sunday would be the the last call for the pub in the Woodhaven neighborhood of Queens “unless a miracle happens.” He said a rent increase and other rising costs had made it impossible to stay in business. Neir’s opened in 1829 as the Old Blue Pump House and has operated at the same location under several different names. It has been featured in several movies, including “Goodfellas,” Martin Scorsese’s 1990 mob classic starring Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nGastonia: A run-of-the-mill concrete median in the city’s downtown has been turning heads after getting a flashy makeover. The visual buzz stems in part from the bright yellow coat of paint that has been applied to the low-lying barrier, which separates a short portion of the east and westbound lanes on U.S. 74. But it’s also based on the oversized black honeybees that appear to be crawling and lighting on the surface. The beautification project was carried out by the city and the entity known as Keep Gastonia Beautiful, in honor of Gastonia’s qualification as a “Bee City.” The city recently became the 74th affiliate of the nationwide Bee City USA initiative. As a Bee City, Gastonia will be required to hold an annual celebration each June to promote pollinator habitat plantings, as well as to distribute information about bees and the important role they plan in the environment.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A man who told authorities he suffers from angry blackouts is accused of inflicting a brain injury on a 2-month-old baby by shaking her and throwing her into furniture. The Bismarck Tribune reports Andrew Procive, 27, was arrested Thursday after police were called to an emergency room. The child had bruising on her forehead and right eye, and further testing showed she had a brain bleed, according to an affidavit. She was in Procive’s care during the day. The child’s mother told police the baby had no injuries and acted normally during a midday video chat the mother had with Procive. Procive allegedly told police that when he gets angry he goes into a rage, blacks out and is unable to control himself. He later told them he recalled losing his temper while playing a video game.\n\nOhio\n\nWarren: Anger over the removal of several trees to make room for a new bocce ball court has prompted the mayor to announce he’s slowing down the project for more study. The court in downtown Warren is an important part of the northeastern Ohio city’s annual Italian-American Heritage Festival, including money raised at the festival for scholarships, The Warren Tribune Chronicle reports. The court is expected to move to a nearby park when the festival shifts there from downtown later this year. In bocce ball, sometimes called Italian lawn bowling, players earn points by competing to roll balls the closest to to a single target ball. Trees were removed from a nearby park in a historic neighborhood to make room for the court, angering residents who said they weren’t consulted, the paper reports. Residents also said the trees could have been plantings by some of the homes’ original residents.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: The mayor says he sees benefits in having A&E’s “Live PD” filmed in the city despite opposition from some local leaders and lawmakers. Mayor G.T. Bynum told the Tulsa World the show that films police officers around the country responding to calls allows residents see for themselves what officers deal with. “I have seen in the last year how two people viewing one police encounter can have completely different understandings of what that encounter was,” Bynum said. City Councilor Vanessa Hall-Harper, state Sen. Kevin Matthews, and state Reps. Regina Goodwin and Monroe Nichols sent a letter to Bynum last week to end the city’s contract with A&E, calling it “racist” and “discriminatory.” “The renewal of this contract ... profits a private entity at the expense of the humanity and trust of communities most directly impacted by policing and must be terminated immediately and permanently,” the letter says.\n\nOregon\n\nRoseburg: The state Department of Fish and Wildlife has closed the harvest of wild spring Chinook salmon in the Umpqua River. The agency prohibited the harvest on the mainstem Umpqua River from Feb. 1 to June 30, The News-Review reports. The primary reason is a low fish count over the past two years. Officials said 64 of the species returned from the Pacific Ocean to the South Umpqua River this past year, while only 29 returned in 2018. Officials hope to preserve the vulnerable species they say was affected in recent years by drought conditions that have reduced river flow and increased water temperatures. The temporary rule change still requires the approval of Oregon Secretary of State Bev Clarno, a department spokeswoman says.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: A former librarian and a bookseller have pleaded guilty in the theft of rare books from the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh in a years­long scheme. Gregory Priore, 63, former manager of the rare books room, pleaded guilty Monday to theft and receiving stolen property. John Schulman, 56, the owner of Caliban Book Shop, pleaded guilty to theft by deception, receiving stolen property and forgery. Allegheny County prosecutors said some charges were withdrawn in exchange for the pleas, but the deal contains no agreement on sentencing, which is scheduled for April 17 for both defendants. Authorities alleged earlier that Priore stole prints, maps and rare books and handed them off to Schulman to resell them. Prosecutors said several hundred rare items worth more than $8 million were taken in a scheme investigators believed dated back to the 1990s.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state’s pool of unclaimed property grew by $23 million last year, bringing the total worth of unclaimed property being held for safekeeping by the state to more than $389 million, the treasurer’s office announced Monday. Treasurer Seth Magaziner’s Unclaimed Property division also resolved nearly 9,800 separate claims in 2019, returning nearly $11 million in unclaimed property to the rightful owners. Unclaimed property can include money left in old bank accounts and safe deposit boxes, uncashed paychecks, unused balances on gift certificates, unreturned utility deposits, uncollected insurance payments, and forgotten stocks and dividends. To search for unclaimed property, visit www.findRImoney.com.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Dozens of cameras have been installed in the city to help curb crime in the months after surveillance video helped capture a suspect in a man’s shooting death. At least 125 cameras were donated to be set up in the East Side neighborhood, The Post and Courier reports. Tim Haman was shot and killed in the neighborhood in August, and police said a neighbor’s camera helped them catch a suspect six days later, according to the newspaper. About 20 cameras were installed by late December, and another 25 were expected to be set up by the end of January, the newspaper reports. The cameras will be registered with the Charleston Police Department, spokesman Charles Francis said. Charleston police data shows 2019 was the second deadliest of the last ten years, The Post and Courier reports.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: The state’s attorney general won’t sign a brief in support of the Indian Child Welfare Act, unlike 27 other attorneys general across the country. A federal lawsuit could determine the future of the law aimed at keeping Native American families together. Several states, a biological mother, and three non-indigenous couples interested in fostering and adopting Native American children are challenging the constitutionality of the law. Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg decided to stay neutral on the matter because of an ICWA federal case in South Dakota, according to the Rapid City Journal. The law was created in response to states removing Native American children from their families at disproportional rates and usually placing them with non-indigenous families.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A brewery is planning a $49 million upgrade to keep up with demand, an effort expected to add 155 jobs. According to the Daily Memphian, Blues City Brewery in Memphis is one of three contract-brewing facilities operated in the U.S. by Wisconsin-based City Brewing Company. The company is seeking a local property tax break worth $3.7 million over 12 years. The Economic Growth Engine for Memphis & Shelby County says the operation will generate $10 million in property tax over the 12-year time frame. The facility currently employs 516 people making an average of $54,000 annually. The plant was built by Schlitz on 83 acres in 1971. City Brewing bought it nine years ago. The 1.3 million-square-foot facility has the capacity to produce more than 60 million cases a year.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Gov. Greg Abbott on Monday gave the state’s highest civilian honor to a 71-year-old man who shot and killed an armed attacker at a church in December. Abbott gave Jack Wilson the Governor’s Medal of Courage during a ceremony in Austin, calling him a hero for stopping the shooter at a church in the small town of White Settlement. Wilson, a firearms instructor who trained the West Freeway Church of Christ’s volunteer security team, shot the attacker once in head after he opened fire with a shotgun in the church’s sanctuary. Wilson’s single shot quickly ended the attack in which two parishioners, 64-year-old Anton “Tony” Wallace and 67-year-old Richard White, were killed. “When events arise, you’re going to do one of two things: You’re either going to step up and do what’s right or walk away. And I’m not one to walk away,” Wilson said in accepting the medal at the Texas Governor’s Mansion.\n\nUtah\n\nMidway: An otherworldly frozen kingdom has made its annual winter debut. The Midway Ice Castles feature ice walls and tall towers that take 10,000 man hours and about 25 tons of ice and snow to create, the Daily Herald reports. Crews worked since October to create the attraction hosted at Homestead Resort in Midway, about 30 miles southeast of Salt Lake, ahead of the opening Friday. The annual event got started in the backyard of Alpine, Utah, resident Brent Christensen and now has six locations between the United States and Canada. New additions this year include a light garden featuring ice structures with lights shown through them, ice caves, a waterfall, and a maze with a ruins-esque area that resembles an old courthouse or church, said Billy Tiedemann, one of the project’s site managers. The ice castles are typically open until mid-February, but unpredictable weather always makes the attraction’s closing date an unknown.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The University of Vermont has received $1 million in funding from a division of Google to support research related to open source software, the school said Monday. Open source software can be shared and modified, but UVM said the concept is about more than software. “The goal of the UVM project is to deepen understanding of how people, teams and organizations thrive in technology-rich settings, especially in open-source projects and communities,” UVM said in a news release. “Researching how people and teams interact in organizations is a powerful way to understand and advance the open source movement,” said assistant computer science professor Laurent Hebert-Dufresne, a principal investigator on the project.\n\nVirginia\n\nHenrico: Police responded Monday to a report of an active shooter in the area of a Henrico County middle school but said they did not find any evidence of a shooting. There were no injuries. Police initially got a 911 text indicating there was an active shooter in the same block as Moody Middle School, Henrico County Police spokesman Lt. Matt Pecka said at a news conference. Authorities responded but found no evidence of a shooter or of any gunfire after methodically searching the school, Pecka said. Police are investigating what appears to have been a false report, Pecka said. “Obviously, if you have a student in the school system, this is very traumatic,” Pecka said. He said officers were available to speak to concerned parents. There is no evidence students were in any danger, a Henrico County Public Schools news release said.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state’s first female speaker of the House was sworn in Monday as lawmakers returned to the Capitol to convene their 60-day legislative session. Democratic Rep. Laurie Jinkins of Tacoma is also the first gay lawmaker to take the role presiding over the chamber. She succeeds Frank Chopp, the state’s longest-serving speaker and the second-longest-serving speaker in the nation. Chopp, who is still a member of the Legislature, announced he was stepping down from his leadership position last year after serving in the role for more than two decades. Jinkins and more than a dozen other lawmakers were wearing white in honor of the 100th anniversary of women’s suffrage. She said the fact that a lesbian woman is now holding the House gavel is another broken barrier, “but it won’t be the last.” Washington is now the eighth state to have a woman in the top spot in the House and the second to have a gay House speaker, joining Oregon.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: An endangered fish could get a boost from grants aimed at restoring its population in the state. The Division of Natural Resources is matching a $61,000 grant from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and using it for a program to increase numbers of the candy darter, which was listed as endangered in 2018, The Charleston Gazette-Mail reports. The DNR will collect candy darters, breed them at a fish hatchery in White Sulphur Springs and release them back into state streams. “This effort represents West Virginia folks working to protect West Virginia natives,” said U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist Barb Douglas. The rainbow-colored fish has lost nearly half its population since the 1930s. Candy darters typically live in picturesque mountain streams. The seldom-seen fish are about the size of a cigar and covered in vibrant bands of teal, red and orange. Their biggest threat is “hybridization.” The variegate darter fish species was somehow introduced into some of those streams and is mating with the candy darters. Another threat is development that pollutes the streams with sediment.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Assembly Republicans will try Wednesday to override Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ veto of a bill that would make it easier to become a nurse’s aide in Wisconsin. State law requires nurse’s aide training programs to run at least 120 hours. Federal regulations, however, say training programs need to run at least 75 hours. The Republican-authored bill would have adopted the federal standard, saving nurse’s aides 45 hours of training. Evers vetoed the proposal in November, saying at the time that he objects to reduced training for those who care for Wisconsin’s most vulnerable citizens and that there are better ways to address the shortage of nurse’s aides. A successful veto override requires a two-thirds vote in both the Assembly and the Senate. Republicans control the Assembly 63-36, which likely leaves them three votes short.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The state Democratic Party has announced changes to its April caucuses to allow greater participation from those who don’t attend the gatherings. Until now, people who voted in the Democratic caucuses by mail had to request a ballot and could vote for only one candidate. If their candidate did not receive 15% of the vote, they had no option to cast a second-round ballot like people attending caucuses could. Under the new plan, mail-in ballots will allow people to rank up to five candidates. If their first-choice candidate doesn’t draw 15% of the vote, their vote will be assigned to their second-choice candidate. Joe Barbuto, chairman of the Wyoming Democratic Party, told the Wyoming Tribune Eagle that while traditional caucuses are a fun way to encourage political engagement, only a fraction of the state’s Democrats normally show up.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/01/politics/biden-state-of-the-union-2022-transcript/index.html", "title": "READ: President Biden's State of the Union address transcript | CNN ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden delivered his 2022 State of the Union address on Tuesday. Here’s his speech as prepared for delivery and released by the White House.\n\nMadam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.\n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again.\n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans.\n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution.\n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny.\n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated.\n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined.\n\nHe met the Ukrainian people.\n\nFrom President Zelensky to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world.\n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\n\nIn this struggle as President Zelensky said in his speech to the European Parliament “Light will win over darkness.” The Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States is here tonight.\n\nLet each of us here tonight in this Chamber send an unmistakable signal to Ukraine and to the world.\n\nPlease rise if you are able and show that, Yes, we the United States of America stand with the Ukrainian people.\n\nThroughout our history we’ve learned this lesson when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression they cause more chaos.\n\nThey keep moving.\n\nAnd the costs and the threats to America and the world keep rising.\n\nThat’s why the NATO Alliance was created to secure peace and stability in Europe after World War 2.\n\nThe United States is a member along with 29 other nations.\n\nIt matters. American diplomacy matters. American resolve matters.\n\nPutin’s latest attack on Ukraine was premeditated and unprovoked.\n\nHe rejected repeated efforts at diplomacy.\n\nHe thought the West and NATO wouldn’t respond. And he thought he could divide us at home. Putin was wrong. We were ready. Here is what we did.\n\nWe prepared extensively and carefully.\n\nWe spent months building a coalition of other freedom-loving nations from Europe and the Americas to Asia and Africa to confront Putin.\n\nI spent countless hours unifying our European allies. We shared with the world in advance what we knew Putin was planning and precisely how he would try to falsely justify his aggression.\n\nWe countered Russia’s lies with truth.\n\nAnd now that he has acted the free world is holding him accountable.\n\nAlong with twenty-seven members of the European Union including France, Germany, Italy, as well as countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and many others, even Switzerland.\n\nWe are inflicting pain on Russia and supporting the people of Ukraine. Putin is now isolated from the world more than ever.\n\nTogether with our allies – we are right now enforcing powerful economic sanctions.\n\nWe are cutting off Russia’s largest banks from the international financial system.\n\nPreventing Russia’s central bank from defending the Russian Ruble making Putin’s $630 Billion “war fund” worthless.\n\nWe are choking off Russia’s access to technology that will sap its economic strength and weaken its military for years to come.\n\nTonight I say to the Russian oligarchs and corrupt leaders who have bilked billions of dollars off this violent regime no more.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of Russian oligarchs.\n\nWe are joining with our European allies to find and seize your yachts your luxury apartments your private jets. We are coming for your ill-begotten gains.\n\nAnd tonight I am announcing that we will join our allies in closing off American air space to all Russian flights – further isolating Russia – and adding an additional squeeze – on their economy. The Ruble has lost 30% of its value.\n\nThe Russian stock market has lost 40% of its value and trading remains suspended. Russia’s economy is reeling and Putin alone is to blame.\n\nTogether with our allies we are providing support to the Ukrainians in their fight for freedom. Military assistance. Economic assistance. Humanitarian assistance.\n\nWe are giving more than $1 Billion in direct assistance to Ukraine.\n\nAnd we will continue to aid the Ukrainian people as they defend their country and to help ease their suffering.\n\nLet me be clear, our forces are not engaged and will not engage in conflict with Russian forces in Ukraine.\n\nOur forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our NATO Allies – in the event that Putin decides to keep moving west.\n\nFor that purpose we’ve mobilized American ground forces, air squadrons, and ship deployments to protect NATO countries including Poland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia.\n\nAs I have made crystal clear the United States and our Allies will defend every inch of territory of NATO countries with the full force of our collective power.\n\nAnd we remain clear-eyed. The Ukrainians are fighting back with pure courage. But the next few days weeks, months, will be hard on them.\n\nPutin has unleashed violence and chaos. But while he may make gains on the battlefield – he will pay a continuing high price over the long run.\n\nAnd a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.\n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world.\n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers.\n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.\n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.\n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming.\n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\n\nWhen the history of this era is written Putin’s war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger.\n\nWhile it shouldn’t have taken something so terrible for people around the world to see what’s at stake now everyone sees it clearly.\n\nWe see the unity among leaders of nations and a more unified Europe a more unified West. And we see unity among the people who are gathering in cities in large crowds around the world even in Russia to demonstrate their support for Ukraine.\n\nIn the battle between democracy and autocracy, democracies are rising to the moment, and the world is clearly choosing the side of peace and security.\n\nThis is a real test. It’s going to take time. So let us continue to draw inspiration from the iron will of the Ukrainian people.\n\nTo our fellow Ukrainian Americans who forge a deep bond that connects our two nations we stand with you.\n\nPutin may circle Kyiv with tanks, but he will never gain the hearts and souls of the Ukrainian people.\n\nHe will never extinguish their love of freedom. He will never weaken the resolve of the free world.\n\nWe meet tonight in an America that has lived through two of the hardest years this nation has ever faced.\n\nThe pandemic has been punishing.\n\nAnd so many families are living paycheck to paycheck, struggling to keep up with the rising cost of food, gas, housing, and so much more.\n\nI understand.\n\nI remember when my Dad had to leave our home in Scranton, Pennsylvania to find work. I grew up in a family where if the price of food went up, you felt it.\n\nThat’s why one of the first things I did as President was fight to pass the American Rescue Plan.\n\nBecause people were hurting. We needed to act, and we did.\n\nFew pieces of legislation have done more in a critical moment in our history to lift us out of crisis.\n\nIt fueled our efforts to vaccinate the nation and combat Covid-19. It delivered immediate economic relief for tens of millions of Americans.\n\nHelped put food on their table, keep a roof over their heads, and cut the cost of health insurance.\n\nAnd as my Dad used to say, it gave people a little breathing room.\n\nAnd unlike the $2 Trillion tax cut passed in the previous administration that benefitted the top 1% of Americans, the American Rescue Plan helped working people—and left no one behind.\n\nAnd it worked. It created jobs. Lots of jobs.\n\nIn fact—our economy created over 6.5 Million new jobs just last year, more jobs created in one year\n\nthan ever before in the history of America.\n\nOur economy grew at a rate of 5.7% last year, the strongest growth in nearly 40 years, the first step in bringing fundamental change to an economy that hasn’t worked for the working people of this nation for too long.\n\nFor the past 40 years we were told that if we gave tax breaks to those at the very top, the benefits would trickle down to everyone else.\n\nBut that trickle-down theory led to weaker economic growth, lower wages, bigger deficits, and the widest gap between those at the top and everyone else in nearly a century.\n\nVice President Harris and I ran for office with a new economic vision for America.\n\nInvest in America. Educate Americans. Grow the workforce. Build the economy from the bottom up\n\nand the middle out, not from the top down.\n\nBecause we know that when the middle class grows, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy do very well.\n\nAmerica used to have the best roads, bridges, and airports on Earth.\n\nNow our infrastructure is ranked 13th in the world.\n\nWe won’t be able to compete for the jobs of the 21st Century if we don’t fix that.\n\nThat’s why it was so important to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law—the most sweeping investment to rebuild America in history.\n\nThis was a bipartisan effort, and I want to thank the members of both parties who worked to make it happen.\n\nWe’re done talking about infrastructure weeks.\n\nWe’re going to have an infrastructure decade.\n\nIt is going to transform America and put us on a path to win the economic competition of the 21st Century that we face with the rest of the world—particularly with China.\n\nAs I’ve told Xi Jinping, it is never a good bet to bet against the American people.\n\nWe’ll create good jobs for millions of Americans, modernizing roads, airports, ports, and waterways all across America.\n\nAnd we’ll do it all to withstand the devastating effects of the climate crisis and promote environmental justice.\n\nWe’ll build a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations, begin to replace poisonous lead pipes—so every child—and every American—has clean water to drink at home and at school, provide affordable high-speed internet for every American—urban, suburban, rural, and tribal communities.\n\n4,000 projects have already been announced.\n\nAnd tonight, I’m announcing that this year we will start fixing over 65,000 miles of highway and 1,500 bridges in disrepair.\n\nWhen we use taxpayer dollars to rebuild America – we are going to Buy American: buy American products to support American jobs.\n\nThe federal government spends about $600 Billion a year to keep the country safe and secure.\n\nThere’s been a law on the books for almost a century\n\nto make sure taxpayers’ dollars support American jobs and businesses.\n\nEvery Administration says they’ll do it, but we are actually doing it.\n\nWe will buy American to make sure everything from the deck of an aircraft carrier to the steel on highway guardrails are made in America.\n\nBut to compete for the best jobs of the future, we also need to level the playing field with China and other competitors.\n\nThat’s why it is so important to pass the Bipartisan Innovation Act sitting in Congress that will make record investments in emerging technologies and American manufacturing.\n\nLet me give you one example of why it’s so important to pass it.\n\nIf you travel 20 miles east of Columbus, Ohio, you’ll find 1,000 empty acres of land.\n\nIt won’t look like much, but if you stop and look closely, you’ll see a “Field of dreams,” the ground on which America’s future will be built.\n\nThis is where Intel, the American company that helped build Silicon Valley, is going to build its $20 billion semiconductor “mega site”.\n\nUp to eight state-of-the-art factories in one place. 10,000 new good-paying jobs.\n\nSome of the most sophisticated manufacturing in the world to make computer chips the size of a fingertip that power the world and our everyday lives.\n\nSmartphones. The Internet. Technology we have yet to invent.\n\nBut that’s just the beginning.\n\nIntel’s CEO, Pat Gelsinger, who is here tonight, told me they are ready to increase their investment from\n\n$20 billion to $100 billion.\n\nThat would be one of the biggest investments in manufacturing in American history.\n\nAnd all they’re waiting for is for you to pass this bill.\n\nSo let’s not wait any longer. Send it to my desk. I’ll sign it.\n\nAnd we will really take off.\n\nAnd Intel is not alone.\n\nThere’s something happening in America.\n\nJust look around and you’ll see an amazing story.\n\nThe rebirth of the pride that comes from stamping products “Made In America.” The revitalization of American manufacturing.\n\nCompanies are choosing to build new factories here, when just a few years ago, they would have built them overseas.\n\nThat’s what is happening. Ford is investing $11 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 11,000 jobs across the country.\n\nGM is making the largest investment in its history—$7 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 4,000 jobs in Michigan.\n\nAll told, we created 369,000 new manufacturing jobs in America just last year.\n\nPowered by people I’ve met like JoJo Burgess, from generations of union steelworkers from Pittsburgh, who’s here with us tonight.\n\nAs Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown says, “It’s time to bury the label “Rust Belt.”\n\nIt’s time.\n\nBut with all the bright spots in our economy, record job growth and higher wages, too many families are struggling to keep up with the bills.\n\nInflation is robbing them of the gains they might otherwise feel.\n\nI get it. That’s why my top priority is getting prices under control.\n\nLook, our economy roared back faster than most predicted, but the pandemic meant that businesses had a hard time hiring enough workers to keep up production in their factories.\n\nThe pandemic also disrupted global supply chains.\n\nWhen factories close, it takes longer to make goods and get them from the warehouse to the store, and prices go up.\n\nLook at cars.\n\nLast year, there weren’t enough semiconductors to make all the cars that people wanted to buy.\n\nAnd guess what, prices of automobiles went up.\n\nSo—we have a choice.\n\nOne way to fight inflation is to drive down wages and make Americans poorer.\n\nI have a better plan to fight inflation.\n\nLower your costs, not your wages.\n\nMake more cars and semiconductors in America.\n\nMore infrastructure and innovation in America.\n\nMore goods moving faster and cheaper in America.\n\nMore jobs where you can earn a good living in America.\n\nAnd instead of relying on foreign supply chains, let’s make it in America.\n\nEconomists call it “increasing the productive capacity of our economy.”\n\nI call it building a better America.\n\nMy plan to fight inflation will lower your costs and lower the deficit.\n\n17 Nobel laureates in economics say my plan will ease long-term inflationary pressures. Top business leaders and most Americans support my plan. And here’s the plan:\n\nFirst – cut the cost of prescription drugs. Just look at insulin. One in 10 Americans has diabetes. In Virginia, I met a 13-year-old boy named Joshua Davis.\n\nHe and his Dad both have Type 1 diabetes, which means they need insulin every day. Insulin costs about $10 a vial to make.\n\nBut drug companies charge families like Joshua and his Dad up to 30 times more. I spoke with Joshua’s mom.\n\nImagine what it’s like to look at your child who needs insulin and have no idea how you’re going to pay for it.\n\nWhat it does to your dignity, your ability to look your child in the eye, to be the parent you expect to be.\n\nJoshua is here with us tonight. Yesterday was his birthday. Happy birthday, buddy.\n\nFor Joshua, and for the 200,000 other young people with Type 1 diabetes, let’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month so everyone can afford it.\n\nDrug companies will still do very well. And while we’re at it let Medicare negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs, like the VA already does.\n\nLook, the American Rescue Plan is helping millions of families on Affordable Care Act plans save $2,400 a year on their health care premiums. Let’s close the coverage gap and make those savings permanent.\n\nSecond - cut energy costs for families an average of $500 a year by combatting climate change.\n\nLet’s provide investments and tax credits to weatherize your homes and businesses to be energy efficient and you get a tax credit; double America’s clean energy production in solar, wind, and so much more; lower the price of electric vehicles, saving you another $80 a month because you’ll never have to pay at the gas pump again.\n\nThird – cut the cost of child care. Many families pay up to $14,000 a year for child care per child.\n\nMiddle-class and working families shouldn’t have to pay more than 7% of their income for care of young children.\n\nMy plan will cut the cost in half for most families and help parents, including millions of women, who left the workforce during the pandemic because they couldn’t afford child care, to be able to get back to work.\n\nMy plan doesn’t stop there. It also includes home and long-term care. More affordable housing. And Pre-K for every 3- and 4-year-old.\n\nAll of these will lower costs.\n\nAnd under my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in new taxes. Nobody.\n\nThe one thing all Americans agree on is that the tax system is not fair. We have to fix it.\n\nI’m not looking to punish anyone. But let’s make sure corporations and the wealthiest Americans start paying their fair share.\n\nJust last year, 55 Fortune 500 corporations earned $40 billion in profits and paid zero dollars in federal income tax.\n\nThat’s simply not fair. That’s why I’ve proposed a 15% minimum tax rate for corporations.\n\nWe got more than 130 countries to agree on a global minimum tax rate so companies can’t get out of paying their taxes at home by shipping jobs and factories overseas.\n\nThat’s why I’ve proposed closing loopholes so the very wealthy don’t pay a lower tax rate than a teacher or a firefighter.\n\nSo that’s my plan. It will grow the economy and lower costs for families.\n\nSo what are we waiting for? Let’s get this done. And while you’re at it, confirm my nominees to the Federal Reserve, which plays a critical role in fighting inflation.\n\nMy plan will not only lower costs to give families a fair shot, it will lower the deficit.\n\nThe previous Administration not only ballooned the deficit with tax cuts for the very wealthy and corporations, it undermined the watchdogs whose job was to keep pandemic relief funds from being wasted.\n\nBut in my administration, the watchdogs have been welcomed back.\n\nWe’re going after the criminals who stole billions in relief money meant for small businesses and millions of Americans.\n\nAnd tonight, I’m announcing that the Justice Department will name a chief prosecutor for pandemic fraud.\n\nBy the end of this year, the deficit will be down to less than half what it was before I took office.\n\nThe only president ever to cut the deficit by more than one trillion dollars in a single year.\n\nLowering your costs also means demanding more competition.\n\nI’m a capitalist, but capitalism without competition isn’t capitalism.\n\nIt’s exploitation—and it drives up prices.\n\nWhen corporations don’t have to compete, their profits go up, your prices go up, and small businesses and family farmers and ranchers go under.\n\nWe see it happening with ocean carriers moving goods in and out of America.\n\nDuring the pandemic, these foreign-owned companies raised prices by as much as 1,000% and made record profits.\n\nTonight, I’m announcing a crackdown on these companies overcharging American businesses and consumers.\n\nAnd as Wall Street firms take over more nursing homes, quality in those homes has gone down and costs have gone up.\n\nThat ends on my watch.\n\nMedicare is going to set higher standards for nursing homes and make sure your loved ones get the care they deserve and expect.\n\nWe’ll also cut costs and keep the economy going strong by giving workers a fair shot, provide more training and apprenticeships, hire them based on their skills not degrees.\n\nLet’s pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and paid leave.\n\nRaise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and extend the Child Tax Credit, so no one has to raise a family in poverty.\n\nLet’s increase Pell Grants and increase our historic support of HBCUs, and invest in what Jill—our First Lady who teaches full-time—calls America’s best-kept secret: community colleges.\n\nAnd let’s pass the PRO Act when a majority of workers want to form a union—they shouldn’t be stopped.\n\nWhen we invest in our workers, when we build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out together, we can do something we haven’t done in a long time: build a better America.\n\nFor more than two years, Covid-19 has impacted every decision in our lives and the life of the nation.\n\nAnd I know you’re tired, frustrated, and exhausted.\n\nBut I also know this.\n\nBecause of the progress we’ve made, because of your resilience and the tools we have, tonight I can say\n\nwe are moving forward safely, back to more normal routines.\n\nWe’ve reached a new moment in the fight against Covid-19, with severe cases down to a level not seen since last July.\n\nJust a few days ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—the CDC—issued new mask guidelines.\n\nUnder these new guidelines, most Americans in most of the country can now be mask free.\n\nAnd based on the projections, more of the country will reach that point across the next couple of weeks.\n\nThanks to the progress we have made this past year, Covid-19 need no longer control our lives.\n\nI know some are talking about “living with Covid-19”. Tonight – I say that we will never just accept living with Covid-19.\n\nWe will continue to combat the virus as we do other diseases. And because this is a virus that mutates and spreads, we will stay on guard.\n\nHere are four common sense steps as we move forward safely.\n\nFirst, stay protected with vaccines and treatments. We know how incredibly effective vaccines are. If you’re vaccinated and boosted you have the highest degree of protection.\n\nWe will never give up on vaccinating more Americans. Now, I know parents with kids under 5 are eager to see a vaccine authorized for their children.\n\nThe scientists are working hard to get that done and we’ll be ready with plenty of vaccines when they do.\n\nWe’re also ready with anti-viral treatments. If you get Covid-19, the Pfizer pill reduces your chances of ending up in the hospital by 90%.\n\nWe’ve ordered more of these pills than anyone in the world. And Pfizer is working overtime to get us 1 million pills this month and more than double that next month.\n\nAnd we’re launching the “Test to Treat” initiative so people can get tested at a pharmacy, and if they’re positive, receive antiviral pills on the spot at no cost.\n\nIf you’re immunocompromised or have some other vulnerability, we have treatments and free high-quality masks.\n\nWe’re leaving no one behind or ignoring anyone’s needs as we move forward.\n\nAnd on testing, we have made hundreds of millions of tests available for you to order for free.\n\nEven if you already ordered free tests tonight, I am announcing that you can order more from Covidtests.gov starting next week.\n\nSecond – we must prepare for new variants. Over the past year, we’ve gotten much better at detecting new variants.\n\nIf necessary, we’ll be able to deploy new vaccines within 100 days instead of many more months or years.\n\nAnd, if Congress provides the funds we need, we’ll have new stockpiles of tests, masks, and pills ready if needed.\n\nI cannot promise a new variant won’t come. But I can promise you we’ll do everything within our power to be ready if it does.\n\nThird – we can end the shutdown of schools and businesses. We have the tools we need.\n\nIt’s time for Americans to get back to work and fill our great downtowns again. People working from home can feel safe to begin to return to the office.\n\nWe’re doing that here in the federal government. The vast majority of federal workers will once again work in person.\n\nOur schools are open. Let’s keep it that way. Our kids need to be in school.\n\nAnd with 75% of adult Americans fully vaccinated and hospitalizations down by 77%, most Americans can remove their masks, return to work, stay in the classroom, and move forward safely.\n\nWe achieved this because we provided free vaccines, treatments, tests, and masks.\n\nOf course, continuing this costs money.\n\nI will soon send Congress a request.\n\nThe vast majority of Americans have used these tools and may want to again, so I expect Congress to pass it quickly.\n\nFourth, we will continue vaccinating the world.\n\nWe’ve sent 475 Million vaccine doses to 112 countries, more than any other nation.\n\nAnd we won’t stop.\n\nWe have lost so much to Covid-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life.\n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at Covid-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.\n\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.\n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on Covid-19 and other issues we must face together.\n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera.\n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun.\n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old.\n\nOfficer Rivera was 22.\n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers.\n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\n\nI’ve worked on these issues a long time.\n\nI know what works: Investing in crime prevention and community police officers who’ll walk the beat, who’ll know the neighborhood, and who can restore trust and safety.\n\nSo let’s not abandon our streets. Or choose between safety and equal justice.\n\nLet’s come together to protect our communities, restore trust, and hold law enforcement accountable.\n\nThat’s why the Justice Department required body cameras, banned chokeholds, and restricted no-knock warrants for its officers.\n\nThat’s why the American Rescue Plan provided $350 Billion that cities, states, and counties can use to hire more police and invest in proven strategies like community violence interruption—trusted messengers breaking the cycle of violence and trauma and giving young people hope.\n\nWe should all agree: The answer is not to Defund the police. The answer is to FUND the police with the resources and training they need to protect our communities.\n\nI ask Democrats and Republicans alike: Pass my budget and keep our neighborhoods safe.\n\nAnd I will keep doing everything in my power to crack down on gun trafficking and ghost guns you can buy online and make at home—they have no serial numbers and can’t be traced.\n\nAnd I ask Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun violence. Pass universal background checks. Why should anyone on a terrorist list be able to purchase a weapon?\n\nBan assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.\n\nRepeal the liability shield that makes gun manufacturers the only industry in America that can’t be sued.\n\nThese laws don’t infringe on the Second Amendment. They save lives.\n\nThe most fundamental right in America is the right to vote – and to have it counted. And it’s under assault.\n\nIn state after state, new laws have been passed, not only to suppress the vote, but to subvert entire elections.\n\nWe cannot let this happen.\n\nTonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections.\n\nTonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service.\n\nOne of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court.\n\nAnd I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence.\n\nA former top litigator in private practice. A former federal public defender. And from a family of public school educators and police officers. A consensus builder. Since she’s been nominated, she’s received a broad range of support—from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans.\n\nAnd if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure the Border and fix the immigration system.\n\nWe can do both. At our border, we’ve installed new technology like cutting-edge scanners to better detect drug smuggling.\n\nWe’ve set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers.\n\nWe’re putting in place dedicated immigration judges so families fleeing persecution and violence can have their cases heard faster.\n\nWe’re securing commitments and supporting partners in South and Central America to host more refugees and secure their own borders.\n\nWe can do all this while keeping lit the torch of liberty that has led generations of immigrants to this land—my forefathers and so many of yours.\n\nProvide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farm workers, and essential workers.\n\nRevise our laws so businesses have the workers they need and families don’t wait decades to reunite.\n\nIt’s not only the right thing to do—it’s the economically smart thing to do.\n\nThat’s why immigration reform is supported by everyone from labor unions to religious leaders to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nLet’s get it done once and for all.\n\nAdvancing liberty and justice also requires protecting the rights of women.\n\nThe constitutional right affirmed in Roe v. Wade—standing precedent for half a century—is under attack as never before.\n\nIf we want to go forward—not backward—we must protect access to health care. Preserve a woman’s right to choose. And let’s continue to advance maternal health care in America.\n\nAnd for our LGBTQ+ Americans, let’s finally get the bipartisan Equality Act to my desk. The onslaught of state laws targeting transgender Americans and their families is wrong.\n\nAs I said last year, especially to our younger transgender Americans, I will always have your back as your President, so you can be yourself and reach your God-given potential.\n\nWhile it often appears that we never agree, that isn’t true. I signed 80 bipartisan bills into law last year. From preventing government shutdowns to protecting Asian-Americans from still-too-common hate crimes to reforming military justice.\n\nAnd soon, we’ll strengthen the Violence Against Women Act that I first wrote three decades ago. It is important for us to show the nation that we can come together and do big things.\n\nSo tonight I’m offering a Unity Agenda for the Nation. Four big things we can do together.\n\nFirst, beat the opioid epidemic.\n\nThere is so much we can do. Increase funding for prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery.\n\nGet rid of outdated rules that stop doctors from prescribing treatments. And stop the flow of illicit drugs by working with state and local law enforcement to go after traffickers.\n\nIf you’re suffering from addiction, know you are not alone. I believe in recovery, and I celebrate the 23 million Americans in recovery.\n\nSecond, let’s take on mental health. Especially among our children, whose lives and education have been turned upside down.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan gave schools money to hire teachers and help students make up for lost learning.\n\nI urge every parent to make sure your school does just that. And we can all play a part—sign up to be a tutor or a mentor.\n\nChildren were also struggling before the pandemic. Bullying, violence, trauma, and the harms of social media.\n\nAs Frances Haugen, who is here with us tonight, has shown, we must hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they’re conducting on our children for profit.\n\nIt’s time to strengthen privacy protections, ban targeted advertising to children, demand tech companies stop collecting personal data on our children.\n\nAnd let’s get all Americans the mental health services they need. More people they can turn to for help, and full parity between physical and mental health care.\n\nThird, support our veterans.\n\nVeterans are the best of us.\n\nI’ve always believed that we have a sacred obligation to equip all those we send to war and care for them and their families when they come home.\n\nMy administration is providing assistance with job training and housing, and now helping lower-income veterans get VA care debt-free.\n\nOur troops in Iraq and Afghanistan faced many dangers.\n\nOne was stationed at bases and breathing in toxic smoke from “burn pits” that incinerated wastes of war—medical and hazard material, jet fuel, and more.\n\nWhen they came home, many of the world’s fittest and best trained warriors were never the same.\n\nHeadaches. Numbness. Dizziness.\n\nA cancer that would put them in a flag-draped coffin.\n\nI know.\n\nOne of those soldiers was my son Major Beau Biden.\n\nWe don’t know for sure if a burn pit was the cause of his brain cancer, or the diseases of so many of our troops.\n\nBut I’m committed to finding out everything we can.\n\nCommitted to military families like Danielle Robinson from Ohio.\n\nThe widow of Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson.\n\nHe was born a soldier. Army National Guard. Combat medic in Kosovo and Iraq.\n\nStationed near Baghdad, just yards from burn pits the size of football fields.\n\nHeath’s widow Danielle is here with us tonight. They loved going to Ohio State football games. He loved building Legos with their daughter.\n\nBut cancer from prolonged exposure to burn pits ravaged Heath’s lungs and body.\n\nDanielle says Heath was a fighter to the very end.\n\nHe didn’t know how to stop fighting, and neither did she.\n\nThrough her pain she found purpose to demand we do better.\n\nTonight, Danielle—we are.\n\nThe VA is pioneering new ways of linking toxic exposures to diseases, already helping more veterans get benefits.\n\nAnd tonight, I’m announcing we’re expanding eligibility to veterans suffering from nine respiratory cancers.\n\nI’m also calling on Congress: pass a law to make sure veterans devastated by toxic exposures in Iraq and Afghanistan finally get the benefits and comprehensive health care they deserve.\n\nAnd fourth, let’s end cancer as we know it.\n\nThis is personal to me and Jill, to Kamala, and to so many of you.\n\nCancer is the #2 cause of death in America–second only to heart disease.\n\nLast month, I announced our plan to supercharge\n\nthe Cancer Moonshot that President Obama asked me to lead six years ago.\n\nOur goal is to cut the cancer death rate by at least 50% over the next 25 years, turn more cancers from death sentences into treatable diseases.\n\nMore support for patients and families.\n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health.\n\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.\n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more.\n\nA unity agenda for the nation.\n\nWe can do this.\n\nMy fellow Americans—tonight, we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy.\n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things.\n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror.\n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known.\n\nNow is the hour.\n\nOur moment of responsibility.\n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself.\n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged.\n\nWell I know this nation.\n\nWe will meet the test.\n\nTo protect freedom and liberty, to expand fairness and opportunity.\n\nWe will save democracy.\n\nAs hard as these times have been, I am more optimistic about America today than I have been my whole life.\n\nBecause I see the future that is within our grasp.\n\nBecause I know there is simply nothing beyond our capacity.\n\nWe are the only nation on Earth that has always turned every crisis we have faced into an opportunity.\n\nThe only nation that can be defined by a single word: possibilities.\n\nSo on this night, in our 245th year as a nation, I have come to report on the State of the Union.\n\nAnd my report is this: the State of the Union is strong—because you, the American people, are strong.\n\nWe are stronger today than we were a year ago.\n\nAnd we will be stronger a year from now than we are today.\n\nNow is our moment to meet and overcome the challenges of our time.\n\nAnd we will, as one people.\n\nOne America.\n\nThe United States of America.\n\nMay God bless you all. May God protect our troops.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/03/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/03/01/biden-state-union-transcript/6979398001/", "title": "State of the Union 2022 transcript", "text": "President Joe Biden gave his first State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday. The roughly hour-long speech started a little after 9 p.m.\n\nBiden spoke about several of his administration's domestic priorities such as voting rights, combatting rising inflation, the electrification of the transportation system to fight climate change and other challenges facing the nation.\n\nHe also addressed Russia's ongoing invasion into Ukraine.\n\nHere's a transcript of Biden's speech:\n\nState of the Union:Biden faces a nation rattled by inflation, uncertain of his leadership\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nFrom Ukraine to inflation:5 things to watch for in Biden's State of the Union address\n\nMadam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.\n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we're finally together again.\n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats, Republicans, Independents. But most importantly as Americans. With a duty to one another, to America, to the American people to the Constitution and with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny.\n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the very foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated.\n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead, he met with a wall of strength he never anticipated or imagined.\n\nHe met the Ukrainian people.\n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, literally inspires the world.\n\nLive Updates:Biden to condemn Putin's 'premeditated and unprovoked' war on Ukraine\n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees to teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\n\nAnd in this struggle, President Zelenskyy said in his speech to the European Parliament “Light will win over darkness.” The Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States (Oksana Markarova) is here tonight sitting with the first lady.\n\nLet each of us, if you’re able to stand, stand and send an unmistakable signal to the world. To Ukraine.\n\nWe, the United States of America stand with the Ukrainian people. Throughout our history we’ve learned this lesson – when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos. They keep moving.\n\nMore:Putin's invasion forces embattled Ukrainian citizens to face the grim realities of combat - again\n\nAnd the cost, the threats to the America, and America, to the world keeps rising.\n\nThat’s why the NATO Alliance was created, to secure peace and stability in Europe after World War 2.\n\nThe United States is a member along with 29 other nations. It matters. American diplomacy matters. American resolve matters.\n\nPutin’s latest attack on Ukraine was premeditated and totally unprovoked. He rejected repeated – repeated – efforts at diplomacy. He thought the West and NATO wouldn’t respond. And he thought he could divide us at home, in this chamber and this nation. He thought he could divide us in Europe as well. But Putin was wrong. We are ready. We are united, and that’s what we did. We stayed united.\n\nWe prepared extensively and carefully.\n\nWe spent months building coalitions of other freedom-loving nations in Europe and the Americas, from the Americas to Asia and African continents to confront Putin.\n\nLike many of you, I spent countless hours unifying our European allies. We shared with the world in advance what we knew Putin was planning and precisely how he would try to falsify and justify his aggression.\n\nMore:Some countries wanted to stay neutral: How Russia's invasion has quickly reshaped Europe\n\nWe countered Russia’s lies with the truth, and now that he has acted, the free world is holding him accountable, along with twenty-seven members of the European Union including France, Germany, Italy, as well as countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand and many others – even Switzerland –are inflicting pain on Russia and supporting the people of Ukraine. Putin is now isolated from the world more than he has ever been.\n\nPolitics:Here's how to watch President Biden's first State of the Union address\n\nTogether, along with our allies, we are right now enforcing powerful economic sanctions. We’re cutting off Russia’s largest banks from the international financial system. Preventing Russia’s central bank from defending the Russian Ruble, making Putin’s $630 Billion “war fund” worthless.\n\nWe’re choking Russia’s access, we’re choking Russia’s access to technology that will sap its economic strength and weaken its military for years to come.\n\nTonight I say to the Russian oligarchs and the corrupt leaders who bilked billions of dollars off this violent regime no more. I mean it.\n\nThe United States Department of Justice is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of the Russian oligarchs.\n\nWe are joining with European allies to find and seize their yachts, their luxury apartments, their private jets. We’re coming for your ill-begotten gains.\n\nAnd tonight I’m announcing that we will join our allies in closing off American air space to all Russian flights – further isolating Russia – and adding an additional squeeze on their economy. He has no idea what’s coming.\n\nThe Ruble has already lost 30% of its value. The Russian stock market has lost 40% of its value, and trading remains suspended. The Russian economy is reeling, and Putin alone is the one to blame.\n\nTogether with our allies, we’re providing support to the Ukrainians in their fight for freedom. Military assistance, economic assistance, humanitarian assistance. We’re giving more than $1 billion in direct assistance to Ukraine, and we’ll continue to aid the Ukrainian people as they defend their country and help ease their suffering.\n\nBut let me be clear. Our forces are not engaged and will not engage in a conflict with Russian forces in Ukraine. Our forces are not going to Europe to fight Ukraine, but to defend our NATO Allies in the event that Putin decides to keep moving west.\n\nFor that purpose, we’ve mobilized American ground forces, air squadrons, ship deployments to protect NATO countries including Poland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.\n\nAnd as I’ve made crystal clear, the United States and our Allies will defend every inch of territory that is NATO territory with the full force of our collective power, every single inch.\n\nAnd we’re clear-eyed. Ukrainians are fighting back with pure courage. But the next few days, weeks and months will be hard on them. Putin has unleashed violence and chaos. But while he may make gains on the battlefield – he will pay a continuing high price over the long run.\n\nAnd a pound of Ukrainian people, a proud, proud people, pound for pound ready to fight with every inch of energy they have. They’ve known 30 years of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.\n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised I would be. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world.\n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions is targeted at Russian economy. And that we use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers.\n\nTonight, I can announce the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.\n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, united with our allies.\n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home, but I know news about what’s happening can seem alarming to all Americans.\n\nBut I want you to know we’re going to be okay. We’re going to be okay.\n\nWhen the history of this era is written Putin’s war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger.\n\nWhile it shouldn’t have taken something so terrible for people around the world to see what’s at stake now everyone sees it clearly.\n\nWe see the unity among leaders of nations, a more unified Europe, a more unified West. We see unity among the people who are gathering in cities, in large crowds around the world, even in Russia, to demonstrate their support for the people of Ukraine.\n\nIn the battle between democracy and autocracies, democracies are rising to the moment, and the world is clearly choosing the side of peace and security.\n\nThis is the real test. It’s going to take time. So let us continue to draw inspiration from the iron will of the Ukrainian people. To our fellow Ukrainian Americans who forged a deep bond that connects our two nations, we stand with you. We stand with you.\n\nPutin may circle Kyiv with tanks, but he’ll never gain the hearts and souls of the Ukrainian people.\n\nHe’ll never extinguish their love of freedom, and he will never – never – weaken the resolve of the free world.\n\nWe meet tonight in an America that has lived through two of the hardest years this nation has ever faced. The pandemic has been punishing. And so many families are living paycheck to paycheck, struggling to keep up with the rising cost of food, gas, housing and so much more.\n\nI understand. Like many of you did, my Dad had to leave his home in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to find work. So, like many of you, I grew up in a family when, if the price of food went up, it was felt throughout the family. It had an impact.\n\nThat’s why one of the first things I did as president was fight to pass the American Rescue Plan.\n\nMore:President Biden signs $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill with $1,400 stimulus checks into law\n\nBecause people were hurting, we needed to act, and we did. Few pieces of legislation have done more at a critical moment in our history to lift us out of crisis.\n\nIt fueled our efforts to vaccinate the nation and combat COVID-19. It delivered immediate economic relief to tens of millions of Americans. It helped put food on the table. Remember those long lines of cars waiting for hours just to get a box of food put in their trunk.\n\nIt cut the cost of health care insurance and, as my Dad used to say, it gave people just a little bit of breathing room.\n\nUnlike the $2 trillion tax cut passed in the previous administration that benefitted the top 1% of Americans, the American Rescue Plan helped working people — and left no one behind.\n\nAnd it worked. It worked. It created jobs. Lots of jobs. In fact, our economy created over 6.5 million new jobs just last year, more jobs in one year than ever before in the history of the United States of America.\n\nMore:Economy added 467,000 jobs in January despite omicron surge, unemployment rose to 4%\n\nThe economy grew at a rate of 5.7% last year, the strongest growth rate in 40 years, and the first step in bringing fundamental change to our economy that hasn’t worked for working people in this nation for too long.\n\nFor the past 40 years, we were told that tax breaks for those at the top and benefits would trickle down and everyone would benefit. But that trickle-down theory led to a weaker economic growth, lower wages, bigger deficits and a widening gap between the top and everyone else in nearly a century.\n\nLook, Vice President Harris and I ran for office, and I realize we have fundamental disagreements on this, but ran for office with a new economic vision for America.\n\nInvest in America. Educate Americans. Grow the workforce. Build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not from the top down. Because we know when the middle class grows, when the middle class grows, the poor have a way up and the wealthy do very well.\n\nAmerica used to have the best roads, bridges and airports on Earth, and now our infrastructure is ranked 13th in the world. We won’t be able to compete for the jobs of the 21st Century if we don’t fix it.\n\nThat’s why it was so important to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and I thank my Republican friends, who joined to invest and rebuild America. The single biggest investment in history.\n\nIt was a bipartisan effort, and I want to thank the members of both parties who worked to make it happen. We’re done talking about infrastructure weeks. We’re now talking about an infrastructure decade.\n\nLook, it’s going to transform America, to put us on a path to win the economic competition of the 21st Century that we face with the rest of the world – particularly China.\n\nMore:What does the progressive response to President Biden's State of the Union address mean?\n\nI’ve told (China President) Xi Jinping, it’s never been a good bet to bet against the American people. We’ll create good jobs for millions of Americans, modernizing roads, airports, ports, waterways all across America.\n\nAnd we’ll do it all to withstand the devastating effects of climate change and promote environmental justice. We’ll build a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations, begin to replace the poisonous lead pipes so every child, every American, has clean water to drink at home and at school. We’re going to provide affordable high-speed internet for every American, rural, suburban, urban and tribal communities. Four thousand projects have already been announced. Many of you have announced them in your districts.\n\nAnd tonight, I’m announcing that this year we will start fixing over 65,000 miles of highway and 1,500 bridges in disrepair.\n\nWhen we use taxpayers’ dollars to rebuild America – we’re going to do it by buying American: buy American products, support American jobs.\n\nThe federal government spends about $600 billion a year to keep the country safe and secure. There’s been a law on the books for almost a century to make sure taxpayers’ dollars support American jobs and businesses. Every administration, Democrat or Republican, says they’ll do it, but we’re actually doing it.\n\nWe’ll buy American to make sure everything from the deck of an aircraft carrier to the steel on highway guardrails is made in America from beginning to end. All of it. All of it.\n\nBut folks, to compete for the jobs of the future, we also need a level playing field with China and other competitors.\n\nThat’s why it’s so important to pass the Bipartisan Innovation Act sitting in Congress that will make record investments in emerging technologies and American manufacturing.\n\nWe used to invest almost 2% of our GDP in research and development. We don’t now. China is.\n\nLet me give you one example why it’s so important to pass.\n\nIf you travel 20 miles east of Columbus, Ohio, you’ll find 1,000 empty acres of land.\n\nIt won’t look like much, but if you stop and look closely, you’ll see a “Field of Dreams,” the ground on which America’s future will be built.\n\nThat’s where Intel, the American company that helped build Silicon Valley, is going to build a $20 billion semiconductor “mega site.”\n\nUp to eight state-of-the-art factories in one place. Ten-thousand new jobs. In those factories, the average job about $135,000 a year.\n\nSome of the most sophisticated manufacturing in the world to make computer chips the size of a fingertip that power the world and everyday lives, from smartphones, technology, the internet, technology that has yet to be invented.\n\nBut that’s just the beginning. Intel’s CEO, Pat Gelsinger, who is here tonight... Pat came to see me, and he told me they are ready to increase their investment from $20 billion to $100 billion. That would be the biggest investment in manufacturing in American history.\n\nAnd all they’re waiting for is for you to pass this bill. So let’s not wait any longer. Send it to my desk. I’ll sign it, and we’ll really take off in a big way. And folks, Intel is not alone. There’s something happening in America. Just look around and you’ll see an amazing story. The rebirth of pride that comes from stamping products “Made In America.\" The revitalization of American manufacturing. Companies are choosing to build new factories here, when just a few years ago, they would have gone overseas.\n\nThat’s what’s happening. Ford is investing $11 billion in electric vehicles, creating 11,000 jobs across the country. GM is making the largest investment in its history – $7 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 4,000 jobs in Michigan.\n\nAll told, 369,000 new manufacturing jobs were created in America last year alone. Powered by people I’ve met like JoJo Burgess, from generations of union steelworkers from Pittsburgh, who’s here with us tonight.\n\nAs Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown says, 'It’s time to bury the label ‘Rust Belt.’ It’s time to see what used to be called the Rust Belt become the home of significant resurgence of manufacturing.\n\nAnd with all the bright spots in our economy, record job growth, higher wages, too many families are struggling to keep up with the bills. Inflation is robbing them of the gains they thought otherwise they would be able to feel.\n\nI get it. That’s why my top priority is getting prices under control. Look, our economy roared back faster than almost anyone predicted, but the pandemic meant that businesses had a hard time hiring enough people because of the pandemic to keep up production in their factories. You didn’t have people making those beams that went into buildings because they were out. The factory was closed.\n\nThe pandemic also disrupted the global supply chain. Factories close. When that happens it takes longer to make goods and get them to the warehouses, to the stores, and prices go up.\n\nLook at cars last year. One-third of all the inflation was because of automobile sales. There weren’t enough semiconductors to make all the cars that people wanted to buy. And guess what, prices of automobiles went way up, especially used vehicles as well. And so we have a choice. One way to fight inflation is to drive down wages and make Americans poorer.\n\nI think I have a better idea to fight inflation: lower your costs, not your wages. That means make more cars and semiconductors in America, more infrastructure and innovation in America. More goods moving faster and cheaper in America. More jobs where you can earn a good living in America. And instead of relying on foreign supply chains, let’s make it in America.\n\nLook, economists call this “increasing the productive capacity of our economy.”\n\nI call it building a better America. My plan to fight inflation will lower your costs and lower the deficit.\n\nSeventeen Nobel laureates in economics said my plan will ease long-term inflationary pressures. Top business leaders and I believe most Americans support the plan.\n\nAnd here’s the plan:\n\nFirst – cut the cost of prescription drugs. We pay more for the same drug produced by the same company in America than any other country in the world. Just look at insulin. One in ten Americans has diabetes. In Virginia, I met a 13-year-old boy, the handsome young man standing up there, Joshua Davis.\n\nHe and his Dad both have Type 1 diabetes, which means they need insulin every single day. Insulin costs about $10 a vial to make. That’s what it costs the pharmaceutical company.\n\nBut drug companies charge families like Joshua and his Dad up to 30 times that amount. I spoke with Joshua’s mom.\n\nImagine what it’s like to look at your child who needs insulin to stay healthy and have no idea how in God’s name you’re going to be able to pay for it.\n\nWhat it does to your family, what it does to your dignity, your ability to look your child in the eye, to be the parent you expect yourself to be. I really mean it, think about that. That’s what I think about.\n\nJoshua is here tonight, but yesterday was his birthday. Happy birthday, buddy, by the way.\n\nFor Joshua, and 200,000 other young people with Type 1 diabetes, let’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month so everyone can afford it.\n\nAnd drug companies will do very, very well, their profit margin. And while we’re at it, I know we have great disagreements on this floor with this, let’s let Medicare negotiate the price of prescription drugs. They already set the price for VA drugs.\n\nLook, the American Rescue Plan is helping millions of families with Affordable Care Act plans to save $2,400 a year on their health care premiums. Let’s close the coverage gap and make these savings permanent.\n\nSecond, let’s cut energy costs for families – an average of $500 a year by combatting climate change.\n\nLet’s provide investments, tax credits to weatherize your home and your businesses to be energy efficient and get a tax credit for it; double America’s clean energy production in solar, wind, and so much more; lower the price of electric vehicles, saving another $80 a month that you’re not going to have to pay at the pump.\n\nThe third thing we can do to change the standard of living for hardworking folks is cut the cost of child care, cut the cost of childcare. Folks, if you live in a major city in America you pay up to $14,000 a year for child care per child. I was a single dad for five years raising two kids. I had a lot of help though. I had a mom, a dad, a brother and a sister that really helped.\n\nBut middle-class and working folks shouldn’t have to pay more than 7% of their income to care for their young children.\n\nMy plan will cut the cost of childcare in half for most families and help parents, including millions of women who left the workforce during the pandemic because they couldn’t afford child care, to be able to get back to work generating economic growth.\n\nBut my plan doesn’t stop there. It also includes home and long-term care. More affordable housing. And Pre-K for 3- and 4-year-olds. All these will lower costs for families.\n\nAnd under my plan, nobody, let me say this again, nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in new taxes. Not a single penny.\n\nI may be wrong, but my guess is if we took a secret ballot in this floor, that we’d all agree that the present tax system ain’t fair. We have to fix it.\n\nI’m not looking to punish anybody. But let’s make corporations and wealthy Americans start paying their fair share. Look, last year, last year, like Chris Coons and Tom Carper and my distinguished congresswoman, we come from the land of corporate America. There are more corporations incorporated in (Delaware) than every other state in America combined, and I still won 36 years in a row.\n\nThe point is, even they understand you should pay just a fair share. Last year, 55 of the Fortune 500 companies earned $40 billion in profit and paid zero in federal taxes. Now look, it’s not fair. That’s why I’ve proposed a 15% minimum tax rate for corporations.\n\nAnd that’s why in the G7 and other meetings overseas we’re able to put together, I was able to be somewhat helpful, 130 countries to agree on a global minimum tax rate so companies can’t get out of paying their taxes at home by shipping jobs and factories overseas.\n\nIt’ll raise billions of dollars. That’s why I’ve proposed closing loopholes so the very wealthy don’t pay a lower tax rate than a teacher and a firefighter.\n\nSo that’s my plan, but we’ll go in more detail later. We will grow the economy and lower costs for families. So what are we waiting for? Let’s get this done. We all know we’ve got to make changes.\n\nAnd while you’re at it, confirm my nominees for the Federal Reserve, which plays a critical role in fighting inflation.\n\nMy plan will not only lower costs and give families a fair shot, it will lower the deficit.\n\nThe previous administration not only ballooned the deficit with those tax cuts for the very wealthy and corporations, it undermined the watchdogs, the job of those to keep pandemic relief funds from being wasted. Remember we had those debates about whether or not those watchdogs should be able to see every day how much money was being spent or was going to the right place.\n\nBut in my administration, the watchdogs are back.\n\nWe’re going to go after the criminals who stole billions in relief money meant for small businesses and millions of Americans. And tonight, I’m announcing that the Justice Department will soon name a chief prosecutor for pandemic fraud.\n\nBy the end of this year, the deficit will be down to less than half of what it was before I took office.\n\nThe only president ever to cut the deficit by more than one trillion dollars in a single year. Lowering your costs also meant demanding more competition. I’m a capitalist, but capitalism without competition is not capitalism. Capitalism without competition is exploitation. It drives up profits.\n\nWhen corporations have to compete, their profits go up, but your prices go up when they don’t have to compete. Small businesses and family farmers and ranchers, I need not tell some of my Republican friends from those states. Guess what? You’ve got four basic meat packing facilities. That’s it. You play with them or you don’t get to play at all. And you pay a hell of a lot more. A hell of a lot more because there’s only four.\n\nSee what’s happening with ocean carriers moving goods in and out of America. During the pandemic, about half a dozen or less of foreign-owned companies raised prices by as much as 1,000% and made record profits.\n\nTonight, I’m announcing a crackdown on those companies overcharging American businesses and consumers. And as Wall Street firms take over more nursing homes, quality in those homes has gone down and costs have gone up. That ends on my watch.\n\nMedicare is going to set higher standards for nursing homes and make sure your loved ones get the care they deserve and that they expect, and they will looked at closely\n\nWe’re also going cut costs to keep the economy going strong and giving workers a fair shot, provide more training and apprenticeships, hire them based on skills not just their degrees.\n\nLet’s pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and paid leave. Raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and extend the Child Tax Credit, so no one has to raise a family in poverty.\n\nLet’s increase Pell Grants and increase our historic support of HBCUs, and invest in what Jill—our First Lady who teaches full-time—calls America’s best-kept secret: community colleges.\n\nLook, let’s pass the PRO Act. When a majority of workers want to form a union — they shouldn’t be able to be stopped.\n\nWhen we invest in our workers, when we build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out together, we can do something we haven’t done in a long time: build a better America.\n\nFor more than two years, COVID has impacted every decision in our lives and the life of the nation.\n\nAnd I know you’re tired, frustrated and exhausted. That doesn’t even count close to a million people who sit at a dining room table or a kitchen table and look at an empty chair because they lost somebody.\n\nBut I also know this, because of the progress we’ve made, because of your resilience and the tools that we have been provided by this Congress, tonight I can say we are moving forward safely, back to more normal routines.\n\nWe’ve reached a new moment in the fight against COVID-19, where severe cases are down to a level not seen since July of last year.\n\nJust a few days ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a new mask guideline.\n\nUnder the new guidelines, most Americans in most of the country can now go mask free. And based on projections, more of the country will reach that point across the next couple of weeks.\n\nThanks to the progress we have made this past year, COVID-19 no longer need control our lives.\n\nI know some are talking about “living with COVID-19.” But tonight I say that we will never just accept living with COVID-19. We’ll continue to combat the virus as we do other diseases. And because this virus mutates and spreads, we have to stay on guard.\n\nHere are four common sense steps as we move forward safely in my view\n\nFirst, stay protected with vaccines and treatments. We know how incredibly effective vaccines are. If you’re vaccinated and boosted you have the highest degree of protection.\n\nWe will never give up on vaccinating more Americans. Now, I know parents with kids under 5 are eager to see their vaccines authorized for their children.\n\nThe scientists are working hard to get that done and we’ll be ready with plenty of vaccines if and when they do.\n\nWe are also ready with anti-viral treatments. If you get COVID-19, the Pfizer pill reduces your chances of ending up in the hospital by 90%.\n\nI’ve ordered more pills than anyone in the world has. Pfizer is working overtime to get us 1 million pills this month and more than double that next month.\n\nAnd now we’re launching the “Test to Treat” initiative so people can get tested at a pharmacy, and if they’re positive, receive antiviral pills on the spot at no cost.\n\nIf you’re immunocompromised or have some other vulnerability, we have treatments and free high-quality masks.\n\nWe’re leaving no one behind or ignoring anyone’s needs as we move forward. On testing, we have made hundreds of millions of tests available, and you can order them for free to your doorstep.\n\nIf you already ordered free tests tonight, I am announcing that you can order another group of tests. Go to covidtests.gov starting next week, and you can get more tests.\n\nSecond – we must prepare for new variants. Over the past, we’ve gotten much better at detecting new variants. If necessary, we’ll be able to deploy new vaccines within 100 days instead of maybe months or years.\n\nAnd if Congress provides the funds we need, we’ll have new stockpiles of tests, masks, pills ready if needed. I can’t promise a new variant won’t come. But I can promise you we’ll do everything within our power to be ready if it does.\n\nMore:https://www.usatoday.com/news/coronavirus/\n\nThird – we can end the shutdown of schools and businesses. We have the tools we need.\n\nIt’s time for America to get back to work and fill our great downtowns again with people. People working from home can feel safe and begin to return to their offices.\n\nWe’re doing that here in the federal government. The vast majority of federal workers will once again work in person.\n\nOur schools are open. Let’s keep it that way. Our kids need to be in school. With 75% of adult Americans fully vaccinated and hospitalizations down by 77%, most Americans can remove their masks and stay in the classroom and move forward safely.\n\nWe achieved this because we provided free vaccines, treatments, tests and masks.\n\nOf course, continuing this costs money. So it will not surprise you, I’ll be back to see y’all.\n\nI’m going to soon send a request to Congress. The vast majority of Americans have used these tools and may want to again. We may need them again, so I expect Congress, and I hope you’ll pass that quickly.\n\nFourth, we’ll continue vaccinating the world. We’ve sent 475 million vaccine doses to 112 countries, more than any nation on Earth.\n\nWe won’t stop. You can’t build a wall high enough to keep out a vaccine. The vaccine can stop the spread of these diseases.\n\nWe’ve lost so much in COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, much loss of life.\n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. So stop looking at COVID as a partisan dividing line. See it for what it is: A God-awful disease. Let’s stop seeing each other as enemies and start seeing each other for who we really are: fellow Americans.\n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. It’s a long time coming, but we can change how to move forward — on COVID-19 and other issues that we must face together.\n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera.\n\nMore:Biden's travels, funeral for NYPD officer, Janet Jackson doc: 5 things to know Friday\n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. Officer Mora was 27 years old. Officer Rivera was 22 years old.\n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets that they later chose to patrol as police officers.\n\nI spoke with their families, and I told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifices, and we’ll carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\n\nLike some of you that have been around for a while, I’ve worked with you on these issues for a long time. I know what works: Investigating crime prevention and community policing, cops who’ll walk the beat, who know the neighborhood, and who can restore trust and safety.\n\nSo let’s not abandon our streets. Or choose between safety and equal justice. Let’s come together and protect our communities, restore trust and hold law enforcement accountable.\n\nThat’s why the Justice Department has required body cameras, banned chokeholds, and restricted no-knock warrants for its officers.\n\nThat’s why the American Rescue Plan that you all provided $350 billion that cities, states, and counties can use to hire more police and invest in more proven strategies. Proven strategies like community violence interruption — trusted messengers breaking the cycle of violence and trauma and giving young people some hope.\n\nWe should all agree: The answer is not to defund the police. It’s to fund the police. Fund them. Fund them with resources and training they need to protect our communities.\n\nI ask Democrats and Republicans alike to pass my budget and keep our neighborhoods safe.\n\nAnd we’ll do everything in my power to crack down on gun trafficking of ghost guns that you can buy online, assemble at home,. No serial numbers. Can’t be traced.\n\nI ask Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun violence. Pass universal background checks. Why should anyone on the terrorist list be able to purchase a weapon? Why? Why?\n\nFolks, ban assault weapons with high-capacity magazines that hold up to 100 rounds. You think the deer are wearing Kevlar vests?\n\nLook, repeal the liability shield that makes gun manufacturers the only industry in America that can’t be sued. The only one. Imagine had we done that with the tobacco manufacturers.\n\nThese laws don’t infringe on the Second Amendment. They save lives.\n\nThe most fundamental right in America is the right to vote – and to have it counted. And, look, it’s under assault.\n\nIn state after state, new laws have been passed, not only to suppress the vote – we’ve been there before - but to subvert the entire election.\n\nWe can’t let this happen.\n\nTonight. I call on the Senate to pass the Freedom to Vote Act, pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans know who’s funding our elections.\n\nTonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer: an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\n\nAnd we all know, no matter what your ideology, one of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a president has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court.\n\nAs I did four days ago, I’ve nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, one of our nation’s top legal minds who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence.\n\nA former top litigator in private practice. A former federal public defender. From a family of public school educators and police officers. She’s a consensus builder. Since she’s been nominated, she’s received a broad range of support including the the Fraternal Order of\n\nPolice and former judges supported by Democrats and Republicans.\n\nFolks, if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure the border and fix the immigration system.\n\nAnd as you might gas, I think we can do both. At our border, we’ve installed new technology like cutting-edge scanners to better detect drug smuggling.\n\nWe’ve set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers.\n\nWe’re putting in place dedicated immigration judges in significant larger number so families fleeing persecution and violence can have their cases heard faster and those who aren’t legitimately here can be sent back.”\n\nMore:A 'brutal crosscurrent': Why Biden's immigration policies are making everyone mad\n\nWe’re securing commitments and supporting partners in South and Central America to host more refugees and secure their own borders.\n\nWe can do all this while keeping lit the torch of liberty that has led generations of immigrants to this land—my forefathers and many of yours.\n\nProvide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farm workers, and essential workers.\n\nRevise our laws so businesses have the workers they need and families don’t wait decades to reunite.\n\nIt’s not only the right thing to do, it’s the economically smart thing to do.\n\nThat’s why immigration reform is supported by everyone from labor unions to religious leaders to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nLet’s get it done once and for all.\n\nFolks, advancing liberty and justice also requires protecting the rights of women.\n\nThe constitutional right affirmed in Roe v. Wade — standing precedent for half a century —is under attack as never before.\n\nMore:With Roe v. Wade in peril in Supreme Court, abortion rights activists ask: Where are the men?\n\nIf you want to go forward, not backwards, we must protect access to health care., preserve a woman’s right to choose, and continue to advance maternal health care for all Americans.\n\nAnd folks, for our LGBTQ+ Americans, let’s finally get the bipartisan Equality Act to my desk. The onslaught of state laws targeting transgender Americans and their families, it’s simply wrong.\n\nAs I said last year, especially to our younger transgender Americans, I’ll always have your back as your president, so you can be yourself and reach your God-given potential.\n\nFolks, as I’ve just demonstrated, while it often appears that we do not agree, we do agree on a lot more things than we acknowledge. I signed 80 bipartisan bills into law last year. From preventing government shutdowns to protecting Asian-Americans from still-too-common hate crimes to reforming military justice.\n\nAnd we’ll be strengthening the Violence Against Women Act that I first wrote three decades ago. It is important for us to show the nation that we can come together and do big things.\n\nSo tonight I’m offering a Unity Agenda for the nation. Four big things we can do together in my view.\n\nFirst, beat the opioid epidemic.\n\nThere is so much we can do. Increase funding for prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery.\n\nGet rid of outdated rules that stop doctors from prescribing treatments. Stop the flow of illicit drugs by working with state and local law enforcement to go after traffickers.\n\nAnd if you’re suffering from addiction, you should know you are not alone. I believe in recovery, and I celebrate the 23 million Americans in recovery.\n\nSecond, let’s take on mental health, especially among our children, whose lives and education have been turned upside down.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan gave schools money to hire teachers and help students make up for lost learning.\n\nI urge every parent to make sure your school does just that. They have the money. We can all play a part. Sign up to be a tutor or a mentor.\n\nChildren were also struggling before the pandemic. Bullying, violence, trauma, and the harms of social media.\n\nAs Frances Haugen, who is here tonight with us, has shown, we must hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they’re conducting on our children for profit.\n\nFolks, it’s time to strengthen privacy protections, ban targeted advertising to children, demand tech companies stop collecting personal data on our children.\n\nAnd let’s get all Americans the mental health services they need. More people they can turn to for help, and full parity between physical and mental health care if we treat it that way in our insurance.\n\nThe third piece of that agenda is support our veterans. Veterans are the backbone and the spine of this country. They’re the best of us.\n\nI’ve always believed that we have a sacred obligation to equip all those we send to war and care for those and their families when they come home.\n\nMy administration provided assistance with job training and housing, and now helping lower-income veterans get VA care debt-free.\n\nOur troops in Iraq and Afghanistan faced many dangers.\n\nOne being stationed at bases and breathing in toxic smoke from “burn pits,” Many of you have been there. I’ve been in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan over 40 times. These burn pits that incinerate waste – the waste of war—medical and hazard material, jet fuel, and so much more.\n\nAnd they came home, many of the world’s fittest and best trained warriors. Never the same.\n\nHeadaches. Numbness. Dizziness.\n\nA cancer that would put them in a flag-draped coffin.\n\nI know.\n\nOne of those soldiers was my son Major Beau Biden.\n\nI don’t know for sure if the burn pit that he lived near, that his hooch was near in Iraq and earlier than that in Kosovo was the cause of his brain cancer and the disease of so many of our troops.\n\nBut I am committed to finding out everything we can.\n\nCommitted to military families like Danielle Robinson from Ohio.\n\nThe widow of Sgt. First Class Heath Robinson.\n\nHe was born a soldier. Army National Guard. Combat medic in Kosovo and Iraq.\n\nStationed near Baghdad, just yards from burn pits the size of football fields.\n\nDanielle is here with us tonight. They loved going to Ohio State football games. And he loved building Legos with their daughter.\n\nBut cancer from prolonged exposure to burn pits ravaged Heath’s lungs and body.\n\nDanielle says Heath was a fighter to the very end.\n\nHe didn’t know how to stop fighting. And neither did she.\n\nThrough her pain she found purpose to demand we do better.\n\nTonight, Danielle — we are going to do better.\n\nThe VA is pioneering new ways of linking toxic exposures to disease, already helping more veterans get benefits.\n\nAnd tonight, I’m announcing we're expanding eligibility to veterans suffering from nine respiratory cancers.\n\nI’m also calling on Congress to pass a law to make sure veterans devastated by toxic exposure in Iraq and Afghanistan finally get the benefits and the comprehensive health care they deserve.\n\nAnd fourth and last, let’s end cancer as we know it.\n\nThis is personal. This is personal to me and Jill, and to Kamala, and so many of you who have lost someone you love: husband, wife, son, daughter, mom, dad.\n\nCancer is the number two cause of death in America – second only to heart disease.\n\nLast month, I announced the plan to supercharge the Cancer Moonshot that President Obama asked me to lead six years ago.\n\nMore:Can Biden's 'Cancer Moonshot' succeed? It's possible, experts say, but it will take more than words\n\nOur goal is to cut the cancer death rate by at least 50% over the next 25 years and I think we can do better than that. Turn cancers from death sentences into treatable diseases.\n\nMore support for patients and their families.\n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund what I call ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. Patterned after DARPA in the Defense Department. Projects that led in DARPA to the Internet, GPS, and so much more to make our forces more safer and be able to wage war with more clarity.\n\nARPA will have a singular purpose: to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s and diabetes, and more.\n\nA unity agenda for the nation.\n\nWe can do these things. It’s within our power. And I don’t see a partisan edge in any of those things.\n\nMy fellow Americans, tonight we have gathered in a sacred space: the citadel of democracy.\n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation of Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things.\n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, debated totalitarianism and terror.\n\nWe built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known.\n\nNow is the hour.\n\nOur moment of responsibility.\n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself.\n\nIt is in this moment that our character of this generation is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged.\n\nWell, I know this nation.\n\nWe’ll meet the test.\n\nProtect freedom and liberty. Expand fairness and opportunity.\n\nAnd we will save democracy.\n\nAs hard as these times have been, I am more optimistic about America today than I’ve been my whole life.\n\nBecause I see the future that is within our grasp.\n\nBecause I know there is simply nothing beyond our capacity.\n\nWe are the only nation on Earth that has always turned every crisis we’ve faced into an opportunity.\n\nThe only nation that can be defined by a single word: possibilities.\n\nSo, on this night, on our 245th year as a nation, I have come to report on the state of the nation, the State of the Union.\n\nAnd my report is this: the State of the Union is strong because you, the American people, are strong.\n\nWe are stronger today than we were a year ago.\n\nAnd we’ll be stronger a year from now than we are today.\n\nThis is our moment to meet and overcome the challenges of our time.\n\nAnd we will, as one people.\n\nOne America.\n\nThe United States of America.\n\nGod bless you all and may God protect our troops.\n\nThank you.

The vote was 65 to 33 with 15 Republicans joining Democrats in support of the measure. The bill now goes to the House for a vote before it can be sent to President Joe Biden to be signed into law. The measure includes millions of dollars for mental health, school safety, crisis intervention programs and incentives for states to bolster juvenile records systems. It also makes significant changes to the process for people ages 18 to 21 to buy a firearm and closes the so-called boyfriend loophole. The package, however, does not include an assault weapons ban that Democrats were seeking. Separately, hours before the Senate vote, the Supreme Court struck down a New York gun law that places restrictions on carrying a concealed handgun outside the home – an opinion marking the widest expansion of gun rights in a decade.\n\n2. January 6\n\nThe January 6 select committee’s hearing on Thursday shed new light on the role that former President Donald Trump’s Republican allies in Congress played in furthering his efforts to try to overturn the election – and how many of them sought pardons after the attack on the US Capitol. The hearing also brought to light a high-stakes Oval Office meeting in December 2020, where Trump considered firing the acting attorney general and installing Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark, who was willing to use the powers of federal law enforcement to encourage state lawmakers to overturn Trump’s loss. The day before the hearing, federal investigators searched Clark’s home, although it’s not clear what investigators were seeking. Clark has denied any wrongdoing related to January 6.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback New documentary footage reveals Pence reacting to a resolution calling for him to invoke 25th amendment to remove Trump from power 03:15 - Source: CNN\n\n3. Coronavirus\n\nLong Covid – a condition marked by lingering Covid-19 symptoms – can affect children of all ages, including infants, a new study shows. The CDC defines long Covid as health problems that last four or more weeks after a Covid-19 infection. According to the study, common symptoms of long Covid varied by age. For children up to 3, it was mood swings, rashes and stomach aches. Children 4 to 11 years old also experienced memory and concentration problems. For 12- to 14-year-olds, it was memory and concentration issues, mood swings and fatigue.\n\n4. Ukraine\n\nUkrainian forces will soon have to withdraw from the embattled city of Severodonetsk, a regional official said today, accusing Russia of destroying most of its infrastructure during months of intense shelling. “All the infrastructure of the city is completely destroyed. More than 90% of houses were fired on, about 80% of houses were critically destroyed,” said Serhiy Hayday, the head of the Luhansk regional military administration. Ukraine also faces a difficult winter ahead as Russia continues to reduce energy supplies to members of the European Union. Additionally, thousands of Ukrainians killed in the war remain unidentified. Police, soldiers, investigators, morticians and forensic experts – desperate to return remains to loved ones – are working tirelessly to find out who they are, so their bodies can be laid properly to rest.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Commander says images reveal new Russian attack plan 02:33 - Source: CNN\n\n5. Student debt\n\nThe Biden administration has agreed to cancel an estimated $6 billion in federal student loan debt for borrowers who have claimed they were defrauded by their college. The administration had previously approved $25 billion in loan forgiveness for 1.3 million borrowers. Many of the borrowers affected by the new agreement have been waiting years for the Department of Education to process their claims under a rule known as borrower defense to repayment. It allows borrowers who believe they were misled by their college, often over inflated job placement rates or the ability to transfer credits, to request federal student loan relief.

Banksy – the anonymous street artist – painted the artwork known as the “sad girl” on the exit door of the Bataclan in homage of the 90 concertgoers who were killed when ISIS attackers opened fire during a performance at the hall. The convicted art thieves had stolen the door in 2019 and shipped it to Italy, where investigators later found it at a farm. The eight men have been sentenced to a maximum of two years in prison.\n\nTODAY’S QUOTE\n\n“The management of this theater discovered after booking ‘Lightyear’ that there is a same-sex kissing scene within the first 30 minutes of the Pixar movie. We will do all we can to fast forward through that scene, but it might not be exact.”\n\n– A sign posted at a movie theater in Oklahoma, warning about a same-sex kiss in the new Disney/Pixar film “Lightyear.” The notice outside of the 89er Theater in Kingfisher cautioned parents about a scene that depicts two female characters sharing a brief kiss. After the sign stirred widespread debate online and in the community, the owners of the theater told CNN that the notice was removed and that the scene had not been censored in any showings. Several countries, including Malaysia, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, have banned “Lightyear” from theaters over its inclusion of the same-sex kiss.\n\nTODAY’S WEATHER\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Heat continues to dominate the Southeast while severe storms are possible for the Plains 03:09 - Source: CNN\n\nCheck your local forecast here>>>\n\nAND FINALLY\n\nWeather reporter's hungry dog interrupts live TV report looking for treats\n\nToday is National Take Your Dog to Work Day\n\nFor some during the pandemic, working from home means pets are always nearby 24/7!

The agreement, coming after nearly two years of often tense negotiations, represents a milestone for the nonprofit, which has waged legal fights against racial discrimination and for workers rights for five decades but has long faced allegations of internal discrimination against minority employees, especially for leadership roles. In a joint statement Monday, SPLC President and CEO Margaret Huang and Cet Parks, the executive director of Washington-Baltimore News Guild Local 32035, TNG-CWA, which represented SPLC employees, said the contract could “be a catalyst for economic and racial justice in the South and beyond.” The contract covers about 250 employees. The nonprofit’s 2020 990 form, the most recent one available, said SPLC employed 475 people on Oct. 31, 2020. Huang said in a statement in March that SPLC had “nearly 400” employees. Messages seeking more recent numbers were sent to SPLC on Monday morning. The SPLC did not voluntarily recognize the union, and hired a law firm that specialized in “union avoidance” strategies. But nearly 76% of the SPLC’s employees voted to organize in December 2019.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: More than 530 wildfires have burned an area the size of Connecticut in Alaska this year and the usual worst of the fire season lays ahead. Although there has not been much property damage, some residents have been forced to evacuate and one person was killed – a helicopter pilot died last month when he crashed while attempting to carry a load of equipment for firefighters. Recent rains have helped but longer-term forecasts are showing a pattern similar to 2004, when July rains gave way to high-pressure systems, hot days, low humidity and lightning strikes that fueled Alaska’s worst fire year. In 2004, the acreage burned by mid-July was about the same as now, But by the time that fire season ended, 10,156 square miles were charred.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: A pedestrian suffered life-threatening injuries after being struck by a train Sunday, authorities said. Police said the incident occurred about 10:30 a.m. The name and age of the injured person haven’t been released yet. Police said they are investigating the incident and so is Union Pacific. The spokeswoman for the railroad company said the crew was not injured in the incident and train traffic has resumed in the area.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state Senate stripped two senators of their committee leadership posts for the rest of the year after one sought reimbursement for a meeting at the Capitol that he did not attend. The Senate approved the sanctions against Republican Sens. Alan Clark and Mark Johnson after finding the two violated the chamber’s ethics rules. The Senate also prohibited the two from receiving per diem or mileage payments for the rest of the year. Clark sought reimbursement for attending a Boys’ State meeting at the Capitol last month, even though he didn’t attend it. Johnson signed in Clark’s name on the sign-in sheet at Clark’s request, but Senate leaders decided to deny the $155 per diem for attending that meeting after staff said they did not see him there. Speaking to the Senate separately before the votes Thursday, Clark and Johnson apologized for the violations and said they accepted the sanctions against them.\n\nCalifornia\n\nVandenberg Space Force Base: SpaceX launched 46 more Starlink satellites into orbit Friday aboard a Falcon 9 rocket that blasted off from Vandenberg Space Force Base at 10:39 a.m. The satellites were deployed from the rocket’s second stage to join the Starlink constellation, a space-based broadband internet system with hundreds of satellites in low Earth orbit. The Falcon 9’s reusable first stage returned from space and successfully touched down on a seagoing landing platform in the Pacific Ocean. It was the stage’s fourth flight. The launch occurred 24 hours after an initial attempt was scrubbed seconds before liftoff when the flight computer detected a problem with the position of a valve in one of the rocket’s engines, according to the SpaceX launch webcast.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A man who had been charged in the presumed death of his missing wife has pleaded guilty to forgery for casting her 2020 election ballot for Donald Trump. Barry Morphew pleaded guilty Thursday and was fined and assessed court costs of $600, The Denver Post reported. He avoids jail time as part of a plea agreement. Suzanne Morphew was reported missing on Mother’s Day in 2020 after she did not return from a bicycle ride near her home in the Salida area in southern Colorado. Barry Morphew, who pleaded for help finding his wife, was arrested and charged with first-degree murder and other crimes in 2021, but prosecutors dropped the charges in April. Suzanne Morphew’s body has not been found.\n\nConnecticut\n\nDanielson: In its July “Best of” issue, Connecticut Magazine named Pouring & Passages as its editor’s pick for best used bookstore in the state, with voters selecting the store as the first runner-up in the readers’ choice category. “I didn’t expect to even be in the top three in the readers’ choice voting, let alone the editor’s pick for the entire state,” owner Jim Weigel, 71, said. Weigel said the magazine article is paying dividends with new customers coming in from across the state to check out the award-winning store.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Republicans in Delaware are challenging two new laws that allow for same-day voter registration and mail-in ballots. Party officials announced the lawsuit Friday, just hours after Democratic Gov. John Carney signed legislation enacting the changes. Republicans contend the state constitution prohibits those changes, which they said could open the door to election fraud. Proponents of the changes said they improve ballot access without opening the door to fraud. The two laws passed the Democratic-controlled Legislature with just one GOP vote for each. The lawsuit is filed in Delaware Chancery Court on behalf of two plaintiffs with GOP ties. State GOP Chair Jane Brady, a former attorney general, is representing the plaintiffs.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:DC Health officials were scheduled to hold a public town hall Monday night to answer questions about the spread of monkeypox, WUSA-TV reported. The District is one of the hot spots in the U.S., with the most monkeypox cases per capita. “We have seen significant interest among D.C. residents in getting vaccinated,” Mayor Muriel Bowser said. D.C. currently has enough vaccinations for 70% of its eligible population to receive one dose.\n\nFlorida\n\nStuart: A 70-year-old woman was stabbed by the bill of a 100-pound sailfish that leaped out of the water and attacked her as her companions were trying to reel it in on a boat near the Atlantic coast, authorities said. The sailfish stabbed the woman from Arnold, Maryland, in the groin area with its pointed bill on Tuesday while she was standing in the boat as two companions tried to bring it in on a fishing line about 2 miles offshore from Stuart, according to a report from the Martin County Sheriff’s Office. The companions applied pressure to the wound, and the woman was taken to Stuart for medical treatment. The woman told deputies the attack happened so fast that she didn’t have time to react, according to the sheriff’s office report. Sailfish are among the fastest fish species in the ocean and, like swordfish, are recognizable by their extended, pointed bills.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The Federal Highway Administration has designated two Georgia highways as “alternative fuel corridors” for facilitating the construction of electric vehicle charging stations. U.S. Highway 441 from Cornelia in Northeast Georgia south to Dublin and U.S. 82 from Brunswick west to Albany will add 25%, or approximately 330 miles, to the state’s EV charging network. The highways were selected based on such factors as their location near major job clusters, access to tourism sites, the high share of EV sales in nearby counties and their proximity to hurricane evacuation routes. The designations also are expected to enhance Georgia’s chances of landing federal funds from the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure spending bill Congress passed last fall. The legislation earmarked $5 billion in grants to support EV charging stations.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Police are investigating after a man’s left hand was severed by a sword at a Waikiki 7-Eleven. Honolulu Emergency Medical Services responders were called to the convenience store just after midnight Friday. EMS spokesperson Shayne Enright said they found the man with a severed left hand. The 40-year-old man was taken in critical condition to a hospital. A tourist from Switzerland told Hawaii News Now he witnessed the attack and saw half the man’s hand on the floor. The TV station reported police later arrested a 46-year-old man and launched an attempted murder investigation.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little has ordered that flags be flown at half-staff in honor of the two pilots who died after their firefighting helicopter crashed in Idaho. Killed were 41-year-old Thomas Hayes of Post Falls, Idaho, and 36-year-old Jared Bird of Anchorage, Alaska. Mary Cernicek with the Salmon-Challis National Forest said the CH-47D Series “Chinook” helicopter crashed Thursday in the Salmon River near the small town of Salmon. The pilots were employees of the Anchorage-based ROTAK, which owned the aircraft and was contracted to help fight the Moose Fire burning about 21 miles north of Salmon. Cernicek said both pilots were military veterans.\n\nIllinois\n\nPeoria: The city has purchased three blocks of vacant land, about 3.75 acres, in the Warehouse District for $1.7 million to be used for future parking. Last fall, the City Council voted to allocate just over $5 million to purchase the land and build the parking lot that will sit behind several buildings on the east side of the 800 to 1000 blocks of Southwest Washington Street and west of the railroad track. Pat Sullivan, who owned the land, said he sold the property to the city at fair market value, and he believes it will help spur development within the Warehouse District. At-Large City Councilman Zach Oyler, who serves on the Downtown Development Corporation, said this will cause a significant expansion within the Warehouse District.\n\nIndiana\n\nCarmel: Mayor Jim Brainard accepted the resignation of Police Chief Jeff Horner, the city announced Monday. Former Police Chief Jim Barlow is expected to act as interim chief of police until the city finds a replacement, according to the city’s news release. Horner was police chief for about six months after Barlow retired in January. The city did not provide a reason for Horner’s resignation.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:Central Iowa doctors said they have seen an increased demand for vasectomies after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, even though abortion is still legal in Iowa. As more states restrict or ban abortion procedures, doctors said more men are seeking sterilization. Dr. Esgar Guarín, founder of SimpleVas, a Pleasant Hill clinic that exclusively performs vasectomies, said traffic to his website more than doubled following the Supreme Court decision, and more people requested an appointment in a single weekend than would usually sign up in weeks. Dr. Fawad Zafar of the Lakeview Center for Urology also noticed a “phenomenal” increase in patients. Demand for vasectomies took over the office, he said, to the extent they extended hours and started offering procedures on Saturdays. Zafar estimated the clinic received 90% more emails than usual after the Supreme Court decision.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka:Work will begin in mid-August to identify and fix whatever is causing small amounts of water to leak through the earthen dam at Westlake in Gage Park. Tim Laurent, the Shawnee County parks and recreation director told The Capital-Journal there’s no reason to be alarmed. He said his department has learned from two contractors that “we’re not in any immediate danger of the dam breaking.” He said it’s his understanding that all dams leak, to some degree. Shawnee County earlier this year paid Topeka-based Emcon Inc. $25,820 to fix a leak in that same dam. The work began in February and ended in March, Laurent said. But soon afterward, a different leak showed up elsewhere in the dam, he said. “Obviously, we didn’t solve the problem,” Laurent said.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Kentucky’s largest school district will require universal masking on school property as Jefferson County moves into the highest level of COVID-19 community spread. The change began Monday and lasts until Jefferson County comes out of the red level, media outlets reported. It came a little more than two weeks before classes resume in Jefferson County Public Schools. Everyone, regardless of vaccination status, will be required to wear a mask on district property or on school buses. District policy automatically requires universal masking whenever the county has a high level of COVID-19 community spread. When community spread in Jefferson County drops, masks in JCPS become optional.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Chief Justice John Weimer of the Louisiana Supreme Court won re-election to another 10-year term. Weimer was automatically reelected when no one signed up to challenge him by Friday’s qualifying deadline for the Nov. 8 ballot, The Advocate reported. Weimer, 67, a former professor at Nicholls State University, first won election to the state’s high court in 2001. He won reelection in 2002 and 2012. In the latter race, he ran unopposed and returned campaign checks to contributors to his campaign. Last Wednesday, he was one of the first candidates to pay the qualifying fees and file the paperwork for the fall election. Weimer’s current term ends Dec. 31.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The federal government is conducting a review of four dams on the Kennebec River that could result in a lifeline for the last wild Atlantic salmon in the U.S. The wild salmon live in a group of rivers in Maine and have been listed under the Endangered Species Act since 2000. One of the rivers is the Kennebec, where Brookfield Renewable U.S. owns dams. Brookfield wants to amend federal licenses for four dams and receive a new 40-year operating license for one of them. That requires a review of the dams’ impacts on salmon, said representatives for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The federal review could result in mitigation measures Brookfield would need to take to protect the salmon, NOAA officials said. The review comes as the Biden administration is also eyeing changes to dams in other parts of the country. The administration released reports earlier this month that said removing dams on the lower Snake River in eastern Washington might be needed to adequately restore salmon runs in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nMaryland\n\nColumbia: A 12-year-old girl died after the car she was driving ran off the road and struck a tree. Howard County Police said the girl was driving a Toyota Corolla on Broken Land Parkway about 2 a.m. Sunday when the accident occurred. The girl was pronounced dead at the scene. A male passenger, 36, was taken to the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center with serious injuries. Police were investigating why the 12-year-old was behind the wheel.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nPlymouth: A humpback whale breached out of the water and landed on the bow of a 19-foot boat Sunday morning. The boat operator reported no injuries and no major damage that affected the seaworthiness of the vessel following the incident, city officials said. Humpback whales can grow up to 62-feet long and weight up to 53 tons. They are popular with whale watchers because of their acrobatic displays – including spectacular breachings in which they launch their bodies out of the water and slap the surface with their pectoral fins or tails. At the time of Sunday’s incident, several boats were around the whale. Video footage from the scene showed the animal launching its body out of the water and its head slamming onto the front of a nearby boat, tipping the rear of the vessel out of the water as it slid back into the ocean. The Plymouth Harbormaster said such incidents are rare, but they can be dangerous for boaters and whales. The harbormaster recommended boaters stay at least 100 yards away from humpback whales to minimize such incidents.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Attorneys for Michigan’s former health director asked a judge Monday to sanction prosecutors who are trying to instantly turn invalid indictments into a fresh round of charges in the Flint water scandal. It’s the latest salvo since the Michigan Supreme Court in June said a one-person grand jury had no authority under state law to return indictments against Nick Lyon, former Gov. Rick Snyder and seven other people. The attorney general’s office insists the indictments can be reinstated as common criminal complaints in Genesee County. That request by prosecutors is pending. A judge has set a Sept. 13 hearing for Lyon and others. Snyder faces a different judge on Aug. 23. They will be the first hearings since the state Supreme Court unanimously said the indictments were invalid.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud:Metro Bus CEO Ryan Daniel was named the Gerald Anderson Member of the Year Award at the Conference of Minority Transportation Officials. The award recognized Daniel for showcasing dedication to the philosophy “the success of one is contingent upon the success of all,” Metro Bus said in a news release. Metro Bus provides fixed route, dial-a-ride and commuter bus services in St. Cloud, Sartell, Sauk Rapids and Waite Park.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson:The state welfare department has fired Brad Pigott, a former U.S. attorney it contracted to claw back millions in misspent federal funds from dozens of people in the state’s sprawling welfare scandal. The termination came about a week after Pigott filed a subpoena on the University of Southern Mississippi Athletic Foundation for its communication with several notable people, including former Gov. Phil Bryant, to get to the bottom of why it received $5 million in welfare funds to build a volleyball stadium. It is unknown how Pigott’s termination will affect the welfare agency’s civil lawsuit, which promised to investigate players in the welfare scheme and answer questions that current criminal proceedings wouldn’t. Last week, Pigott had scheduled depositions with key players in the scheme, including former NFL quarterback Brett Favre. Pigott said he was not given a reason for his termination, but that Mississippi Department of Human Services officials told him it was not related to the quality of his legal work.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Charles: Roughly 2,500 Boeing workers are expected to go on strike next month at three plants in the St. Louis area after they voted Sunday to reject a contract offer from the plane maker. The strike is planned to begin Aug. 1 at Boeing manufacturing facilities in St. Charles County, St. Louis County and Mascoutah, Illinois, after the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 837 union voted down the contract, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Boing said in a statement it is disappointed in the vote but it will now use its “contingency plan to support continuity of operations in the event of a strike.” A Boeing spokesman said the company’s contract offer included competitive raises and a generous retirement plan that included Boeing matching employee contributions up to 10% of their pay.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls:The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is offering up to a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for the production and placement of two homemade pipe bombs in Great Falls. On July 4, the ATF, Great Falls Police Department, and United States Air Force Explosives Ordinance Disposal Unit responded to the 2000 block of 9th Avenue South to investigate a homeowner’s discovery of two suspected pipe bombs in their residential backyard while mowing the lawn. The pipe bombs were made of metal pipe containing nuts, screws, bolts and other shrapnel. They were wrapped in cellophane with an exposed fuse. Fortunately, neither device detonated, and no one was injured. Evacuations and shelter-in-place orders were in effect until the devices were rendered safe. It is believed the devices might have been placed anytime between mid-June and July 4. Tipsters should contact the ATF at (888) ATF-TIPS. Information can also be sent to ATFTips@atf.gov or through ATF’s website at www.atf.gov/contact/atftips.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Union Pacific’s second-quarter profit improved a bit, but the Omaha-based railroad’s expenses jumped as it tried to reduce delivery delays that have left its customers waiting for trains at times. The railroad said its profit grew 2% to $1.84 billion, or $2.93 per share, in the quarter. That’s up slightly from last year’s $1.8 billion, or $2.72 per share. The results beat Wall Street expectations even though Union Pacific’s performance disappointed with two key performance measures – the speed of its freight cars and locomotive productivity – down 12%. CEO Lance Fritz said the railroad’s performance improved throughout the quarter after it imposed limits on the number of cars some customers could ship to help clear backlogs, and he said he expects that improvement to continue gradually as the railroad hires and trains more workers to handle the demand. Union Pacific is one of the nation’s largest railroads, with a network of 32,400 miles of track in 23 Western states.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Authorities said they still are investigating the reported theft of an ancient Torah from a man who was staying at a hotel on the Las Vegas Strip. Metro Police said the item was reported stolen from The Venetian last month. They said a man told detectives he left his Torah inside of a convention room that had been converted into a synagogue. Police said the Torah had been used in the convention room since June 8 and had remained in that location until it was reported stolen two days later. Hotel video surveillance showed a man walking through the property pulling a suitcase on wheels, but police said Friday they have not been able to identify the suspect.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nExeter: The city recently joined 50 other communities in the Granite State to impose outdoor water use restrictions amid a statewide drought. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the state and more than half of Maine is under a “moderate drought” and communities along the state’s border with Massachusetts are enduring a “significant drought.” Data from the National Integrated Drought Information System showed all of Strafford and Rockingham counties are in a or moderate drought. However, 13% of Rockingham is experiencing severe drought. The dry conditions affecting the state are tied to low snowpack this past winter, an early spring melt and below-average rainfall over the past few months.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAsbury Park: Gov. Phil Murphy announced $60 million in incentive programs designed to increase the number of electric vehicles and charging stations in the Garden State. “There is no doubt that the tide has turned and electric vehicles are now a legitimate alternative, equal to their internal combustion competitors in price, if not superior in performance,” Murphy said during a stop in Asbury Park’s municipal building. The Charge Up New Jersey program offers up to $4,000 in incentives for New Jersey residents who purchase or lease electric vehicles. The state Board of Public Utilities’ program previously provided residents up to $5,000 off the purchase or lease of new, eligible zero-emission vehicles, including battery electric and plug-in hybrid electric models retailing for less than $55,000. The incentive was changed to $4,000, according to the board, to “allow the existing funding to go further and provide more incentives for EVs in New Jersey.” Murphy said in its first two years the program was “maxed out” and helped put 13,000 new EVs in New Jersey garages.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Vegas: The search continued Sunday for a man reported missing after flash floods hit a wildfire burn scar in northern New Mexico. Authorities said the bodies of two women were recovered Thursday west of Las Vegas after the Cabo Lucero Volunteer Fire Department responded to a call of a vehicle being washed away by floodwaters. Officials with the San Miguel County Sheriff’s Office said the bodies were found in different places along a creek. A search began Friday for a missing man who was in the vehicle with the women, according to authorities. The names, ages and hometowns of the women and man haven’t been released yet. The flooding occurred in the “burn scar” area from the Hermits Peak/Calf Canyon Fire. The combined wildfire has burned 533 square miles and has yet to be fully contained after more than three months.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: By the thousands, revelers recently returned to Havemeyer Street in the city’s Williamsburg neighborhood to celebrate the annual Giglio Feast following its first-ever cancellation in 2020 because of the pandemic, and then downsized crowds in 2021. The feast, first held in Williamsburg in 1903 by immigrants from Nola, Italy, combines two celebrations. One, typically held on June 22, is dedicated to St. Paulinus, the Bishop of Nola from 409 AD to 431 AD, and the other, celebrated on July 16, to Our Lady of Mount Carmel, the name given to the Virgin Mary by the Catholic Church’s Carmelite Order. Although the feast used to span several weeks between the holidays, it has since been combined into one 12-day event. Throughout the festivities, people from the Catholic church and the surrounding community walk the streets, savoring food from pop-up stands and playing carnival games. The highlight of the feast is the lifting of the Giglio, an 80-foot, 4-ton tower crowned with a life-size St. Paulinus figurine. As 100 to 150 men struggle to walk with the Giglio on their shoulders, an older man takes the lead, clearing the way and waving a cane while shouting directions.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: Officials said an environmental cleanup company violated a county’s “objectionable odor rule” when it accidentally released a smelly chemical that offended nostrils and caused alarm across Charlotte earlier this month. The Charlotte Observer reported the area’s 911 system was flooded with calls July 14 from people who thought they smelled a leak of natural gas. Climate conditions across the city seemed to spread the smell broadly. In fact, though, a company called Legacy Environmental Services accidentally released a chemical called mercaptan while it was recycling four metal tanks. Mercaptan is a harmless chemical added to natural gas that smells like rotten eggs so that people can detect a possible leak. The Observer reported Friday that Mecklenburg County officials said the release has been classified as a violation and they are seeking more information from the company to determine next steps. The company said it is cooperating with regulators.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State officials said taxable sales and purchases for the first quarter of 2022 were up 13.2% compared to the same period last year. State Tax Commissioner Brian Kroshus reported taxable sales and purchases for January, February and March totaled $4.7 billion, with all industry sectors seeing an increase, the Bismarck Tribune reported. All of the 15 major industry sectors reported increases over the first quarter of 2021. The mining and oil extraction sector rose 37%, and the wholesale trade sector was up 27.5%. Counties with the highest percentage increases were Williams at 32.1% and Renville at 34.5%. Morton County had an increase of 5.1% and Burleigh County experienced a decrease of 0.4%.\n\nOhio\n\nPlain City: A recent study said a new state permit that would allow Plain City to treat more sewage should include tougher standards to better protect the Big Darby Creek and its watershed. The assessment, conducted by the Hilliard-based Midwest Biodiversity Institute for the nonprofit Darby Creek Association, in particular cited concerns about ammonia, and the monitoring under a state draft permit is inadequate to protect the diverse wildlife in the watershed. The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency’s rules regarding ammonia are not as stringent as the U.S. EPA’s regulations, said Ed Rankin, senior research biologist for the institute. He said he is concerned about the effects of ammonia on about 40 species of mussels in Big Darby Creek. Dissolved oxygen reductions from the use of ammonia in wastewater treatment can decrease species diversity in water downstream of treatment plants and result in fish kills, according to the U.S. EPA. The nutrients in ammonia also can feed plant growth along waterways, feeding algae and creating other problems, the EPA said. Rankin said any new permit for Plain City’s wastewater treatment plant should include federal standards for ammonia.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A nonprofit will open a transition home for human trafficking victims later this year, with organizers hoping to serve those affected while also educating the public about sexual exploitation. The Dragonfly Home started as a crisis center in 2016, aiding sex and labor trafficking victims by providing resources such as legal assistance and therapeutic services. Now, the nonprofit has a nine-bedroom house for women who have experienced human trafficking and need shelter, becoming the first and only transitional house in Oklahoma City certified by the Oklahoma attorney general’s office. All services provided by the Dragonfly home are free. The Dragonfly Transition Home is opening as reports of sex trafficking and forced labor multiply across the country. In 2020, the National Human Trafficking Hotline reported 10,583 reported trafficking cases, a 37% increase in just five years. In May, Oklahoma legislators approved using $5.3 million from the state budget to to create a human trafficking response unit. For more information about The Dragonfly House, go to https://www.thedragonflyhome.org.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:Backyard burning, agricultural burning and land clearing burns are restricted in Polk County starting Monday. In a news release sent Friday, Dallas Fire and EMS announced the ban, which is effective through late September. The burn ban was issued by the Polk County Fire Defense Board. The decision was made after the Oregon Department of Forestry’s fire season declaration and the upcoming higher summer temperatures. Under the ban, all backyard and agricultural burning will be prohibited. The ban does not apply to the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management regulated lands that have independent jurisdiction and regulations. More information is available at the Burn Information Line at (503) 838-2020. Anyone in violation of the ban might be held liable for the cost of putting out a fire and for any property damage that results, according to the release. There is currently no burn ban in Marion County.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nFogelsville: A man taken to an eastern Pennsylvania hospital last week after police shot a boa constrictor that was around his neck has died of his injuries, authorities said. The Lehigh County coroner’s office said Monday that 27-year-old Elliot Senseman died Sunday morning at Lehigh Valley Hospital, Cedar Crest. The cause of death was was listed as anoxic brain injury due to asphyxiation by constriction and the manner of death was ruled accidental. “A boa constrictor-type snake approximately 18 feet in length constricted around the neck of Mr. Senseman, thus causing the anoxic brain injury (complete lack of oxygen to the brain),” the coroner’s office said. Police were called to the Fogelsville home shortly after 2 p.m. Wednesday on a report of a man in cardiac arrest with a snake wrapped around his neck. Police said an officer was able to shoot the snake’s head without hurting Senseman, who was given medical aid and taken to the hospital. Upper Macungie Township police and the coroner’s office are investigating. Police told WTXF-TV the snake was the man’s pet and several other snake enclosures were found inside the home. Lt. Peter Nickischer said Monday that investigators don’t know the circumstances of the attack because “the dire situation” precluded “extended interviews … about the snake, its origin, or anything along those lines.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A high school basketball coach has been criminally charged by authorities who said he asked male student-athletes to remove their clothes so he could check their body fat. Aaron Thomas was charged Thursday with child molestation and sexual assault involving two students. Thomas coached boys at North Kingstown High School since the 1990s until he resigned last year. An attorney for Thomas said his client denies wrongdoing and the tests bettered the athletic performance of many students. Arraignment is scheduled for Aug. 19.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nAnderson:More than 400 friends and family enjoyed food and an evening of live music at the 80th birthday celebration for blues great Dr. Mac Arnold on Wednesday at the Anderson Civic Center. In between performances, Arnold’s family presented him with a white cowboy hat as a birthday gift and as an alternate option to the signature black hat he is known to wear. “Words can’t express it,” Arnold said. “The people who are here, most of them, I’ve known over 70 years.” Earlier on Wednesday, Arnold received the Jo Brown Senior Citizen of the Year Award from the Anderson County Senior Citizens Program – an accolade that commemorates his Hall of Fame Blues career and local, Upstate impact.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: Tim Giago, the founder of the first independently owned Native American newspaper in the United States, has died at age 88, his former wife said. Giago, who died at Monument Health in Rapid City on Sunday, created an enduring legacy during his more than four decades of work in South Dakota journalism, his colleagues said. Giago founded The Lakota Times with his first wife, Doris, in 1981, and quickly showed that he wasn’t afraid to challenge those in power and advocate for American Indians, she said. Launching the paper, even years after the 1973 Wounded Knee siege between U.S. marshals and the American Indian Movement, was challenging because wounds still existed on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation and in South Dakota, Doris Giago said. Tim Giago blamed the American Indian Movement for violence on the reservation. Windows at the paper were broken and the office was firebombed. “And through it all, Tim never backed down,” said Doris Giago, who was married to him from 1979 to 1986. The Lakota Times was renamed Indian Country Today. Giago founded the Native American Journalists Association and served as its first president. He was also the first Native American to be inducted into the South Dakota Newspaper Hall of Fame.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: State attorney general Herbert Slatery’s office on Monday said it’s still unknown when the state’s anti-abortion “trigger ban” will go into effect, but some state lawmakers are raising alarm the ban has no exceptions for victims of rape or incest. Tennessee has been limiting abortion as early as six weeks into pregnancy since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade abortion rights case in June. However, the state also has another abortion ban designed to restrict abortion almost entirely. But that law can’t be enacted until the Supreme Court enters a judgment on the Roe ruling, which is expected soon. Doing so will start the clock on Tennessee’s trigger law and allow it to be implemented within 30 days. Idaho and Texas have similar timelines, and a handful of other states’ trigger laws have been delayed because of legal challenges. Slatery’s office initially said the state could begin enforcing the trigger law in mid-August, but nearly a month after making that estimate, a spokesperson said they were “not sure” if that timeline was still in place.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: Muhammad Ali’s championship belt from his 1974 “Rumble in the Jungle” heavyweight title fight was sold at auction on Sunday for $6.18 million. The winner of the heated competition for the belt was Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay, according to Heritage Auctions in Dallas. In a tweet Sunday, Irsay confirmed he acquired the belt for his collection of rock music, American history and pop culture memorabilia that is touring the country. The belt will be displayed on Aug. 2 at Chicago’s Navy Pier and on Sept. 9 in Indianapolis. The 1974 fight was one of boxing’s most memorable moments. Ali stopped George Foreman to recapture the heavyweight title in the African nation of Zaire. Ali won the fight with a knockout in the eighth round.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: The city opened its ninth fire station that will serve the growing population on its southern edge. Fire Station 9 is located at 2225 East Commerce Drive. The city has been planning for the fire station for seven years and the newest addition is one of three fire stations in the works, Mayor Michele Randall said. The public was invited to tour Fire Station 9 on Friday during a ribbon-cutting ceremony and fire truck push. A fire hose was used in place of a ribbon and those in attendance were offered refreshments and small gifts. St. George Fire Department Chief Robert Stoker said the new facility would make responses to fires in Little Valley much quicker.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington:Ice Cream Bob’s, a canary-yellow kiosk on the Burlington waterfront, is open again after supposedly shutting down after Memorial Day. “I realized I maybe retired too soon,” owner Bob Saffi, 80, said. “I missed it, I really did.” Saffi reopened the shop on July 1 so a potential buyer could see the operation. Those talks stalled after July 4, but Saffi said he was having so much fun – and receiving so much traffic – that he decided to keep the stand open for another summer. Saffi began running the stand in 2002 as a converted ticket booth. Ice Cream Bob’s sells an assortment of hot food and ice cream and is best known for its maple creemees and sprinkles.\n\nVirginia\n\nStaunton: The Central Shenandoah Health District has temporarily discontinued clinical services offered by the Waynesboro-Augusta Health Department as it prepares to move to a new location. A reopening date is scheduled for the spring of 2023. Health department staff will still be available until Aug. 12 at the Waynesboro-Augusta Health Department for inquiries regarding vital records or other documents. During this transition, arrangements for services can be made with the Staunton-Augusta Health Department. Information on the new site for the Waynesboro-Augusta Health Department will be shared with the public as soon as additional logistics are completed, according to a news release.\n\nWashington\n\nKitsap:A carving studio that will become part of the Chief Kitsap Academy campus is under construction, opening the way for the Suquamish Tribe’s compact school to display various projects by students. The studio is planned to include a classroom for teaching Salish-style art and carving techniques, according to a statement. One-third of the building is set up as classroom space in which students and teachers can conduct educational projects, and two-third of the building would be a shop area, according to Rex Green, the principal of Chief Kitsap Academy. The studio is expected to be completed in mid-August, Green said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice on Monday abruptly added state abortion law to the agenda for a special session of the Legislature he called to focus on his plan to reduce the state’s income tax. The Republican governor announced last week he was calling legislators to Charleston on Monday to weigh his plan for a 10% tax reduction. He made no mention of abortion in that announcement, though he has hinted in recent days that it might be the subject of a special session as well. The Senate had gaveled in for the day and the House was preparing to start work when Justice announced abortion was being added to their agenda. In his announcement, Justice asked legislators to “clarify and modernize” the state abortion laws in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling last month ending federal protection for abortion. West Virginia has a state law on the books dating to the 1800s making performing or obtaining an abortion a felony, punishable by up to a decade in prison. It provides an exception for cases in which the mother’s life is at risk. A week ago, a Charleston judge blocked enforcement of the ban, saying the recent laws enacted by the Legislature “hopelessly conflict with the criminal abortion ban” and that it would be “inequitable” to allow conflicting laws to remain on the books. West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey has appealed the ruling to the state Supreme Court.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Democrat Tom Nelson dropped out of Wisconsin’s U.S. Senate race on Monday and endorsed Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes ahead of next month’s primary. Nelson announced his decision in a tweet. The Outagame County executive didn’t elaborate on why he was suspending his campaign, but he has trailed in polls behind front-runners Barnes, Milwaukee Bucks executive Alex Lasry and state Treasurer Sarah Godlewski. The Democrats are vying to take on Ron Johnson, who is seeking a third term.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A Morning Consult poll released July 19 showed Republican Gov. Mark Gordon tied with Vermont Republican Phil Scott as the nation’s most popular governor, the Casper Star Trbune reported. The same poll showed Gordon with a 17% disapproval rating, the lowest in the nation.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/10/10/fluoride-wince-tsunami-maps-volcanic-unrest-news-around-states/50819717/", "title": "Fluoride wince, tsunami maps: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuscaloosa: A long-running festival that aims to entertain people while educating them about the heritage and culture of Native Americans returns this week to west Alabama. The annual Moundville Native American Festival will be held from Wednesday to Saturday at the University of Alabama Moundville Archaeological Park. This will mark the first in-person festival since 2019, as the event was held online only the past two years because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thousands of visitors are expected at the festival, which began 34 years ago. “The festival is one the largest events that brings people to the park every year,” said Clay Nelson, director of the UA Moundville Archaeological Park. Holding the festival online was the best option for the past couple of years, but Nelson said there’s no substitute for seeing up close the park’s attractions, which include 29 massive flat-topped earthen mounds. “We can describe the earthen mounds as much as we want, but seeing them in person really helps illustrate what great engineering feats the indigenous peoples of Alabama were doing in the 13th century,” he said. The festival will feature artists, craftsmen and educators from around the nation, who’ll share their knowledge of Native American culture. People will be able to buy Native crafts and food, as well as traditional festival fare.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A fall storm packing strong winds damaged roofs and windows in parts of western and northwest Alaska and resulted in flooding of roads in the far northern city of Utqiagvik, according to damage reports, with a new storm expected to hit the Arctic coast this week. Water levels dropped by midday Saturday across the region, said Jonathan Chriest, a National Weather Service meteorologist. The system forecasters are tracking is expected to bring elevated surf and strong winds to the Arctic coast Tuesday through Thursday, though water levels and winds weren’t expected to be as high as with the last storm, he said Sunday. There commonly are strong storms in northern and western Alaska between September and December, he said. But the storm that just hit parts of western and northwest Alaska and the remnants of Typhoon Merbok, which caused widespread damage in parts of western Alaska last month, were “exceptionally strong” for the areas that each impacted, he said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Abortions can take place again in the state, at least for now, after an appeals court on Friday blocked enforcement of a pre-statehood law that almost entirely criminalized the procedure. The three-judge panel of the Arizona Court of Appeals agreed with Planned Parenthood that a judge should not have lifted the decades-old order that prevented the older law from being imposed. The brief order written by Presiding Judge Peter J. Eckerstrom said Planned Parenthood and its Arizona affiliate had shown they are likely to prevail on an appeal of a decision by the judge in Tucson to allow enforcement of the old law. Planned Parenthood had argued that the lower court judge should have considered a host of laws restricting abortions passed since the original injunction was put in place following the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade that said women have a constitutional right to an abortion. Those laws include a new one blocking abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy that took effect last month. The previous limit was 24 weeks, the viability standard established by now-overruled U.S. Supreme Court cases. “Arizona courts have a responsibility to attempt to harmonize all of this state’s relevant statutes,” Eckerstrom wrote, mirroring arguments made by attorneys for Planned Parenthood.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Two deputies who were caught on video violently arresting a suspect outside a convenience store in August have been fired, Crawford County Sheriff Jimmy Damante said Thursday. Damante told Fort Smith television station KHBS that Levi White and Zachary King had been fired but did not elaborate on the decision. A bystander recorded White, King and Mulberry Police Officer Thell Riddle arresting 27-year-old Randal Worcester outside a convenience store in the small town of Mulberry, about 140 miles northwest of Little Rock, near the border with Oklahoma. Mulberry Police Chief Shannon Gregory said Riddle remains on administrative leave. The bystander’s video of the Aug. 21 arrest shows one of the deputies repeatedly punching and kneeing Worcester in the head before grabbing his hair and slamming him against the pavement. As that was happening, another officer was holding Worcester down, while a third kneed him over and over. Damante has said Worcester was being questioned for threatening a clerk at a convenience store in the nearby small town of Alma. Damante said Worcester tackled one of the deputies and punched him in the head before the arrest. The deputy suffered a concussion, Damante said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The California Geological Survey has released updated tsunami hazard maps for seven counties to help users determine whether they are in areas at risk for inundation and for planning. The revised interactive maps released Friday cover San Diego, Santa Cruz, Ventura, Marin, Sonoma, Solano and Napa counties. The new maps reflect new data and improved computer modeling since an earlier series of maps was published in 2009, as well as threats from tsunamis originating far away and locally, the Geological Survey said in a press release. In one example of the updates, new modeling for Santa Cruz County shows that a subduction zone earthquake off the Aleutian Islands could unleash a tsunami 18-25 feet above the Santa Cruz Boardwalk, more than double the height suggested in 2009, the agency said. The Geological Survey said California’s shores have been struck by more than 150 tsunamis since 1800, and while most were minor, some have been significantly destructive and deadly. On March 28, 1964, a tsunami triggered by a powerful earthquake in Alaska smashed into Crescent City, California, hours later. Much of the business district was leveled, and a dozen people were killed.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A police officer who arrested a woman who was seriously injured when the parked patrol car in which she was placed was struck by a freight train said he did not realize he had stopped the vehicle on the railroad tracks, according to police body camera video. In video obtained by KUSA-TV on Thursday, Platteville Sgt. Pablo Vazquez told another officer he thought he had cleared the tracks when he stopped Yareni Rios-Gonzalez on Sept. 16 in a suspected road rage case involving a gun. He said he pulled up right behind her truck and was focused on her because he was concerned about weapons. Vazquez also said he did not know another officer had put Rios-Gonzalez in Vasquez’s patrol vehicle until after it was hit by the train. He said the “saving grace” was that the other officer put Rios-Gonzalez on the side of the vehicle not usually used for arrested people. Rios-Gonzalez’s injuries included nine broken ribs, a broken arm and a fractured sternum. Her lawyer has said he plans to file a lawsuit against police. Previously released video from Vazquez’s body camera shows he asks the other officer several times over the sound of the train’s rumbling whether Rios-Gonzalez was in the patrol vehicle, and she responds, one hand to her face, “Oh my God, yes, she was!”\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: Jurors concluded their first full day of deliberations without reaching a verdict Friday in a trial to determine how much conspiracy theorist Alex Jones should pay for spreading the lie that the 2012 Sandy Hook School shooting was a hoax. Jurors are scheduled to return Tuesday. After deliberating just briefly Thursday afternoon, the panel got back to business Friday with a request for a dry-erase easel, markers, an eraser and a copy of the jury instructions. Last year, Jones was found liable for damages. The jury’s task is to decide how much Jones and his company Free Speech Systems should pay to relatives of eight Sandy Hook victims and to an FBI agent who responded to the massacre. The plaintiffs testified they have been tormented and threatened by people who believed that one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history was a con staged to build support for gun restrictions. Jones repeatedly publicized that false notion on his “Infowars” show. Twenty children and six adults were killed when a gunman stormed Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, on Dec. 14, 2012. Jones testified in the trial, saying he was “done saying I’m sorry.” His lawyers have argued that he’s not responsible for the deeds of anyone who tormented the victims’ families, and that they are overstating how much harm it caused them.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: New state laws allowing universal voting by mail and Election Day registration are unconstitutional, Delaware’s Supreme Court ruled Friday. In a three-page order, the justices said the vote-by-mail statute impermissibly expands the categories of absentee voters identified in Delaware’s constitution. The same-day registration law conflicts with the registration periods spelled out in the state constitution, they said. The order, which will be followed later by a formal opinion, came after justices heard arguments in the case Thursday. Vice Chancellor Nathan Cook last month upheld the same-day registration law but said the vote-by-mail law, the result of legislation Democrats rammed through the General Assembly in less than three weeks, violates constitutional restrictions on absentee voting. Both bills were passed in June, each receiving exactly one Republican vote, and were signed by Democratic Gov. John Carney in July. Democratic Attorney General Kathleen Jennings appealed Cook’s ruling striking down the vote-by-mail law. GOP attorneys representing voters, a state House candidate and a Department of Elections employee appealed Cook’s decision upholding same-day registration. The Supreme Court upheld Cook’s ruling on the vote-by-mail law but said his decision allowing same-day registration should be reversed.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The National Air and Space Museum will reopen half of its flagship building to the public on the National Mall on Friday, WUSA-TV reports. When the museum partially reopens, visitors can check out eight new and renovated exhibitions, along with the planetarium on the museum’s west end. Highlights include “Destination Moon,” which will display the Apollo 11 space suit; “Kenneth C. Griffin Exploring the Planets Gallery,” which will feature an immersive experience called Walking on Other Worlds; and the “Thomas W. Haas We All Fly” exhibition, which will include the Challenger III and the Lear Jet 23. The museum has been undergoing a seven-year renovation that began in 2018 and includes redesigning all 23 exhibitions and presentation spaces, replacing outdated mechanical systems and other repairs and improvements. “You should be excited to engage with these pieces of history, these real artifacts, these real things,” said Beth Wilson, an educator with the museum. “Come and see them.” Free timed-entry passes are required to visit the National Air and Space Museum.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: Florida officials began planning to transport migrants to other states in July and told potential contractors their task would be to relocate them on a voluntary basis, according to state documents. The documents released Friday night provide new details about the program that culminated in the Sept. 14 flight of 48 mostly Venezuelan migrants from San Antonio, Texas, to Martha’s Vineyard, an island off Massachusetts. The flight has spawned an investigation by a Texas sheriff and two lawsuits amid criticism that the program was a political stunt by Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to appeal to his conservative base. DeSantis is running for reelection this year and is frequently mentioned as a potential 2024 presidential candidate. According to the documents, the program as outlined in July was intended to “assist in the voluntary relocation of Unauthorized Aliens who are found in Florida and have agreed to be relocated” elsewhere in the country. It made no mention of finding migrants in Texas. Ultimately, state officials chose Vertol Systems Co., based in Destin, Florida, and has so far paid the firm $1.56 million for the Martha’s Vineyard flight and possibly for a second flight to Delaware, the home state of President Joe Biden, that didn’t happen. No other flights have been announced.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The Georgia prosecutor investigating whether then-President Donald Trump and others illegally tried to interfere in the 2020 election filed paperwork Friday seeking to compel testimony from a new batch of Trump allies, including former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis filed petitions in court seeking to have Gingrich and Flynn, as well as former White House lawyer Eric Herschmann and others, testify next month before a special grand jury that’s been seated to aid her investigation. They join a string of other high-profile Trump allies and advisers who have been called to testify in the probe. Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor and Trump attorney who’s been told he could face criminal charges in the probe, testified in August. Attorneys John Eastman and Kenneth Chesebro have also appeared before the panel. U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham’s attempt to fight his subpoena is pending in a federal appeals court. And paperwork has been filed seeking testimony from others, including former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. Willis has said she plans to take a monthlong break from public activity in the case leading up to the November midterm election.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Mauna Loa, the largest active volcano on the planet, is in a “state of heightened unrest” but is not erupting, and there are no signs of an imminent eruption, the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said Friday. Earlier in the week week, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park closed the Mauna Loa summit backcountry until further notice, calling it a “precautionary measure” amid “elevated seismic activity.” The observatory said the heightened unrest began in mid-September, “as recorded by an increase in earthquakes below Mauna Loa summit.” The volcano, which stands about 13,680 feet above sea level on the island of Hawaii, last erupted in 1984, the observatory said. Since 1843, it has erupted 33 times, with the time between eruptions ranging from months to decades, according to the observatory. The park’s online portal says this is the volcano’s “longest quiet period since written records have been kept.” “Mauna Loa will erupt again,” Ken Hon, scientist-in-charge at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. “As long as there is heightened unrest, it is more likely to erupt. But it could be weeks or months – or it could eventually die off.” The latter happened the last time there was elevated seismic activity and summit expansion on Mauna Loa, in early 2021.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state Supreme Court heard arguments in lawsuits over three of Idaho’s abortion laws Thursday, sharply questioning attorneys about the value placed on a pregnant person’s health, the state’s interest in ensuring that pregnancies are carried to term and Idaho’s long history of anti-abortion laws. The high court earlier this year allowed the laws to go into effect, and as a result Idaho is one of several states where abortion is almost entirely outlawed. A final ruling on the laws – including one that criminalizes all abortions but allows physicians to defend themselves by showing the abortion was needed to save the pregnant persopn’s life, one that criminalizes most abortions after about six weeks’ gestation, and one that allows even extended potential relatives of a fetus or embryo to sue an abortion provider – could be handed down sometime in the coming months. “For 50 years, generations of Idaho women have had control over their bodies and lives with respect to the most intimate personal and private decision imaginable whether to carry a pregnancy to term or whether to terminate it,” Alan Schoenfeld, the attorney representing a regional Planned Parenthood affiliate, told the court. “The Idaho Legislature seeks to upend women’s lives and strip them of this fundamental right – one that’s necessary to the exercise of numerous other rights that all Idahoans cherish.”\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A man accused of walking into a Chicago police station and pointing a gun at officers, leading police to shoot and wound him, appeared in court Friday on assault charges, where a judge ordered his bond set at $200,000. The police department said in a news release that 43-year-old Terrick Bland, of nearby Maywood, is charged with five counts of aggravated assault of a peace officer and one felony count of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. According to police, Bland walked into the lobby of the Ogden District station in the Lawndale neighborhood on the city’s West Side and began shouting anti-police statements Wednesday. When officers ordered him to drop a gun that he had wrapped in a plastic bag, he pointed it at officers, and at least three of them opened fire. Bland was shot once in the shoulder and was treated at a hospital for non-life-threatening injuries. According to the Cook County State’s Attorney’s office, Bland was represented at Friday’s hearing by an attorney with the county public defender’s office. An official from the office said she could not immediately determine who represented Bland. It was the second time in a little more than a week in which Chicago officers shot an armed suspect inside of a police station.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Health officials are warning northern Indiana residents to take precautions to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes after detecting a rare and potentially deadly mosquito-borne virus in the region. State public health and animal health officials issued the warning Thursday after determining that the eastern equine encephalitis virus was active in multiple northern Indiana counties, with four horses testing positive for the virus. State veterinarian Dr. Bret Marsh said the virus “is a serious threat to both horses and people in northern Indiana” until the first hard freeze of the fall season occurs. As of Tuesday, the Indiana State Board of Animal Health said two horses in LaGrange County and one horse in Kosciusko County had tested positive for the virus. No human cases of the virus disease or mosquitoes infected with the virus have been reported in Indiana this year. But officials said that because northern Indiana contains suitable habitat for mosquitoes that can transmit the virus, “humans and horses in all northern Indiana counties are potentially at risk.” Residents were urged to avoid being outdoors when mosquitoes are present and take other steps, including eliminating breeding grounds for the insects. While rare, the virus can cause serious illness with long-term complications and has a fatality rate of around 33% or higher.\n\nIowa\n\nCedar Falls: Paddlers on the Cedar River now will be floating on designated waters. The river, from Janesville to around La Porte City – about 46 miles – has been formally recognized as a designated water trail as part of the Cedar Valley Nature Trail. A 14-mile stretch of Black Hawk Creek from Hudson to the Cedar River was also designated as an official water trail. The Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier reports members of the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, Black Hawk County Conservation, Iowa Northland Regional Council of Governments and Partnership for a Healthy Iowa paddled from Washington Park in Cedar Falls to the Waterloo Boat House in celebration of the new identification. Kayla Lyon, director of the Iowa DNR, said there are more than 1,000 miles of designated water trails in the state. The state’s first designated water trail was the Cedar Valley Paddler’s Trail in Black Hawk County, which begins at the Fisher Lake Boat Ramp. The 10-mile trail was recognized in 2005. Peter Komendowski, executive director of the Partnership for a Healthy Iowa, said the waterway was first paddled by 26 eighth graders and adults, and it took them more than six hours. It travels through a chain of lakes, down the Cedar River and through George Wyth State Park before looping back to the start.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A Wichita police officer was arrested early Saturday on suspicion of drunken driving, becoming the city’s third officer to be apprehended within about two weeks. Police said in a release that the officer, who was off-duty, is also facing a charge of possession of a gun while intoxicated. The officer, who has been with the department for two years, has been placed on administrative leave while a criminal and internal investigation is conducted, the Wichita Eagle reports. The incident follows two other arrests of Wichita officers within five days at the end of last month. A detective and 15-year veteran of the force was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence Sept. 23 after she collided with a city bus in downtown. A police recruit was arrested on suspicion of criminal threat Sept. 28 when police responded to a domestic violence call.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Three Jewish women from Louisville filed a lawsuit Thursday to block Kentucky’s laws banning most abortions from remaining in effect, arguing they are a violation of their religious rights under the state constitution. Under current Kentucky laws, the protected human life of “an unborn child” begins when an egg is fertilized by a sperm, with abortion strictly prohibited once fetal cardiac activity is detected at roughly six weeks. Exceptions are only allowed to prevent a pregnant woman’s death or a “substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.” The plaintiffs in the case say Jewish law, known as Halakha, for millennia has not defined human life as beginning at conception but rather at birth, while the abortion ban passed into law in Kentucky “has imposed sectarian theology on Jews.” Their complaint, filed in Jefferson County Circuit Court, says Kentucky law particularly contradicts their constitutional religious rights when it comes to their past and intended future use of in vitro fertilization, in which a human egg is fertilized with sperm in a laboratory and then implanted in the uterus. “As a mom, as a woman, this directly affects me; it affects my health care,” lead plaintiff Lisa Sobel said. “And then it’s a personal affront to my personal religious views, on top of it.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The Democratic challenger to U.S. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise released a campaign ad on social media that includes video of her giving birth. Katie Darling said she was seven months pregnant when she decided to join the congressional race in reaction to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June that ended constitutional protections for abortion. The 75-second video documents Darling traveling from her family farm in St. Tammany parish in September to a hospital, where she grips the side of a bed while in labor. “I wanted to share that this is real for me,” Darling, 36, said in an interview with the Associated Press. “I am literally the one hooked up to the machines and the IVs in the hospital bed, going through childbirth, and nobody else should be deciding how I handle that.” In a voiceover, Darling highlights her concerns about climate change, Louisiana underperforming in education and the state’s near-total abortion ban – the only exceptions are if there is substantial risk of death or impairment to the patient if they continue with the pregnancy and in the case of “medically futile” pregnancies. There are no exceptions for rape or incest. “Louisiana deserves better than the path it’s on,” Darling says in the video. “I want that better path,” she adds, “for you” – as the ad pans to her husband in the delivery room. “For her,” as a the video shows her 6-year-old daughter. “And for him,” she says directly into the camera from her hospital bed as she cradles her newborn.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Wildlife agencies are finding elevated levels of a class of toxic chemicals in game animals such as deer, prompting health advisories in some places where hunting and fishing are ways of life and key pieces of the economy. Authorities have detected the high levels of PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, in deer in several states, including Maine, where legions of hunters seek to bag a buck every fall. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency launched an effort last year to limit pollution from the chemicals, linked to health problems including cancer and low birth weight. In Maine, where the chemicals were detected in well water at hundreds of times the federal health advisory level, legislators passed a law in 2021 requiring manufacturers to report their use of the chemicals and to phase them out by 2030. The state issued a “do not eat” advisory last year for deer harvested in the Fairfield area, about 80 miles north of Portland, after several of the animals tested positive for elevated levels. The state is now expanding the testing to more animals across a wider area, said Nate Webb, wildlife division director at the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife. “Lab capacity has been challenging,” he said, “but I suspect there will be more facilities coming online to help ease that burden.”\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The office of the state’s attorney general is supporting an appeal by a slain woman’s family after a Baltimore judge overturned a man’s murder conviction in a case chronicled by a groundbreaking podcast. Hae Min Lee’s brother, Young Lee, has asked the Maryland Court of Special Appeals to halt court proceedings for Adnan Syed, whose conviction in Lee’s 1999 killing was reversed by Baltimore Circuit Judge Melissa Phinn in September. Young Lee is asking the appellate court to suspend an Oct. 18 deadline for prosecutors to decide whether to drop the charges against Syed or retry him. Lee argues that his family didn’t get adequate notice of the Sept. 19 hearing at which Phinn overturned Syed’s conviction. Attorney General Brian Frosch’s office, which represented the state in opposing Syed’s appeals, said in a court filing Friday that Young Lee has a right to appeal given his status as the victim’s representative, the Baltimore Sun reports. The filing argues that Lee’s appeal should be addressed before any circuit court rulings render it moot. Syed, who has always maintained his innocence, has served more than 20 years of a life sentence. He was convicted of strangling Lee, whose body was found buried in a Baltimore park. Syed and Lee were students at a Baltimore County high school.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Health officials said Friday that they’re concerned about elevated levels of the coronavirus in the city’s wastewater. The concentration of the virus in local wastewater had increased by 3.1% over the prior week and by nearly 100% over the past two weeks, according to new data from last week from the Boston Public Health Commission. New COVID-19 cases in Boston had decreased slightly over the prior week, though the data did not include positive results from at-home tests, the commission said. Boston hospitals had 170 new hospital admissions related to COVID-19 last week. Dr. Bisola Ojikutu, the public health commissioner, said the elevated concentration in the wastewater is “very concerning” because increases in COVID-19-related hospitalizations, combined with flu season, will cause “major strain” on Boston’s health care system. Ojikutu said it’s important to try to get ahead of the issue and recommended that people get booster shots and flu shots, wear a mask indoors, get tested for COVID-19 and isolate if they test positive to help reduce transmission. Nearly 79% of Boston residents are fully inoculated against the disease. The commission began noticing elevated coronavirus levels in the wastewater in late September.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has signed another extension of a law that makes people convicted of crimes, typically with low incomes, responsible for a portion of local court expenses. The law, which raises millions of dollars for local governments, doesn’t apply to others who use Michigan’s court system. It has been criticized, even by judges, as unfair at minimum and unconstitutional at worst. The state Supreme Court last spring heard a challenge by a man who was ordered to pay $1,200 in Alpena County. But instead of settling the matter, the court said it would hear more arguments during its 2022-23 term. The Legislature in September voted to keep the law going for an additional 18 months. Only 17 lawmakers opposed it. Whitmer, a Democrat, said she signed the extension last week. Rep. Sarah Lightner, R-Springport, acknowledged it puts another “Band-Aid on this issue” while a long-term court funding solution can be explored. A group called the Fines and Fees Justice Center tracks how states impose fines and fees in courts. Co-director Lisa Foster said Michigan stands out because judges who preside over a criminal case are also given power to order financial penalties that benefit local government. People convicted of crimes can be ordered to pay a portion of staff salaries and building maintenance.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: State Attorney General Keith Ellison sued Fleet Farm on Wednesday, alleging the retailer negligently sold firearms to two straw buyers, including one gun that was used in a shootout in a St. Paul bar that left one person dead and 14 bystanders injured. The lawsuit, filed in Hennepin County District Court, alleges that Fleet Farm ignored multiple red flags that should have tipped off chain officials, including sales of multiple guns in single purchases. It alleges that Fleet Farm stores sold the two at least 37 firearms over a 16-month period. Most of the guns have not been recovered, Ellison said. Ellison, a Democrat, is facing a stiff reelection challenge from Republican candidate Jim Schultz, who has made violent crime his top issue. “We comply with all applicable gun laws and devote substantial resources to training and compliance,” countered Fleet Farm spokesman Jon Austin. He said that after the St. Paul shooting Ellison highlighted, “we were told by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms that our team members had ‘done nothing wrong’ and had complied with all applicable gun laws.” The Midwestern company has 17 stores in Minnesota that sell firearms. Straw buyers purchase firearms from licensed retailers and resell them to people who can’t legally buy them or on the black market.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The city is heading off the threat of a garbage pileup by agreeing to pay its overdue bill for collections the past six months. Even as Jackson struggles with a troubled water system, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba and the City Council have been feuding over the garbage contract for the city of 150,000 residents. Richard’s Disposal has picked up Jackson garbage since April without compensation. The company said it would stop collections after Saturday unless it receives payment. City Council President Ashby Foote told the Associated Press on Friday that the city will pay $4.8 million, and garbage collection will continue. Lumumba awarded an emergency contract early this year to Richard’s after the council voted multiple times against hiring the New Orleans-based company. Jackson has had water problems for years, and most of the city lost running water for several days in late August and early September because torrential rainfall exacerbated problems with the main water treatment plant. Crews are still making emergency repairs to the water plant, and questions remain about the quality of water in the city where 80% of residents are Black, and a quarter live in poverty.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A mother whose son died less than an hour after he was transported from a jail to a state prison has won a $1.2 million settlement in a case that helped lead to suspensions, firings and reforms. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports Angela Malcich claimed in the suit that nurses and guards at the St. Louis County Justice Center repeatedly ignored the serious medical distress of her son, Daniel Stout. He was arrested June 3, 2019, on a parole revocation and spent the next eight days in the county jail. The night before his death, Stout complained of stomach pains but was told he would have to wait until the morning to see a nurse, the suit claims. That morning, though, jail staff told a worsening Stout that he would need to wait for care again until he could be transported more than an hour to the state prison in Bonne Terre. Upon arriving, he was vomiting blood and died before emergency crews could get there. An autopsy blamed complications of an ulcer that perforated his intestine. Four other inmates also died in the county jail in 2019, with an internal report finding that all of them had acted “strangely” beforehand and that most were denied medical care.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A draft report from Gov. Greg Gianforte’s housing task force details a slew of ideas to boost housing supply in an effort to tackle Montana’s affordability crunch, previewing legislation that could be advanced during next year’s legislative session, the Montana Free Press reports. Several of the task force’s recommendations involve scaling back local zoning restrictions such as minimum lot sizes, building height limits and parking requirements to make it easier to develop more dense housing developments in urban areas with existing access to services like water lines, streets and fire departments. The report released last week calls for legislation that places “sideboards” on the development restrictions towns and cities have the power to enact and also suggests providing financial incentives to local governments that implement “key regulatory reforms.” The group also suggests putting some state money toward supporting affordable housing efforts. It generally avoids suggestions that seek to address housing challenges with new government regulations, such as restricting AirBnB-style short-term rentals. The task force, which is set to formally present its recommendations to the governor in the coming weeks, is looking for public comment to consider as it finalizes its initial report by a Saturday deadline.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The city will have a new tallest building once Mutual of Omaha completes its planned $600 million headquarters tower downtown in 2026. Mutual CEO James Blackledge told the Omaha World-Herald it recently became clear that the insurance company’s new skyscraper would eclipse the 45-story First National Bank tower. The new Mutual building is projected to be 677 feet tall. That would make it 43 feet taller than the First National building that opened in 2002. Mutual didn’t set out to build the city’s tallest building, but Blackledge said he’s proud of the impact the project will have on Omaha’s downtown and its image. “I think people see skylines, and it does create an impression of all the things we want Omaha to be perceived as – a vibrant, growing, thriving place where people can live and work and prosper,” he said. The new building will be designed to hold roughly 2,400 of the company’s 4,000 headquarters workers at any one time, reflecting the rise of working from home. It will also be a little less than half the size of Mutual current 1.7 million-square-foot headquarters complex in midtown Omaha. In conjunction with the Mutual project, Omaha leaders have pledged to build a $306 million, 3-mile-long streetcar line to connect midtown with downtown by sometime in 2026.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Victims of a quick series of stabbings on the Las Vegas Strip described the shock and horror of the unexpected attack Thursday on a group of showgirls and others outside a casino that left two people dead and six injured. Police arrested Yoni Barrios, 32, after a short chase blocks from where they say he attacked four showgirls and ended up stabbing eight people. An arrest report released Friday said Barrios told police some of the victims had laughed at him, and he “let the anger out.” Prosecutors said he’ll be charged with two counts of murder and six counts of attempted murder. “I couldn’t believe that this was happening to me,” said Victoria Caytano, one of the showgirl impersonators who was released from the hospital Friday after she was treated for a stab wound. “I got up, and I started running,” Caytano told KLAS-TV. “I started yelling, ‘He has a knife!’ ” The coroner’s office identified those killed as Las Vegas residents Brent Allan Hallett, 47, and Maris Mareen DiGiovanni, 30. Hallett was stabbed in the back, and DiGiovanni died from a chest wound, authorities said. DiGiovanni was part of the Best Showgirls in Vegas modeling and talent agency, according to Cheryl Lowthorp, who runs the business. She said two others with the agency were among the wounded, and a third escaped without injury.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A former juvenile parole officer has been sentenced to 11 years in federal prison for possession of child pornography and trying to send an explicit image to a child. Jason Ellis pleaded guilty in June. Prosecutors agreed in a plea agreement to drop a third charge of distributing child pornography. Ellis was fired from his job as a juvenile parole officer earlier in the year after he was arrested. An affidavit said Ellis sent online messages in 2020 and 2021 to undercover investigators posing as a 13-year-old girl and her father. Detectives uncovered more than 100 images of child sex abuse material on his phone, WMUR-TV reports.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state would sell off all of its pension fund investments in oil, gas and other fossil fuel companies under a bill approved by a New Jersey Senate committee Thursday. The bill targets any pension money invested in 200 of the largest publicly traded fossil fuel companies based on each of their carbon content in oil, gas and coal reserves. It was passed 3-2 along party lines with Democrats in support and Republicans against. “The clock is ticking, and there is not that much time left,” said state Sen. Bob Smith, D-Middlesex, the bill’s sponsor. “We’ve got to get our industry to change and our economy to change.” The pension fund was valued at $92.9 billion as of May 31, but it is not known exactly how much is invested in fossil fuel company stocks. A state Treasury Department spokeswoman did not return a request for that information Thursday. Divest NJ, a group advocating for the measure, estimates it’s between $3 million and $4 million, based on documents it has obtained. The measure had languished in Trenton for almost five years and still has a long road ahead of it. It was moved to the Senate Budget Committee on Thursday and would still need to be approved by the full Senate, the Assembly and Gov. Phil Murphy. It would take effect 12 months after being signed into law.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has asked the federal Department of Justice to assign more FBI agents to the state in response to violent crime. Lujan Grisham said Wednesday in a statement that she wants to replicate the success of a recent surge in FBI resources and agents in Buffalo, New York. The Sept. 15 letter to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland describes a recent spate of homicides in Albuquerque and says that “additional federal agents are needed to alleviate the current strain on New Mexico’s law enforcement offices.” Lujan Grisham sent a similar request in June to FBI Director Christopher Wray. Lujan Grisham spokeswoman Nora Meyers Sackett said the governor’s office did not receive a response from the Department of Justice as of Wednesday evening. Concerns about crime are a prominent theme in the race for governor ahead of the Nov. 8 general election as Lujan Grisham seeks a second term in office. Republican nominee and former television meteorologist Ronchetti has painted a dire portrait of public safety conditions, railing against the state’s bail system and vowing a different approach to judicial appointments.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state police superintendent resigned Friday, days after Gov. Kathy Hochul said he was being investigated for his handling of internal personnel matters. In a statement, Hochul thanked Kevin Bruen for “his years of public service” and said that First Deputy Superintendent Steven Nigrelli will take over as acting superintendent on an interim basis. Bruen had been in charge of the state police since June 2021. A 20-year veteran of the department, he was appointed superintendent by Hochul’s predecessor, Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Bruen’s resignation is effective Oct. 19, the state police said. Hochul told the Albany Times Union’s editorial board on Tuesday that she had ordered her counsel’s office to investigate allegations against Bruen. Among them, according to the newspaper, is whether he had shielded a senior human resources official from complaints about her own handling of personnel issues.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s two top Democratic officials are urging the Republican-led Legislature to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana in light of President Joe Biden’s pardon Thursday of thousands of Americans convicted of “simple possession” under federal law. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and Attorney General Josh Stein, the state’s top lawyer who is considering a run for governor in 2024, shared their support for the president’s decision at a Friday task force meeting on racial equity and criminal justice. Established by Cooper in June 2020 after George Floyd’s murder, the 24-member panel of law enforcement officers, attorneys, civil rights advocates and state officials had recommended in a 2020 report that state lawmakers replace the misdemeanor charge for possessing up to 1.5 ounces of marijuana with a civil offense on par with a traffic infraction. The General Assembly did not act on this recommendation. “Conviction of simple possession can mar people’s records for life and maybe even prevent them from getting a job,” Cooper told the task force Friday. “The General Assembly didn’t pass your recommendations on this last session, but I believe they should. North Carolina should take steps to end this stigma.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state’s five American Indian tribes are seeking exclusive rights to host internet gambling and sports betting in North Dakota – a monopoly worth millions – just a year after legislators turned aside a push by one big national player to allow gambling in the state. The tribes are turning to Republican Gov. Doug Burgum to approve the idea under tribal-state agreements known as compacts, the first of which was signed in 1992. The current compacts expire at the end of this year, and only Burgum can approve them, said Deb McDaniel, North Dakota’s top gambling regulator. The tribes argue their casinos have been hurt by the explosion of electronic pull tab machines statewide after they were legalized in 2017, with North Dakotans pouring almost $1.75 billion into the machines in fiscal 2022. Their proposal, obtained by the Associated Press, is still in draft form. A public hearing on a final proposal is set for Oct. 21, McDaniel said. DraftKings, a big player in the U.S. mobile gambling market, supported legislation and a failed resolution last year to allow sports betting in North Dakota to join about two dozen other states. The company said at the time that sports wagering already is taking place in North Dakota through illegal offshore markets.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A law banning virtually all abortions will remain blocked while a state constitutional challenge proceeds, a judge said Friday in a ruling that will allow pregnancy terminations through 20 weeks’ gestation to continue for now. Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge Christian Jenkins issued the preliminary injunction from the bench after a daylong hearing where courthouse guards screened spectators, and one abortion provider testified to wearing a Kevlar vest over fears for her safety. In impassioned remarks announcing his decision, Jenkins knocked the state’s arguments that the Ohio Constitution doesn’t ever mention abortion and thus doesn’t protect the right to one. He said a right doesn’t have to be named to be protected. “This court has no difficulty holding that the Ohio Constitution confers a fundamental right on all of Ohioans to privacy, procreation, bodily integrity and freedom of choice in health care decision-making that encompasses the right to abortion,” he said. He said the state failed to prove that the ban on most abortions after detection of fetal cardiac activity is narrowly tailored enough not to infringe on those rights. Rather, Jenkins said, the law is written “to almost completely eliminate the rights of Ohio women. It is not narrowly tailored, not even close.” The state is expected to appeal.\n\nOklahoma\n\nBlanchard: Jody Miller, whose “Queen of the House” won the 1966 Grammy Award for best country performance by a woman, died Thursday at age 80. Miller died in her hometown, Blanchard, of complications from Parkinson’s disease, according to Universal Music Group, owner of Capitol Records, which released most of her hits. “Queen of the House” was released in 1965 as an answer to Roger Miller’s hit “King of the Road.” The hit opened up a crossover career for Jody Miller, who wasn’t related to the “King of the Road” composer and singer. Her 1965 teen protest song “Home of the Brave” was her biggest-selling single, despite being banned from some radio stations’ playlists. Another hit was “Long Black Limousine,” a song about a man’s funeral procession. In the 1970s, Miller moved to Epic Records, where she had hits with “Baby I’m Yours,” “There’s a Party Goin’ On,” “Darling, You Can Always Come Back Home,” and the Grammy-nominated crossover hit cover of “He’s So Fine.” She retired in the 1980s to spend more time with her husband and children. After her husband’s death, she recorded a 2018 single, “Where My Picture Hangs on the Wall,” with daughter Robin Brooks Sullivan and Miller’s two grandchildren.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A serial rapist is set to be released from prison in mid-December after serving nearly 36 years behind bars, almost all of his maximum sentence. Richard Gillmore, arrested in 1986 and called the “jogger rapist” because he staked out victims as he ran by their homes, admitted to raping nine girls in the Portland area in the 1970s and ’80s but was only convicted in one case because of the statute of limitations. In 1987, a jury found him guilty of raping 13-year-old Tiffany Edens, his last known victim, in December 1986. The Associated Press generally does not name people who have been sexually assaulted unless they come forward publicly. Edens has spoken out about the assault and recently wrote on social media that she received a voicemail in August from the state’s Victim Information and Notification Service telling her of his impending release. “I have been slowly processing the reality of it all,” she wrote. The Oregonian, citing prison officials, reported that Gillmore was transferred in August from Two Rivers Correctional Institution in Umatilla to the minimum-security Columbia River Correctional Institution in Portland to help him prepare for his reentry into the community. He will be 63 at the time of his release in December. KOIN reports Gillmore will remain under supervision until 2034.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: An Italian heritage group has vowed to appeal a judge’s ruling that officials can remove a 13-foot statue of Christopher Columbus from a city park. Attorneys for the Italian Sons and Daughters of America have argued that the mayor doesn’t have the power to override an ordinance passed by the City Council in 1955 that cleared the installation of the 800-pound statue of the explorer. Common Pleas Judge John McVay Jr. ruled about a week ago that because the statue erected in 1958 is in a city-owned park, it represents government speech – citing a 2009 U.S. Supreme Court ruling on a Utah city rejecting a monument proposed for a city park by a religious group. The Italian Sons and Daughters of America filed the lawsuit in October 2020 after the Pittsburgh Art Commission voted to remove the statue. Then-Mayor Bill Peduto then also recommended its removal. McVay had for two years urged the two sides to work toward a solution, including its relocation to a different location. The statue has been vandalized numerous times and is wrapped in plastic. “Based on the court’s ruling, the mayor can put up or take down any statue he wants on any city-owned property without regard for other branches of the city government,” the Italian Sons and Daughters of America argued. “Obviously, this cannot be correct.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Rhode Island Festival of Children’s Books and Authors returns to an in-person format this year for the first time since 2019, kicking off Friday with a virtual appearance by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor at Lincoln School. Sotomayor, who has written several children’s books in addition to a 2013 memoir, will speak to and answer questions from Rhode Island children. Free signed copies of her books “Just Ask” and “Just Help” will be given to children who attend the 4:30 p.m. event. The festival will continue Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. at Lincoln School, where participants can listen to 30-minute talks by authors, purchase books and have them signed; make book crafts; and buy lunch from a variety of vendors. Authors and illustrators at the event will be Mary Jane Begin, Gaia Cornwall, Anika Aldamuy Denise, Christopher Denise, Rita Hubbard, Kekla Magoon, Juana Martinez-Neal, Oge Mora, Hayley Rocco, John Rocco, Bob Shea, Melissa Stewart, Chris Van Allsburg and Rhode Island’s poet laureate, Tina Cane, as well as members of Rhode Island Black Storytellers. Admission to the two-hour kickoff event with Sotomayor is free, but space is limited, and advance registration is recommended online. Admission to Saturday’s festival is $5.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Write-in U.S. House candidate Lee Turner rallied in downtown Greenville on Saturday to spread the word about her campaign. Turner had no intention of running for Congress, she said, but after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, details of incumbent U.S. Rep. William Timmons’ personal life went viral online, and Democratic candidate Ken Hill dropped out of the race, Turner said: “I’ve got to do something.” Turner said she’s running a campaign based on finding solutions, common ground and bringing elected officials from across the aisle together. “I became more sure that this district needed someone like me, who was a problem solver, versus somebody like Mr. Timmons, who’s just going to tow the party line,” Turner said. While she has run for office as a Democrat in the past, Turner said she is truly an independent who believes people are more alike than they are different and hopes to create legislation with mutual benefits across political ideologies to help the masses. “Mutual benefit is the strongest glue ever,” she said. “It needs no legislation to even sustain itself, but if you do legislate it, it’s not likely to be overturned by the next party in power because it’s mutually beneficial.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A new free online tutoring program is available for K-12 students in the state, administered by the Board of Regents and funded by the Department of Education. The Dakota Dreams Online Tutoring Program is staffed by college students at Black Hills State University and Northern State University who are preparing to become teachers. The program uses a secure online platform for students and tutors to connect for virtual sessions in English, language arts, math, science and social studies. Secretary of Education Tiffany Sanderson said the program will allow K-12 students to receive individualized support after the school day has ended. “Once a parent has registered their child, students can access a tutor from home, the local library or after-school program, or even their favorite coffee shop,” Sanderson said. “I think parents are going to like this one-on-one support as much as their students.” To access the free service, parents first need to register their students to use the platform. Once registered, sessions can either be scheduled in advance or on-demand, depending on tutor availability. Tutors will be available Monday through Sunday afternoons and evenings. The service will not be available on holidays and during Christmas and spring breaks.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Country music icon Loretta Lynn was buried in her family’s cemetery on her Hurricane Mills estate Friday morning. The private ceremony of about 100 guests took place in the unincorporated Humphreys County town she bought in the 1960s after achieving worldwide fame with “Coal Miner’s Daughter.” Lynn died Oct. 4 at the age of 90. She left instructions for her funeral ceremonies, including plans for a large memorial where fans will be invited. “A public memorial is being planned,” family spokesperson Ebie McFarland said. “The family did have a private ceremony Friday with no other details available to share at this time.” McFarland said details about the public ceremony will be released soon. Loretta Lynn’s Ranch is one of the largest campgrounds in the state and draws streams of tourists throughout the year to the rural expanse, where she built an event center and other attractions. Lynn, who owned roughly 3,500 acres in Humphreys County, lived in the estate’s mansion until 1988 before turning it into a tourist center and moving into a smaller house on the property. She also built a museum and replica of the Butcher Hollow, Kentucky, cabin where she grew up for tourists to visit.\n\nTexas\n\nUvalde: The city’s school district suspended its entire police force Friday amid fresh outrage over the hesitant law enforcement response to the gunman who massacred 21 people at Robb Elementary School. The extraordinary move follows the revelation that the district hired a former state trooper who was among hundreds of officers who rushed to the scene of the May 24 shooting. School leaders also put two members of the district police department on administrative leave, one of whom chose to retire instead, according to a statement released by the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District. Remaining officers will be reassigned to other jobs in the district. Uvalde school leaders’ suspension of campus police operations one month into a new school year in the South Texas community underscores the sustained pressure that families of some of the 19 children and two teachers killed have kept on the district. Brett Cross, the uncle of 10-year-old victim Uziyah Garcia, had been protesting outside the school administration building for two weeks, demanding accountability over officers allowing a gunman with an AR-15-style rifle to remain in a fourth grade classroom for more than 70 minutes. Families have said students in the district are not safe so long as officers who waited so long to confront and kill the gunman remain on the job.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A jury found two animal rights activists not guilty on charges of burglary and theft after they allegedly took two sick piglets from an industrial pig farm. Activists Wayne Hsiung and Paul Picklesimer, with the California-based group Direct Action Everywhere, had argued during their trial that nothing of value was stolen because the 3-week old piglets were in poor condition and likely to die. The not guilty verdict was delivered Saturday following a weeklong trial. The group took a 360-degree virtual reality video of the March 2017 incident at Smithfield Food’s Circle Four Farms near Milford and promoted it online, as part of a tactic known as “open rescue” that’s meant to shed light on abusive farming practices. Investigators used the video to identify the defendants and three other activists who were charged and took plea deals rather than go to trial. Hsiung and Picklesimer faced up to 51/ 2 years in jail if they had been convicted, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. In 2017 a federal court struck down a Utah law banning secret filming at farm and livestock sites, claiming the restrictions were an unconstitutional violation of free speech.\n\nVermont\n\nRichmond: Residents of a small community were blindsided last month by news that one official in their water department quietly lowered fluoride levels nearly four years ago, giving rise to worries about their children’s dental health and transparent government – and highlighting the enduring misinformation around water fluoridation. Katie Mather, who lives in Richmond, a town of about 4,100 in northwestern Vermont, said at a water commission meeting last week that her dentist recently found her two kids’ first cavities. She acknowledged they eat a lot of sugar but said her dentist recommended against supplemental fluoride because the town’s water should be doing the trick. Her dentist “was operating and making professional recommendations based on state standards we all assumed were being met, which they were not,” Mather said. Kendall Chamberlin, Richmond’s water and wastewater superintendent, told the Water and Sewer Commission in September that he reduced the fluoride level because of his concerns about changes to its sourcing and the recommended levels. He said he worries about quality control in the fluoride used in U.S. drinking systems because it comes from China – an assertion that echoes unfounded reports about Chinese fluoride that have circulated online in recent years.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: A Civil War reenactor pleaded not guilty Friday to charges that he planted a pipe bomb at a battlefield in 2017 and threatened to disrupt additional events. A federal indictment against Gerald Leonard Drake, 63, of Winchester, Virginia, was unsealed Thursday. The indictment accuses Drake of planting a pipe bomb at Cedar Creek Battlefield during an annual reenactment in October 2017. The bomb did not detonate but resulted in cancellation of the reenactment after its discovery. The indictment also charges him with writing letters threatening violence at subsequent Cedar Creek reenactments, as well as an annual Remembrance Day Parade in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. At a press conference Thursday announcing the charges, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Virginia Christopher Kavanaugh said Drake falsely claimed connections to Antifa in his threatening letters not only to hide his actual identity but also to create additional political angst. In reality, according to the indictment, Drake was a Civil War reenactor who regularly participated in events at Cedar Creek until he was expelled from his unit in 2014. The indictment, though, does not explicitly state that bitterness over his expulsion motived his alleged misconduct.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia National Park: Park officials have closed recreational fishing indefinitely because waters have reached historic lows. The National Park Service announced it would halt all recreational fishing starting Thursday on the Ozette, Bogachiel, South Fork Calawah, Sol Duc, North Fork Sol Duc, Dickey, Quillayute, Hoh, South Fork Hoh, Queets, Salmon and Quinault rivers. The Cedar, Goodman, Kalaloch and Mosquito Creeks within Olympic National Park are also closed, The Seattle Times reports. The region for months has seen above-average temperatures and low rainfall. Seattle has had 0.48 inches of rain from July to September, while the average for that period is 3.16 inches, making it the driest such stretch on record. Park officials said they hope the closure will help protect fish, especially those trying to make upstream spawning migrations in the low water levels.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMorgantown: A West Virginia University fraternity has been cleared of hazing allegations but will be sanctioned separately on other violations, the school said. Pi Kappa Phi and the school agreed to end the fraternity’s interim suspension related to alleged hazing. The chapter will be on deferred suspension through February and lose some privileges through June, the school said Thursday. “In this case, our inquiry found no evidence of hazing, but exposed recruitment and alcohol behaviors which violate our Student Conduct Code,” said Jill Gibson, director of the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities. The fraternity agreed to participate in education, training and harm reduction programs, WVU said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A Dane County judge refused Friday to issue a temporary order that would allow local election clerks to accept partial witness addresses on absentee ballots. A group called Rise Inc. filed a lawsuit in September seeking a judicial order requiring the Wisconsin Elections Commission to tell local clerks that they must accept ballots as long as the witness address includes enough information that clerks can reasonably discern where the witness can be contacted. The day after the group filed the lawsuit, its attorneys asked Judge Juan Colas to issue a temporary injunction mandating that the commission issue that guidance to clerks. Colas refused to issue the order during a hearing Friday morning, online court records indicate. The case will continue with a scheduling conference set for Oct. 17. Rise Inc., which encourages students to vote, sued after a Waukesha County judge last month sided with Republicans and said clerks are barred from filling in missing witness information on ballot envelopes.

The park has pushed back the road’s opening date from Oct. 15 to Nov. 1, according to the newspaper, as park officials said they need more time to ensure that over 5,000 feet of guardrail are properly installed for traffic safety. “We have set incredibly aggressive time frames for these repairs, and our contractors have worked at lightning speed to get this road safely reopened,” Yellowstone National Park Superintendent Cam Sholly said in a news release. “It’s essential that we do not cut corners and we ensure the road meets required safety standards prior to opening.” Unprecedented flooding in June severely damaged roads, swept away homes and forced the park to close as it evacuated about 10,000 visitors. The National Park Service said the most significant damage occurred at the Yellowstone’s north and northeast entrances, where access was cut off. The flooding washed out segments of the roadway between the north entrance and Mammoth Hot Springs. To reconnect the two areas, authorities have paved and expanded an old stagecoach route from the 1880s called Old Gardiner Road.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2023/04/18/oklahoma-city-bombing-victims-names-and-faces/5929605001/", "title": "Oklahoma City bombing victims: The names and faces", "text": "The Oklahoman\n\nUSAToday Network\n\nThe Oklahoma City bombing committed by Timothy McVeigh killed 168 people.

Bolden is survived by a 21-year-old daughter and two sons, Ricky Hill, 13, and Jonathan, 11. The 15-year Army veteran worked in the fourth-floor recruiting station in the federal building. The single mother had transferred from Colorado to Oklahoma in January. Her son Ricky described his mother as kind and funny, and said she would have pillow fights and \"stuff\" with her kids.\n\nKaren Gist Carr\n\nKaren Gist Carr was a \"people\" person who embraced life. \"She just made living a 24-hour vocation,\" said the Rev. Leslie Brown, pastor of First Christian Church in Midwest City, where Carr attended. Carr, 32, was an advertising assistant for the Army recruiting office. In addition to her full-time job, she was an aerobics instructor at the Downtown YMCA and at Rose State College. She also was a member of the Mid-Del Toastmasters Club. Carr and her husband, Gregory Carr, had just celebrated their eighth anniversary eight days before she was killed in the explosion.\n\nPeggy Louise Holland\n\nA Kentucky native Peggy Louise Holland, 37, became a welcome addition to the Oklahoma City area in 1987 when she assumed responsibilities in public information and command information programs for the Army. Most recently a computer specialist for the Army Recruiting Battalion in Oklahoma City, Holland gave much of her time to children at Knob Hill Baptist Church as a Sunday school teacher, children's choir teacher and vacation Bible school teacher. She was also secretary of the Coolidge Eyes and Ears Neighborhood Watch Association. She and her husband Richard have two children, Erica and Kylie.\n\nJohn C. Moss III\n\n\"He was very good at his job; he had found his niche. And he was very happy in Oklahoma City,\" the sister of John C. Moss III said. Moss, 50, was a civilian employee in the Army recruiting office where he served as chief of public affairs. \"He was a funny, witty, popular man who had a lot of friends,\" his sister, Marjorie Moss Hendrix, said. Moss played football at Warren High School, where he graduated in 1961. While serving in Vietnam as a Marine, he was burned when a fuel tank exploded. \"He survived that and a lot of other close calls,\" Hendrix said. He had been a civilian employee for the Army the past 16 years after a brief stint as a high school English teacher.\n\nVictoria Lee Sohn\n\nShe had an \"illustrious career,\" giving 16 years to the service of her country, and was remembered with outstanding compliments. \"Placing all others' needs above her own, she unselfishly gave her care and concern to all whose lives she touched,\" read the obituary for Master Sgt. Victoria Lee Sohn, 36, of Moore. \"Vickey was a perfectionist, striving for and achieving a level of accomplishment surpassed by none.\" Sohn is survived by her husband, Sgt. 1st Class Gregory P. Sohn. She also is survived by her five children, Gregory Jr., Jessica, Stephen, Victoria Marie and John Michael. \"Vickey, above all else was a beloved wife, and a devoted mother of five children.\"\n\nDolores M.

However, we are hopeful that we – the current generation of the Meaher family – can start a new chapter,” said the statement, which came amid the release of “Descendant,” a new documentary about the people who were brought to the United States aboard the slave ship Clotilda and their families. The film was acquired by Netflix and Higher Ground, the production company of Barack and Michelle Obama. The Meaher family has started meeting with leaders of the community in and around Africatown, the community begun by the Africans in north Mobile after they were released from slavery in 1865, the statement said. Clotilda Descendants Association President Jeremy Ellis said the organization had been in contact with the Meaher family by email, and members hope for face-to-face talks.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Republican U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski said Alaskans want results, not “partisan political rhetoric,” as she faced Donald Trump-backed Republican rival Kelly Tshibaka in a televised debate Thursday. Tshibaka questioned the value of Murkowski’s seniority and said it’s time for a change. Murkowski “cannot accomplish in the next six years what she hasn’t been able to accomplish in the last 21 years,” Tshibaka said. Murkowski, who has held the seat since late 2002 and is the most senior member of Alaska’s congressional delegation, said the race is about “who can best deliver for Alaska.” She pointed to and defended her record. The debate, held less than two weeks before the Nov. 8 ranked-choice election, also included Democrat Pat Chesbro, who has significantly trailed Murkowski and Tshibaka in fundraising. The other candidate on the ballot, Republican Buzz Kelley, who finished fourth in the August primary, last month suspended his campaign and endorsed Tshibaka. Trump, who came to Alaska in July for a rally with Tshibaka and Sarah Palin, whose U.S. House run he’s endorsed, participated in a tele-rally for Tshibaka last week. He called Murkowski “one of the worst senators even imaginable,” criticizing her for voting for the “insane impeachment” and for opposing Brett Kavanaugh’s U.S. Supreme Court nomination.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A federal judge refused Friday to bar a group from monitoring outdoor ballot boxes in Maricopa County – where watchers have shown up armed and in ballistic vests – saying to do so could violate the monitors’ constitutional rights. U.S. District Court Judge Michael Liburdi said the case remained open, and the Arizona Alliance for Retired Americans could try again to make its argument against a group calling itself Clean Elections USA. A second plaintiff, Voto Latino, was removed from the case. Liburdi concluded that “while this case certainly presents serious questions, the Court cannot craft an injunction without violating the First Amendment.” The judge is a Trump appointee and a member of the Federalist Society, a conservative legal organization. Local and federal law enforcement have been alarmed by reports of people, some masked and armed, watching 24-hour ballot boxes in Maricopa County and rural Yavapai County as midterm elections near. Some voters have complained of voter intimidation after people watching the boxes took photos and videos and followed voters. “Plaintiffs have not provided the Court with any evidence that Defendants’ conduct constitutes a true threat,” the judge wrote. “On this record, Defendants have not made any statements threatening to commit acts of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals.”\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: Students from Northside High School have made bed frames for children in need. The city’s school district, Rotary Club of Fort Smith, the Community Rescue Mission, and the Sleep in Heavenly Peace organization joined forces on the hand-crafted bed construction project. According to SHP, 3% of children ages 3-17 nationwide do not have a bed in which to sleep. On Friday, 25 students from Northside’s construction class put their knowledge and skills to work in an effort to build beds for needy children. The SHP organization will deliver 30 new beds, along with mattresses and bedding, to area homes. “This project gives our students a chance to serve their community while enhancing their skill set,” Fort Smith Public Schools Superintendent Terry Morawski said. Fort Smith Rotary Club volunteer member Ken Colley said his group was “very excited” to lend a hand. “No kid should sleep on the floor in our town,” Colley said. “Studies have shown that if a child has a good night’s sleep, they will be much more apt to stay alert in the classroom and be able to focus and remember what they learn.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A man who spent more than 38 years behind bars for a 1983 murder and two attempted murders has been released from prison after long-untested DNA evidence pointed to a different person, the Los Angeles County district attorney said Friday. The conviction of Maurice Hastings, 69, and a life sentence were vacated during an Oct. 20 court hearing at the request of prosecutors and his lawyers from the Los Angeles Innocence Project at California State University, Los Angeles. “I prayed for many years that this day would come,” Hastings said at a news conference Friday. “I am not pointing fingers. I am not standing up here a bitter man, but I just want to enjoy my life now while I have it.” “What has happened to Mr. Hastings is a terrible injustice,” District Attorney George Gascón said in a statement. “The justice system is not perfect, and when we learn of new evidence which causes us to lose confidence in a conviction, it is our obligation to act swiftly.” The victim in the case, Roberta Wydermyer, was sexually assaulted and killed by a single gunshot to the head, authorities said. Her body was found in the trunk of her vehicle in the Los Angeles suburb of Inglewood. A suspect identified through DNA testing last year had died in prison in 2020, according to state officials.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A wildfire that destroyed nearly 1,100 homes and businesses in suburban Denver last winter caused more than $2 billion in losses, making it by far the costliest in Colorado history, the state insurance commissioner said. Commissioner Michael Conway provided the updated estimate this month during a meeting with residents who lost homes to the so-called Marshall Fire in Boulder County and other Colorado wildfires in recent years, The Denver Post reports. The Boulder County fire broke out unusually late in December following months of drought and is blamed for at least one death. Official estimates released days after the fire put the losses at more than $500 million. Experts say the winter grassland fire that blew up along Colorado’s Front Range was rare, but similar events will be more common in the coming years as climate change warms the planet, sucking the moisture out of plants, and as suburbs grow in fire-prone areas. Conway said additional insurance claims and assessments of the scope of rebuilding from the wildfire prompted the new estimate. “We’re estimating now it will be $2 billion in claims if not more,” he told residents. Investigators have yet to determine what caused the Dec. 30 fire, which was fed by winds up to 100 mph and raced from the Rocky Mountain foothills eastward through unincorporated Boulder County and into the cities of Superior and Louisville.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: As part of his campaign to win over blue state voters, the Republican candidate for governor, Bob Stefanowski, is trying to capitalize on any lingering resentment over safety precautions taken at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Earlier this month, the businessman pledged never to mandate COVID-19 vaccines for schoolchildren, joining Republicans who made similar promises after a national panel advised the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to add the shots to lists of recommended vaccinations for kids and adults. Stefanowski has complained that the state’s old mask mandate in schools, which ended in most districts in late February after campuses were allowed to reopen for in-person learning with masks in August 2020, lasted too long. In his proposed “Parents’ Bill of Rights,” he said families shouldn’t be “forced by the government to vaccinate or mask their children without any recourse to object.” “It’s up to the person. They should have the choice,” Stefanowski said. Stefanowski’s opposition to mandatory COVID-19 vaccines for “public or private employees or anyone else” is in line with other Republicans who have campaigned this election season on promises to protect individual liberty in public health.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: President Joe Biden returned to his home state to cast his ballot for the midterm election Saturday afternoon. He was joined by his 18-year-old granddaughter Natalie, a first-time voter. The two arrived at the Shipyard Shops polling location on the Wilmington Riverfront at 4:15 p.m., a few hours after the president watched Natalie Biden’s field hockey game at St. Andrew’s in Middletown. The two of them walked through the doors of the polling place hand in hand after greeting a constituent leaving the building. Secret Service and local police officers were posted outside as the Bidens voted, drawing the attention of others who had come to vote early. They took photos and posted on social media, surprised to see the president there. When the Bidens emerged from the voting booths, White House staff said Joe and Natalie Biden placed “I Voted” stickers on each others’ shirts. The president then gave his granddaughter a kiss on the cheek. Joe and Natalie Biden join the more than 17,800 Delawareans who had voted either by mail or in person as of Friday afternoon, according to the Delaware Department of Elections. A department spokesperson said the official count would be updated Monday.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The chief White House groundskeeper as of this month has spent 50 years serving the families – and many of their pets – who have called the mansion home. Dale Haney’s chief responsibility in his post that has spanned 10 presidencies is to care for the vast lawns, colorful flower gardens, hundreds of trees, thousands of shrubs and burgeoning vegetable garden on 18 acres of property surrounding the White House. He also picks out the official White House Christmas tree every year. To honor Haney, President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, surprised Haney last Monday by planting an elm tree on the south grounds. Biden said visitors in future years are “going to be looking at this tree and asking, ‘Who’s Dale?’ ” Haney, 70, joked that he “might still be here.” But Haney is perhaps better known to many at the White House, from staff to Secret Service officers, as the keeper of the president’s pets. “He’s like the whisperer,” said Anita McBride, who was a young aide in the correspondence office in Ronald Reagan’s administration when she first met Haney. These days, Haney is often seen walking Commander, Biden’s German shepherd. Haney started at the White House in 1972 and said he originally planned to work there for just two years.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami Beach: An evacuation order has abruptly forced out residents of a 14-story oceanfront building on the same avenue where a condominium collapse killed nearly 100 people last year. The city posted an unsafe structure notice Thursday evening at the Port Royale condominium, Miami Beach spokesperson Melissa Berthier said in an email. A structural engineering report prompted the evacuation of the 164-unit structure, which is in the process of undergoing a required recertification. An engineer discovered that a main support beam identified for repair 10 months ago had shifted, and a crack in the beam had expanded, and other structural supports may need repair as well, the report said. One resident, renovation contractor Marash Markaj, who lived in the building for more than six years, said the damage extends beyond a single support beam. “I’ve seen the issues for many years,” Markaj told the Associated Press. He said he tried to report the issues – including cracks in a column and water standing in the garage area for weeks at a time – to the building management and to the city’s building department. “I was never able to get a response,” he said, adding that he was feeling “unsafe” living in the building and with the way the building’s maintenance was handled.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A man and his family “have faced threats of violence and live in fear” since the movie “2000 Mules” falsely accused him of ballot fraud during the 2020 election, according to a federal lawsuit. The widely debunked film includes surveillance video showing Mark Andrews, his face blurred, depositing five ballots in a drop box in downtown Lawrenceville, a suburb northeast of Atlanta. A voiceover by conservative pundit and filmmaker Dinesh D’Souza says: “What you are seeing is a crime. These are fraudulent votes.” In fact, a state investigation found, Andrews was dropping off ballots for himself, his wife and their three adult children, who all live at the same address. That is legal in Georgia, and a state investigator said there was no evidence of wrongdoing by Andrews. D’Souza’s film uses research from the Texas-based nonprofit True the Vote and suggests that ballot “mules” aligned with Democrats were paid to illegally collect and deliver ballots in Georgia and four other closely watched states. An Associated Press analysis found that it is based on faulty assumptions, anonymous accounts and improper analysis of cellphone location data. State and federal officials have repeatedly confirmed that there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud during the 2020 election that could have changed the outcome of the presidential race.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A former U.S. defense contractor in Hawaii accused with his wife of living for decades under stolen identities of dead babies will get a new attorney, a federal judge ruled Thursday. According to prosecutors, Walter Glenn Primrose and Gwynn Darle Morrison are the real names of the couple who have been fraudulently living for decades under stolen identities, Bobby Fort and Julie Montague. Prosecutors say Primrose spent more than 20 years in the Coast Guard, where he obtained secret-level security clearance. The couple have pleaded not guilty to conspiracy, false statement in a passport application and aggravated identity theft. Assistant Federal Defender Max Mizono filed a motion this month asking to withdraw as Primrose’s attorney, citing a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. During a telephone hearing Thursday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Rom Trader granted the request after a private conversation with Mizono and Primrose. Prosecutors have suggested the case is about more than identity theft. A search of the couple’s home in Kapolei, a Honolulu suburb, turned up Polaroids of them wearing jackets that appear to be authentic Russian KGB uniforms, an invisible ink kit, documents with coded language and maps showing military bases, prosecutors said. Attorneys for the couple have said they are not Russian spies.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state Supreme Court says it will not reconsider the clemency case of a terminally ill man who is facing execution for his role in the 1985 slayings of two gold prospectors near McCall. The high court made the decision Friday in Gerald Ross Pizzuto Jr.’s case. The decision means the state remains free to seek a death warrant for Pizzuto. Once issued, the warrant would set his execution by lethal injection in the next 30 days. Deborah A. Czuba, the head of the Federal Defender Services of Idaho’s capital case unit, said in a statement that the Idaho Supreme Court decision was disappointing. “There is still time for Gov. Brad Little to accept the recommendation of his parole commissioners and let Mr. Pizzuto die a natural death in prison,” Czuba said. “If not, our hope is that the State will have enough grace to wait at least until after the Thanksgiving and Christmas season before making Department of Correction employees participate in a needless and traumatizing execution during the holidays.” Pizzuto has spent more than three decades on death row and was originally scheduled to be put to death in June 2021. He asked for clemency last year because he has terminal bladder cancer, heart disease, diabetes and decreased intellectual function.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A mountain lion that roamed residential neighborhoods in the state capital was sedated Friday and taken to a sanctuary that houses big cats, the Illinois Department of Natural Resources said. The young male cat was tranquilized by staff with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Wildlife Services branch and sent to the Exotic Feline Rescue Center in Center Point, Indiana, the state agency said. IDNR wildlife experts, Illinois Conservation Police, the USDA and the Springfield Police Department determined the animal had entered areas of the city where he would be a threat to people or property. The animal, which was fitted last year with a GPS collar by the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, had wandered to Illinois from Nebraska. It arrived in Springfield on Wednesday, and IDNR warned residents not to disturb it while the agency tracked its movements. The DNR asked people to leave the mountain lion alone because the animals are a protected species in Illinois, and it’s illegal to kill them unless they pose an imminent threat to person or property. Its appearance in Springfield marks the second time in recent weeks a mountain lion has been detected in Illinois. The DNR said a mountain lion was struck and killed Oct. 16 by a vehicle along Interstate 88 in DeKalb County.\n\nIndiana\n\nCrown Point: A fifth grade teacher in northwestern Indiana charged with felony intimidation after authorities say she told a student she had a “kill list” of students and staff has agreed to stay away from the school. Angelica Carrasquillo, 25, of Griffith, signed a no-contact order Friday without objection when she appeared wearing a green jail uniform in Lake Superior Court, The Times of Northwest Indiana reports. Judge Kathleen Lang affirmed Carrasquillo’s not guilty plea to one felony count of intimidation. Carrasquillo was being held with a bond set at $20,000 surety or $2,000 cash. Court documents say Carrasquillo communicated “a threat to commit murder” on Oct. 12. Once officials at the school where she was employed, St. Stanislaus in East Chicago, learned of the threat, they immediately confronted her and escorted her from the building, the Diocese of Gary said in a message to parents. When Carrasquillo was asked why she wanted to kill herself and others, she reportedly told school officials: “I’m having trouble with my mental health, and sometimes the kids do not listen in the classroom. I also have trauma caused when I went to high school.” But Carrasquillo also allegedly told school officials that “she was only joking about it all.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A judge should allow a law passed in 2018 that bans most abortions to take effect, three years after the measure was ruled unconstitutional, lawyers for Gov. Kim Reynolds argued Friday. Chris Schandevel, a lawyer for the Republican governor, said Judge Celene Gogerty should set aside a 2019 permanent injunction that prevented Iowa from enforcing a law that would block abortions once cardiac activity can be detected. That is usually around six weeks into pregnancy and before many women know they’re pregnant. Schandevel said the injunction rests entirely on an Iowa Supreme Court 2018 decision that guaranteed the right to an abortion under the state constitution and cases decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1992 and 1973 that established abortion rights nationally. All three cases were overruled this year by more conservative courts, and given that, Reynolds’ lawyers argued the judge should reverse the injunction and let the 2018 law take effect. Rita Bettis Austen, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa, countered that there is no precedent or legal support in Iowa for a judge to reverse a final judgment entered three years ago. The judge said she would issue a ruling soon.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Voters are being asked to reduce the authority of the governor and other state officials and give legislators a bigger say in how the state regulates businesses, protects the environment and preserves residents’ health. A proposed amendment to the Kansas Constitution on the Nov. 8 ballot would make it easier for the Republican-controlled Legislature to overturn regulations written by state agencies and boards – those under the control of the governor but also others in the executive branch of state government. At issue are rules as varied as which shots are required for children attending school and how often hotels must clean guest rooms. Business groups and advocates of smaller government view the measure as reining in unelected bureaucrats. But in the fall campaign’s final weeks, abortion rights advocates have begun warning that it is another attempted power grab by far-right legislators. The November vote comes three months after voters overwhelmingly rejected a proposed amendment to eliminate state constitutional protections for abortion and give lawmakers authority to more tightly regulate or ban the procedure. Those who oppose the regulation amendment have repurposed the “vote no” yard signs from the abortion vote for their fall campaign.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Jefferson County Public Schools has received the largest gift in its history, according to the district, with plans to invest the funds in some of the city’s most disadvantaged schools. A total of $20 million was put forward by philanthropist MacKenzie Scott for Louisville’s public school district, officials said at a press conference Thursday. The money will go toward “direct financial support for JCPS,” district officials said in a release. JCPS Superintendent Marty Pollio said the gift came following an interview with a consulting firm that represents several unnamed philanthropists. Three months later, he said, Scott’s team called to tell him about the planned donation to JCPS. “We also promised this community that we would fund the schools in an appropriate way so that the families in this community would have equity in selection,” Pollio said at the event at the Academy @ Shawnee in Louisville’s West End. “You can’t go to a high-poverty school across America and see something like this.” Pollio said the $20 million influx in cash will help address growing inequity in supplemental funding – cash that schools receive through parent-teacher associations, athletic events, booster clubs and alumni associations.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Roads: Authorities are looking for a stolen sign marking a centuries-old tree that inspired author Ernest Gaines. The Pointe Coupee Parish Sheriff’s Office said the historical marker identifying the “Miss Jane Pittman Oak” was stolen recently, and the parish government is offering a $500 reward for information leading to its recovery or the thief’s arrest, news outlets report. The tree itself, believed to be about 400 years old, served as partial inspiration for “The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman,” which gained widespread notice for the internationally acclaimed, award-winning author. The book describes a first-person narrative of a fictional 110-year-old woman born into slavery. Historians have said Gaines regularly walked past the oak tree, which sits along Louisiana Highway 16 in Lakeland, a village in the parish, on his way to the grocery store. In 2008, state officials considered cutting down the oak because its low-hanging branches posed a potential threat to passing cars. But the state ultimately relented amid pushback from Gaines and other activists, opting instead to trim the branches. Tips leading to an arrest or recovery of the marker should be directed to the sheriff’s office at 225-694-3737. Gaines, who died in 2019 at age 86, will be depicted on a stamp next year, the U.S. Postal Service announced last week.\n\nMaine\n\nHallowell: The Maine Public Utilities Commission on Wednesday approved a pair of energy projects that would generate enough wind power for up to 900,000 homes along with construction of a new transmission corridor to get the electricity to the regional power grid. The PUC was required by law to choose the projects to boost transmission capacity and renewable energy in Aroostook County. It chose LS Power Base for a 345-kilovolt transmission project and Longroad Energy’s King Pine for a wind generation project, but it didn’t rule on how how much of the cost would be borne by Maine ratepayers. Together, the net cost of the projects is $1.8 billion over a 30-year period, but they would benefit the state, officials said. An influx of energy into the regional grid would “place downward pressure on electricity prices, benefitting consumers in Maine and throughout New England,” said PUC Chair Philip L. Bartlett II. It’s a similar to the proposed 145-mile transmission line that would be a conduit for 1,200 megawatts of Canadian hydropower to the New England power grid, but it would serve a different purpose. State voters rebuked the New England Clean Energy Connect last November, and work was halted pending the outcome of a lawsuit.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Two legislators have called for an independent review of the state Department of Natural Resources’ handling of repeated complaints against the former manager at Gunpowder Falls State Park. A Baltimore County grand jury indicted former longtime manager Michael Browning last Monday on charges that include rape and assault. The Baltimore Sun reports that state Sen. Sarah Elfreth and Del. Eric Luedtke called for the review in a letter to Jeannie Haddaway-Riccio, Maryland’s secretary of natural resources. “The behavior and lack of accountability described is inexcusable and requires prompt action by the Department to address the issues raised and ensure that a similar situation never happens again,” the letter says. Baltimore County Police arrested Browning, 71, in September and charged him with sexually assaulting a former park employee. According to charging documents, the woman told police she met Browning as a teenager while attending a youth club his wife ran before working with Browning at the park. Police wrote in charging documents that the two had a yearslong consensual relationship. The woman told police that she tried to end the relationship and that Browning raped her 10 to 15 times.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Police and school officials are trying to figure out how a 7-year-old child managed to bring a loaded gun to school. Police responded to UP Academy Holland in the city’s Dorchester neighborhood about 3:30 p.m. Thursday for a report of a student with a firearm, police said in a statement on the department’s website. Responding officers confiscated the weapon. No injuries were reported. “I’m speechless. I don’t have the words. This is truly devastating,” Boston Public Schools Superintendent Mary Skipper said in a statement. “We have to ask ourselves how a very young student becomes in possession of and gains access to a firearm.” Mayor Michelle Wu pledged to hold the person who allowed the child access to the gun accountable. “No child should be near a weapon, much less directly endangered at such a young age,” she said. No additional information was released. “The Boston Police Department is focused on the proliferation of guns in our city and keeping access to them away from the youngest among us needs to be a priority for everyone,” Police Commissioner Michael Cox said. The school has about 770 students from kindergarten through fifth grade, according to its website. Police are still investigating.\n\nMichigan\n\nWyandotte:There’s nothing sweet about bringing home a cockroach, so trick-or-treating is off limits in a suburban Detroit neighborhood. Officials in Wyandotte said a cockroach infestation has been confirmed at a vacant home after a tip from a trash hauler. The pests have been moving to other homes. Sidewalks will be closed Monday night on a portion of 20th Street. City engineer Greg Mayhew said a Halloween ban will prevent “further roach migration.” Officials don’t want the bugs hitching a ride on costumes. The city is trying to exterminate the roaches, but “it will take some time,” Mayhew said. Walking the street could help kill the cockroaches, but their eggs still could spread and survive, City Council member Todd Hanna said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Election officials held a public demonstration of voting machines Friday as part of an effort to maintain public trust and transparency in election systems that have drawn coordinated attacks from ex-President Donald Trump and others. Minneapolis Director of Elections and Voter Services Katie Smith showed election judges from around the city how to test the voting equipment: Turn on the tabulator machine, feed the pre-marked set of test ballots into the machine, print off the results, and make sure the results exactly match the ballots. More than two dozen people tested the tabulator machines and assistive voting devices – which help voters zoom in, print and read their ballots with Braille, if needed – at the demonstration at the city’s election and voter services building. Smith said the public accuracy test, which is required under state law, is important because it lets members of the public see their votes are going to be correctly and accurately counted on election night. Around the country, some voters have expressed skepticism about election systems since Trump and others have falsely claimed that widespread voter fraud led to President Joe Biden being elected. After nearly two years, no evidence has shown that voting machines were manipulated to steal the 2020 election or that there was any widespread fraud.\n\nMississippi\n\nMound Bayou: The tiny, all-Black town of Mound Bayou became a safe haven for Emmett Till’s mother as she traveled to Mississippi to testify in the murder trial of two white men who lynched her son in 1955. Hundreds of people – a good portion of Mound Bayou’s 1,500 residents – turned out Thursday evening to watch the movie “Till.” The feature film went into wide release across the U.S. over the weekend after being in limited release since Oct. 14. “This place, this city, is very sacred to the story of Emmett Till,” one of the filmmakers, Keith Beauchamp, told the mostly Black audience in the gymnasium/auditorium of Mound Bayou’s John F. Kennedy High School. The screening happened days after a bronze statue of Till was unveiled about 50 miles away in Greenwood. Beauchamp is one of the producers and writers of “Till,” which largely focuses on Mamie Till-Mobley’s reaction to the loss of her only child and her evolution into a civil rights leader. Mound Bayou was founded by formerly enslaved people in the cotton-growing Mississippi Delta in 1887 as a freestanding community where Black people could thrive amid the hostility of the Jim Crow era.\n\nMissouri\n\nFlorissant: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has completed testing inside a school closed amid concerns of radioactive contamination, and sampling of soil outside the school has begun, Corps officials said Friday. A suburban St. Louis school board voted last week to close Jana Elementary School in Florissant after testing by a private firm found levels of radioactive isotope lead-210 that were 22 times the expected level on the kindergarten playground. It also found high levels of polonium, radium and other material inside the school, which sits along Coldwater Creek, contaminated decades ago with Manhattan Project atomic waste. The Corps said in a news release that radiation detection instruments were used to scan surfaces inside the school. Sampling of soil outside the school is expected to go on for another two weeks, the Corps said. The agency plans to sample at least 45 spots, with depths ranging from 15 to 28 feet below the surface. Preliminary test results are expected in November. The approximate 400 students at Jana Elementary are taking virtual classes for the next month, then will be reassigned to other schools. Coldwater Creek was contaminated in the 1940s and 1950s when waste from atomic bomb material manufactured in St. Louis got into the waterway near Lambert Airport, where the waste was stored. The result was an environmental nightmare that resulted in a Superfund declaration in 1989.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Two conservation groups have filed a lawsuit against the state and its wildlife management agency, alleging it illegally set hunting and trapping policies and quotas intended to reduce the gray wolf population by making it easier to kill the predators. WildEarth Guardians and Project Coyote filed the lawsuit Thursday in District Court in Helena asking for the new laws and resulting increased quotas to be overturned. Montana’s Republican-controlled Legislature in 2021 passed bills that allowed the state to reduce the wolf population, authorize additional hunting methods, allow extended hunting seasons, allow an individual to kill up to 20 wolves, and allow private parties to offer bounties for hunting or trapping wolves. The conservation groups allege management decisions are being made based on a wolf plan that was created in 2002 and was amended to use a new wolf population model without following state rulemaking procedures and without public participation. The state Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks does not comment on pending litigation, spokesperson Greg Lemon said Friday. Montana officials authorized the killing of 450 wolves during the winter of 2021-22 but ended up shutting down hunting near Yellowstone National Park after 23 wolves from the park were killed, all but five in Montana.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Dueling lawsuits have been dropped by a former candidate for governor and a fellow Republican state lawmaker who accused him of groping her at a political function several years ago. Charles W. Herbster, who lost his bid in May to become the GOP nominee for governor despite an early endorsement from ex-President Donald Trump, sued state Sen. Julie Slama for defamation after she told the Nebraska Examiner that, in 2019, Herbster reached under her skirt and groped her at the Douglas County Republican Party event when she was 22. Slama was one of eight women who accused Herbster of unwanted groping, but Slama was the only one to go on the record with her name. Herbster denied the allegations and painted them as a politically motivated attack. Slama quickly countersued, accusing Herbster of sexual battery. The competing lawsuits had largely stalled in the months since being filed, with both sides seeking delays. Online court records show that both sides on Wednesday submitted motions to dismiss their lawsuits with prejudice, meaning they can’t be refiled. On Thursday, the judge granted the motion. Neither the motion nor the judge’s order addressed why the parties sought to dismiss their respective lawsuits.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A rural county roiled by voting machine conspiracy theories stopped its unprecedented effort Friday to hand-count ballots cast in advance of Election Day. But Nye County officials vowed to reshape their plan and seek another go-ahead from the Nevada Supreme Court, after justices ruled late Thursday that counting methods used last week violated rules they set to prevent the county from allowing early disclosure of election results. “Yesterday’s Supreme Court order requires us to make some changes to our hand count process,” Nye County officials said in a statement issued Friday that promised to “resume as soon as our plan is in compliance with the court’s order and approved by the secretary of state.” Lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada said they stood ready to challenge any effort to restart the hand tallies this week and don’t believe there’s any hand-counting scenario that would pass legal muster. The civil rights advocacy group accused Nye County officials of failing to prevent public release of early results before polls close to in-person voting Nov. 8. It argued that reading candidates’ names aloud from ballots within hearing distance of public observers violated the court rule.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Democratic U.S. Rep. Annie Kuster and Republican challenger Robert Burns frequently took jabs and interrupted one another over COVID-19 funding, drug addiction treatment and abortion rights during their first debate Friday for New Hampshire’s 2nd Congressional District seat. Burns said many companies are suffering now because of reckless government spending. “My opponent here talks about the need for the federal government to help build businesses ... I built my business without the help of the federal government,” said Burns, who runs a quality control and pharmaceutical safety company in Bedford. “That’s not true when you consider the Paycheck Protection loan that you took,” Kuster said. Burns responded: “That was 10 years later.” Kuster expressed her support for suboxone medication to treat opioid addiction, saying it is helping her own brother. Burns said statistics have shown that isn’t true and accused her campaign of being funded by its manufacturers. Burns, who says he is pro-life and supported the overturn of Roe v. Wade, was asked to clarify his proposal to form “panels” that would require a second and third opinion when a woman, in his words, is “being forced to have an abortion.” Burns said “probably misspoke a little bit” in his use of the word “panel” and said he was referring to the mental health of the mother.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nFreehold Borough: A “significant” piece of historic artwork depicting George Washington at the Battle of Monmouth may be sold by the Monmouth County Historical Association for millions of dollars, drawing opposition from historians who claim the MCHA museum would lose a valuable piece of history. Titled “Washington Rallying the Troops at Monmouth,” the painting by Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze, a legendary German artist, dates to 1857. It recreates Washington’s involvement in the historic battle that occurred in June 1778. “I think it would be pathetically tragic to sell one of the key pieces of the association’s major collection,” said Joe Hammond, a former curator of the MCHA museum and one-time director of the association. “It is a regional collection of national significance, and the painting of Washington rallying the troops at Monmouth is one of the most significant.” But with a price tag that could reach tens of millions of dollars, MCHA officials contend it is worth investigating a potential sale. The new interest is likely the result of a recent multimillion-dollar sale of another Washington painting by Leutze. His famed “Washington Crossing the Delaware” piece fetched more than $45 million in May, according to Christie’s.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The FBI confirmed Friday that it is investigating a report from a Santa Fe-based environmental advocacy group that it received mail containing antisemitic imagery and a suspicious powdery substance inside. FBI spokesman Frank Fisher said in an email that the substance was tested and determined not to be harmful. Further details were not being released in order to protect the integrity the investigation, he said. Conservation Voters New Mexico Executive Director Demis Foster said the group received an envelope Wednesday in the mail that included a brown, powdery substance inside along with a torn-up political flier that the group distributed in support of a Democratic state House representative who is running for reelection. The mail included a reference to the Nazi Party, a swastika and other antisemitic symbols, Foster said. She said first responders including police evacuated the building, and an employee who opened the mail was released unharmed from a hospital after undergoing observation. Foster said she and her employees are working remotely as a precaution, while continuing their advocacy for environmental causes and endorsed political candidates.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The Rev. Calvin O. Butts III, who fought poverty and racism and skillfully navigated New York’s power structure as pastor of Harlem’s historic Abyssinian Baptist Church, died Friday at age 73, the church announced. “The Butts Family and entire Abyssinian Baptist Church membership solicit your prayers for us in our bereavement,” the church said on its website. No cause of death was given. Butts began serving as a youth minister at Abyssinian in 1972 and was senior pastor there for more than 30 years. He also served as president of the State University of New York at Old Westbury, on Long Island, from 1999 to 2020. His post at Abyssinian gave Butts one of the most prominent pulpits in the U.S. The church traces its roots to 1808 when a group of Black worshippers who refused to accept segregation at the First Baptist Church of New York City left to form their own congregation. The church’s current home on 138th Street in Harlem is a massive Tudor and Gothic revival structure dedicated in 1923 and designated a city landmark in 1993. Earlier pastors at Abyssinian included Adam Clayton Powell Sr. and his son Adam Clayton Powell Jr., the first African American to be elected to Congress from New York.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The two North Carolina Supreme Court seats up for election in November have taken on extra significance as the outcome could flip the court’s partisan makeup during a period of political polarization. Registered Democrats hold a 4-3 advantage on the court, but Republicans would retake the majority for the first time since 2016 should they win at least one race. The seats carry eight-year terms, so barring unplanned retirements, Republicans would be assured of keeping the upper hand for at least 41/ 2 years if successful. Outside groups are spending big to influence the races. In the two largest television markets alone, two super PACs have committed spending roughly $3 million on ads, according to documents filed with the Federal Communications Commission. In keeping with nonjudicial elections this year, ads have focused on crime and abortion.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state auditor said Thursday that an examination of North Dakota’s electoral systems conducted in response to voter concerns found that they are “incredibly secure.” Auditor Josh Gallion said he undertook the review in response to concerns nationally that false claims of election fraud and conspiracies are threats to democracy. “We looked at any potential weaknesses in the election system of our state that could be exploited by someone with nefarious intent,” Gallion said. “The determination after extensive review from our contractor was that our election systems are incredibly secure across our state.” The review found six vulnerabilities to the state’s election system but all were labeled “low risk,” Gallion said. The report identified the vulnerabilities as the the ability for a voter to cast multiple ballots, identity theft of deceased voters, stuffing or discarding valid absentee ballots, equipment tampering, and absentee ballot fraud. Gallion said his office received many inquiries from residents and others about North Dakota’s election security following the 2020 election, fueled by former President Donald Trump’s false claims of election fraud. One inquiry came from MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, who has echoed lies that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The first major retrospective of artist Maurice Sendak’s work since his 2012 death – and the largest and most complete to date – opened this month at the Columbus Museum of Art and runs through March 5, 2023. Most people today know Sendak as the creator of children’s book classics such as “Where the Wild Things Are” and “In the Night Kitchen.” A new exhibition of his work looks at that reputation and a less well-known side of his immense output: his work as a designer for opera, theater, film, and television. “We wanted people to understand that Maurice was actually a serious artist,” said Lynn Caponera, executive director of the Maurice Sendak Foundation in Ridgefield, Connecticut. Though most knew him as an illustrator and picture book artist, “they didn’t see beyond the fact that he did a lot more than that,” she said. “Wild Things are Happening” opened this month at the Columbus Museum of Art and runs through March 5, 2023. It’s the first major retrospective of Sendak’s work since his 2012 death and the largest and most complete to date. The exhibit takes its name from a 1990s advertising campaign Sendak did for Bell Atlantic that featured Wild Things characters promoting “a fast, dependable Internet service.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nBroken Arrow: The deaths of eight family members – including six children found in a burning Oklahoma home – are being investigated as a murder-suicide, authorities said Friday. Police are trying to determine whether both adults were involved in the killings. The children, who ranged in age from 1 to 13, were the victims, Broken Arrow Police Chief Brandon Berryhill said during a news conference. He did not provide their identities, ages or explain their relationships to one another except to say they were family members believed to be living in the home. Police said both adults who live in the home were considered “primary suspects” because they were found dead in the front of the home while the children were all found in a bedroom, where the fire was contained. A police spokesman declined to say whether authorities believe the two adults were both responsible for the killings or whether it could be just one of them. “It’s because investigators are still trying to piece together what happened with eight people dead,” police spokesman Ethan Hutchins said in an email to the Associated Press. Hutchins also said police would not be able to identify the dead adults until the medical examiner’s office has completed its work.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials in the Trump administration compiled extensive intelligence dossiers on people who were arrested, even for minor offenses, during Black Lives Matter protests in Oregon. Initial drafts of the dossiers even included friends of the subjects as well as their interests, but those were later removed and replaced with a note that they would be made available upon request, according to an internal review by the Department of Homeland Security. The dossiers, known by agents as baseball cards, were previously normally compiled on non-U.S. citizens or only on Americans with “a demonstrated terrorism nexus,” according to the 76-page report. It was previously released last year but contains new revelations based on extensive redactions that were removed by the Biden administration. Ben Wizner, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union’s free speech, privacy and technology project, said the report indicates leaders of the Department of Homeland Security wanted to inflate the risk caused by protesters in Portland. The city became an epicenter of sometimes violent demonstrations in the wake of the killing of George Floyd, a Black man, by a Minneapolis police officer. But many protesters, including women belonging to a “Wall of Moms” ad hoc group and military veterans, were peaceful.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: Authorities say they have recovered a gun believed to have been thrown off a bridge by a suspect after a shooting that injured six people, one critically, outside a church where a funeral was being held. Pittsburgh Public Safety officials said a river rescue team working off the McKees Rocks Bridge on Sunday morning was able to locate a firearm matching the description of the firearm used in Friday’s shooting outside Destiny of Faith Church. Officials said the weapon found had a bullet in the chamber and had been reported stolen in Shaler Township. Nineteen-year-old Shawn Davis of McKees Rocks and a 16-year-old Pittsburgh youth are both charged with attempted homicide, aggravated assault and weapons counts in the noontime gunfire Friday outside the church where a funeral was being held for a man killed in a shooting earlier this month. The service was being livestreamed, and the video showed several people screaming and ducking for cover. It wasn’t clear if any shots went into the church. One person was taken to a hospital in critical condition while four other shooting victims were listed as stable. A sixth person injured trying to escape was also treated.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Backed by Brown University, Vartan Gregorian Elementary School has opened a hands-on, interactive classroom meant to help students explore science, technology, engineering, art and math in a fresh new space. Three groups of fourth and fifth graders were assigned a challenge Friday to figure out a way to raise a tiny flag using three machines and six chain reactions – without electricity. After a couple of false starts, fifth grader Noelle Ingle’s team propelled a tiny ball down a ramp, which struck a series of matchbox cars, which raised a card-size version of the Brown University flag. The room erupted in cheers. The Rube Goldberg machine was the first experiment in Gregorian’s new STEAM lab. Brown University spent approximately $200,000 renovating the dingy third grade classroom, installing new windows, floors and a sink and buying new furniture, including ricochet stools that allow students to wiggle while seated. The university also purchased whiteboards, a smart television and a microscope with up to 1,200x magnification. The shelves are already filled with robot and model car kits, magnetic play tiles and Legos. Brown has had a decades­long partnership with the elementary school, named after Vartan Gregorian, Brown’s larger-than-life president, who served from 1989 to 1997 and died April 15.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Officials are scheduled to vote Tuesday on a resolution that would restrict children from accessing public library books and electronic materials that are “promoting sexuality.” Local news outlets report the proposed Greenville County Council measure would direct trustees of the Greenville County Library System to order books and electronic materials removed from the county’s 12 libraries. The resolution also orders the library trustees to report “how such books ever found their way into the children’s sections of our public libraries” and to say how they will prevent them returning. As is true nationwide, controversies over materials dealing with LGBTQ and racial themes have been roiling South Carolina schools and public libraries for a year, particularly in the heavily Republican Upstate region. A large number of opponents spoke against restricting books during a Greenville County Council meeting in September, saying it targets books with LGBTQ themes. “These materials are not innately sexualized, they are not innately about sex, they are just about who we are and those should continue to exist,” Tyler Prescott of the Upstate LGBTQ+ Chamber of Commerce told councilors then. Republican Councilor Joe Dill, who is sponsoring the resolution, said in September that the county needs to also consider other people who are offended.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Two critically endangered red wolves have arrived at the Great Plains Zoo from facilities in Texas and Washington. There are fewer than two dozen red wolves living in the wild, the zoo said in a press release, making them the most endangered canid species in the world. The wolves’ placement at zoo is part of a species survival plan, which aims to breed pairs with the greatest possible genetic diversity. “With only around 20 individuals remaining in the wild, the survival of the red wolf species is contingent the concerted help of accredited zoos and conservation partners with species survival breeding and reintroduction plans,” CEO Becky Dewitz said in a statement. “Weare grateful and dedicated to helping save the red wolf from extinction.” The male and female wolves are still getting used to each other and their new habitat, so the path by their enclosure will be blocked for ZooBoo, which takes place this Friday through Sunday. The zoo asks patrons respect the barricades as the wolves adjust.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The Tennessee Historical Commission is taking applications for awards to honor people or groups that work to study and preserve the state’s heritage. The commission said Thursday that its Certificates of Merit are presented each May, during National Preservation Month. The deadline for submissions is Dec. 31. Patrick McIntyre, State Historic Preservation Officer and executive director of the commission, said the awards program “highlights people and organizations for the work they do in the areas of publication, commemoration, and education regarding our state’s unique history and heritage.” “For 47 years our awards program has offered an opportunity to give thanks and recognition to those working to champion and revitalize Tennessee’s historic places,” McIntyre said. Applications can be found on the commission’s website.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state police chief said Thursday that his department “did not fail” Uvalde during the hesitant law enforcement response to the Robb Elementary School shooting, as a Republican congressman joined angry parents of some of the 19 children killed in the May attack in calling for him to resign. Col. Steve McCraw, the head of the Texas Department of Public Safety, acknowledged mistakes by officers while several Uvalde families confronted him in Austin over multiple outrages: why police waited more than 70 minutes before entering the fourth-grade classroom and killing the gunman, false and shifting accounts given by authorities, and records that remain withheld more than five months later. But McCraw defended his agency, and during a meeting of the state’s Public Safety Commission, made the case that failures uncovered to date did not warrant his removal while saying he was not shirking from accountability. Uvalde families bristled and asked how DPS could not have failed, given that troopers were among the first on the scene. “I can tell you this right now, DPS as an institution, right now, did not fail the community,” McCraw said. “Plain and simple.” Significantly, Republican Rep. Tony Gonzales said for the first time after the meeting that McCraw should also lose his job, becoming the first major figure in the GOP to call for a change at the top of Texas’ state police force.\n\nUtah\n\nSouth Jordan: U.S. Rep. Burgess Owens and Democratic challenger Darlene McDonald agreed on none of the issues addressed Friday in their only debate before the midterm elections, with each largely echoing their party’s talking points on inflation, abortion and infrastructure spending. In an untelevised debate in the basement of a suburban real estate office with an audience of only campaign staff and half a dozen reporters, the Utah Republican blamed Democrats and President Joe Biden for fentanyl being imported across the U.S.-Mexico border, racial division and inflation. Owens accused Democrats of pushing critical race theory – an academic framework that connects the country’s history, including the legacy of slavery, to contemporary racism – and said that it’s destroying the country’s social fabric. “One thing that the Biden administration has accomplished is that they’ve given us a common purpose again,” Owens, one of two Black Republicans in the U.S. House, added. “We now share in what’s called misery, as a people.” McDonald, who is also Black, countered that Owens was spreading falsehoods to drum up fear – about both the nature of protests against police brutality and the idea that critical race theory was being taught in K-12 schools.\n\nVermont\n\nRutland: A man charged with the 1989 stabbing deaths of his in-laws in the town of Danby after modern DNA techniques linked him to the crime pleaded not guilty Friday during a court hearing. The arraignment of Michael Louise in Vermont Superior Court in Rutland came two days after he was returned to Vermont from New York to answer charges in the deaths of George Peacock, 76, and Catherine Peacock, 73. He had been scheduled for arraignment Thursday but the hearing was delayed 24 hours. Louise entered the pleas and then was ordered held without bail, said Vermont State Police spokesperson Adam Silverman, who monitored the hearing remotely. Louise, 79, who was married to one of the Peacocks’ daughters, was identified as a suspect about two weeks later after the couple was found dead in their Danby home in September 1989. Investigators at the time developed circumstantial evidence tying Louise to the killings, but there was not enough to charge him, police said in an affidavit filed in the case. Louise told conflicting stories about whether he had traveled to Vermont from his home in Liverpool, New York, on Sept. 13, 1989, the day the Peacocks were believed to have been killed. Their bodies were discovered Sept. 17 after neighbors went to check on the couple.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: The U.S. Coast Guard, a crew of scientists and others launched an air and sea mission to rescue 13 people, including a child, from a fishing vessel just moments before it sank in darkness early Friday in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Virginia, authorities said. The 115-foot Tremont fishing vessel collided with the 1000-foot Panamanian-flagged container vessel MSC Rita, about 60 miles from shore, the Coast Guard said in a statement. The Tremont sent out a mayday call that it was taking on water and sinking with 13 people aboard that was received by watchstanders with Coast Guard Sector Virginia, officials said. That call was also heard by Atlantis, a 274-foot ship operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Falmouth, Massachusetts, at about 1:45 a.m., WHOI said in an email to The Associated Press. The captain of the Atlantis contacted the Coast Guard and motored 8 miles west to the fishing vessel. The Coast Guard launched an MH-60 Jayhawk helicopter crew and an HC-130 Hercules airplane crew from its air station in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, the Coast Guard said. It also dispatched a motor lifeboat crew from its station in Chincoteague, on Virginia’s Eastern Shore, and diverted the Coast Guard Cutter Rollin Fritch to assist.\n\nWashington\n\nEverett: The city’s dress code ordinance saying bikini baristas must cover their bodies at work has been ruled unconstitutional by a federal court. The decision in a partial summary judgment last week came after a lengthy legal battle between bikini baristas and the city of Everett over the rights of workers to wear what they want, the Everett Herald reports. Everett is about 30 miles north of Seattle. U.S. District Court in Seattle found Everett’s dress code ordinance violated the Equal Protection clauses of the U.S. and Washington state constitutions. The Court found that the ordinance was, at least in part, shaped by a gender-based discriminatory purpose, according to a 19-page ruling signed by U.S. District Judge Ricardo S. Martinez. It is difficult to imagine, the court wrote, how the ordinance would be equally applied to men and women in practice because it prohibits clothing “typically worn by women rather than men,” including midriff and scoop-back shirts, as well as bikinis. Bikini baristas were “clearly” a target of the ordinance, the court also ruled, adding that the profession is comprised of a workforce that is almost entirely women.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Local chefs and surgeons put their carving skills to the test for the Huntington Children’s Museum Pumpkin Carving Contest at The Market’s outdoor patio in downtown Huntington. Jessica McCormick, of Huntington, brought her two children, 10-year-old Iris and 4-year-old Oscar, to the event on Tuesday, which also featured the Marshall Nutrition Program, a dance floor with a fog machine, and other contests and events for kids. “They loved this event last year, and they love checking out the carved pumpkins, too,” said McCormick, who is the vice president of the museum’s board of directors. “We have been waiting for a children’s museum in Huntington since Iris was a baby. I hope everyone will get involved and donate to such a great cause.” Drew Hetzer, of Backyard Pizza and Raw Bar and The Peddler, was one of the local dining legends competing in the contest that also included Jonathan Patterson of Le Bistro and Jordan Hagy of La Famiglia. “I’m sticking with a pizza theme, but with a Halloween twist on it,” Hetzer said. Participating surgeons included doctors Ashleigh Clickett, Courtney Crain, Michael Gentile, Farzad Amiri and Ben Moosavi. “I will attempt carving a breastfeeding mother with a baby,” said Clickett, an obstetrics and gynecology specialist at Valley Health. “Cutting a pumpkin is a lot different than human skin, so it will be much different. I just want to have fun with it and help a great cause at the same time.” Votes for the best pumpkin can be made with donations to Huntington Children’s Museum online at givebutter.com/hcmpumpkin.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: An appeals court is refusing to block a lower court’s ruling prohibiting voters who already submitted an absentee ballot from voiding it and voting again, a rarely used practice known as ballot spoiling. The 2nd District Court of Appeals decided Thursday against hearing an appeal of a Waukesha County circuit court judge’s ruling this month in favor of a conservative group founded by prominent Republicans. That ruling required the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission to rescind its guidance that allowed the spoiling of ballots that had already been cast. Voters who obtained an absentee ballot, but have not yet voted and want to obtain a new one, can still do that. The elections commission held an emergency meeting Friday, less than two weeks before the Nov. 8 election, and unanimously voted to rescind the guidance issued in August detailing how an already cast ballot could be spoiled. Very few voters have actually spoiled their absentee ballots after voting in recent elections, data provided by the elections commission to the Associated Press shows. In the August primary, just 3,519 people cast a new ballot after spoiling their original one, less than 0.3% of all votes cast, the data shows.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Three wolves shot and killed in the state are drawing attention across the border. Colorado Parks and Wildlife officials believe the animals may have belonged to their state’s closely watched North Park wolf pack. The North Park pack, which often crosses into Wyoming where hunting wolves is legal, gained notoriety last year after birthing Colorado’s first known litter of pups in 80 years. Travis Duncan, spokesperson for Colorado Parks and Wildlife, said in an email that the agency cannot yet confirm whether the slain wolves were in the North Park pack but will continue to monitor the animals “if and when they are next seen in the area.” Duncan added that at least two wolves were seen Friday in northern Colorado. In Colorado, killing a wolf can bring a $100,000 fine and up to a year in prison. But once all four paws are across the border into Wyoming, wolves are in the state’s “predator zone” where anyone can legally hunt the animals without a license. The Wyoming Game and Fish Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The difference in state laws could impede Colorado’s planned reintroduction of wolves that was narrowly approved by voters in a controversial 2019 ballot initiative. The introduction is planned for 2023 on the sparsely populated Western Slope.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/31"}]}

The purpose of the hearing is essentially for the judge to ensure that Hunter Biden understands his rights and the charges against him, allow him to enter a plea, and for the court to set the terms of his pretrial release.\n\nThe hearing will occur in the J. Caleb Boggs Federal Building on King Street in downtown Wilmington where dozens of national reporters will stage before and after the hearing. Attorneys on both sides expect the hearing to go quickly, according to their submissions to the court.\n\nIn recent weeks, Hunter Biden’s attorneys asked the court to allow him to attend via video conference.\n\nIn a letter written to the judge, attorney Abbe Lowell said his client understands his rights and the charges against him, intends to plead not guilty and so traveling from his home in California to Wilmington would be unnecessary for “what should be a rather short proceeding.”\n\nRECENT: Hunter Biden indicted on federal gun charges for allegedly lying about drug addiction\n\nProsecutors under Davis Weiss, the U.S. Attorney for Delaware, argued that Hunter Biden’s appearance in person was “important to promote the public’s confidence that the defendant is being treated consistently with others.”\n\nThey also argued that Hunter Biden’s in-person attendance will be more “conducive” to sorting out any issues that may arise, citing contradictory statements he made at a July hearing where a deal to stave off the charges he now faces fell apart.\n\nPresiding Judge Christopher J. Burke ultimately ruled that Hunter Biden must attend the hearing, which was originally scheduled to occur last week.\n\nWhat’s changed since July hearing?\n\nThis will be Hunter Biden’s second federal court appearance in Delaware in recent months.\n\nIn July, his attorneys had struck a deal with federal prosecutors. The plan for both sides going into that hearing was that Hunter Biden would plead guilty to two misdemeanor tax charges and enter a separate diversion agreement to stave off prosecution on the gun charges.\n\nThat diversion agreement gave him immunity from potential future prosecutions involving his finances as long as he abided by the terms of that agreement.\n\nHowever, the parties’ accord unraveled under questioning from presiding District Judge Maryellen Noreika.\n\nNoreika’s questioning exposed differing positions between defense attorneys and prosecutors over the scope of immunity the diversion agreement allowed. She also questioned what role she would have in potentially enforcing the agreement, accused both parties of seeking a “rubber stamp” and said she could not accept the plea deal without further information.\n\nShe ordered the parties to amend the wording of the agreement and submit further briefings, but the divide between the attorneys exposed in the hearing only grew after the court adjourned.\n\nLOCAL COVERAGE: How Hunter Biden's plea agreement fell apart in federal court, leading to not guilty plea\n\nSince then, federal prosecutors filed paperwork dismissing the tax charges and indicating they will refile the charges in either California or Washington D.C. They also told the court they regard the gun-diversion agreement as dead. Hunter Biden’s attorneys have told the court the agreement is still in place.\n\nIt is unclear if Tuesday’s hearing will address the disputed diversion agreement.\n\nWhat could come next?\n\nThe situation puts the president’s son on track for a potential criminal trial in Delaware as his father campaigns for reelection. But it’s likely defense attorneys will seek to have the charges thrown out ahead of that potential trial.\n\nIn a written statement published by USA Today, Lowell, one of Hunter Biden’s lawyers, labeled the new firearms charges as a product of political pressure. He said nothing changed in the weeks since prosecutors were willing to not pursue the charges with the diversion agreement.\n\nHe added that the previous agreement Hunter Biden had with prosecutors and recent court rulings elsewhere invalidate the charges.\n\nIMPEACHMENT HEARING RECAP:Here's what witnesses said about Joe Biden, Hunter Biden\n\nMeanwhile, Hunter Biden’s finances are also part of a congressional inquiry by Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives seeking to tie the president to his son’s business dealings overseas. Additionally, a handful of lawsuits over Hunter Biden’s laptop continue to move through the courts.\n\nMost recently, Hunter Biden sued Rudy Giuliani, claiming the then-campaign attorney for former President Donald Trump illegally copied, manipulated and distributed his private records.\n\nHUNTER BIDEN CASE:Lead prosecutor cut a contentious path during his time in Baltimore\n\nContact Xerxes Wilson at (302) 324-2787 or xwilson@delawareonline.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/04/02/hunter-biden-tax-charges/73119630007/", "title": "In Hunter Biden tax case, judge refuses to dismiss charges", "text": "A federal judge refused to dismiss tax charges against Hunter Biden, brushing aside claims from the president’s son that the case resulted from political pressure because Republicans criticized a plea agreement that fell apart as too lenient.\n\nU.S. District Judge Mark Scarsi in Los Angeles ruled Monday against throwing out the case based on eight motions from Biden, including selective prosecution and immunity from the charges because of the failed plea agreement.\n\nThe trial is scheduled to start June 20, a couple of weeks after a Delaware trial on gun charges.\n\nHunter Biden's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said they \"strongly disagree with the court’s decision and will continue to vigorously pursue Mr. Biden’s challenges.\"\n\nThe combined cases threaten to hound Hunter Biden as his father, President Joe Biden, campaigns to remain in the White House against likely Republican nominee Donald Trump.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nWhy did Hunter Biden ask to dismiss the tax charges against him?\n\nLowell filed eight arguments to dismiss some or all of the tax charges against him. The reasons included accusations of \"outrageous government conduct,\" and \"vindictive\" and \"selective\" prosecution. Another claim was that Biden was immune from the charges because of the failed plea agreement.\n\nThe alleged \"outrageous government conduct\" referred to two Internal Revenue Service agents, Gary Shapley and Joseph Ziegler, accused of leaking confidential information about Biden's taxes through congressional testimony and during TV interviews, according to court records. Biden has sued the IRS over the revelations.\n\nThe \"selective and vindictive prosecution\" referred to Lowell's claim that Justice Department special counsel David Weiss filed multiple new charges against Biden without new evidence, succumbing to political pressure. Lowell noted \"DOJ started piling on tax charges right after Weiss was dragged before Congress and admitted he started fearing for the safety of his team and family.\"\n\nBut Judge Scarsi swatted away the request as lacking evidence, ruling that Biden cited social media posts and legal blogs rather than formally recognized exhibits of evidence.\n\n\"These citations, however, are not evidence,\" Scarsi wrote. \"To that end, the Court may deny the motion without further discussion.\"\n\nHow did prosecutors respond to Hunter Biden's accusations?\n\nWeiss replied to the allegations of \"outrageous government conduct\" by arguing the actions of the two agents didn't result in faulty charges. If they broke the law, they could be charged criminally or sued rather than throw out Biden's indictment, he argued.\n\nWeiss argued Biden has no immunity from the failed plea agreement because it never went into effect and was withdrawn Aug. 9. To prove selective prosecution, Weiss said Biden needed to show other people not prosecuted for the same allegations, which he hasn't.\n\nScarsi found no evidence of discriminatory prosecution.\n\nWhat tax charges does Hunter Biden face?\n\nHunter Biden faces nine tax charges that carry a combined maximum penalty of 17 years in prison.\n\nHe was indicted on three felony and six misdemeanor tax charges for allegedly failing to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes on time from 2016 to 2019, and evading other taxes, all while spending millions on a lavish lifestyle.\n\nHunter Biden's lawyers said he repaid the back taxes before he was charged.\n\nHis foreign business dealings, which are mentioned in the tax indictment, are at the center of an impeachment investigation by House Republicans about whether his father profited. Lawmakers haven't found evidence of any payments to Joe Biden. Hunter Biden received millions from a Ukrainian industrial company and a Chinese private equity fund, according to the indictment.\n\nWhat happened with Hunter Biden's plea agreement?\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika in Delaware rejected a plea agreement in July 2023 that could have allowed Hunter Biden to avoid jail time on both the tax and gun charges.\n\nThe plea agreement would have allowed Biden to plead guilty to two misdemeanors for failing to pay his taxes in 2017 and 2018, and to enter a pretrial program for a gun charge that could have been dismissed if he complied.

And he is charged with knowingly possessing the revolver despite the restrictions against people addicted to drugs owning firearms.\n\nLowell has argued the prosecution is trying to renege on the deal while Biden has fulfilled his side of the agreement by not possessing a firearm, not using illicit drugs and agreeing to drug testing and treatment.\n\nWeiss noted that Biden wrote a memoir about his addiction in 2021 − after he announced the federal investigation against him in 2020 − and recounted buying the gun after a drug dealer pointed a gun at him.\n\n\"The charges in this case are not trumped up or because of former President Trump − they are instead a result of the defendant’s own choices and were brought in spite of, not because of,any outside noise made by politicians,\" Weiss wrote.\n\nWhat are the tax charges?\n\nHunter Biden is accused of failing to pay at least $1.4 million in self-assessed taxes from 2016 through 2019, and also evading tax assessment for 2018 when he filed false returns, according to the indictment.

On that form, they are asked whether they are an unlawful user or are addicted to controlled substances, narcotics and other listed substances. Biden is accused of answering \"no\" to that question on the form.\n\nBiden has been open about his longtime struggles with crack cocaine addiction. He's written about it in his book and discussed it during a court hearing last year, stating he's been sober since 2019.\n\nHe was able to purchase the gun and kept it for less than a month before it was thrown by his lover into a trash receptacle outside the upscale Janssen's Market grocery store in Greenville. This prompted a Delaware State Police search for a man who found the gun while collecting recyclables outside the store and − several years later − drew federal prosecutors' attention back to the form.\n\nWhy is that allegedly a crime?\n\nBiden faces three firearms felonies.\n\nThe first two relate specifically to the form he filled out to purchase the gun, accusing Biden of lying about this drug use on the form.\n\nThe third charge pertains to Biden's possession of a firearm while he was allegedly an unlawful user or addicted to controlled substances.\n\nWhat must prosecutors prove to the jury?\n\nFor the first charge, prosecutors must generally convince the jury that:\n\nBiden filled out the form and that he made a false statement, specifically that he was an unlawful user of or addicted to controlled substances.\n\nThat he knew that statement was false.\n\nThat the statement was meant to deceive the salesman on a fact material to the sale. In other words: the sale would not have occurred had he answered otherwise.\n\nThe second charge is similar. Prosecutors need to show that Biden knowingly made a false statement, but need not show the statement was material to the transaction.\n\nFor the third charge, prosecutors need to prove:\n\nBiden was either an unlawful user of or addicted to controlled substances.\n\nThat he knowingly possessed the firearm.\n\nThat he knew he was an unlawful user of or addicted to controlled substances.\n\nWhat is a user and an 'addict'?\n\nTo find Biden was an unlawful user of controlled substances or addicted to drugs, the jury must have a common definition of what those terms mean in order to apply the evidence to the question. This has been a hotly litigated topic in pretrial motions and continues to be where defense attorneys are concentrating their litigation days ahead of trial.\n\nLast week, U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika granted the prosecutors' motion barring defense attorneys from arguing or suggesting that they must show Biden used controlled substances the day of the firearm purchase in order to get a guilty verdict.\n\nProsecutors successfully argued that relevant definitions dictate they need to simply show that the \"unlawful use has occurred recently enough to indicate that the individual is actively engaged in such conduct.\"\n\nRecent: What is an addict? Hunter Biden is fighting what that means as gun trial looms\n\nHowever, the debate on the issue continues as of Wednesday in litigation over what definitions jurors will work with. On Wednesday, defense attorney submitted arguments seeking a more constrained definition of \"addict\" and unlawful user than what prosecutors have sought in their proposed jury instructions.\n\nAmong other requests, defense filings request specific instructions telling the jury that if they do not find that Biden knew himself to fit the definition of drug user or \"addict\" at the time he purchased the gun, the verdict must be not guilty.\n\nHow the judge decides these definitions and instructions could be key to how Biden defends himself at trial.\n\nWhat evidence and witnesses will prosecutors use?\n\nRegardless of what definitions are ultimately presented to the jury, prosecutors have a mountain of evidence showing Biden's drug use.\n\nA primary vein of evidence will be Biden’s own words exploring his drug use in his 2021 memoir “Beautiful Things.” In it, he said he was in active addiction for four years leading to March 2019 and speaks about rehab and relapses, according to excerpts identified by prosecutors.\n\nProsecutors will also lean on his text messages: missives like, “I was sleeping in a car smoking crack on 4th Street and Rodney.”\n\nThe book: Hunter Biden says he was 'smoking crack every 15 minutes', more jaw-dropping moments from memoir 'Beautiful Things'\n\nAdditionally, they will call close family witnesses including what court documents indicate are his ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, as well as Hallie Biden, the widow of Biden’s brother and Hunter Biden’s former lover. In court, prosecutors said these witnesses will testify to Biden’s conduct, as well as verify digital communications entered as evidence in the trial.\n\nProsecutors also intend to call witnesses from the gun shop to testify about the purchase of the revolver.\n\nWhat will Biden's defense argue?\n\nSo far, defense attorneys have unsuccessfully sought to toss the case using arguments that the charges are legally defective.\n\nAs trial looms, his attorneys have hinted at a defense that emphasizes the requirement that prosecutors show that Biden knowingly lied about his status as an unlawful drug user when he filled out paperwork to purchase the gun.\n\nAbbe Lowell, Biden's primary defense attorney, has sought permission to introduce at trial expert testimony from a specialist who can testify regarding a person with addiction’s understanding of and state of denial about their own addiction.\n\n“Someone, like Mr. Biden who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict,” Lowell wrote in court documents filed earlier this month.\n\nProsecutors have argued that Lowell submitted paperwork to admit that witness too late, asking the judge to bar such testimony.\n\nSecondarily, Lowell has hinted he may seek a line of questioning that attacks the credibility of the gun shop employees responsible for keeping the form on which Biden is accused of lying.\n\nThis avenue was opened by the fact that the form was altered between when it was first emailed to federal authorities in 2018 and when the original was turned over to federal investigators years later. Employees at the gun shop added another form of identification verification to the form after the fact that may not have actually been submitted by Biden, according to court documents.\n\nIn court, Lowell said the alteration calls the credibility of the shop employees to question and presents questions over whether the witnesses are obtaining a benefit from prosecutors since they appeared to have, like Biden, written false information on the form.\n\nWho will decide whether Biden is guilty?\n\nA jury of 12 picked from residents of New Castle County will evaluate the evidence and be tasked with rendering the verdict. Because of the high-profile nature of the defendant, hundreds are being called into the courthouse for jury selection on Monday.\n\nThe court will use pre-decided questions to cull potential jurors who can't be impartial down to a smaller pool. Then, prosecutors and defense attorneys will have the choice to strike a certain number of prospective jurors. This process could take days.\n\nWhere is this happening and how long will it take?\n\nAfter jury selection, each side will present opening statements and prosecutors will begin to call witnesses.\n\nProsecutors have said they expect to take three days to present their case. Lowell, Biden's attorney, indicated he will possibly also present a case and said if he does, it won't take double the time prosecutors have projected for their own.\n\nRecent: Hunter Biden appears in Wilmington court ahead of looming gun trial. Here's what happened\n\nIn all, the court expects the case to last about two weeks.\n\nThe trial will take place in the federal courthouse on King Street in downtown Wilmington.\n\nA piece of trivia: The court is housed in the J. Caleb Boggs Federal Building, named after the former U.S. senator a young Joe Biden defeated in 1972 to launch his political career in Washington D.C.\n\nWho is the judge?\n\nFederal Judge Maryellen Noreika is presiding over the case.\n\nHer career before the bench centered on civil litigation: intellectual property cases and corporate litigation in federal and state courts. Later on, she'd gain experience representing children in Delaware's Family Court.\n\nIn 2017, Sens. Tom Carper and Chris Coons put forward Noreika and Colm F. Connolly to fill judicial vacancies in the Delaware District. Then-President Donald Trump nominated Noreika and Connolly, and she was confirmed the following year.\n\nThe Judge:Biden gun charges remain before judge who questioned plea deal, placing spotlight on her\n\nHer political affiliations and contributions have been mixed, according to past reporting.\n\nNoreika gained national attention last year when a plea deal for Biden fell apart under her pointed questioning of the parties. Both sides went into the hearing having agreed to a deal that would have resolved both the gun case, as well as pending tax charges against Biden with a misdemeanor plea and recommended sentence of probation only.\n\nFailed Plea Deal: Here's how Hunter Biden's expected plea deal fell apart, leading to his not guilty plea\n\nHowever, Noreika repeatedly complained that both parties wanted her \"rubber stamp\" on the \"unusual\" agreement and subjected them to hours of questions. Her line of inquiry ultimately exposed differences in each side's interpretation of the deal and led to her ordering further legal briefings that prompted the sides to abandon the deal.\n\nCould the president's son go to prison?\n\nThe charges carry a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison, though Biden is likely to get a shorter sentence if convicted. It is atypical for defendants to get a maximum sentence when they are first-time offenders like Biden.\n\nWhat about Biden's taxes?\n\nSeparately, Biden faces tax evasion charges in a California case now set to go to trial this fall.\n\nCali Case: Back-to-back Hunter Biden trial schedule gets spaced out as California judge delays\n\nContact Xerxes Wilson at (302) 324-2787 or xwilson@delawareonline.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/08/31/delaware-judge-status-update-on-hunter-biden-felony-gun-charge/70730671007/", "title": "Delaware judge requests status update on Hunter Biden gun charge", "text": "Randall Chase\n\nAssociated Press\n\nDOVER, Del. — A federal judge in Delaware ordered prosecutors and defense attorneys on Thursday to provide a status report regarding a felony gun charge against Hunter Biden.\n\nJudge Maryellen Noreika directed lawyers to provide the report by next Wednesday, including any steps they believe the court needs to take.\n\nAttorneys for Biden have argued that a \"diversion agreement\" sparing him from prosecution on the gun charge is still in place, even though it was inextricably linked to a plea deal on misdemeanor tax offenses that imploded during a court appearance in July.\n\nNoreika dismissed the tax case, and prosecutors have indicated they plan to pursue tax charges against President Joe Biden's son in another district, perhaps California or Washington, D.C.\n\nMeanwhile, prosecutors maintain that the agreement on the gun charge, which contains unprecedented immunity provisions against federal prosecutions for other potential crimes, never took effect and is no longer valid.\n\nThe Press Room:What it was like watching Hunter Biden's plea deal unravel\n\nThe two-part deal on tax and gun charges was supposed to have largely wrapped up a years-long investigation overseen by Delaware U.S. Attorney David Weiss. The deal fell apart after Noreika raised questions about its terms during a hearing in July. Among other issues, prosecutors were unable to resolve the judge's concerns about offering Biden immunity for certain crimes as part of the diversion agreement, instead of in the plea deal.\n\nTypically, a non-prosecution agreement is not presented to a judge and requires no court input. A plea deal, on the other hand, must be presented to a judge, but prosecutors tried to structure Biden's tax plea deal in a way that left Noreika with no discretion to accept or reject it. The judge expressed concern that attorneys were asking her to simply \"rubber stamp\" the deal, which she refused to do.\n\nPressed by Noreika, prosecutor Leo Wise said he could find no precedent for agreeing not to prosecute Biden for crimes that have nothing to do with the gun case or the charges being diverted. Wise also acknowledged that he had never seen a diversion agreement in which the agreement not to prosecute is so broad that it encompasses crimes in a different case. Nor could he offer any precedent for requiring prosecutors to first obtain court approval before prosecuting Biden for certain crimes in the future.\n\nHunter Biden Deal:How Hunter Biden's plea agreement fell apart in federal court, leading to not guilty plea\n\n\"These agreements are not straightforward and they contain some atypical provisions,\" Noreika noted.\n\nPrior to the hearing, Republicans denounced Biden's plea agreement as a \"sweetheart deal.\" The deal called for Biden to be sentenced to probation in exchange for pleading guilty to failing to pay taxes on more than $1.5 million in income in both 2017 and 2018. According to prosecutors, Biden's income during those two years included roughly $4 million in business and consulting fees from a company he formed with the CEO of a Chinese business conglomerate, and from the Ukrainian energy company Burisma.\n\nThe diversion agreement, meanwhile, was aimed at sparing Biden from prosecution on the felony crime of being a drug user in possession of a gun in 2018 if he kept out of trouble for two years. Hunter Biden's history of drug use and financial dealings have trailed the political career of his father.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the plea deal, Attorney General Merrick Garland named Weiss as special counsel, a status that confers broad powers to investigate and report out his findings.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/07/25/hunter-biden-plea-federal-court-tax-crimes-gun-david-weiss/70458419007/", "title": "Hunter Biden in federal court: What to know about Wednesday's ...", "text": "Hunter Biden, son of President Joe Biden, is expected to plead guilty to misdemeanor tax crimes during a court hearing in Wilmington Wednesday.\n\nThe hearing is also expected to address an agreement between federal prosecutors and Hunter Biden to avert prosecution on a felony charge of illegally possessing a firearm as a drug user.\n\nThe Caleb Boggs Federal Building, a typically quiet courthouse on King Street in downtown Wilmington, is expected to be buzzing with national media, as well as interested members of the public, for the morning hearing.\n\nHere’s a rundown of what you need to know.\n\nNEED TO KNOW:How last-minute court filings could prompt sanctions against Hunter Biden's legal team\n\nWhat is Hunter Biden accused of?\n\nFirst, Hunter Biden faces two misdemeanor crimes for “willful failure to pay tax.” Specifically, federal prosecutors claim Hunter Biden received at least $1.5 million in income each year in 2017 and 2018 but didn't pay taxes, according to court records.\n\nCharging documents state he was a resident of Washington, D.C., during the years he failed to pay taxes. His court documents indicate that he currently resides in Malibu, California.\n\nFederal prosecutors also claim Biden possessed a Colt Cobra 38SPL revolver despite being addicted to drugs. That is a violation of federal firearms laws, prosecutors claim.\n\nHe bought the handgun in October 2018 somewhere in Delaware. On a required form, he replied \"no\" when prompted to answer whether he was “an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance,\" according to the Washington Post.\n\nBy his own account, Biden has battled drug addiction for periods, including 2018.\n\nWhat exactly is happening Wednesday?\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika is presiding over what is scheduled as a change of plea hearing for the tax charge and his initial court appearance for the gun charge.\n\nAccording to court documents, Hunter Biden is expected to plead guilty to both of the tax charges at the hearing. In such hearings, the judge will typically ask the defendant a series of questions to ensure they understand their rights and are knowingly pleading guilty.\n\nLOCAL DEALINGS:What Hunter Biden's emails reveal about his investment in now-defunct Fisker Automotive\n\nThe firearm charge is a felony and much more serious in terms of potential punishment.\n\nThe hearing may cover the logistics of a pretrial diversion agreement between prosecutors and Biden that would see that charge struck from his record if he adheres to the terms of that agreement. Those terms have not been discussed publicly as of yet.\n\nCould this send the president's son to prison?\n\nHunter Biden is not expected to see any prison time despite facing potential maximum sentences totaling 12 years in prison. It is rare for a defendant, particularly one with Hunter Biden's background, to receive anything close to the maximum punishment.\n\nThe two tax charges are punishable by a maximum of a year in prison each, along with potentially six-figure fines. Citing unnamed sources, the Associated Press has reported that prosecutors will recommend a sentence consisting entirely of probation for the tax charges.\n\nDID HUNTER BIDEN GET A SWEETHEART DEAL?How these cases play out with other defendants\n\nA judge will consider standardized sentencing guidelines alongside recommendations from prosecutors and defense counsel in sentencing Hunter Biden. In some cases, judges sentence defendants on the same day they plead guilty. However, there is no indication in court documents that will happen in Biden's on Wednesday. Sentencing may occur at a future court hearing.\n\nThe gun charge itself carries a potential 10-year sentence, but the pretrial diversion agreement will likely head off any potential prison time and require Biden to adhere to terms and monitoring similar to a probationary sentence.\n\nLast month, following the unsealing of the case against Biden, his lawyer, Christopher Clark, said the president's son will take responsibility for \"mistakes he made during a period of turmoil and addiction in his life. He looks forward to continuing his recovery and moving forward.\"\n\nLong-running Delaware investigation\n\nThe charges are being brought by David Weiss, U.S. attorney for the District of Delaware. Weiss began the investigation five years ago and was appointed by former President Donald Trump.\n\nUnder the Biden administration, Weiss was not asked to resign like most U.S. attorney Trump appointees. Biden officials said that decision was made to ensure continuity in the investigation into Hunter Biden.\n\nWeiss has been targeted by congressional Republicans that have characterized the case as a “slap on the wrist” for Biden and the result of preferential treatment.\n\nMeanwhile, congressional Republicans are continuing their own investigations into Hunter Biden and his family.\n\nUSA TODAY COVERAGE: Hunter Biden, White House, House GOP clash over widening investigation of Joe Biden's son\n\nNew developments included the first public testimony by two IRS agents involved in the Hunter Biden investigation, along with the public release of an FBI document with unverified allegations against President Joe Biden.\n\nLaptop lawsuit brewing in Delaware courts\n\nMeanwhile, Hunter Biden is suing the Trolley Square computer repair shop owner who claimed Biden dropped off his computer at the Wilmington shop and never retrieved it, which led to the leak and publication of private photographs and correspondence belonging to the president’s son.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in response to a defamation lawsuit pursued by the computer repairman, John Paul Mac Isaac, which names as defendants Hunter Biden, as well as news publications CNN and The Daily Beast and U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat.\n\nThe lawsuit claims those defendants characterized Mac Isaac as a thief and a Russian agent and this caused him to shutter his business.\n\nRECENT:Hunter Biden is suing Trolley Square laptop repairman at center of data leak.\n\nBiden's countersuit claims Mac Isaac had no right to access and copy the data on the laptop and then invaded Biden’s privacy by disseminating the ill-gotten content.\n\nThat case is proceeding in Sussex County Superior Court.\n\nContact Xerxes Wilson at (302) 324-2787 or xwilson@delawareonline.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/25"}]}

The planets will slowly catch up to one another over time. Because they are all traveling along the same path, the ecliptic, as they pass Earth, it appears as though they are aligned, according to NASA. However, the alignment formation will be short-lived since each planet moves at different speeds, depending on its distance from the sun.\n\nWhere to look for the planet alignment\n\nLooking in the eastern sky the planetary alignment will be visible almost everywhere in the Northern Hemisphere, weather permitting.\n\nYou'll need high-powered binoculars to view the majority of the planets – Mercury and Jupiter will be extremely low in the sky. Uranus will be fairly dim and Neptune will appear star-like with binoculars due to its distance from Earth. But Mars and Saturn should be visible with the naked eye.\n\nPlanet alignments aren't extremely rare, especially with two to four planets. They do occur several times each year. With five or more planets aligning, it is less common.\n\nThe last planetary alignment seen in the Northern Hemisphere was on April 8.\n\nProfiles of the six planets on parade\n\nWith eight planets in our solar system, they all have some very interesting traits.

As June progresses, Mercury will become brighter and easier to see, according to Diana Hannikainen, observing editor of Sky & Telescope.\n\nThe rest of the planets should be consistently visible to the naked eye, she added.\n\nThe best time to view the five planets is in the 30 minutes before sunrise, she said. The night before you plan to view the alignment, check when the sun will rise in your area.\n\nSome stargazers are especially excited for the celestial event, including Hannikainen. She flew from her home west of Boston to a beachside town along the Atlantic Ocean to secure an optimal view of the alignment.\n\n“I’ll be out there with my binoculars, looking towards the east and southeast and crossing all my fingers and toes that it is going to be clear,” Hannikainen said.\n\nYou don’t have to travel to catch a glimpse of the action because it will be visible to people around the globe.\n\nStargazers in the Northern Hemisphere can see the planets from the eastern to southeastern horizon while those in the Southern Hemisphere should look along the eastern to northeastern horizon. The only requirement is a clear sky in the direction of the alignment.\n\nIf you wake up and the weather blocks the sky, don’t worry, Hannikainen said.\n\n“Just keep looking throughout the month of June and as soon as you have a clear morning, go out and enjoy that view,” she said.\n\nThe moon joins the party\n\nIn addition to the five planets, the waning crescent moon will also be in alignment between Venus and Mars on June 24.\n\nUnlike on the days leading up to it, this special celestial alignment can be viewed in the hour before sunrise, Hannikainen said.\n\nBy the next day, the moon will have continued its orbit around the Earth, moving it out of alignment with the planets, she said.\n\nIf you miss the five-planet alignment in sequential order, the next one will happen in 2040, according to Sky & Telescope.\n\nThere will be seven more full moons in 2022, according to The Old Farmers’ Almanac:\n\nJune 14: Strawberry moon\n\nJuly 13: Buck moon\n\nAugust 11: Sturgeon moon\n\nSeptember 10: Harvest moon\n\nOctober 9: Hunter’s moon\n\nNovember 8: Beaver moon\n\nDecember 7: Cold moon\n\nThese are the popularized names associated with the monthly full moons, but the significance of each one may vary across Native American tribes.\n\nLunar and solar eclipses\n\nThere will be one more total lunar eclipse and a partial solar eclipse in 2022, according to The Old Farmer’s Almanac.\n\nPartial solar eclipses occur when the moon passes in front of the sun but only blocks some of its light. Be sure to wear proper eclipse glasses to safely view solar eclipses, as the sun’s light can be damaging to the eye.\n\nA partial solar eclipse on October 25 will be visible to those in Greenland, Iceland, Europe, northeastern Africa, the Middle East, western Asia, India and western China. Neither of the partial solar eclipses will be visible from North America.\n\nA total lunar eclipse will also be on display for those in Asia, Australia, the Pacific, South America and North America on November 8 between 3:01 a.m. ET and 8:58 a.m. ET – but the moon will be setting for those in eastern regions of North America.\n\nMeteor showers\n\nCheck out the remaining 11 showers that will peak in 2022:\n\nSouthern delta Aquariids: July 29 to 30\n\nAlpha Capricornids: July 30 to 31\n\nPerseids: August 11 to 12\n\nOrionids: October 20 to 21\n\nSouthern Taurids: November 4 to 5\n\nNorthern Taurids: November 11 to 12\n\nLeonids: November 17 to 18\n\nGeminids: December 13 to 14\n\nUrsids: December 21 to 22\n\nIf you live in an urban area, you may want to drive to a place that isn’t littered with city lights to get the best view.\n\nFind an open area with a wide view of the sky.

She flew from her home west of Boston to a beachside town along the Atlantic Ocean to secure an optimal view of the alignment.\n\n“I’ll be out there with my binoculars, looking towards the east and southeast and crossing all my fingers and toes that it is going to be clear,” Hannikainen said.\n\nYou don’t have to travel to catch a glimpse of the action because it will be visible to people around the globe.\n\nStargazers in the Northern Hemisphere can see the planets from the eastern to southeastern horizon while those in the Southern Hemisphere should look along the eastern to northeastern horizon. The only requirement is a clear sky in the direction of the alignment.\n\nBy the next day, the moon will have continued its orbit around the Earth, moving it out of alignment with the planets, she said.\n\nIf you miss the five-planet alignment in sequential order, the next one will happen in 2040, according to Sky & Telescope.\n\nThere will be seven more full moons in 2022, according to The Old Farmers’ Almanac:\n\nJune 14: Strawberry moon\n\nJuly 13: Buck moon\n\nAugust 11: Sturgeon moon\n\nSeptember 10: Harvest moon\n\nOctober 9: Hunter’s moon\n\nNovember 8: Beaver moon\n\nDecember 7: Cold moon\n\nThese are the popularized names associated with the monthly full moons, but the significance of each one may vary across Native American tribes.\n\nLunar and solar eclipses\n\nThere will be one more total lunar eclipse and a partial solar eclipse in 2022, according to The Old Farmer’s Almanac.\n\nPartial solar eclipses occur when the moon passes in front of the sun but only blocks some of its light. Be sure to wear proper eclipse glasses to safely view solar eclipses, as the sun’s light can be damaging to the eye.\n\nA partial solar eclipse on October 25 will be visible to those in Greenland, Iceland, Europe, northeastern Africa, the Middle East, western Asia, India and western China. Neither of the partial solar eclipses will be visible from North America.\n\nA total lunar eclipse will also be on display for those in Asia, Australia, the Pacific, South America and North America on November 8 between 3:01 a.m. ET and 8:58 a.m. ET – but the moon will be setting for those in eastern regions of North America.\n\nMeteor showers\n\nCheck out the remaining 11 showers that will peak in 2022:\n\nSouthern delta Aquariids: July 29 to 30\n\nAlpha Capricornids: July 30 to 31\n\nPerseids: August 11 to 12\n\nOrionids: October 20 to 21\n\nSouthern Taurids: November 4 to 5\n\nNorthern Taurids: November 11 to 12\n\nLeonids: November 17 to 18\n\nGeminids: December 13 to 14\n\nUrsids: December 21 to 22\n\nIf you live in an urban area, you may want to drive to a place that isn’t littered with city lights to get the best view.\n\nFind an open area with a wide view of the sky.

This Monday, experts say the capital city should catch at least 70% visibility of the celestial alignment.\n\nYou think the media has gone nuts over Monday’s total solar eclipse?\n\nYou should have been here in 1970. That was the last time the path of a total solar eclipse passed over Tallahassee.\n\nBack when newspapers were confined to print only editions, the Tallahassee Democrat went eclipse-batty.\n\nWe published dozens of stories in the days preceding the Sunday, March 7, 1970, eclipse, including a special “Eclipse Preview Edition” on the day before the eclipse.\n\nWe spread 18 stories, photos and cartoons about the eclipse across a 64-page Saturday edition, then followed that up with six more stories on the day of the event and another half-dozen the day after the eclipse. It was mid-April before we stopped carrying stories about that eclipse.\n\nAnd never mind, the weather kept us from seeing it.\n\nBut give us credit. This newspaper is no Johnny Come Lately about eclipses. We’ve been covering them since June 8, 1918 – which was the last time (before 2017) that a total solar eclipse was visible across the entire contiguous United States.\n\nThat’s what will happen Monday. People in the path will experience a period of total darkness eclipse period. Residents in dozens of other states, including Florida, will witness a partial eclipse.\n\nA total solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between the sun and the earth, blocking the sun’s light to earth. The next total solar eclipse visible in the U.S. will occur April 8, 2024.\n\nMore:Hurricane eclipse? Something new under the sun\n\nFor the 1918 eclipse, the Tallahassee Democrat’s coverage was basic: We published a front-page story on Friday before the Saturday eclipse. The newsroom was mostly a one-man operation back then, so reporter/editor/owner Milton Smith filled much of his story by republishing a story about the eclipse from Popular Mechanics magazine. But Smith did advise readers “get your glasses all smoked up for the occasion.”\n\nThe next solar eclipse after 1918 slated to be visible in Tallahassee occurred April 7, 1940 – and was an omen for 1970. More than three inches of rain fell on Tallahassee, along with scattered hail. Nobody in Tallahassee in 1940 saw what was only an “annular” eclipse, meaning the moon did not block out the entire sun. But then, with World War II on the horizon, the Democrat was restrained in its coverage: We ran a measly five stories in the days before the eclipse and only six more on the day and day after the event.\n\nOf course, we had to cover the 1970 eclipse, which traveled a path from Central America up the east coast of the U.S. – with nearby city of Perry anointed the first city in the U.S. to view the eclipse.\n\nA crowd estimated at between 30,000 people and 50,000 people flocked to the small paper mill town, 50 miles southeast of Tallahassee – which Florida Gov. Claude Kirk officially proclaimed as the “Eclipse Capital of the World.” The throng included the 150-member Swiss Astronomical Society, as well as scientists from England, Japan, Italy, Canada and the U.S. All three major TV networks conducted live broadcasts from Perry. The astronomy club of Hopkins (Minn.) High School traveled 1,500 miles to view the eclipse.\n\nThe Perry-Taylor County chamber of commerce broke open its piggy bank to stage a two-day festival. The chamber established seven public viewing areas, held a Friday night education seminar, distributed 50,000 pinhole viewers, barbecued 5,000 chickens and hired two bands for a Saturday night dance. Taylor County High School seniors sold sandwiches and drinks to raise money for their annual class trip.\n\nUnfortunately, in a repeat of 1940, the weather did not cooperate. A thick morning fog in Perry was followed by overcast skies throughout North Florida. When the eclipse officially started at 1:16 p.m., no one in Perry or Tallahassee saw it (and it made only scattered appearances from South Georgia to Virginia) though there was a darkening of the day even through the clouds.\n\nAmong those in Perry in 1970 was recent Florida Newspaper Hall of Fame inductee Bill Cotterell, a future Democrat reporter who was covering the eclipse for United Press International. Cotterell spent the day fending off New York editors who wanted him to confirm the lore about cows lying down in the field during an eclipse because they thought the darkness meant nighttime (“New Yorkers think we have cows in the street down here,” Cotterell recalled on Facebook).\n\nBut, you can’t blame those big city editors. Apparently, there have never been any formal studies on how animals react to an eclipse. But throughout history, there are anecdotal references to birds, bugs, wildlife and, yes, cows bedding down for the night in the darkness of an eclipse.\n\nIn one of our 1970 stories, we quoted a Leon County “old-timer,” who recalled he had to unhitch his mule team and come in from the fields during an 1899 annular eclipse because “it got so dark.” We also carried a story from Eclipse, Virginia, in which residents recalled that 1899 eclipse. One woman said, “The chickens went to roost. The geese huddled up. The cows all got together. My mother came running out of the kitchen and said, ‘Lord, have mercy!’ “\n\nSo that’s one assignment for Monday: Keep an eye on the livestock.\n\nBut more importantly, exercise caution. In 1970, the Democrat interviewed Mrs. L.M. Lewis of nearby Havana, who said during the 1899 eclipse, a friend went blind from looking at the sun. That led the Democrat to write a 1970 editorial about proper viewing techniques and equipment for an eclipse. The Democrat has repeated those admonitions in many stories leading up to Monday's eclipse.\n\nSo be careful out there, Monday. Make sure you “get your glasses all smoked up for the occasion.”\n\nGerald Ensley is a retired Democrat reporter.

Even the city's name, he added, is perfect for the astronomical event. \"But if we had a big festival with thousands of people here, we'd have to worry about safety.\"\n\nSo, Gardner said, as much as the city wants to host an eclipse festival, it won't.\n\nThat, however, hasn't put a damper on the excitement from residents, including some of the city's youngest schoolchildren who are learning about space in their classrooms and at the library, and some out-of-town astronomy enthusiasts, who are planning to set up their telescopes on the city's curved, 800-foot-long pier.\n\n\"Everyone is talking about it,\" Gardner said. \"It's the hot topic of conversation.\"\n\n'In our own backyard'\n\nAt Central Elementary school, 4- and 5-year-olds recently got their first lesson about the eclipse from Miss Madilyn.\n\nIt started Thursday morning with a class discussion about why, when the eclipse occurs next month — or anytime, really — no one should look directly at the sun, unless, they are wearing special, protective glasses: You could go blind.\n\nLater, the youngsters went outside with the sunshine, to try the eyewear on.\n\nFor months, the superintendent, Kelli Tuller, said, Mason Consolidated Schools has been planning to turn the rare daytime solar eclipse into what educators call a \"teachable moment.\"\n\n\"We are explaining what the eclipse means and why it’s exciting and important,\" Tuller said. \"The eclipse is set to happen right in the middle of our bus dismissal time for our elementary kids.\"\n\nSo, the district purchased more than 1,250 cardboard safety glasses, enough to protect the eyes of every elementary, middle and high school student, teacher, administrator — and staff member, including the bus drivers.\n\nTuller added that while some people are booking special, cross-country flights in hopes of catching a glimpse of the eclipse from an airplane, they won't have to do that. District students will be able to watch the eclipse \"in our own backyard.\"\n\n'Keep your eyes safe'\n\nOn the playground, Madilyn Hafner blew a whistle, the signal for the kids to line up.\n\n\"Remember, boys and girls, we talked about glasses this morning?\" Miss Madilyn said in her sweetest preschool teacher voice. She handed out the eyewear, while, at the same time, urging a student holding a wriggling worm to set it back down in the dirt. \"We're going to practice using them.\"\n\nAt first, Merlin Sorensen, 5, of Luna Pier, said: \"I can't see anything.\"\n\n\"Well, that's the purpose,\" Miss Madilyn told him, before realizing that he was right, unless he used the glasses to look at the sun. \"It helps keep your eyes safe. Don't look at the sun without them.\"\n\nAs the preschoolers' eyes adjusted, they blurted out whatever popped into their heads.\n\n\"I can see space,\" 5-year-old Emma Sue Atkins, who was wearing corduroy pants covered with unicorns and hearts. She said her full name as if it were all one word. She added, \"I can see the sun!\"\n\nMiss Madilyn asked them: \"What shape does it look like?\"\n\n\"A circle,\" several replied in unison.\n\nTheir teacher assured them they were correct: \"You guys are so smart!\"\n\nOne lesson, Hafner told the Free Press, isn't enough for the young children to understand how an eclipse works. But she said after many more, that likely will include books, globes and flashlights, some will.\n\nIf nothing else, they will remember wearing the glasses for a long time.\n\nEverything in motion\n\nAn eclipse — Miss Madilyn's students soon will learn — requires a precise alignment of three celestial bodies, which, like the young kids and everything else in the universe, are in constant motion.\n\nThe Earth is spinning on its axis. The moon rotates around the Earth. Both the Earth and the moon are going around the sun, which is just one of 100 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy.\n\nAnd the Milky Way, one galaxy, among a couple trillion, is zooming through the universe.\n\nIt's a humbling concept.\n\nThe last time a total solar eclipse crossed near Luna Pier was more than 200 years ago, in 1806, before Michigan was even a state. The next total eclipse to cross Michigan was in 1925. It was visible in northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula.\n\nBack then, the city of Luna Pier was known as Lakewood, and the pier that eventually gave the community its name was only a few years old. The Lakewood name was changed, in part, to keep the post office from confusing it with Lakewood, Ohio, and the original, straight wooden pier has been replaced with a curved concrete one.\n\nIn 1954, another total solar eclipse passed over the western part of the U.P. And in 2021, some in the state saw a partial solar eclipse — when part, but not all, of the sun is hidden.\n\nAfter April, the next total solar eclipse won’t be visible in lower Michigan until 2099.\n\nThe best in centuries\n\nEven more than being visible from Michigan, the upcoming eclipse has been touted by science publications like Space.com as potentially \"the best\" to view in hundreds of years.\n\nThe eclipse path goes through 15 states.\n\nSo if all goes just right — and there's one early, but perhaps not that reliable, weather prediction that the sky here will be clear — it will take about 2½ hours for the moon to pass in front of the sun, gradually blotting it out and then revealing it again.\n\nThe exact length of the moment in the middle of that, when the sun completely disappears, will vary from place to place.\n\nIn Luna Pier — a community that once depended on tax revenue from a coal-burning power plant before it shut down and has since turned to tourism to make up for the monetary loss — the moment will last just 26 seconds.\n\nBut in some places in North America, totality will last more than four minutes — somewhat longer than previous eclipses. During that time, you can expect the temperature to drop about 10-15 degrees and confused crickets to chirp.\n\nMore:Solar eclipse will create Purkinje effect — and red, green clothes will help you see it\n\nThis total solar eclipse, even more than the one in 2017 that bypassed Michigan, is forecast to be visible to more people, about 40 million, in contrast to 12 million seven years ago.\n\nAnd, as a bonus, there's a chance some people also may be able to see a tiny comet.\n\n\"A solar eclipse is a phenomenon, from a point of view in the cosmos, that is temporary and rare,\" Kapila Castoldi, an adjunct physics professor at Oakland University said. \"It happens on certain occasions on certain regions of the Earth, which is why, I think, people get so excited.\"\n\nThe professor added that a total eclipse is mind-boggling because, suddenly, in the middle of the day with the sun out, the sky gets progressively darker until it’s like it's nighttime.\n\nAnd that's why, scientists theorize, the crickets start chirping and birds stop singing.\n\n'Inflamed with wrath'\n\nStill, before people around the world used science to explain lunar and solar eclipses, they told stories. Some myths personified the sun and moon, representing them as a man and a woman — and sometimes even as lovers.\n\nIn folklore, the eclipses were supernatural signs.\n\nThe ancient Greeks interpreted an eclipse to mean the gods were angry and threatening to desert humanity. The modern word, eclipse, even comes from Greek, \"to abandon.\"\n\nIn a solar eclipse, the moon, which is the smallest of the three bodies, comes between the Earth and sun. In a lunar eclipse, which scientists calculate is more common than a solar one, the Earth comes between the sun and moon.\n\nThey are illusions, really.\n\nBut in 1504, only some people understood that.\n\nDuring Christopher Columbus’ last voyage to the New World, the European explorer became stranded in Jamaica with his crew for months. To survive, they exploited their knowledge of a lunar eclipse to manipulate the indigenous people.\n\nThe local people brought the crew food, but when they decided to stop, Columbus used an almanac that predicted an eclipse was coming and frightened them into doing what he wanted.\n\nColumbus declared that God was angry and would make the moon appear \"inflamed with wrath.\" The indigenous people, who then witnessed the eclipse, agreed to Columbus' demands.\n\nWhen the moon reappeared, Columbus told them God had forgiven them.\n\nMark Twain used a similar story as a key plot device in \"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court,\" which was published in 1889. In the novel, the time-traveling Yankee saves himself from being burned at the stake by predicting a solar eclipse.\n\nA special place\n\nAnd that brings us back to Michigan’s Luna Pier, where Michelle and Jesse Griffin, 38 and 41, are ready with their glasses. They are planning to take the day off to watch the sun momentarily vanish.\n\nJesse Griffin said he’s not quite as excited about the eclipse as his wife, who follows astrology. He isn't as convinced the planetary movements determine his destiny, nor does he believe that they are the result of divine intervention.\n\nBut, he said, he is eager to witness the eclipse because it will be \"kinda cool.\"\n\nThe city’s library, formally known as the Rasey Memorial Branch, has been helping answer questions from fascinated children — and adults — who often ride their bikes or walk there to satisfy their curiosity and get help with homework.\n\nBecky Poca, a library clerk, said when people want to know more about the science behind the phenomenon, she directs them to books and internet videos.\n\nThe library, which opened in 1935 with 163 books, is now in the former summer home of Mr. and Mrs. James Rasey, which was donated by their daughter after they died. It is part of the Monroe County Library system with a collection that has grown to about 6,000 volumes.\n\nThe Luna Pier branch plans to give away a limited number of eclipse-viewing glasses.\n\nPoca said she just wants everyone to be able to enjoy the eclipse.\n\nAnd so does the city's mayor.\n\n\"I have a friend who saw a total eclipse in Tennessee\" in 2017, Gardner said, adding that in his 65 years he has never witnessed one. His buddy told him \"it was the most spectacular thing he’s ever seen.\"\n\nGardner said he has been eager to watch one ever since then.\n\nThe mayor acknowledged that while a few neighboring communities, which also will be in the path of totality, may offer people a chance to see the eclipse, and where perhaps the time the sky goes dark for even longer, but they don’t have a pier — or a beach.\n\nLuna Pier also is his home.\n\nGardner explained that while he was born in the U.P., he has lived there for decades. In addition, his father lived in the city and so did his grandfather, which, using one of his best dad-jokes, means he \"got grandfathered in.\"\n\nThe upcoming eclipse, the mayor said, will add to the city's history.\n\n\"I expect for a lot of people — when stories like yours come out and it gets closer — this will be way bigger than they anticipated,\" Gardner told the Free Press. And when Luna Pier residents actually see the eclipse, they will \"be blown away.\"\n\nFree Press reporters Amelia Benavides-Colón, Kylie Martin, Jenna Prestininzi, Tanya Wildt and special correspondent Max Maybee contributed.\n\nContact Frank Witsil: 313-222-5022 or fwitsil@freepress.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/03/10/flat-earth-conspiracy-theorists-2024-eclipse/72849962007/", "title": "What do flat Earth conspiracy theorists think about the 2024 eclipse?", "text": "Editor's note: An updated cloud forecast for the April 2024 total solar eclipse is in. Read the latest eclipse forecast and news as of Wednesday, April 3.\n\nThe sun and moon will perfectly align during the total solar eclipse April 8 to cast a narrow shadow of darkness on Earth in the middle of the day, a surreal event that has renewed debunked conspiracy theories that clash with a proven scientific explanation.\n\nExperts say it's another example of how easily anti-science conspiracy theories can spread.\n\n“I’m already seeing it more and more as we get closer to the April 8 eclipse,” said Jeffrey Blevins, a professor of journalism at the University of Cincinnati who studies social media and disinformation.\n\nBlevins is among the experts who say the debunked \"flat Earth\" conspiracy theory doesn't slow down when an eclipse happens – even though the event is precisely explained because of scientists' deep understanding of celestial bodies and their orbits.\n\nThere is a whole spectrum of conspiracy theories, some harmless or thoughtful, others based on a wholesale rejection of science and still others promoted for financial or political gain. Thinking the Earth is flat is generally considered a more concerning conspiracy theory because it feeds into paranoia and leads people to an unhealthy skepticism of all science and credible authorities, said Blevins.\n\n“They’re not just primed to believe the Earth is flat, they’re primed to believe you can’t trust science, academics, the media or government,” he said. “And it might also lead you to see other extremist views as plausible.”\n\nWhat do flat-earthers believe?\n\nIn general, most flat-earthers believe Earth is a flat, hockey puck-like object covered by a dome, sometimes called a firmament, with walls of ice around the edges of the dome. They believe they can prove this because the seas appear level, not curved, and say it is not possible to view the curvature of the horizon from airplanes.\n\nThey also dispute photographic evidence from space, saying it cannot be trusted and that the NASA moon landing was a hoax.\n\nFact check:Antarctica is a continent, not an 'ice wall' around a flat Earth\n\nDoesn't a solar eclipse prove Earth is round?\n\nFlat-earthers don't see it that way, although they offer no unified alternative theory. In general, they think the sun and the moon glide above the ground at a much closer distance than astronomers have measured.\n\nTotal eclipse explained in graphicsWhat is a solar eclipse?\n\nDuring the last U.S. total solar eclipse, news site Mic.com cataloged numerous flat Earth objections to the scientific understanding of the eclipse, including the size of the shadow cast. More recently, a YouTube video promoting flat Earth ideas suggested the sun and moon are a similar size.\n\nBut scientists have a comprehensive understanding of how total solar eclipses occur. They happen when three spheres – the sun, moon and Earth – line up in a specific way in space.\n\nAccording to NASA, a solar eclipse happens when the moon passes between the sun and Earth. That alignment casts a moving shadow on Earth that either fully or partially blocks the sun's light in some areas. This leads to a period of partial or full darkness on a narrow stretch of Earth.\n\nThe path is so narrow because of the huge distance and size of the sun – as well as the moon's distance from Earth. That focuses the moon's shadow on an area of land much smaller than the moon itself. The movement of the shadow across the land happens as Earth's rotation interacts with the orbit of the moon.\n\nUSA TODAY 10BestThese 10 dreamy dark sky parks and places will leave you starry-eyed\n\nA total eclipse happens only occasionally, because the moon doesn't orbit in the exact same plane as the sun and Earth do. In addition, a solar eclipse can only happen during a new moon.\n\nThere are multiple videos and explanations online covering what happens in a solar eclipse. NASA will also live stream the total solar eclipse on April 8.\n\nFact check roundup:Debunking the flawed science behind flat Earth claims\n\nWhen did people learn Earth is round?\n\nThere is another, different, flat Earth error out in the world. This common mistake, popularized in the 19th century, suggested that prior to the rise of scientific study beginning in the 17th century, most people believed Earth to be flat.\n\nIn fact, the ancient Greeks figured out the Earth was round around 500 B.C., and it’s been commonly accepted by scholars, navigators and cartographers ever since.\n\nThe flat Earth belief as a kind of conspiracy theory popped up again in the mid-1800s in England. The Flat Earth Society was founded in 1956.\n\n\"It certainly is one of the oldest conspiracy theories,\" said Blevins.\n\nFlat-earthers had something of a renaissance beginning in the 2010s.\n\n\"That’s when social media really started to grow in popularity when you had 4chan and subreddits. You could find all sorts of wacky stuff out there, and it had a chance to reach a larger and larger audience,\" Blevins said.\n\nWhy do people believe in conspiracy theories?\n\nThere are three general reasons, says Karen Douglas, a professor of social psychology who researches conspiracy theories at the University of Kent in the United Kingdom.\n\nFact check:Ample evidence the Earth is round and sea levels are rising\n\nThe first is a desire to know the truth and have clarity and certainty. The second is the need to feel safe and to have some control over things happening around us. The third is the social need to maintain self-esteem and feel positive about the groups to which we belong.\n\n“Anyone can fall into conspiracy theories if they have psychological needs that are not being met at any particular time,” she said.\n\nDuring times of social change and uncertainty, conspiracy theories can be especially appealing.\n\n“This is perhaps one explanation why we tend to see a lot of conspiracy theories when things happen like sudden deaths of celebrities, or during pandemics,” said Douglas. “A simple explanation is often not very appealing for such a significant event. People assume that a big event must also have a big or more sinister cause.”\n\nContributing: Doyle Rice, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/03/23/2024-total-solar-exclipse-religious-implications/72869724007/", "title": "Solar eclipse offers evidence of spiritual meaning to some in 2024", "text": "Editor's note: An updated cloud forecast for the April 2024 total solar eclipse is in. Read the latest eclipse forecast and news as of Monday, April 8.\n\nOn April 8 in Gatesville, Texas, members of Coryell Community Church will congregate at the campus’ hilltop site where a trio of 70-foot crosses tower over the city of 17,000, 38 miles west of Waco.\n\nThe region lies in the center of the approaching solar eclipse’s path of totality, the last such event to affect the contiguous United States until 2044. Ancient cultures viewed the dusk-like darkness prompted by the passing of the moon between the Earth and the sun, temporarily blocking the sun’s light, as a sign of the gods’ anger or even their impending departure.\n\nInstead, Coryell’s “Eclipse of the Crosses” family gathering will feature live music, games and worship – an occasion to celebrate. Meanwhile, organizers at the Jewish Community Center of Greater Buffalo have bought a thousand eclipse glasses for a viewing event, complete with black-and-white half-moon cookies.\n\nWhat time is the 2024 solar eclipse?Here's when you should look up in your area\n\nAs the faithful convene in scattered Christian, Jewish and Muslim communities around the country, the gatherings reflect how celestial events once seen as ominous by some religious communities continue to wield spiritual significance today.\n\n“An eclipse is yet another opportunity to witness the handiwork of God that exists in the universe,” said Eric Moffett, Coryell’s lead pastor. “We aren’t looking for any omens in the cosmos, but we are using this as an opportunity to, for a little over four minutes, be reminded that we live in a world made by God and sustained by his love and goodness.”\n\nEclipses have inspired fear and awe among civilizations throughout history, from the Aztecs to the ancient Hindus. They're also associated with some major religious events, including the darkness that accompanied Jesus’ crucifixion in Christianity and, in Islam, the passing of the Prophet Muhammad’s son, Ibrahim.\n\nAs the Bible's Gospel of Mark 15:33 reads: \"And when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.\"\n\nSuch references often emphasize the power of God over the cosmos, said James Willis, an assistant professor of practice for religion at the University of Indianapolis.\n\n“What we today see as an astronomical event, people previously interpreted as having life-and-death significance,\" Willis said.\n\nEarlier this month, in the Choctaw Nation newspaper Biskinik, a recurring column exploring Choctaw culture noted the sun was considered to bring life and good fortune; for some communities, when solar eclipses occurred, it was as if great black squirrels in the sky were devouring the sun. In response, all were called upon to make noise to frighten them away.\n\nBradley Schaefer, a professor of astronomy at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, said in most pre-modern cultures, the sun god was among the most powerful deities in the pantheon. An eclipse represented the destruction of that god – or at least a dire sign.\n\n“Where better to put signs from the gods but in the heavens?” Schaefer said. “If you see a sign in the heavens, it’s got to be from the gods. They’re telling us something, and what was universal from culture to culture is that it was always bad.”\n\nIn Islam, eclipses offer an occasion to pray\n\nFourteen centuries ago, as Islam’s Muhammad and his supporters grieved his deathly ill son, the prophet watched the toddler breathe his last as the skies darkened above them – the beginning, it is believed, of a total eclipse.\n\nAs the story goes, speculation spread among Muhammad’s followers that even the sun and moon were grieving his loss. In response, he summoned them to prayer and dispelled that notion, but added that such events, as signs of God’s power, should nonetheless inspire them to pray.\n\nOmid Safi, a professor of Islamic studies at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, said tradition holds that both solar and lunar eclipses are “divine matters unfolding in nature” while honoring the prophet’s “steadfast refusal to use the fortuitous occasion of a solar eclipse at the passing of his son as a way of bolstering his own standing.”\n\nWhile Islam’s eclipse prayer is not a mandatory one, many still take time to recite it. During last fall’s annular eclipse, Muslim Americans around the U.S. gathered in places such as the Muslim Community Center–East Bay in Pleasanton, California; The Mecca Center in Willowbrook, Illinois; and Commons Park in Fridley, Minnesota.\n\nNadia Abuisnaineh, who volunteers as a NASA solar system ambassador in the Minneapolis area, organized the Minnesota event hoping not only to pique her community’s scientific curiosity but also its sense of identity as Muslims.\n\nStill, she had no idea the public gathering would come as Palestinians scrambled to evacuate northern Gaza in anticipation of a massive counteroffensive by Israeli forces, a week after the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas on Israel. The timing made the gathering all the more powerful, she said.\n\n“My community was very hurt, and for them, it was a time to reflect and ask God to alleviate the pain and suffering,” Abuisnaineh said. “I never imagined that five months later, with the second eclipse coming, that we would still have to think about this and be advocating for our brothers and sisters in Palestine.”\n\nThose who witnessed the October eclipse were overcome by the event, she recalled, in particular, two older people who were moved to tears.\n\n“Whether they were tears of grief because of what was happening in Gaza or just being overwhelmed by the eclipse and strengthening their relationship with God, it’s a privilege to allow people to do that,” she said.\n\nWith the April 8 event coming during the most intense period of Ramadan, Abuisnaineh isn’t planning to arrange another prayer gathering. Instead, she plans to remind community members to use the time to reflect.\n\nAn avid stargazer who takes any opportunity to view the night sky, she’s not about to miss a solar eclipse.\n\n“If it’s sunny, I’ll take out all my eclipse glasses and knock on every door in my neighborhood,” Abuisnaineh said. “It’s just a bummer to live your life and not know these things happen.”\n\nEclipse for kids?Decoding the sky: A definitive solar eclipse guide for kids (adults also welcome)\n\nA warning of God’s imminent wrath?\n\nPerspectives on eclipses vary widely within the Jewish community, said Mark Horowitz, chief operating officer for the Jewish Community Center of Greater Buffalo, New York. More conservative members, he said, still consider them warnings, especially for those in their path of totality.\n\n“There are a lot of people who don’t believe it’s a time for putting on glasses, getting together and drinking or whatever people are going to do,” Horowitz said. “Some people believe it’s a time for prayer and introspection.”\n\nThe Hebrew word for eclipse, he noted, translates to “defect.”\n\nWeather on eclipse day:Everything to know about Monday's total solar eclipse: Latest forecast includes optimism\n\n“When the luminaries are stricken, it is an ill omen for the world,” reads the Talmud, a central text of Judaism. The passage offers the example of a king who, after preparing a feast for his servants, becomes angry with them and orders the removal of the lantern illuminating their banquet.\n\nEven now, some say celestial happenings warn of God’s imminent wrath; some have even claimed they bear political significance. In November 2022, some ultraconservative Christian pastors said the approaching blood moon lunar eclipse portended a surge of Republican midterm wins.\n\n“God is warning America of impending disaster and destruction,” Anne Graham Lotz, daughter of iconic evangelist Billy Graham and founder of AnGel Ministries, wrote on her blog as the solar eclipse of August 2017 approached.\n\nMore recently, Lotz has seen speculation among some that the combined paths over the U.S. of this year’s eclipse and the previous two solar eclipses appear to mimic the shapes of the first and last letters of the Hebrew alphabet – in other words, the beginning and the end.\n\n“Maybe people are reading too much into it,” she said. “But when you look at the world, you don’t need an eclipse to know that things are getting really dangerous. Maybe it’s telling us it’s time to get right with God and the people in our lives so that we have no regrets.”\n\nEclipses offer a spiritual experience, even for nonbelievers\n\nSchaefer, of Louisiana State University, said as the science behind eclipses began to be understood, some used such knowledge to their advantage, among them Christopher Columbus, who in 1504 was shipwrecked with his crew in Jamaica and for months relied on local natives to provide food in exchange for trinkets.\n\nAs those gifts started to wear thin, the natives refused to continue, Schaefer said. Columbus seized on the idea of using an approaching lunar eclipse to convince the locals he could commune with the gods and make the moon disappear.\n\n“That’s the beauty of science, is when you make predictions they come true,” Schaefer said. “Columbus knew it was just a shadow. But the Jamaicans saw it as a death of a god. Once you understand what an eclipse is, it’s no longer the realm of the gods.”\n\nStill, he said, even the way Americans view eclipses has changed over time. Accounts of New Yorkers witnessing a total eclipse in 1924 described silent crowds of people solemnly taking it in.\n\n“Now it’s just raucous fun,” Schaefer said. “No one is fearful that Jupiter will come down and steal their soul.”\n\nWitnessing a solar eclipse, however, can provide a spiritual experience, even for those who aren’t necessarily religious, he and others said.\n\nFormer NASA engineers Jeff Stone and his wife, Susan, will be experiencing the eclipse from their hilltop home in Kerrville, Texas.\n\n“Her priority was to have a nice view,” Stone said. “My priority was to be as close to the centerline of the eclipse as possible. We managed to do both.”\n\nWhen they worked as flight controllers for the Space Shuttle program at Houston’s Johnson Space Center, the couple traveled to Mexico in 1991 to experience nearly seven minutes of totality when a solar eclipse passed over the region. They’ve been eclipse-chasers ever since.\n\nOn April 8, the Stones will host a dozen-plus visitors from as far away as Sweden to experience this year’s event.\n\n“It’s such an emotional event,” Stone said. “It touches your soul, it really does. Any time you realize there’s something bigger than you, it gives you perspective. Surely that power has a purpose.”\n\nIn Buffalo, Horowitz said the eclipse, an obvious reminder of nature’s beauty, offers a chance to reflect on nature’s fragility and to find hope amid worldly chaos and personal challenges.\n\n“You can sometimes be clouded by all that darkness,” he said. “The natural world is trying to tell us that beyond the darkness, there is light.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/03/22/planets-parade-mercury-venus-mars-jupiter-uranus/11522610002/", "title": "'Planetary parade': How to see Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and ...", "text": "Get ready for a \"planetary parade.\"\n\nA planetary alignment will soon happen, allowing people to see five planets – Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Uranus – in the night sky towards the end of March, Star Walk says.\n\nThis will be the first planetary alignment since June, when five planets were aligned in a in an event that hadn't happen in nearly 20 years.\n\nThis time, the visible planets will be seen in an arc that may require some extra technology to spot.\n\n\"Don’t forget to look to the sky the end of the month for the planetary alignment which will have at least five planets – plus the moon – all visible in almost an arc shape as seen from Earth,\" former astronaut Buzz Aldrin tweeted.\n\nWhen is the planetary alignment?\n\nThe planetary alignment will happen the evening of March 28, Star Walk said.

There was only two guys at practice the first week of practice. We wasn’t even going to have a program. He told us, even with two guys in the gym, we going to the state championship. We going to be state champions.”\n\nWhy did Avent believe?\n\nHe’d won a pair of sectional titles with Woodbury earlier in his career, and though only a few players were out early, he knew the talent he had coming into the gym.\n\nHe also had a simple game plan – play defense and hustle for 32 minutes.\n\nThe Tigers most certainly did that.\n\nMore:All-South Jersey Boys Basketball Teams for the 2021-22 season\n\nTheir pressure D became one of the fiercest in South Jersey, if not the state. They allowed just 46.5 points per game minus their two matchups with powerhouse Camden.\n\nTheir never-quit mindset showed up time and again too as they tended to play their best basketball in the fourth quarter.\n\nWoodrow Wilson nearly beat Egg Harbor Township in its opener despite falling behind 25-5 in the first quarter. It defeated Paul VI twice with rallies in the final period and won its first state championship since 1985 by coming back in the final minute against Ramapo.\n\n“Our motto is every day we get better,” Avent said. “We don’t say that just to say it. We say it because we believe it and the only way we can get better is we come work hard with 100 percent effort. … I ask ’em when it’s required, (they respond) all the time. All the time.”\n\nThe Tigers lauded their coach for pushing them to be their best.\n\n“It’s all a trust thing,” Avent said. “They have to trust me and believe in the process and believe I know what I’m doing and what I’m bringing to the table, and I have to trust them, and trust is earned.

The disclosure came Monday at a court hearing over inmate Alan Miller’s request to block his scheduled Sept. 22 execution by lethal injection. Miller maintains that prison staff lost paperwork he returned in 2018 requesting nitrogen hypoxia, an execution method that the state has authorized but never used. U.S. District Judge R. Austin Huffaker Jr. asked whether Alabama was ready to carry out executions by nitrogen hypoxia. James Houts, a deputy state attorney general, said the method could be available as soon as next week. He said, however, that a final decision on when to use the new method would be up to Corrections Commissioner John Hamm. The Alabama Department of Corrections did not respond to an email seeking comment about the status of the proposed new execution method. Nitrogen hypoxia, which is supposed to cause death by replacing oxygen with nitrogen, has been authorized by Alabama and two other states for executions but has never used by a state. Huffaker noted the “high stakes” involved with a looming execution date but did not immediately rule on the request to block the lethal injection.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Joseph Hazelwood, the captain of the Exxon Valdez oil tanker that ran aground more than three decades ago, causing one of the worst oil spills in U.S. history, has died, the New York Times reports. He was 75. He died in July after struggling with COVID-19 and cancer, his nephew Sam Hazelwood told the newspaper. The Exxon Valdez, a 987-foot tanker, grounded on Alaska’s Bligh Reef at 12:04 a.m. March 24, 1989, spewing nearly 11 million gallons of oil into the rich fishing waters of Prince William Sound. Currents and storms carried the crude over 1,200 miles of Alaska coastline. The Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council estimates the spill killed a quarter-million seabirds, 2,800 sea otters, 300 harbor seals, 250 bald eagles, up to 22 killer whales and billions of fish eggs. It took years for the fish numbers to rebound following the spill, and oil can still be found under the surface of some beaches in Prince William Sound. Hazelwood, whom prosecutors accused of being drunk when the tanker grounded, was the only crew member criminally charged after the spill. He had left a third mate in control of the ship while he went below to do paperwork. Hazelwood was accused of one felony, criminal mischief, and three misdemeanors – reckless endangerment, operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil.\n\nArizona\n\nLees Ferry: The National Park Service will poison a Colorado River side channel below Glen Canyon Dam to remove fish that threaten native species, the agency announced. Meanwhile, biologists warn, rising temperatures and declining oxygen levels in water the dam releases into the river’s Lees Ferry stretch are stressing the popular trout fishery there. Nonnative smallmouth bass are known to have passed through the dam’s hydropower-generating turbines for several years to reach the Lees Ferry area, but their successful breeding at that stretch was not documented until this year. If it continues, agency officials fear, bass could establish themselves far downstream and eat humpback chubs, which are protected as a threatened species. “Threats to the native fish are increasing due to the warmer temperatures of water passing through the dam and related increased river temperatures below the dam,” said a statement released by Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, which includes the river segment. The park service announced it will treat the slough with the fish killer rotenone Saturday and Sunday. While the plant-derived chemical is commonly used by fish managers, and the park service said it will carefully protect the environment and human health by isolating it in the slough, at least one Native American tribe with cultural links to the river and Grand Canyon has objected. The Zuni Pueblo of New Mexico consider the river and canyon sacred.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: Jason Andrew Vineyard, a Sebastian County Election Commission chairman, has a felony conviction that makes him ineligible to vote and has reportedly been removed from the position. Sebastian County Prosecuting Attorney Daniel Shue said Monday that Vineyard, 43, a Republican, has a 2003 felony conviction. Shue sent a letter to Sharon Brooks, Sebastian County Clerk, notifying the office that Vineyard is ineligible to vote, despite the fact he had continued to cast ballots in elections since his conviction. The letter says that Shue was responding to a recent request from Brooks on whether Vineyard is ineligible to vote. Lee Webb, Democrat election commissioner, said Monday that he was not aware if Vineyard had been removed as chairman. Either the Circuit Court or the Sebastian County Republican Party could remove Vineyard. But Larry Bishop, chairman of the Sebastian County Republican Committee, told reporters Vineyard had been removed from the commission Monday. “It is part of a long list of stuff that has been going on the last few months,” Webb said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Gov. Gavin Newsom wants voters to reject a new tax on rich people that would pay for more electric vehicles in the nation’s most populous state, warning in a new statewide TV ad that a measure on the ballot this November won’t help the environment but is instead “one company’s cynical scheme to grab a huge taxpayer subsidy.” Proposition 30 would raise taxes on people who make more than $2 million per year. It would generate up to $5 billion in new tax money each year, most of which would go to programs that help people buy electric cars and install charging stations. A smaller amount would go to wildfire prevention response and prevention programs. The ballot measure’s campaign is paid for by the ride-hailing company Lyft. Last year, state regulators ordered companies like Lyft to make sure nearly all their rides are in electric vehicles by 2030. Newsom says the ballot measure is Lyft’s attempt to make taxpayers pay for that. “Don’t be fooled. Prop 30’s been advertised as a climate initiative. But in reality, it was devised by a single corporation to funnel state income taxes to benefit their company,” Newsom says in the ad, which will air in all of the state’s major media markets. “Put simply, Prop 30 is a Trojan horse that puts corporate welfare above the fiscal welfare of our entire state.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Police who shot a 22-year-old man after he called 911 for roadside assistance escalated the situation, needlessly leading to his death, the man’s relatives said in a tearful news conference Tuesday in which they called for accountability. After Christian Glass’ June 11 death in the small mountain town of Silver Plume west of Denver, the Clear Creek County Sheriff’s office issued a news release saying Glass was shot after he became “argumentative and uncooperative” and tried to stab an officer when police broke a car window to grab him. “Christian was experiencing a crisis, and he called 911 for help,” said the parents’ attorney, Siddhartha Rathod, “and yet these officers busted out Christian’s window, shot him six times with bean bag rounds, Tased him multiple times from two Tasers, and then shot him five times.” The Colorado Bureau of Investigation handles police shootings, including the Glass case, but the family wants prosecutors to file criminal charges, Rathod said. Videos shared with the Associated Press show Glass refusing to come out of his car while also telling police he’s “terrified” and making heart shapes with his hands to officers. At one point, he also can be seen praying with folded hands and saying, “Dear Lord, please, don’t let them break the window.” When the officers do break the window, Glass seems to panic and grabs a knife.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: An FBI agent struggled to control his emotions Tuesday as he described on the witness stand seeing bodies inside Sandy Hook elementary school – a scene that the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones later claimed was staged by actors. FBI agent William Aldenberg was the first witness to testify as a Connecticut jury began hearing statements in a trial to decide how much money Jones owes for spreading the lie that the 2012 mass shooting in Newtown didn’t happen. Aldenberg broke down as he described being among the first law enforcement officers to enter the two classrooms where 20 children died. “Was what you saw in that school fake?” asked attorney Christopher Mattei, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. “No,” Aldenberg said. “It’s awful. It’s awful.” He also testified about how he and others in the community and law enforcement were targeted with threats and conspiracy theories, including one that claimed he was an actor who also pretended to be the father of a victim. The trial in Waterbury – less than 20 miles from Newtown, where the children and six teachers were shot to death – was attended by more than a dozen family members of victims, including David Wheeler, the father who conspiracy theorists had claimed was the same person as Aldenberg.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: The City Council has set a public hearing for Oct.3 to discuss a new ordinance that distinguishes short-term and long-term rentals and establishes certain rules for each. One Lewes couple said they’ve lived in the quaint, historic beach town for more than three decades, but it wasn’t until more recently that they started to see their neighborhood change. As more of the homeowners on their street began to offer short-term rentals through sites like Airbnb and Vrbo, they noticed that their quiet community would drastically switch from a near “ghost town” to “busy beach town” within the turn of a weekend. Knowing that Lewes typically has more year-round residents than many of its neighboring resort towns, another resident who commented at a city meeting last year said he worried that the sense of community in Lewes would start to break down if short-term rentals soon dominated. These residents all had concerns about how these rentals would affect their quality of life – from pressures on parking to issues with trash or noise – if the city did not specifically regulate short-term rentals. For at least the past year, the City Council, the city manager and a designated short-term rental committee have been discussing how to manage these rentals and ensure they do not add costs to the city.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Washington Spirit fans can travel to games with new commemorative Metro SmarTrip cards celebrating their National Women’s Soccer League Championship win, WUSA-TV reports. The transit cards feature an image of the team hoisting the championship trophy after the title-winning game. The limited-edition cards are being sold at Navy Yard, Waterfront and Gallery Place stations in specially marked fare machines topped with a sign. The NWSL championship cards arrive just in time for soccer fans headed to Saturday’s game at Audi Field against the NJ/NY Gotham FC. “We are excited to honor the Spirit, reigning NWSL champs, with this commemorative card. The Spirit’s title run continues the winning tradition in the District of Champions,” Metro General Manager/CEO Randy Clarke said in a statement. “Metro is proud to support the team and fans getting to and from games.” The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority produced 10,000 of the commemorative cards, and they are only available on a first-come, first-served basis. Fans looking to grab the cards can meet up with starting midfielder Anna Heilferty at the Gallery Place station to grab a card and say hello starting at 4 p.m. Sept. 13.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: State health officials are fining an Orlando abortion clinic $193,000 for violating a law requiring a 24-hour waiting period before abortions are performed, according to a case assigned to an administrative judge Tuesday. The Florida Agency for Health Care Administration filed the complaint against the Center of Orlando for Women this summer. The mandatory 24-hour waiting period rule for abortions in Florida was signed into law in 2015 and was upheld by a judge in April after a nearly seven-year court case. State regulators used patient records to determine the clinic performed 193 abortions that violated the 24-hour waiting period rule between late April and early May of this year, the complaint said. State law allows for a fine of $1,000 per violation of the waiting period law. A clinic manager told officials she was aware of the law but did not know when it became effective, according to the complaint. A lawyer representing the center said the facility contacted the state several times to inquire about the law’s effective date, given the lengthy legal battle over the rule, but received no additional information. “It would be disastrous for the clinic if they had to pay a $193,000 fine to keep their license,” attorney Julie Gallagher said in an interview Tuesday. At least two other Florida clinics are facing similar but smaller fines.\n\nGeorgia\n\nStatham: Republican Gov. Brian Kemp said Monday that he wants the state to provide grants to school districts to help students catch up on what they might have missed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, expand the number of school counselors, encourage teacher aides to become full-fledged teachers and pass a law requiring school lockdown drills. Kemp unveiled a relatively modest set of K-12 education proposals as part of his second-term reelection effort at an elementary school in Oconee County where one of his daughters was a teacher last year. “We have more work to do to address pandemic learning loss, bring more educators and counselors into our schools, and keep our students and staff safe,” Kemp said at Dove Creek Elementary School in Statham, just outside Athens. Kemp made a $5,000 pay raise for teachers a centerpiece of his agenda when he was running in 2018 and delivered the final chunk of the money this year, but he didn’t propose a pay raise for his second term Monday, although in response to reporter questions, he said he would “continue to work support all state employees to make the pay scale competitive in the future.” Democrat Stacey Abrams, who is running against Kemp, has proposed boosting average teacher pay over four years to $75,000 and guaranteeing a starting salary of $50,000.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Gov. David Ige on Monday appointed several people, including some prominent Native Hawaiian activists, to a new board charged with managing Mauna Kea summit lands underneath some of the world’s most advanced astronomical observatories. Two of the eight appointees – Lanakila Mangauil and Noe Noe Wong-Wilson – were leaders of 2019 protests that brought a halt to the construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope, the latest observatory proposed for the mountain on Hawaii’s Big Island. Many Native Hawaiians consider the summit sacred, and protesters objected to building yet another telescope there. The summit currently hosts about a dozen telescopes built since the late 1960s. Responding to the protests, the state created the Mauna Kea Stewardship and Oversight Authority this year with a new law that says Mauna Kea must be protected for future generations, and science must be balanced with culture and the environment. Native Hawaiian cultural experts will have voting seats on the governing body, instead of merely advising the summit’s managers as they do now. The eight nominations must be confirmed by the state Senate. The authority will have 11 voting members. The other three are representatives of the Board of Land and Natural Resources, the University of Hawaii Board of Regents and Hawaii County’s mayor.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Chipmaker Micron’s planned $15 billion investment in a new factory in the company’s hometown of Boise will help protect the United States from the vulnerabilities of a globalized semiconductor market, U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said Monday. “It is time to get America making things again, with American parts and American labor,” Granholm told a crowd of about 250 guests and Micron workers invited to a tent-covered dirt field for a ceremonial groundbreaking. The event included setting off a ground-clearing explosion far from the crowd that emitted red, white and blue smoke. The U.S. and Europe are pushing aggressively to build chipmaking capacity and reduce reliance on producers that are now mostly based in Asia. Semiconductor businesses have also been trying to diversify their operations to avoid bottlenecks caused by problems – such as a natural disaster or pandemic lockdown – in a specific region. Micron officials said that the high desert, sagebrush steppe area east of Boise is expected to have the largest chipmaking cleanroom, or fab, in the U.S. by the end of the decade, covering 600,000 square feet and creating 17,000 jobs. Construction is expected to start in 2023, with some cleanroom working space ready by 2025 and expanding in phases. Micron is among the nation’s largest chipmakers, with product development sites in five other states and eight countries. Research and development is centered in Boise.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Anne Burke, chief justice of the Illinois Supreme Court, announced her retirement Monday. The 78-year-old jurist will end her 16-year high-court tenure Nov. 30. “I have been blessed to serve as a Supreme Court Justice,” Burke said in a statement. “The past three years as chief justice have been a challenging time due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but I am thrilled with the progress made by the Illinois courts.” The seven-member court, which has the authority to fill interim vacancies, has chosen Joy Cunningham, a justice on the First District Appellate Court, to take Burke’s place. Cunningham will be the court’s second Black woman. The first took her oath just three months ago. Lisa Holder White was appointed to replace the retiring Rita Garman. Burke herself replaced the first woman on the court, Mary Ann McMorrow, in 2006. Burke will leave just weeks after the fall election, in which two seats are up for grabs, and Republicans hope to gain control of the court for the first time in decades. Burke’s husband, Edward Burke, a Chicago alderman for half a century, is scheduled to go on trial next year on federal racketeering and extortion charges. He has pleaded not guilty and denies wrongdoing.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Local leaders and community stakeholders have highlighted a proposal to include money for a pilot clinician-led emergency response program in the city’s proposed budget – an initiative at the heart of calls for reform following the death of Herman Whitfield III in police custody during a mental health crisis in April. Mayor Joe Hogsett, alongside representatives from the Office of Public Health and Safety, the City-County Council and Faith in Indiana, voiced their support last week for the program, which would require $2 million in the city’s proposed operating budget for 2023. The program and its budget still need approval from the full City-County Council in October. If it passes, the pilot is expected to begin next year and would include 24-hour coverage of teams made up of mental health clinicians and experts in a limited number of Indianapolis police districts who can respond to calls for nonviolent mental health help. The proposed budget item would also include money to increase mental health expertise at the 911 dispatch center. “This team would be equipped to provide meaningful support for those who in years past would have spent the length of their crisis in a jail cell,” Hogsett said. “This is because we recognize that police are not health care providers and our jails are not hospitals.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The second-largest school district in the state improperly and repeatedly shut students with disabilities in seclusion rooms and restrained them in violation of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act, federal authorities said Monday. The U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division and the federal prosecutor for the Northern District of Iowa announced a settlement with the Cedar Rapids Community School District in which school officials have agreed to end the use of seclusion rooms and reform its restraint practices. The district based in Cedar Rapids, about 120 miles east of Des Moines, also promised in the settlement agreement to improve staff training on how to address and de-escalate students’ disability-related behavior through appropriate measures. A justice department investigation found that the district subdued students with disabilities through unnecessary restraints and improper confinement in small seclusion rooms, sometimes multiple times in a day and often for excessive periods of time. The investigation covered the three school years ending in 2019, 2020 and 2021. Investigators found 4,968 incidents where students were secluded, restrained or transported from class and more than 83% of cases involved a student with a disability.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A Topeka police officer hit a car while driving drunk last October, then told police his wife had hit it, says the body that voided his law enforcement certification last month. The Kansas Commission on Peace Officers’ Standards and Training revoked the certification of Steven Dorsey Smith, it said on its website Aug. 15. “Respondent’s conduct shows that he lacks the personal qualities of integrity, upholding the laws of the state, conduct that warrants the public trust, and upholding the oath required for certification,” the website said. Smith was employed by the city of Topeka from Oct. 7, 2019, through Jan. 21, 2022, said Gretchen Spiker, the city’s communications director. Smith was put on leave after the crash, Spiker said, and he resigned during the investigation, which continued even after he left the department. The investigation’s findings were then sent to the statewide commission. “While unfortunate, the city feels this is an example of an investigation that was handled with the utmost integrity,” she said, “and that all best practices were followed.” Kansas statute empowers KSCPOST to revoke the certification of officers whose actions show they aren’t of good moral character sufficient to warrant public trust in them.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: Three country music superstars, all natives of Kentucky, will come together for a concert to aid victims of this summer’s catastrophic flooding in the eastern part of the commonwealth. Chris Stapleton, Dwight Yoakam and Tyler Childers have announced the Kentucky Rising benefit concert, a special, one-night-only show that will be held at Lexington’s Rupp Arena on Oct. 11. A full 100% of net proceeds from the concert will benefit the Kentucky Rising Fund to support flood relief work and recovery efforts in eastern Kentucky, including support for the many victims, their families and first responders. In August, 39 people died as a result of devasting flooding in parts of eastern Kentucky. The flooding also destroyed many homes, roadways and other infrastructure. Both Childers and Stapleton stepped up in different ways to help out their home state in the days immediately following the flooding. Tickets for the benefit concert go on sale Friday. Visit KentuckyRising.com for more information. For Citi cardmembers, the official presale credit card of Kentucky Rising, sales began Tuesday and run through Thursday at 10 p.m. through CitiEntertainment.com.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The U.S. Department of the Interior said Monday that it wants to reverse some Trump administration rollbacks of offshore safety rules to prevent blowouts like the BP catastrophe that killed 11 people and fouled the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. “This proposed rulemaking will help ensure that offshore energy development utilizes the latest science and technology to keep people safe,” Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in remarks prepared for an afternoon announcement. “As our nation transitions to a clean energy economy, we must commit to strengthening and modernizing offshore energy standards and oversight.” The changes are a step in the right direction but not far enough, said Diane Hoskins of the ocean environmental nonprofit Oceana. “No operator can promise there won’t be another disaster like BP’s Deepwater Horizon blowout. The only way to prevent offshore drilling disasters is to permanently protect our coasts and workers from new offshore leasing,” she said. Under Trump, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement acted in 2019 to change rules put in place three years earlier while Barack Obama was president. The agency is proposing to change seven out of the scores of revisions and additions made in 2010, director Kevin M. Sligh Sr. said.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The governor said Tuesday that the federal government is moving ahead too quickly with potential new restrictions on the lobster fishing industry and isn’t taking the industry’s concerns about the changes into account. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently announced it was seeking input on new rules to reduce risk to rare whales. The North Atlantic right whales number less than 340, and they are vulnerable to entanglement in lobster fishing gear. Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, said the agency’s plan to provide only one chance for public comment about the new rules later this month is not sufficient. She wrote in a letter to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, who oversees NOAA, that lack of input from fishermen will put coastal industries and communities at risk. “As NOAA well knows, effectively reaching an audience of fishermen with challenging schedules absolutely requires in-person meetings and opportunities for comment,” Mills said. The protection of the lobster industry has emerged as an issue in Mills’ reelection race this year. Her opponent, Republican former Gov. Paul LePage, said last week that he would push back at the “Biden administration’s destructive regulatory policy aimed at destroying the livelihoods of our fishermen over the false notion they are harming whales.”\n\nMaryland\n\nFrederick: Five western Maryland police officers won’t face charges in a man’s death that occurred days after officers shocked him with a stun gun during an altercation, officials announced Monday. Frederick police said Daniel Michael Holley, 23, died at a hospital Nov. 14, two days after officers used a stun gun to subdue him, news outlets report. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner is still trying to determine the exact cause of Holley’s death, but the report rules out the officers’ actions as a cause, officials said. The Office of the Attorney General looked into the incident, and nothing in the initial report from the office’s Independent Investigations Division led officials to believe that there was a basis for prosecution, Frederick County State’s Attorney Charlie Smith said. Officers were called to a home for a report of a person behaving erratically and found Holley nude, pacing and talking incoherently, police said. Body camera footage showed an officer use a stun gun after Holley tackled another officer. Officers requested emergency medical services, and Holley was taken to a hospital, where he died, officials said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: President Joe Biden on Monday urged Americans to come together for a new “national purpose” – his administration’s effort to end cancer “as we know it.” At the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, Biden channeled JFK’s famed moonshot speech 60 years ago, likening the space race to his own effort and hoping it, too, would galvanize Americans. “He established a national purpose that could rally the American people and a common cause,” Biden said of Kennedy’s space effort. “We can usher in the same unwillingness to postpone.” Biden hopes to move the U.S. closer to the goal he set in February of cutting U.S. cancer fatalities by 50% over the next 25 years and dramatically improving the lives of caregivers and those suffering from cancer. Experts say the objective is attainable – with adequate investments. Dr. Michael Hassett, of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, said Biden’s goal to reduce cancer deaths could be met by following two parallel paths: one of discovery and the other making sure as many people as possible are reaping the advantages of existing therapies and preventive approaches. “If we can address both aspects, both challenges, major advances are possible,” Hassett said.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The chief justice of the state Supreme Court said Monday that she will step down by the end of 2022, an announcement that followed a major decision affecting abortion rights and more than two years of steering Michigan’s judiciary through the COVID-19 pandemic. Bridget McCormack, a Democratic Party nominee, has been on the court since 2013 and still had six years left in her second term. “After a decade, the time has come for me to move on, to let others lead, and to build on a foundation of progress,” McCormack, 56, said in a statement. She said she would resign no earlier than Nov. 22 and no later than Dec. 31. The timing will depend on the appointment of her successor. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said she will pick a new justice, apparently no matter the results of the Nov. 8 election. Whitmer, a Democrat seeking reelection, called her a “phenomenal public servant.” McCormack is leaving to become president of an international provider of dispute-resolution services, the American Arbitration Association-International Centre for Dispute Resolution announced Tuesday. Kimberly Wiehl, leader of the group’s governing board, said the organization was looking for someone who has “outstanding business acumen” and is committed to expanding access to resolving disputes outside court.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: Local police and the FBI are investigating a break-in at a mosque as a bias-motivated crime. According to a press release from the St. Cloud Police Department, officers were called to the Islamic Center at 375 Fifth Ave. S early Thursday. Islamic Center of St. Cloud President Mohayadin Mohamed said the damage was discovered as individuals began to arrive for morning prayer. Police said a man and woman had damaged a door to enter the mosque, then caused damage inside. Both suspects were found before 7 a.m. at a nearby hotel and taken into custody. Mohamed said surveillance footage showed the two inside the mosque for two hours, roughly 1-3 a.m. He said they went into every space; caused damage to an exterior door, office space and the building’s downstairs area; and brought alcohol into the building. Consuming alcohol is forbidden in Islam. CAIR-MN, the Minnesota chapter of national Islamic civil liberties and advocacy group Council on American Islamic Relations, held a press conference at the center Friday morning regarding the incident, which CAIR-MN Executive Director Jaylani Hussein said the group is asking be investigated as a hate crime.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The city hasn’t paid for its trash to be picked up in more than five months, as the mayor and City Council are locked in a battle over who truly won the bidding process, but Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said his administration is proposing a public referendum in which Jackson residents could pick between Waste Management, whose bid a majority of the City Council supports, and Richard’s Disposal, whose bid his administration supports. After the request for proposal blind-bidding process was completed, the mayor’s office maintained that Richard’s won, but the council refused to approve a contract, claiming that Waste Management had been victorious. That led to Lumumba attempting to veto the council’s no-vote on the Richard’s contract. A specially appointed judge ruled that Lumumba could not veto a no-vote, but the mayor has appealed that decision to the state Supreme Court. Lumumba said at his weekly news conference Monday that he trusts the will of the voters to resolve the dispute. The mayor said his legal team has researched statutes on referendums and consulted with the state auditor’s office in order to ensure that such a vote would be legal. Whether one will end up happening now rests with the council.\n\nMissouri\n\nStockton: A Christian boarding school in southwestern Missouri can remain open despite the state attorney general alleging a “dark pattern of behavior,” a judge ruled Monday. Judge David Munton’s ruling allows continued round-the-clock monitoring of Agape Boarding School in Stockton by Missouri child welfare workers. The school serves about 60 boys. The Kansas City Star reported that the state was prepared to call two former Agape students to testify Monday. Agape attorney John Schultz told the judge that there was no proof of any immediate health or safety concern for students and that allowing former students to testify was “simply for publicity,” the Star reports. The judge didn’t allow the testimony but scheduled another hearing for Sept. 21. Attorney General Eric Schmitt’s office first sought to shut down Agape last Wednesday after learning that someone on the state registry for child abuse and neglect was actively working there. On Friday, the attorney general’s office filed an amended motion alleging systemic abuse. “Agape’s operation of a residential care facility must cease because it presents an immediate health and safety concern for the children residing at Agape,” the court filing said. It also accused Agape of providing the state with incomplete information concerning which adults have access to children.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: U.S. officials have withdrawn parcels of public land near the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation from future mining to protect a reclamation area where more than $80 million has been spent to clean up past mining contamination. Mining will be barred for 20 years on 4 square miles of land at the Zortman-Landusky Mine site now administered by the Bureau of Land Management. Canada-based mining company Pegasus Gold Inc. declared bankruptcy in 1998, leaving cleanup at the site to U.S. taxpayers. The BLM has previously said the remaining cleanup work could cost about $70 million and involve moving millions of tons of waste rock and treating hundreds of millions of gallons of water in coming decades. Contaminated water from the shuttered mine site has flowed downstream to the Fort Belknap reservation and fouled its water. Treatment of mine water to prevent further contamination will continue indefinitely, the BLM said in announcing the Sept. 9 withdrawal. About 5.4 square miles were withdrawn from mining in 2000, but that action expired in 2020. A proposal for a new withdrawal on the remainder of the land – about 1.4 square miles – is pending.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Fifteen years after being rejected as too controversial, Malcolm X is the first Black honoree to be inducted into the Nebraska Hall of Fame. The organization’s commission selected the civil rights icon Monday with a 4-3 vote, edging out the late University of Nebraska educator and author Louise Pound. “Malcolm X used the lessons he learned early in life and his intellectual power, dedication and perseverance in the fight for freedom and equality for all during the civil rights movement in America,” said commission Chairman Ron Hull. “His work and his legacy continue to impact the citizens of the world.” Malcolm X was born Malcolm Little in Omaha in 1925 as the son of a Baptist preacher. His family left for Milwaukee the following year after threats from the Ku Klux Klan. The firebrand was first nominated for Nebraska’s Hall of Fame in 2004 but passed over by a commission made up solely of white men who instead selected a U.S. senator who made a name for himself with his campaign to remove gay men from government posts in the 1940s and 1950s. The pick of Sen. Kenneth Wherry was later nixed because of an open-meetings violation. Malcolm X was passed over again in 2007 for little-known botanist Charles Bessey. Each Nebraska Hall of Fame member is immortalized with a bronze bust displayed in the state Capitol.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Demolition has begun at two Las Vegas-area casino properties had been shuttered since the start of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020. A spokesman for Station Casinos declined to comment about work that began Monday at Texas Station in North Las Vegas and Fiesta Henderson in Henderson. Work has not begun at the company’s closed Fiesta Rancho, which is also slated to be razed. Red Rock Resorts, the publicly traded corporate owner of the properties, announced in July that the three casino-hotels would be demolished, and the land on which they sit will be sold. Fiesta Rancho opened in 1994 off Rancho Drive near North Las Vegas Airport, and Texas Station opened across the street in 1995. Fiesta Henderson opened as The Reserve in 1998 off U.S. 95 and was acquired by Station Casinos in 2001. Station Casinos markets its off-Strip properties to Las Vegas residents. It is building a new property, Durango Casino & Resort, off the 215 Beltway southwest of the Las Vegas Strip. Station owns six other casino-hotels in and around Las Vegas and is building a new site near a crossroads southwest of the Las Vegas Strip. It also operates several non-hotel Wildfire properties.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state Department of Justice is seeking to assuage concerns about a new state law curbing some enforcement of federal firearms laws. School officials can still report potential shooters on campus, Attorney General John Formella wrote this month. New Hampshire State Police officers can still confiscate weapons from alleged domestic abusers, the New Hampshire Bulletin reports. A new federal firearms law closing the “boyfriend loophole” will still apply in the state. The legal interpretations, issued in a nine-page opinion Sept. 1, are part of an effort by the department to provide more information and cool tensions around the new law, which prevents state and local officials from enforcing federal firearms laws that are not replicated in state law. “Unless expressly delegated by a federal law enforcement agency, state and local law enforcement have never had the authority or jurisdiction to enforce or administer federal firearms violations or laws,” the department wrote in an accompanying “Frequently Asked Questions” document. “HB 1178 has not changed this.” The law was championed by Republicans and Second Amendment advocates as a partial bulwark against federal firearms laws and rules, which include agency rules from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Workers can’t be fired just for testing positive for marijuana, under new guidelines the state released Friday. The long-awaited interim regulations for the nascent industry came as a relief to employers, who said they had been left in the dark on how to keep their workplace free of drugs. While a positive drug test for marijuana won’t by itself be grounds to fire or discipline a staffer or to decline to hire someone, an employee could still be let go if they’re also shown to be under the influence during work hours. “Striking a balance between workplace safety and work performance and adult employees’ right to privacy and to consume cannabis during their off hours is possible,” said a statement from Jeff Brown, executive director of the state Cannabis Regulatory Commission, which oversees the state’s marijuana industry. “We have been doing that with alcohol without thought.” For workers and bosses, the situation has been complicated by medical uncertainty ever since sales began April 21, as well as by fears of how weed could affect worker performance in high-risk jobs with little room for error. Pot and alcohol affect the human body differently, so long-established protocols for substance-free workplaces and gauging if someone’s under the influence hadn’t necessarily applied.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is using a visit to Washington to celebrate Democrats’ flagship U.S. climate and health care bill and to advocate for addition federal wildfire relief. The Democratic governor said she was traveling to Tuesday’s celebration of the Inflation Reduction Act at the invitation of President Joe Biden. Signed in August, the law could save money for some Americans by lessening the cost of prescription drugs for the elderly, extending health insurance subsidies and reducing energy prices. The legislation represents Congress’ largest-ever investment in curbing carbon emissions. It would also modestly cut the government’s budget deficit. While in Washington, the 62-year-old governor and skiing enthusiast also planned to consult with an orthopedic surgeon about a lingering knee injury. Campaign related activities in Washington and New York are scheduled before the Lujan Grisham’s planned return to New Mexico on Friday. Lujan Grisham is seeking a second term in the November general election against Republican nominee and former television meteorologist Mark Ronchetti. He is campaigning on proposals for a permanent annual tax rebate tied oil-field production, new restrictions on abortion access and enhanced criminal penalties to address crime.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The man who shot and killed John Lennon outside his Manhattan apartment building in 1980 has been denied parole for a 12th time, New York corrections officials said Monday. Mark David Chapman, 67, appeared before a parole board at the end of August, according to the state Department of Corrections and Community Supervision. Chapman shot and killed Lennon on the night of Dec. 8, 1980, as Lennon and Yoko Ono were returning to their Upper West Side apartment. Lennon had signed an autograph for Chapman on a copy of his and Ono’s recently released album, “Double Fantasy,” earlier that day. State officials have yet to make transcripts of Chapman’s latest board interview available, but he has repeatedly expressed remorse in previous parole hearings. Chapman called his actions “despicable” during his hearing in 2020 and said he would have “no complaint whatsoever” if they chose to leave him in prison for the rest of his life. “I assassinated him … because he was very, very, very famous, and that’s the only reason, and I was very, very, very, very much seeking self-glory. Very selfish,” Chapman said then. He is serving a 20-years-to-life sentence at Green Haven Correctional Facility, north of New York City, according to online state corrections records.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nGraham: A judge has dismissed a lawsuit by civil rights leaders that sought the removal of a Confederate statue in front of a historic courthouse. Superior Court Judge Don Bridges ruled Tuesday against the state NAACP, which had argued that the statue in front of the Alamance County Courthouse was a danger to public safety and violated constitutional rights to equal protection, according to The Times-News. A 2015 state law sharply limits state and local governments from removing Confederate statues and other objects of remembrance. The NAACP had argued in its 2021 lawsuit that county officials had leeway to remove the statue under an exception for public safety. The statue, erected in 1914, has been the site of protests in recent years. Separately, North Carolina’s governor ordered the removal of Confederate monuments outside the state’s historic Capitol in 2020, citing the public safety clause in the law after nearby monuments were damaged by protesters. Demonstrators have toppled other statues in recent years on the campus of the University of North Carolina and in downtown Durham. But Bridges said that he interprets the state law as protecting the Alamance County statue and that the local county commission is entitled to follow it.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Legalizing recreational pot could cut the number of people who are registered to use the drug as medicine by at least 80%, due to access to bigger quantities and more varied products, a state health official said Monday. Supporters of legalizing recreational cannabis in North Dakota succeeded last month in bringing the matter to a public vote in November by submitting more than the required 15,582 valid petition signatures to get it on the ballot. The state has issued more than 8,200 identification cards to qualifying patients since voters approved medical marijuana in 2016. North Dakota’s approved medical marijuana forms are dried leaves and flowers, concentrates, tinctures, capsules, topicals and transdermal patches. Edibles were part of the original initiative, but the Legislature removed them from the list, fearing they could get in the hands of children. The initiative on the ballot in November would allow people 21 and up to legally use marijuana at home, as well as possess and cultivate restricted amounts. Edibles would be allowed. Medical Marijuana Division Director Jason Wahl said thousands medical marijuana users may only purchase 2.5 ounces of cannabis flower in a 30-day period. Recreational users could potentially – though illegally – purchase at least that amount in a single day, as “none of that is tracked,” Wahl said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: An educational experiment happening in one of the city’s poorest neighborhoods could expand to a national model, using tax dollars to establish religious schools. Last month 31 children from the Hilltop and Franklintown areas began attending a new school called Westside Christian inside converted Sunday school classrooms at Memorial Baptist Church. Founders of this “micro-school” call it a new, low-cost way to open private schools in underserved communities using state education dollars – known in Ohio as EdChoice vouchers – instead of private donations. And if it’s successful, they hope to open hundreds more. “Our goal is five to 10 more in Ohio next yea,” Center for Christian Virtue Executive Director Troy McIntosh said. “But we want to take this model and export it to other states.” Public school advocates worry this is a misuse of the EdChoice Scholarship system at best or another step toward dismantling public education at worst. “It’s not about rescuing kids from failing schools,” former Democratic lawmaker and school finance expert Stephen Dyer said. “It’s all about subsidizing private education and mostly religious education.” Traditionally, opening a private school requires millions of dollars in donations that “float” the school until tuition can cover its expenses.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state received almost $17.9million in tribal gaming exclusivity fees in August – the most the industry has ever paid to the state in a single month. The record amount is one sign of the region’s continued economic growth despite rising inflation. Summer is also a strong season for the tribal gaming industry, which generates a large chunk of its business from Texans and other travelers. Officials in both Oklahoma and Texas have said consumer spending as a whole ticked up last month as prices and pay increased. The previous record for exclusivity fees was nearly $17.8 million in May 2021, according to monthly totals published by the Oklahoma Office of Management and Enterprise Services. The fees have added up to $193 million over the past year, 13% more than the same time in 2021. Whether Oklahoma’s tribal gaming industry can keep expanding will depend largely on external forces, especially whether Texas legalizes widespread casino-style gaming or sports betting, said Victor Rocha, a tribal gaming industry analyst based in California. Oklahoma’s largest casinos are near the Texas border and draw heavily from Dallas-Fort Worth. Casinos on the other side of the border would be a game changer, said Rocha, who belongs to the Pechanga Band of Luiseño Indians.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Saying that a police response is often an improper solution to mental health crises, Biden administration officials on Monday announced financial support for expansion of mobile crisis intervention teams in Oregon. The Pacific Northwest state, which has pioneered the use of unarmed intervention teams, became the first to receive the infusion of aid under President Joe Biden’s American Rescue Plan Act. The new Medicaid-supported plan will allow Oregon to provide and expand community-based stabilization services to individuals experiencing mental health and/or substance use crises throughout the state by connecting them to a behavioral health specialist, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement. HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra encouraged other states to take advantage of the funding opportunity. Federal health officials said that under the program, 85 cents of every dollar spent by states to expand these services and utilized by Medicaid-covered individuals will be paid for by the federal government. There are more than 1.4 million Medicaid recipients in Oregon, according to the Oregon Health Authority. That’s almost one-third of the state’s population of 4.1 million. An example of such a program exists in Eugene, where teams of paramedics and behavioral health practitioners take mental health crisis calls out of the hands of uniformed and armed officers.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: A white Philadelphia police officer became distraught when he learned that a Black motorist he fatally shot after a high-speed chase was unarmed, his lawyer said as the ex-officer’s third-degree murder trial began Tuesday. Prosecutors said former Officer Eric Ruch Jr. shot and killed Dennis Plowden Jr. less than six seconds after arriving on the scene – even as other officers held their fire. A grand jury investigation found that Plowden, 25, was dazed after crashing the car and had his left hand raised as he tried to follow commands on a city sidewalk. However, defense lawyer David Mischak told jurors that Plowden’s right hand remained hidden near a pocket. Only later, he said, did Ruch learn what was inside. “As soon as my client discovered it was heroin and not a gun, he was upset. He was distraught,” Mischak said. He urged jurors to consider not just what happened in the six seconds at the scene but also the two-minute chase beforehand. Police thought the car was linked to a recent homicide. Plowden, who had borrowed the car and was not involved in that case, drove at high speed for several blocks through a city neighborhood before crashing. “It was a tragedy,” Mischak said of Plowden’s death. “To call my client a criminal really compounds that tragedy.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: U.S. Rep. Jim Langevin, D-R.I., said he hopes something good can come from an “outrageous” incident last month in which he nearly had to cancel a congressional trip because an airline wouldn’t let his wheelchair onto a plane. The event caused him to miss his flight and arrive late in Italy, where the House Armed Services Committee member was leading a congressional delegation with the U.S. Navy. The airline, Lufthansa, has acknowledged it made a mistake and has issued an apology. “It’s outrageous that airlines are blocking wheelchair users from traveling with FAA-compliant mobility devices,” Langevin tweeted Monday. “If I was denied boarding on a government trip, what do you think is happening to people with disabilities on vacations, visiting family, or traveling for work?” Langevin, who is quadriplegic, uses a wheelchair powered by lithium-ion batteries. Lufthansa staff at Boston Logan International Airport told him the chair was prohibited because its batteries posed a fire threat. Having had similar trouble in January, he’d taken steps to avoid another problem, with the Navy contacting the airline on his behalf in advance. Discussing the issue with a gate agent and operations manager, Langevin even got the wheelchair’s inventor on the phone to explain that it was safe. “They wouldn’t budge,” he said. Langevin noted that most people wouldn’t have a staff to help under such circumstances. “It’s very expensive to be disabled,” he said. “Not everyone has a backup chair.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Republican state lawmakers will keep trying to enact new abortion restrictions later this month. Speaker Murrell Smith announced Monday that the House will meet Sept. 27, more than two weeks after the Senate sent back a markedly different proposal from the one passed earlier by the lower chamber. Contentious debates among Republicans over exceptions have emerged in a special session on abortion that convened after the U.S. Supreme Court’s June decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. It is unclear if the House will take up the Senate’s bill. Smith told reporters earlier Monday that “all options are on the table.” While Smith was disappointed with the outcome last week, he said this is how legislation gets made. “I respect the Senate as a body and their votes,” Smith told reporters. “Obviously, the House is vastly different from their position.” The House passed a ban on abortion at all stages of pregnancy in late August with exceptions for the mother’s life and rape or incest up to 12 weeks. The Senate passed a six-week ban, based on when cardiac activity can be detected in an embryo, with exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape or incest, to save the life of the mother and, when approved by two doctors, in cases of fatal fetal anomaly.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem disclosed Monday that she recently underwent back surgery to treat an injury impacting her spine and that her activity would be limited during several months of recovery. The 50-year-old Republican governor said she traveled to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, for the surgery after receiving medical treatment for several weeks in South Dakota. She said in a video posted on Twitter that she injured her back about two months ago. She said she will be restricted in the amount of travel she can do and the time she can spend standing while she recovers. Noem is in the midst of a reelection campaign and is also considered a potential 2024 White House contender. “I won’t be able to stand for more than 10, 15 minutes at a time. I won’t be able to get out and about South Dakota like I love to do so much,” the governor said in the video, where she appeared slightly dispirited. Dr. Mohamed Bydon said in a statement released by the governor’s office that he treated her for an “acute condition impacting her lumbar spine.” He said that the surgery was successful and that the governor is in “excellent health.” The governor’s office and her campaign spokesman did not immediately respond to a question on how she was injured.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Police have revised the number of people killed in a man’s shooting rampage from four to three after a different suspect was identified in the slaying of a teenager during the tense ordeal. In a Facebook post, Memphis police said the killing of a 17-year-old girl, Corteria McKinnie, was not part of the series of shootings last Wednesday that terrorized the city and led to a shelter-in-place order. The teen was shot as police frantically hunted the man who posted some of his actions on social media. Police said Ezekiel Kelly, 19, carjacked two motorists and drove around Memphis and north Mississippi, opening fire on people. Kelly has been charged with first-degree murder in one of the shootings. More charges are pending, authorities said. Kelly’s next court appearance is scheduled for Friday. The court-appointed public defender has not returned calls seeking comment in his case. At a news conference early Thursday – just after Kelly was arrested – Memphis Police Director Cerelyn “CJ” Davis provided a timeline that included four people killed and three others wounded. In a Facebook post made after-hours Friday, police said the shooting of McKinnie in south Memphis was not carried out by Kelly but by a different suspect. Police said McKinnie reported the shooting at a fire station, but she was shot in her car at a separate location by a man wearing all black.\n\nTexas\n\nNew Boston: A woman accused of killing another woman to steal her unborn baby to present as her own went on trial for capital murder Monday. Taylor Rene Parker has pleaded not guilty to capital murder and kidnapping in the October 2020 deaths of 21-year-old Regan Michelle Simmons-Hancock and the daughter who died after being cut from her mother’s womb. Authorities say Simmons-Hancock was stabbed and cut more than 100 times and had her skull crushed with a hammer in her New Boston home before a scalpel was used to remove her unborn baby. She is also charged with non-capital murder in connection with the baby’s death. Assistant District Attorney Kelley Crisp told the Bowie County jury Monday that Parker, 29, acted not because she wanted a baby but to keep from losing her boyfriend. Crisp said Parker disguised herself to make her look pregnant for nearly 10 months, faked ultrasounds, had a gender-reveal party and posted about her fake pregnancy on social media while searching for a possible victim, Crisp said. “How did we get here?” Crisp asked the jury. “How did it get this far? She is an actress, an actress of the highest order. The lies and fraud go on and on; the layers of fraud are staggering.” Leaving the victim’s 3-year-old daughter alone with her dying mother, Parker then drove with the baby in her lap when a state trooper stopped the car and sent the child to a hospital in nearby Idabel, Oklahoma, authorities say. The child later died.\n\nUtah\n\nTooele: Federal wildlife managers say they plan to gather approximately 700 wild horses later this week as part of an ongoing effort to tamp down the horses’ populations along the Utah-Nevada border. The gathering operation is slated to start Saturday and last for two weeks, starting in the proximity of the Cedar Mountain Herd Management Area, west of Tooele, according to the Bureau of Land Management. BLM officials say the herd management area should have between 190 and 390 horses but now has a population of 920. Horses removed from the range will be transported to BLM-contracted off-range corrals in Axtell, Utah. “The Cedar Mountain Horse Management Area wild horse gather supports the BLM’s continuing efforts to manage public lands for multiple use and sustained yield and to manage wild horse populations under the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971,” Jessica Wade, the bureau’s Salt Lake field manager, said in an email. The agency’s method for rounding up the horses involves low-flying helicopters chasing the horses into corrals – a method that has drawn fire from advocacy groups over the years but that wildlife officials say is the quickest, most effective way to reduce herd sizes and minimize longer-term problems. Members of the public are invited to come and observe the operations, as long as they remain at a safe distance, starting Monday.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The U.S. Department of Education is investigating allegations of antisemitism at the University of Vermont, including that some Jewish students were excluded from campus clubs and that a teaching assistant threatened to reduce the grades of students who support the state of Israel. The complaint filed by the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law alleges that UVM has allowed a hostile environment to exist on campus in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The complaint, which was filed last year but acted upon by the Department of Education last month, says that Jewish students have expressed fear about identifying publicly as Jewish, that they hide their Jewish identity and that some have considered transferring from UVM due to the hostile environment. Jewish students are being pressured to disavow their sense of being Jewish if they want to engage on issues like LGBTQ, women’s or immigration rights or climate change, said Alyza Lewin, the president of the Brandeis Center. “It can’t be that today, the only community that’s not welcomed to bring their full identity to the table are the Jews,” she said in an interview with the Associated Press. In a statement, UVM spokesman Enrique Corredera said officials were aware of the investigation by the Office of Civil Rights and look forward to providing the agency with a full response to the underlying allegations, which were reported to the university in 2021 and investigated by campus officials.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: The Elizabeth River Project’s latest work will roll with the rising tide. The environmental group is constructing a 6,500-foot resilience lab with an intentional life span of about 30 to 50 years. When sea levels reach a certain height, the structure can be disassembled and moved to allow a living shoreline – part of the design – to take its place. The outdoor pavilion will float when the area floods and is meant as a refuge for people who canoe down the river-like streets after a deluge or for those caught outside. The Pru and Louis Ryan Resilience Lab and Learning Park is scheduled to open next fall. The $8 million project is funded by Pru and Louis Ryan of Norfolk and donations through the ERP’s Next Wave Campaign. The group picked the location because it is a notorious flood zone, and the creek is an important tributary. The lab will be equipped with solar panels, rainwater collection barrels and gray water collection systems. It also will employ natural cooling techniques such as a “green wall” of ivy. The proposed living shoreline will be at the back of the property and planted to restore wetland and oyster habitats. Once in place, it will help trap contaminants and filter the water. There will be two storage sheds, one of which will float, a research dock, and a public boardwalk for people to look out over the creek. A kayak launch will be just off the boardwalk.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Seattle Public Schools said late Monday that it had reached a tentative agreement with the union for teachers who went on strike last week over issues like pay and classroom support. Earlier Monday, the district had canceled classes Tuesday – the fifth school day that students have missed since the strike began began Sept. 7. That was supposed to be the first day for approximately 49,000 students in the district. Details about the agreement weren’t immediately available. Striking teachers said their main concern was educational and emotional help for students, especially those with special needs or learning difficulties. The school district had offered pay raises of an additional 1% above the 5.5% cost-of-living increase set by state lawmakers – far less than the union says it wanted – plus one-time bonuses for certain teachers, including $2,000 for third-year Seattle teachers earning an English language or dual-language endorsement. Teachers in the city have seen healthy raises since their last strike in 2015, with many making more than $100,000, thanks largely to a new state education funding model. The union has said it is primarily focused on winning raises for its lower-paid members, including instructional assistants and front office staff. Paraeducators in Seattle Public Schools start at $19 an hour – nowhere near enough to afford to live in the city, many say. The union says it was opposing the district’s efforts to eliminate staffing ratios for special education students.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The Legislature passed a sweeping abortion ban with few exceptions Tuesday, approving a bill that several Republicans said they hope will make it impossible for the state’s only abortion clinic to continue to offer the procedure. Under the legislation, rape and incest victims would be able to obtain abortions at up to eight weeks of pregnancy – but only if they report to law enforcement first. Such victims who are minors would have until 14 weeks to terminate a pregnancy and be required report either to law enforcement or to a physician. Rape and incest victims would have to report the assault within 48 hours of getting an abortion, and a patient would have to present a copy of a police report or notarized letter to a physician before the procedure could be performed. Abortions also would be allowed in cases of medical emergencies. Lawmakers resumed debate on the bill after failing to come to an agreement in late July, giving up the chance for the state to become the first to approve new legislation restricting access to abortions since the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in June removing its protected status as a constitutional right.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Hundreds of Madison nurses seeking to be recognized as a union canceled a three-day work strike at the last minute after Gov. Tony Evers called the health care workers and their bosses to Maple Bluff over the weekend to hash out a settlement. Evers announced the agreement to avoid striking Monday at a state Capitol news conference, where UW Health health care workers and UW Health CEO Alan Kaplan said the two sides agreed to pursue an analysis from the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission on whether the health system must recognize their union. “I just made an offer to come to the residence, sit down together, and my message was quite clear that people in Wisconsin expect everybody to work together for the best of everyone. And no one wants a strike,” Evers said. The agreement came a day before the nurses were set to start a three-day strike they voted in late August to take if UW Health officials did not agree to negotiate with their union, SEIU Healthcare Wisconsin. Their pursuit of union recognition has been brewing since 2011, when Republican state lawmakers and then-Gov. Scott Walker passed a collective bargaining law that eliminated most collective bargaining for public employees. Kaplan has argued state law prevents officials from bargaining with the union.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Republican U.S. House nominee Harriet Hageman won’t agree to a debate with Democratic challenger Lynnette Grey Bull, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. Hageman, who defeated incumbent U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney in the GOP primary after winning the endorsement of ex-President Donald Trump and pushing his election conspiracy theories, declined an invitation to appear on stage with Grey Bull next month, first citing a scheduling conflict and later saying she wouldn’t take part at all. Grey Bull said voters deserve to hear the candidates discuss their differences and calling the refusal a tactic of the privileged class, according to the newspaper. WyomingPBS officials, who have long hosted statewide debates, also said they were diappointed that Hageman wouldn’t agree to participate in a forum that helps constituents learn about the candidates and issues.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2019/04/18/tower-former-prison-greenbank-park-delaware/3427431002/", "title": "Tower in Greenbank Park: Where it came from", "text": "CLARIFICATION: The Wilmington Country Club moved to its current Greenville location from Wilmington in the early 1960s.

Those stories are not included in this list. This is the best of the rest.\n\nRecall attempt\n\nThree residents affiliated with the conservative political action committee New Mexicans for a Better Tomorrow initiated a process to recall Las Cruces city councilors Olga Pedroza, Nathan Small and Gill Sorg in November 2014.\n\nThey submitted the petitions to City Deputy Clerk Linda Lewis on Feb 6, arguing the three councilors were too heavily influenced by local progressives.\n\nIn March, it was determined the group had not collected enough valid signatures, but the group filed notice seeking a time extension to gather more signatures. The effort against Sorg had generated 91 percent of the signatures necessary for recall, 81 percent of the signatures necessary to recall Small, and 62 percent of the signatures required to recall Pedroza.\n\nUltimately, all three recall efforts failed, but not before being heard in District Court. On May 20, the group sought to change how the city clerk’s office verified petition signatures — a request that was quashed by District Court Judge Mary Rosner.\n\nThe issue was finally put to bed on June 1, when City Council voted 4-1 on three separate resolutions to certify the ruling of former City Clerk Esther Martinez-Carillo that the petitions lacked sufficient signatures from the three councilors’ districts.\n\nCell beating\n\nIn 2015, a saga unfolded involved two now-former Las Cruces Police Department officers who are accused of beating a detainee in an LCPD holding cell.\n\nSurveillance video from Dec. 23, 2014, shows two LCPD officers slamming detainee Ross Flynn, of Las Cruces, against the holding-cell wall and kneeing him in the stomach. Flynn was in police custody following his arrest for allegedly threatening a neighbor with a firearm. He sustained a fractured skull and other injuries after being beaten by the officers, according to court records\n\nThe now-former LCPD officers — Danny Salcido, 25, and Richard Garcia, 34 — were indicted in June by a Doña Ana County grand jury on one count each of aggravated battery resulting in great bodily harm, a third-degree felony that carries a maximum sentence of up to three years in prison.\n\nThe police department fired Salcido and Garcia in May in connection with the incident after an internal investigation concluded they'd violated LCPD policies and procedures.\n\nThe video was made public in early March, when Flynn's attorneys, Jeff Lahann and Christopher Cardenas, filed a federal lawsuit against the officers, LCPD and the city of Las Cruces. The attorneys have said they're seeking a $12.5 million settlement.\n\nA state district judge has said a four-day trial for Salcido and Garcia will take place starting April 26, 2016.\n\nFlynn, meanwhile, is set to stand trial for the charges against him starting on Feb. 8, 2016, according to online records. He faces charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, assault upon a peace officer, and resisting, obstructing or refusing to obey an officer. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nStrange billboards\n\nOdd billboards featuring what appeared to be Arabic writing or hieroglyphics began appearing on Interstate 10 and on US Highway 70 around Las Cruces, sparking alarm among some Sun-News readers.\n\nAs it turned out, the billboards were part of the Manifest Destiny Billboard Project, a series of artist-produced billboards and activations that will be shown along Interstate 10 from Jacksonville, Florida to Los Angeles. The billboards were created by Daniel R. Small, a Los Angeles artist.\n\n\"The symbols are rooted from old biblical terms used in the Ten Commandments,\" said Samantha Frank, territorial director of the Los Angeles Nomadic Division, a nonprofit organization that promotes public art exhibitions.\n\nLAND's website said the billboards were constructed by culling materials from two fake historical sites: the Los Lunas Decalogue Stone in New Mexico, and Cecil B. DeMille's film set from \"The Ten Commandments\" buried in Guadalupe, California.\n\nLAND's website said the 10 billboards depict text from the Decalogue Stone, believed by many people as an attempt at writing the Ten Commandments in a fabricated language derived from Cypriot Greek and a form of paleo Hebrew.\n\nValentine's Day shooting\n\nJoshua Jones, then 19, and his friend, Christopher Silva, then 20, attempted to break into a home in the 1600 block of Delano Drive and steal marijuana on Valentine's Day.\n\nAccording to investigators, Jones asked Silva to serve as the lookout while he carried out the break-in. When brothers Antonio Molina, Jr. and Fernando Molina, who lived nearby, spotted the burglars, they gave chase. A scuffle occurred, and “Jones pulled out a .38-caliber revolver and fired at both Antonio and Fernando Molina, shooting them both in the torso at close range,” according to the case’s lead prosecutor, Cynthia Clark.\n\nAntonio Molina Jr. was pronounced dead at Memorial Medical Center in Las Cruces, and Fernando Molina was transported to University Medical Center in El Paso, where he spent months fighting for his life.\n\nSilva, now 21, pleaded no contest to one count of conspiracy to commit residential burglary, a fourth-degree felony, in August.\n\nDuring Silva's sentencing hearing in November, Fernando Molina was arrested on a contempt-of-court charge following an aggressive outburst in court. The incident cut short Silva's sentencing, which has yet to take place. He faces a maximum of 18 months in jail.\n\nJones, now 20, pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and attempted aggravated burglary with a deadly weapon, both third-degree felonies, as part of a plea bargain with prosecutors. He also pleaded guilty to attempted voluntary manslaughter and tampering with evidence, both fourth-degree felonies. In December, he was sentenced to 13 years in prison.\n\nReunited with their rings\n\nAn elderly woman was reunited this year with a wedding ring set she'd lost decades ago in Grant County.\n\nOfelia Kirker, 82, of Las Cruces had lost the two-ring set in the late 1960s in the community of Santa Clara, where she lived with her husband, Robert Kirker.\n\nThe couple was married Dec. 30, 1951 in Santa Rita when Robert was 18 and Ofelia was 17. Robert bought an engagement ring and wedding band from a Silver City jeweler for $400. Years later, the ring were reset in white gold.\n\nThe couple moved from Santa Rita to Santa Clara in the late '50s after a tragic house fire that claimed the life of their 7-month-old daughter. Ofelia had a habit of taking her rings off while cooking and placing them in tissues. She eventually lost them. The last place she'd recalled seeing them was somewhere near the church they attended.\n\nIt turned out the couple, when attending services, would always park their car in front of the same home, owned by a woman named Romana Gutierrez.\n\nYears passed, and a man who was hired to clean Gutierrez's yard stumbled upon the wedding rings. Gutierrez knew they weren't hers, but recalled that years before, Ofelia Kirker had been searching for lost wedding rings in front of the home. Gutierrez placed the rings in a box for safekeeping, not knowing how to contact the Kirkers, who'd since moved out of the community.\n\nThen, in the spring of 2015, Gutierrez's daughter, Edna Salas, found the box and learned about the story from her mom. Salas was able to deliver the rings to the Kirkers' daughter-in-law, who works in a grocery store in Santa Clara, and relay the story. The couple traveled to Santa Clara to reclaim the rings.\n\n\"It's a miracle,\" Robert Kirker said. \"We've had our share of ups and downs, but this is uplifting.\"\n\nThe Kirkers celebrated their 64th wedding anniversary on Wednesday, Dec. 30.\n\nJANUARY\n\nJan. 1: First Las Cruces Chile Drop rings in the new year.

The scheduled execution follows criticism over the state’s last two lethal injection attempts, including one that was called off after the execution team had trouble finding a vein. Kenneth Eugene Smith, 57, is set to die at Holman Correctional Facility on Nov. 17, according to a Friday order from the Alabama Supreme Court. Smith was sentenced to death for the killing of Elizabeth Dorlene Sennett, a 45-year-old grandmother and pastor’s wife. Prosecutors said Smith was one of two men who were each paid $1,000 to kill Sennett on behalf of her husband, the Rev. Charles Sennett, who was deeply in debt and wanted to collect on insurance. Elizabeth Sennett was found dead March 18, 1988, in the couple’s home in Colbert County. The coroner testified that she had been stabbed eight times in the chest and once on each side of the neck. The pastor killed himself a week later. Smith maintained it was the other man who stabbed Elizabeth Sennett, according to court documents. Smith was initially convicted in 1989, and a jury voted 10-2 to recommend a death sentence, which a judge imposed. His conviction was overturned on appeal in 1992. He was retried and convicted again in 1996.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Acting state Revenue Commissioner Deven Mitchell has been chosen as the new chief executive officer of the Alaska Permanent Fund Corp. The announcement was made Monday by the fund’s board. The corporation said in a statement that the selection “is contingent on the successful negotiation of a salary and benefits package” and that a start date has not yet been set. Mitchell has called Alaska’s nest-egg oil wealth fund the state’s “trump card” as a renewable source of revenue, the Anchorage Daily News reports. His message to the board was that he would not chase short-term cash yields, as the fund has been invested for long-term growth. He also said he doesn’t see the CEO’s role as second-guessing investment decisions made by the corporation’s chief investment officer or as overriding his decisions. Earnings from the fund traditionally have been used to pay annual dividends to residents. Since 2018, earnings also have been used to help pay for state government. Mitchell last month stepped down as the state’s debt manager and executive director of the Alaska Municipal Bond Bank Authority when Gov. Mike Dunleavy appointed him to be the acting Department of Revenue commissioner.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: An abortion clinic has come up with a way for patients who can end their pregnancy using a pill to get the medication quickly without running afoul of a resurrected state law that bans most abortions. Under the arrangement that began Monday, patients will have an ultrasound in Arizona, get a prescription through a telehealth appointment with a California doctor, and then have it mailed to a post office in a California border town for pickup, all for free. While not as easy as before an Arizona judge ruled that a pre-statehood law criminalizing nearly all abortions could be enforced nearly two weeks ago, the process saves an overnight trip to a major California city with an abortion clinic. And it is more accessible than the previous workaround used by Camelback Family Planning in Phoenix, which was to have a doctor in Sweden prescribe the pills and a pharmacy in India mail them to Arizona. That could take up to three weeks. Ashleigh Feiring, a nurse at the clinic, said the cost of the pills will be covered by the Abortion Fund of Arizona, which is helping women pay for out-of-state access to abortions. Women can use a pill for an abortion until the 12th week of pregnancy. Pills and surgical abortions were legal until about 24 weeks until the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade in June.\n\nArkansas\n\nNorth Little Rock: Authorities say three people have died after a fire early Tuesday at a North Little Rock apartment complex. The fire broke out shortly after 2 a.m. at an apartment near Shorter College, authorities said. North Little Rock Fire Department Capt. Dustin Free told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that three adults died in the blaze. The fire, which was extinguished by about 7 a.m., was contained to one apartment but caused the second floor of the building to collapse onto the first, Free said. “This was an all-hands-on-deck situation,” he said. “We work every day to save a life, but sometimes we are notified too late. The firefighters came in and tried to stop the fire aggressively.” The cause of the blaze remained under investigation.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The past three years have been the state’s driest on record, and officials said Monday that they’re preparing for the streak to continue. The official water year concluded Friday, marking an end to a period that saw both record rainfall in October and the driest January-to-March period in at least a century. Scientists say such weather whiplash is likely to become more common as the planet warms. It will take more than a few winter storms to help the state dig out of drought. Though it’s impossible to predict with certainty what the winter will bring, “we are actively planning for another dry year,” said Jeanine Jones, drought manager for the state Department of Water Resources. Jones spoke alongside state climatologist Michael Anderson about the just-completed water year. The water year runs from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30 so that the rainiest winter months are recorded together. Snow that falls in California’s mountains typically provides one-third of the state’s annual water supply, but last year snow levels were far below average by the end of the winter. The Colorado River, another major source of water for Southern California, is also beset by drought, threatening its ability to supply farmers and cities around the U.S. West.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A man survived a bear attack in his own backyard when he fired at the animal and scared it away after it threw him to the ground, state wildlife officials said. The attack occurred Saturday night in the small town of New Castle, Colorado Parks and Wildlife area manager Kirk Oldham said in a news release. The man went into his backyard after hearing a noise and encountered the bear, which threw him to the ground, officials said. He then threw up an arm to protect his face while grabbing a gun with his free hand and firing three shots, they said. It’s unknown whether the bear was hit by the bullets. The man told Parks and Wildlife that he had seen the bear in his yard the previous two nights. Heavy rain made it difficult for Parks and Wildlife officers to find and follow a blood trail and bear tracks as they searched for the animal, the news release said. They were still searching Monday. The man, whose name was not released, was treated at a hospital for minor injuries to his hand and arm and bruising on his chest, the release said. It’s the second bear attack in the western Colorado town in the past three months as bears prepare for hibernation, Oldham said. In August, a bear charged a woman and swiped at her, lacerating her arm and back. She recovered, and a mother bear and cub were euthanized, The Denver Post reports.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear an appeal by the Connecticut State Police Union in its challenge of a police accountability law that allows public disclosure of certain state trooper personnel files and internal investigation reports. At issue were documents in internal probes that end with no finding of wrongdoing. The union argued the 2020 state law violated the 2018-2022 troopers’ contract by stripping away its exemptions from state freedom of information laws and allowing such documents to be publicly released. Union officials say troopers oppose the law because it allows records involving unfounded allegations to become public, possibly tarnishing a trooper’s reputation despite no findings of wrongdoing. The Supreme Court did not say anything about the case in rejecting it among a host of others, as is typical. The decision upholds rulings by lower federal courts that upheld the state law. Andrew Matthews, executive director of the state police union, said the decision is going to have a chilling effect. Proponents of the 2020 law, which included many other reforms, said it answered the calls for reform, including accountability and transparency, after the police killings of George Floyd and other Black people.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Elevated lead levels in water were found at nearly 50 schools, prompting the Delaware Division of Public Health to advise shutting off at least one school’s drinking water supply in New Castle. Water samples were taken from 25 locations at the Wallace Wallin School in the Colonial School District last year and on multiple occasions throughout the summer, with all but three coming back with elevated lead levels. The results prompted the school to shut off its drinking water supply throughout the building at the beginning of the school year and utilize bottled water while the state continues to test the water quality and determine a plan for remediation, said Ted Lambert, director of facilities for the school district. The Wallin School is one of 47 schools across the state that tested positive for elevated levels of lead, according to results released by the state last month. Wallin’s highest results were over 12 times the maximum acceptable level in a staff break room. Lead levels from a water fountain outside a classroom at the school came back nine times higher than acceptable levels. According to federal standards, acceptable levels of lead in water must be lower than 0.015 milligrams per liter; however, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes says there is no safe blood level for young children.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: With an ambitious goal of ending generations of racial discrimination, Mayor Muriel Bowser announced a plan Monday to boost Black homeownership, hoping to place 20,000 families into their own homes by 2030, WUSA-TV reports. “We know we want to add more homes, but we want to be intentional about making sure people can afford those,” Bowser said in the announcement at the Howard Theatre. According to a report gathered by the Black Homeownership Strike Force, only 34% of D.C.’s Black residents owned their own homes in 2019, compared to 49% of white residents. The task force pointed to a history of discriminatory practices that have prevented Black families from attaining property and generational wealth. Bowser’s plan attempts to correct both. “These recommendations are ambitious but are imminently doable if we all work together,” said Vanessa Perry with the Housing Finance Policy Center. The task force issued 10 recommendations including using the mayor’s allotted $10 million down payment to help families buy and maintain homes and rezoning neighborhoods to allow for more multifamily housing. “I am standing before you as a testament that homeownership is possible,” Brittney Freeman told the crowd at the Howard. “I am indeed my ancestors wildest dreams.”\n\nFlorida\n\nPolk City: A 21-year-old deputy appears to have been fatally shot by friendly fire from deputies with whom he was serving a warrant in central Florida early Tuesday, authorities said. The Polk County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement that Deputy Blane Lane was shot in the left arm and chest at a trailer in Polk City while serving a warrant with three other deputies on a suspect wanted for failing to appear on a felony drug charge. Shots were fired after deputies discovered the suspect with what appeared to be a handgun pointed at them but actually was a BB gun. Two of the deputies fired their guns, and “the round that struck Lane came from one of their firearms,” the sheriff’s office statement said. The deputy, who Sheriff Grady Judd described as one of the youngest on the force, was taken to a hospital, where he died “despite valiant efforts,” the sheriff said. The suspect, Cheryl William, also was hit multiple times. She was taken to a hospital where she was in stable condition. She faces a felony second-degree murder charge, among other charges, the sheriff’s office said. The sheriff’s office planned to hold a line-of-duty death funeral with full law enforcement honors for Lane.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The prosecutor investigating whether ex-President Donald Trump and his allies broke the law trying to overturn his 2020 election loss in the state is seeking search warrants in the case, a sign that the wide-ranging probe has entered a new phase. The revelation came Monday in a court order filed by Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney, who’s overseeing the special grand jury seated to help the investigation. In an order sealing any search warrants and related documents from being made public, McBurney wrote that District Attorney Fani Willis’ office is “now seeking to obtain and execute a series of search warrants, the affidavits for which are predicated on sensitive information acquired during the investigation.” Disclosure of the information could compromise the investigation, McBurney wrote, “by, among other things, causing flight from prosecution, destruction of or tampering with evidence, and intimidation of potential witnesses.” It could also result in risks to the “safety and well-being” of people involved in the investigation, he wrote. It wasn’t immediately clear who the targets of the search warrants are or whether any search warrants had yet to be approved by a judge.\n\nHawaii\n\nJoint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam: The commander of the task force responsible for draining fuel from a World War II-era storage tank facility that leaked jet fuel and poisoned Pearl Harbor’s tap water last year said Monday that he’s exploring ways to get community feedback. Rear Adm. John Wade told reporters at a news conference he may establish an advisory group, but he’s not sure yet what form it will take. He said getting input from the community will help him be more responsive. He said Hawaii’s elected officials told military leaders that it would be valuable for them to give the community a voice in their work. “I don’t have the structure yet. It’s still a work in progress, but I think it’s something that’s important,” said Wade, the commander of Joint Task Force Red Hill. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced Wade’s appointment last month. In November, jet fuel spilled from a drain line at the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility, flowing into a drinking water well and then into the Navy’s water system serving 93,000 people in and around Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam. Nearly 6,000 sought medical attention for ailments like nausea, headaches and sores. The military put about 4,000 families in hotels for several months. Wade said he’s started reaching out to Hawaii’s congressional delegation and other local leaders.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A federal judge has ordered the state and its prison medical care provider to pay more than $2.5 million in legal fees to a transgender inmate who sued after she was denied gender confirmation surgery. The cost, however, will not come out of taxpayer dollars. Instead, it will be covered by Corizon Correctional Healthcare under a separate agreement with the state. Adree Edmo sued the state and the Idaho Department of Correction’s health care provider, Corizon, in 2017, alleging they were violating her Eighth Amendment right against cruel and unusual punishment by denying her gender confirmation surgery. Edmo identifies as female, but she had long been housed in the men’s prison while she served a 10-year sentence for sexually abusing a 15-year-old boy. In her lawsuit, she asked a judge to order the state to allow her to change her name, provide her with access to gender-appropriate clothing, transfer her to a women’s correctional facility and provide her with gender-confirmation surgery. U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill ruled in 2018 that the state must provide Edmo with the surgery and said that continuing to deny the treatment would place her at risk of irreparable harm. The state appealed Winmill’s ruling, and it was two more years before she received the gender confirmation surgery, becoming the second person in the U.S. to undergo the surgery while incarcerated. She was transferred to a women’s prison to serve the remainder of her sentence and was released in 2021.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A Cook County judge on Monday threw out convictions for eight more people whose cases were linked to a notorious former Chicago police sergeant who regularly framed people for drug crimes they didn’t commit. Judge Erica Reddick vacated the convictions and sentences of the men in response to motions filed jointly by their attorneys and the Cook County State’s Attorney Office. The action followed the dismissal of 44 convictions in April and brought to 237 the number of vacated convictions in recent years linked to former Sgt. Ronald Watts and his tactical unit, State’s Attorney Kim Foxx said. Watts, a Black sergeant, led a team that for nearly a decade until 2012 planted drugs or falsely accused residents of a public housing complex and others who were visiting or simply happened to be in the area. Watts and another officer pleaded guilty in 2013 to stealing money from an FBI informant. Watts received a 22-month prison sentence. “Vacating these convictions provides just a fraction of relief for those who spent time in prison, away from their families, and we will never be able to give them that time back,” Foxx said. “We will continue to review these cases as we seek justice for all his victims.”\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: At the start of the pandemic, the number of people killed in homicides across the state as a result of domestic violence jumped 180%, as shutdowns and stay-at-home orders sometimes led to unintended consequences such as locking people in with their abuser. But while businesses, schools and workplaces have reopened, and building capacities have returned to normal, experts say domestic violence homicides have not decreased as much as they expected. In the past decade, Indiana has averaged 55 to 60 deaths from domestic violence annually, according to the Indiana Coalition Against Domestic Violence. From June 2020 to July 2021, domestic violence homicides jumped to 98. The coalition tracks such deaths through news media and advocacy organizations that report when a person dies as a result of domestic violence. It often means the numbers are much lower than reality, which makes the rising number of deaths recorded in the past two years more concerning. The coalition’s latest data show there hasn’t been a corresponding reduction in homicides from domestic violence as shelters returned to full capacity and social distancing requirements loosened. Seventy-seven people from 2021 from late June this year died in Indiana from domestic violence.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A state board on Monday rejected claims for $1 million payments for 52 prison inmates who were given six times the proper dose of COVID-19 vaccines last year. The three-member State Appeals Board, which considers state legal financial obligations, unanimously denied the claims from inmates who received the extra doses in April 2021. The 52 inmates who each sought a $1 million payment were among 77 prisoners at the Iowa State Penitentiary in Fort Madison who had been given overdoses of the Pfizer vaccine by prison nursing staff. The board – made up of State Auditor Rob Sand, State Treasurer Michael Fitzgerald and Iowa Department of Management Director Kraig Paulsen – accepted the recommendation of the Iowa attorney general’s office lawyers to reject the claims. The lawyers advised that under the federal Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act, “the state is immune from claims arising out of administration of the COVID-19 vaccine.” The mistaken doses occurred after the vaccine was delivered in concentrate form that was supposed to be diluted with saline solution. Two nurses were fired after the incident. A spokesman for the union representing prison staff said the overdoses happened after the prison abruptly switched from using the Moderna vaccine to the Pfizer version.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Enrollment in the state’s public universities and colleges is on a downward trend that started before COVID-19 but surged as more teenagers have pursued other options after high school. Headcount enrollment, or the raw number of individual students across the Kansas Board of Regents system, decreased by 1% overall, according to the Regents’ count released Thursday. Meanwhile, full-time equivalent enrollment – calculated by dividing the total number of credit hours taken by 15 hours for undergraduates and 15 for graduate students – fell by a slightly lower amount of 0.9%. In a statement, Regents chair Jon Rolph, Wichita CEO of the Thrive Restaurant Group, said the board acknowledges the declines but is working as a system to reverse the trend. “Our system is taking decisive action to reverse declining enrollments, better serve students and ensure that our state has the workforce needed to grow the Kansas economy,” Rolph said. “Initiatives such as our general education package and implementation of student success initiatives will help our system serve and graduate more students.”\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: While the battle over a voter referendum that will determine the future of abortion rights in Kentucky has drawn considerable attention, it is not the only constitutional amendment on the ballot this fall that could have a large political impact on the future of the state. Constitutional Amendment 1 is a rather lengthy, 744-word ballot referendum that essentially would give more power to the General Assembly – letting legislators call themselves into a special session and potentially extending regular sessions to end later in the year. Currently, only a governor can call legislators into a special session, in which they may pass bills that are within the parameters set by the governor. The Republican supermajority that pushed for the ballot referendum wants to be able to initiate special sessions with legislation of their choosing, while Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear wants to retain this power in the governor’s office. Under the proposed amendment, the Legislature could be called into a special session by a joint proclamation of the House speaker and Senate president, though they could only meet for a maximum of 12 days per calendar year in such sessions. Kentucky is one of just 14 states in which only the governor can call the legislature into a special session.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: An outspoken Christian conservative attorney has asked a federal appeals court to revive a pastor’s damage claims against state officials over long-expired COVID-19 restrictions. A federal judge this year dismissed minister Tony Spell’s lawsuit against Gov. John Bel Edwards and others over enforcement of the ban. Spell drew national attention for his flouting of the restrictions early in the pandemic at his church in Central, near Baton Rouge. One of Spell’s attorneys is Roy Moore, the former Alabama Supreme Court justice and U.S. Senate candidate, who insisted in arguments this week before a panel of judges from the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that the state had no authority whatsoever to restrict church gatherings. Panel members appeared skeptical of that claim in arguments Monday. But they raised the question of whether Spell’s church was unfairly restricted, compared with other public gathering places, such as shopping mall food courts. “They have treated us differently,” Moore said. “But the basis of our argument is there is no jurisdiction to limit a church attendance.” Spell has had some legal victories in his fight with the state. Louisiana’s Supreme Court threw out state charges against him in May, ruling 5-2 that restrictions in place at the time violated Spell’s freedom of religion.\n\nMaine\n\nKennebunkport: The Kennebunkport Heritage Housing Trust, a local nonprofit organization whose mission is to build 25 affordable or “attainable” homes in town by 2025, has completed one neighborhood and is now actively seeking properties on which to build a second and third, according to Executive Director Larissa Crockett. Heritage Woods, the completed neighborhood, includes six new homes, all purchased and now occupied. One morning last month, Crockett stood on Briggs Way – named after Patrick Briggs, the president of KHHT – and said the new homes there are designed to accommodate the way people live today. “Inside, they have really bright, open, sunny, airy, shared spaces,” she said, looking at the duplexes and single homes in view. Tanya Alsberg and Jennifer Armstrong are an example of two people whom KHHT has helped attain their own home in Kennebunkport. In April 2021, Alsberg and Armstrong stood at the edge of an excavated, gravel-filled hole and dreamed. Now, at the very same site, they live in their own home, thanks to KHHT. They bought and moved into the place in February. “We’re kind of crazily happy,” Alsberg said. “Every single day, we do the happy dance. Now that we’re here, it has changed our lives. ... It’s a lovely home.”\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A Johns Hopkins University scientist who created a website to track COVID-19 cases worldwide is the recipient of this year’s Lasker award for public service. The $250,000 awards, announced last week by the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation, recognize achievements in medical research. The public service award went to Lauren Gardner, an engineer who studies the spread of diseases. She worked with her lab team to develop the COVID-19 tracker as the coronavirus began spreading worldwide in January 2020. The dashboard became a key resource and now tracks global cases, deaths, vaccines and more. Through it all, the team has made the tracker freely available to the public. The dashboard set “a new standard for public health data science” and helped inform both personal decisions and policy, the Lasker Foundation said in a release.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A former Northeastern University employee who said he was injured when a package he was opening on campus exploded last month was charged Tuesday with fabricating the incident. Jason Duhaime, formerly the new technology manager and director of the university’s Immersive Media Lab, was charged with “conveying false and misleading information related to an explosive device” and then lying to federal investigators, federal authorities said. “This alleged conduct is disturbing to say the least,” U.S. Attorney Rachael Rollins said at a news conference. “Our city, more than most, knows all too well that a report or threat of an explosion is a very serious matter and necessitates an immediate and significant law enforcement response, given the potential devastation that can ensue.” Duhaime told investigators the hard plastic case exploded when he opened it Sept. 13, causing “sharp” objects to fly from the case and injure his arms, but his arms only had superficial marks, and there was no damage to his shirt or signs the case had been near an explosion, investigators said. The case also contained a rambling yet “pristine” typed note full of misspellings and exclamation points that railed against virtual reality, referenced Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, and threatened to “destroy” the lab. And investigators found a word-for-word electronic copy stored in a backup folder on a university computer in Duhaime’s office – written just hours before he called 911.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: A judge dismissed charges Tuesday against seven people in the Flint water scandal, including two former state health officials blamed for deaths from Legionnaires’ disease. Judge Elizabeth Kelly took action three months after the Michigan Supreme Court unanimously said a different judge acting as a one-person grand jury had no authority to issue indictments. Kelly rejected efforts by the attorney general’s office to just send the cases to Flint District Court and turn them into criminal complaints, the typical path to filing felony charges in Michigan. “Simply put, there are no valid charges,” Kelly said. Kelly’s decision doesn’t affect former Gov. Rick Snyder because he was charged with misdemeanors, and his case is being handled by a judge in a different Flint court. But he, too, was indicted in a process declared invalid by the state Supreme Court. In 2014, Flint managers appointed by Snyder took the city out of a regional water system and began using the Flint River to save money while a new pipeline to Lake Huron was being built. But the river water wasn’t treated to reduce its corrosive qualities. Lead broke off from old pipes and contaminated the system for more than a year. Separately, the water was blamed for an outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease, which typically spreads through heating and cooling systems.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Two of the four former police officers who were convicted of violating George Floyd’s civil rights during the May 2020 restraint that killed him were scheduled to begin serving their federal sentences Tuesday. The Bureau of Prisons typically would assign J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao to a federal facility, but authorities had not publicly said where they would go. They are scheduled to go to trial on state charges of aiding and abetting both murder and manslaughter later this month. The Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office said it anticipated Kueng and Thao would be transferred into its custody for the trial, but further specifics were not provided for security reasons. Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill issued an order Monday saying the sheriff’s office must provide the men with access to three sets of clothing for the trial – as well as for two hearings scheduled for later this week – further suggesting that they will be in local custody. Kueng, Thao and Lane were convicted earlier this year of depriving Floyd of his right to medical care as the 46-year-old Black man was pinned under former Officer Derek Chauvin’s knee for 91/ 2 minutes while handcuffed and facedown on the street. Kueng knelt on Floyd’s back, Lane held his legs, and Thao kept bystanders back.\n\nMississippi\n\nColumbus: Forty years after Mississippi University for Women started enrolling men, its president says the school should consider choosing a more inclusive name. Previous attempts to remove “women” from the name, including the most recent one in 2009, have brought strong backlash from alumni of the school, nicknamed the W. Men make up about 18% of the 2,700 students at MUW. In a letter to alumni, President Nora Miller said the university is creating a task force to examine a name change, the Commercial Dispatch reports. Miller said she received a letter in May from the Deans Council at the university, acknowledging the current name presents “challenges.” “I assure you, no matter what happens, we maintain our historic commitment to academic and leadership development for women, forever embracing our status as the first state-supported college for women in the United States,” Miller wrote in the letter sent Sept. 28. The president of MUW in 2009, Claudia Limbert, proposed changing the name to Reneau University to honor Sallie Reneau, who wrote to the Mississippi governor in the mid-19th century to propose a public college for women. That renaming effort fizzled amid opposition from outspoken graduates.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: A $40 million tax credit package for farmers and other agricultural businesses neared passage Monday, when a committee voted to send the bill to the full state Senate. The bill was expected to come up for a final Senate vote Tuesday. The measure extends several agricultural tax credits that expired and creates some new tax credits, including breaks for gas stations that sell biodiesel and fuel with a higher percentage of ethanol. The legislation also would expand government loan programs for farmers in the state. The Republican-led Missouri Legislature passed a bill with similar provisions during the regular legislative session this year, which ended in May. But GOP Gov. Mike Parson vetoed the measure, citing a two-year sunset attached to the tax credits that he said was too short. He also said the bill unconstitutionally included a provision on recycled asphalt shingles, violating a rule against including multiple topics in the same legislation. Parson called a special session – primarily focused on cutting individual income taxes in the state – and tasked lawmakers with extending the agricultural tax breaks for at least six years. Lawmakers last week sent Parson a bill to cut individual income taxes from 5.3% to 4.95% beginning next year.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A judge struck down as unconstitutional three laws that restricted voting in the state, saying there was no evidence of the widespread voter fraud that the 2021 Republican-sponsored laws ostensibly were targeting. The laws ended same-day voter registration, imposed new identification requirements on students and restricted third-party ballot collections. The restrictions were put on hold in April under a temporary injunction later upheld by the Montana Supreme Court. Election officials declined to say if they would appeal the latest ruling to the state high court. And with the election just over a month away, it’s uncertain if justices would render a decision before Nov. 8. Native American tribes that sued over the laws argued the student ID and ballot collection measures would hurt voters on remote reservations, where many people live far from polling places and are dealing with poverty and other challenges. Montana Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen, who oversees elections in the state, requested the voting measures last year as Republicans around the country changed voting laws in the wake of the November 2020 election. The moves followed claims made by ex-President Donald Trump and parroted by his supporters that the election was stolen.\n\nNebraska\n\nHalsey: Progress has been made in containing a large Sandhills wildfire where one firefighter died while fighting the flames, which also destroyed much of a popular youth campsite and threatened a small village, officials said Tuesday. The Bovee Fire in west-central Nebraska’s remote Thomas County was 30% contained Tuesday morning, according to a statement from the Rocky Mountain Complex Incident Management Team, which has taken over management of the scene. Favorable weather conditions, including high humidity, temperatures in the 60s and some rainfall, are helping fire crews contain the grasslands blaze that was sparked Sunday afternoon and ballooned to 15,000 acres, or about 24 square miles, within six hours. The fire destroyed the main lodge and cabins of the Nebraska State 4-H Camp, as well as an observation tower in the Bessey Ranger District of the Nebraska National Forest. Purdum Volunteer Fire Department Assistant Chief Mike Moody died Sunday after suffering an apparent heart attack while battling the fire, officials said. Officials ordered the evacuation of the nearby village of Halsey and shut down a stretch of Nebraska Highway 2 as smoke from the fire cut visibility. The highway was reopened by Monday. Officials have said the fire was “human-caused” but have not released details.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A $20,000 reward is now being offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of whoever killed five wild horses in eastern Nevada late last year, the Bureau of Land Management announced Monday. BLM officials said the National Mustang Association pledged to double the previous $10,000 reward in the case. Authorities said five mortally wounded horses were discovered Nov. 16 in Jakes Valley, about 30 miles west of Ely. They said the horses all were located within 600 yards of each other about 2 miles south of U.S. Highway 50, and an aborted fetus was attached to one of the dead animals. The BLM is investigating and prosecuting the killings as part of the enforcement of the Wild Horses and Burro Act of 1971.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state has resumed COVID-19 mobile vaccination clinics and a home-based vaccination program. “As we move into the fall and winter, we want to make sure everyone has access to the updated COVID-19 booster doses that better protect against the most recently circulating COVID-19 variants,” Patricia Tilley, the state’s director of Public Health Services, said in a statement Tuesday. Three mobile vaccination vans are available to provide free COVID-19 inoculations, both primary series and updated booster doses. Public and private clinics will be available statewide. The home-based program visits any part of the state to provide free COVID-19 vaccines and booster doses to those individuals who are unable or have difficulty leaving their home or have been advised by a medical provider that their health or an illness could worsen by leaving their home. The programs are funded through the American Rescue Plan and will run through March 2023. Groups can schedule a mobile vaccination clinic at on-sitemedservices.com/van or by calling (603) 826-6500, and residents can make an appointment for a home-based COVID-19 vaccine or a booster dose at on-sitemedservices.com/vaccine or by calling (603) 826-6500.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The Assembly approved a revised version of a state child tax credit Monday, fixing an error in the legislation that would have delayed payments for two years. The Legislature passed the program in June, and Gov. Phil Murphy signed it into law, providing a refundable credit of up to $500 per year for each child under the age of 6. The program was a response by Democrats to soaring costs of living and closer-than-expected state elections last fall. But a drafting error in the initial legislation meant the credit could not be claimed until the end of the 2023 tax year, and families would not get the benefit until 2024. Monday’s vote by the Assembly moved the eligible tax year forward, so the credit will be available next year. The state Senate approved the fix last week. The program will cost the state $135 million to $156 million annually, according to a state fiscal analysis released last week. The credit is $500 per child for families earning up to $30,000 a year. The benefit decreases by $10 for every $1,000 increase in yearly family income, until it reaches a minimum of $300 per child for a household earning up to $80,000, according to the legislation.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: Pete’s Most Wanted Salsa, a new product bearing the image of New Mexico State University mascot Pistol Pete, celebrated its launch last week with a party at La Posta de Mesilla, and the university says more branded products will soon be joining a growing family of licensed NMSU merchandise. “There’s a realm of possibilities out there, and as long as it’s a good-quality product, I don’t see why this thing won’t keep expanding,” NMSU athletics director Mario Moccia said. Sales of NMSU-licensed beer, wine and whiskey are reportedly robust. Precise data was unavailable, but non-apparel licensed products – including the alcoholic products but also its other consumable and non-consumable items such as lawn chairs and tents – totaled approximately $116,700 in the last fiscal year. And the university’s licensing company stated in a recent report that NMSU ranked second among college institutions with licensed alcoholic products, including the first collegiate-branded spirit, Pistol Pete’s Six Shooter Rye Whiskey. Moreover, NMSU ranked fifth in sales of consumable licensed products among colleges and universities, according to the Collegiate Licensing Company/Learfield Licensing Partners, which licenses university-branded products\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Giant tents for temporarily housing migrants arriving in the city are being moved to an island off Manhattan from a remote corner of the Bronx, after storms raised concerns about flooding at the original site. Mayor Eric Adams announced Monday that the city’s humanitarian relief center will now be on Randall’s Island, which sits in the waters between Manhattan, Queens and the Bronx. It’s connected by five bridges to the three boroughs, and people can take buses or walk off the island to reach the city’s subway system. The center’s tents had been put up in a parking lot at Orchard Beach, in the northeast part of the Bronx on Long Island Sound, where access to public transportation is limited. Images online showed water ponding at the site following rainfall over the weekend. In a statement announcing the change, Adams said while the city could have made the original location work, moving the center “is the most efficient and effective path forward.” The city’s plan for Orchard Beach had been met with concern by immigration advocates, who cited its inaccessibility among other reasons, and that concern extended to the new location. “The city must look to other solutions instead of tent cities, where our clients will be isolated, vulnerable to extreme weather, and far from public transportation and other critical services,” the Legal Aid Society and the Coalition for the Homeless said in a statement issued Tuesday.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The State Board of Elections directed county election officials Monday not to engage in signature matching when reviewing absentee ballot envelopes this fall after a judge rejected the GOP appeal of a state board ruling prohibiting the practice. According to a directive sent to county election directors from the board’s legal counsel Paul Cox, the judge’s ruling maintains the status quo outlined in state law, which requires that all absentee voters fill out their ballots in the presence of two witnesses or a notary. Absentee ballot request forms in North Carolina must also include a date of birth and either a driver’s license number or the last four digits of the voter’s Social Security number. The North Carolina Republican Party had filed motions in Wake County Superior Court last week, asking the court to block the state board from enforcing its declaratory ruling that prevented county election officials from comparing signatures on absentee ballot request forms and return envelopes with the signatures included in voter registration records. Superior Court Judge Stephan Futrell ruled from the bench Monday afternoon, denying the party’s motion for a temporary restraining order and preventing the use of signature matching in the 2022 general election, state board spokesperson Pat Gannon said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A trial has been set in a federal lawsuit brought by two Native American tribes that allege the state’s new legislative map dilutes tribal members’ voting strength. The bench trial is scheduled for June 12, 2023. A bench trial means the verdict is up to the judge alone. The lawsuit filed in February by the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa and the Spirit Lake Tribe alleges that North Dakota’s new legislative map violates the Voting Rights Act. The Legislature during its special session last fall approved the map, based on updated census data. The map includes the new state House subdistricts for the Fort Berthold and Turtle Mountain Indian reservations. Turtle Mountain argues the split House district “packs” tribal members into a single subdistrict on its reservation, while diluting their vote in the non-reservation subdistrict. Spirit Lake alleges the new redistricting map dilutes American Indian voters on and near its reservation. A federal judge in July dismissed the state’s argument that the tribes lacked the standing to sue. Tim Purdon, an attorney for the tribes, said about half of the 14-member GOP-led redistricting committee will be called as witnesses in the trial. He would not name them.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The nation was shocked when a 10-year-old Ohio rape victim was forced to obtain an abortion in Indiana after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June. But in the months since, court records detailed at least two other minors who traveled out of state for abortions because Ohio banned doctors from performing the procedure after cardiac activity was detected. New data from the Ohio Department of Health offers some insight: In 2021, 538 children ages 17 and younger legally obtained abortions in Ohio, including 57 who were younger than 15 years old. That represents 2.5% of the 21,813 abortions performed in Ohio last year. The state does not track how many abortions were performed on victims of rape and incest. The age of consent in Ohio is 16 years old. The Ohio Department of Health report offered a snapshot of abortion access in Ohio before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, and the state’s six-week ban took effect. The “heartbeat bill” is now on hold, blocked temporarily by a Hamilton County Common Pleas Court judge. The number of abortions performed in Ohio increased by nearly 6% in 2021, the second year in a row of increased abortions. Of the 21,813 abortions performed in 2021, 20,716 were for Ohio residents, and 1,097 people came from other states.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state Department of Human Services has implemented a 25% rate increase for providers who work with some of Oklahoma’s most vulnerable individuals as part of the agency’s push to eliminate its 13-year waiting list for developmental disability services. DHS on Saturday bumped its provider reimbursement rates to increase pay for a variety of medical professionals, including nurses, speech therapists, group home employees, direct care staffers who help developmentally disabled Oklahomans, and those who help low-income seniors. An official from a Sallisaw-based provider that serves Oklahomans with intellectual and developmental disabilities said this is the largest one-time rate increase nationally. Sheree Powell, government liaison at Sequoyah Enterprises Inc., said the reimbursement rate increase is key for providers to recruit and retain the best employees as businesses across the state have increased wages due to the pandemic and related worker shortage. The Legislature this year earmarked $32.5 million in new appropriations for DHS to clear its developmental disability services waiting list. Roughly one-third of that funding will go toward the provider rate increase. The boost brings hourly wages from about $9.50 to $12, DHS Interim Chief of Staff Samantha Galloway said.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A jury has awarded a racial justice demonstrator more than $1million in a federal lawsuit she filed against the city in 2020 accusing officers of violating her civil rights. Eleaqia McCrae, a Black woman, sued the city and the police department, accusing police of intentionally targeting Black people with deadly force during the protest, which followed the killing of George Floyd, a Black man, by Minneapolis police officers in May 2020. The jury found McCrae proved that Officer Robert Johnston shot her in the eye and chest with rubber bullets and violated her “Fourth Amendment right not to be subjected to excessive force.” McCrae said the bullets caused permanent vision loss and a chest injury. The jury also found she did not prove by “preponderance of the evidence” that Johnston violated her First Amendment right to lawful assembly or that he committed battery against her. She was awarded $250,000 in economic loss and $800,000 in non-economic loss, the jury verdict documents said. McCrae’s attorney, Kevin Brague, said in the lawsuit that McCrae attended a demonstration May 31, 2020, and after nightfall, people unrelated to the march arrived and began throwing objects. McCrae said she, her sister and a friend were kneeling at the front of the march when she was shot twice.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: A judge has barred enforcement of an executive order signed by Mayor Jim Kenney last week banning guns and deadly weapons from the city’s indoor and outdoor recreation spaces, including parks, basketball courts and pools. Common Pleas Judge Joshua Roberts on Monday ordered Philadelphia “permanently enjoined” from enforcing the order after a legal challenge, citing Pennsylvania state law that prohibits any city or county from passing gun-control measures, The Philadelphia Inquirer reports. The Gun Owners of America, on behalf of several state residents, filed a lawsuit immediately after Kenny’s order, the latest attempt by Philadelphia officials to regulate guns inside city limits. Attorneys for the city had cited its role as a property owner managing its facilities, saying that distinguished the order from previous legislation passed by the City Council and struck down in court. Andrew Austin, who represents the plaintiffs, said in a statement that he was gratified by the court’s quick action. But he said it was “in large part because the law is so explicit: The city is not allowed to regulate possession of firearms in any manner.” “It is unfortunate that the mayor and city are willing to waste their time and taxpayer money on these type of ‘feel-good’ measures,” Austin said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: With the “Superman Building” as a backdrop and an unsheltered woman surrounded by her belongings just yards away, more than 50 protesters gathered at Burnside Park on Monday to demand that Gov. Dan McKee declare a state of emergency and take more action to provide immediate shelter to Rhode Islanders experiencing homelessness. “It’s your friends. It’s your neighbors. It’s your relatives. These people are not a separate category of human beings. They’re people who need help,” said Eric Hirsch, a Providence College professor who’s spent three decades advocating for people without housing. At last count, there were 405 people living without shelter in the state, not factoring in others who are staying with family and friends, said Hirsch, co-chair of the state’s Homeless Management Information System Steering Committee. The protest came as McKee and state Secretary of Housing Josh Saal participated in Crossroads Rhode Island’s Celebration of Housing to highlight “record investments in housing.” The event touted $12 million in state and federal money for the development of Crossroads’ Summer Street Apartments in Providence, a 176-apartment complex that will provide current residents of the Crossroads Tower with one-bedroom units that include private bathrooms and full kitchens.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Every year, law enforcement agencies across the state turn in crime data to the Federal Bureau of Investigation on a voluntary basis. The optional nature of this self-reporting can leave gaps when comparing crime data from the FBI to local agencies. “You likely have seen news stories where a crime was solved or an investigation was supported or a missing person was found. It was a crime analyst who connected those dots,” said Michele Covington, executive director of USC Upstate’s Greenville programs and an associate professor of criminal justice. “When you see crime trends, and an agency is able to trend downwards, there’s usually an analyst behind that.” The Marshall Project, a nonprofit news organization that focuses on the U.S. criminal justice system, compiled a report of which agencies fully reported, partially reported, or neglected to report crime data for the 2021 calendar year. Eighty-five percent of South Carolinians saw their jurisdictional law enforcement agency fully report 12 months of 2021 crime statistics to the FBI, despite only 30% of agencies in the state fully reporting. The largest agencies in the state by population coverage not to fully report were the York County Sheriff’s Office, Charleston Police Department and Aiken County Sheriff’s Office. Most of the major agencies missing data were located in the Midlands and Lowcountry.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Native Americans who plead guilty to first-degree manslaughter in South Dakota receive on average 11 years longer in prison than their white counterparts, according to an analysis and investigation of court records spanning 10 years. But prosecutors and judges called into question the sample size and said several factors go into sentencing decisions, such as criminal histories and the specific nature of the crime. The Sioux Falls Argus Leader pulled data from the South Dakota Unified Judicial System, filtering by charged convictions made by offenders who were Native American. The data only captures those who pleaded guilty and/or avoided a trial, reflecting the majority of convictions in the state during the past decade. The data also excludes those who were given life sentences. A total of 84 offenders pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter in South Dakota during the past 10 years, according to the data. Of those cases, 44% were white, 32% were Native American, 16% were Black, and 7% were Hispanic or Latino. Four of the 84 received a life sentence, according to the data. None of the four were Native American. White people convicted of first-degree manslaughter on average were sentenced to 35 years in prison, Native Americans to 46, Black people to 40 years and Hispanics to 42.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The snail darter, a tiny fish that derailed a federal dam during an epic battle over Endangered Species Act protection in the 1970s, is no longer considered imperiled, officials announced Tuesday. The fish held up construction of the Tellico Dam in Tennessee for more than two years as biologists and others fought to protect its only known habitat, the free-flowing Little Tennessee River. The battle, which went to the U.S. Supreme Court and beyond, is still sometimes cited as an example of environmentalist overreach, although the reality is much more complicated. The dam eventually was built, with snail darters collected and transplanted into other rivers. They were also later discovered in several additional streams. Snail darters went from being considered an endangered species in 1975 to a threatened species in 1984 as they continued to recover. Three years ago, the Center for Biological Diversity, Jim Williams and Zygmunt Plater petitioned to remove the fish from federal protection altogether. Williams is the biologist who listed the snail darter as endangered. Plater is the attorney who sued to protect it. The U.S. Department of the Interior on Tuesday announced the snail darter’s official removal from the federal list of threatened and endangered wildlife.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: A man accused of killing 22 elderly women in the Dallas area and stealing jewelry and valuables has been linked by DNA evidence to one of the deaths, a prosecutor said Monday. Billy Chemirmir, 49, is on trial for capital murder in the death of 87-year-old Mary Brooks. It’s Chemirmir’s third trial. His first trial, in the smothering death of 81-year-old Lu Thi Harris, ended in a mistrial last November when the jury deadlocked. He was retried and found guilty in April and sentenced to life without parole. If convicted in Brooks’ death, he’ll receive a second sentence of life without parole. Prosecutor Glen Fitzmartin said in opening statements that while presenting evidence in the deaths of Brooks and Harris, he would also show that DNA links Chemirmir to the death of 80-year-old Martha Williams. Chemirmir has maintained his innocence. His attorney entered a not guilty plea on his behalf Monday but declined to make an opening statement. His arrest was set in motion in March 2018 when Mary Annis Bartel – 91 at the time – told police that a man had forced his way into her apartment at an independent living community for seniors, tried to smother her with a pillow and took her jewelry.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Five years after they allegedly snuck into a pig farm and recorded video of themselves smuggling two piglets away from what they said were inhumane living conditions, two animal rights activists are set to face a jury trial this week despite protests about a mistake made during Monday’s jury selection process. Wayne Hsiung and Paul Darwin Picklesimer, the two remaining defendants facing charges from the 2017 incident, could face more than 10 years in prison on charges of felony burglary and theft. They were part of a group of five people who reportedly recorded a series of disturbing videos at Circle Four Farms in Milford, Utah, where owner Smithfield Foods was operating one of the country’s largest pig farms. The other three people charged in the case struck plea deals earlier, but Hsiung and Picklesimer pursued their cases, saying they hoped they could raise awareness about animal cruelty at factory farms and potentially set new precedent if a jury determined they were justified in taking the piglets because they feared for the animals’ lives. Jury selection in the trial was set to start Monday at the 5th District Courthouse, but there was controversy even before the trial could begin after defense lawyers protested they had not received information on prospective jurors and asked for a mistrial.\n\nVermont\n\nSt. Albans: The state Health Department has confirmed five cases of Legionnaire’s disease in Franklin County, including one death, but the source of the infection is unknown, it said Tuesday. The cases were reported between Aug. 12 and Aug. 29 and appear to be clustered in the St. Albans area, the department said. The death was in a person in their 70s, it said. The general risk to residents is very low: Most healthy people exposed to the bacteria do not get sick, the Health Department said. The disease can be treated with antibiotics. Legionnaires’ disease is a form of pneumonia caused by Legionella bacteria. Air-conditioning units for large buildings, hot tubs, cooling misters, decorative fountains or plumbing systems are common sources of infection, officials said. Symptoms, which start two to 14 days after exposure, can include a cough, muscle aches, fever, shortness of breath and headache, the department said. The disease is not contagious and almost never spreads from human to human, the department said. People with symptoms who live or work in Franklin County are encouraged to contact a health care professional. Those age 50 and older who smoke or formerly smoked, have chronic lung disease, or have a weakened immune system are at increased risk of serious illness.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: Higher prices at the grocery store mean more and more people in the area are relying on food banks to feed themselves and their families. The Thomas Jefferson Area Food Bank has been packed, its warehouse holding rows of pallets of canned goods stacked to be packed into kits for seniors or distributed to members of the community who need emergency food. As of late, it’s also held lines of people. “This is the one day this week where it hasn’t been crowded,” said the food bank’s partner engagement manager, Joe Kreiter. Rising food costs are being blamed. Prices swelled 11.4% between August 2021 and August 2022, according to the most recent Consumer Price Index report Michael McKee, CEO of the Blue Ridge Area Food Bank, which partners with the Thomas Jefferson Area branch, said the organization served 110,000 people in July, an increase from 106,000 in June. He expects the upward trend to continue. High rent in Charlottesville and Albemarle County and a lack of affordable child care often leave little room in a family’s budget, McKee said. Single mothers, seniors and children are the three groups who depend on food-assistance programs the most. Food banks used to provide emergency food assistance, but they’ve become a regular source of food for low-income people, Kreiter said.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Amazon has sued the state’s labor agency following disputes with regulators over citations and fines imposed on the company for worker safety issues. In the lawsuit, filed Monday in federal court for the Western District of Washington, Amazon asked a judge to prohibit orders from the Washington Department of Labor & Industries to remedy any types of workplace hazards during the company’s pending appeal over the citations. Amazon argued in the lawsuit that the agency has not proven any of its allegations and that requiring companies like it to remedy alleged hazards before that happens violates the due process protections under the 14th Amendment. Matt Ross, a spokesperson for the agency, said the department is aware of the lawsuit and will review it along with the state’s attorney general’s office. The agency had said in March it inspected an Amazon warehouse in Kent, Washington, and found workplace processes that “create a serious hazard for work-related back, shoulder, wrist, and knee injuries.” It said workers were expected to perform tasks, such as lifting and carrying items, at a fast pace that heightened the risk of injury. Amazon’s warehouse injury rate has been higher compared to other warehouses, which CEO Andy Jassy acknowledged earlier this year and said the company was attempting to improve.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A voucher program that would provide parents state money to pull their children out of K-12 public schools is blatantly unconstitutional and would disproportionately affect poor children and those with disabilities, a lawyer representing parents who sued the state argued Tuesday in West Virginia’s Supreme Court. The Hope Scholarship Program, which was passed by the GOP-controlled Legislature last year and would have been one of the most far-reaching school choice programs in the country, “negatively and intentionally” impacts West Virginia’s system of free schools, lawyer Tamerlin Godley told justices during oral arguments. “It decreases enrollment and thus funding,” said Godley, who is representing two parents of children who receive special education supports in West Virginia public schools. “It utilizes public funding for subsidizing more affluent families that have chosen private and home-schooling, and it silos the poor and special needs children who cannot use the vouchers.” Signed by Republican Gov. Jim Justice last year, the program was set to go into effect this school year but was blocked by Circuit Court Judge Joanna Tabit in July.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The Republican-controlled Legislature took mere seconds Tuesday to reject Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ call to create a way for voters to get a chance to repeal the state’s 1849 abortion ban, even as Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson voiced support for letting the people decide the issue. The move by Evers is the latest by Democrats in the battleground state to turn the Nov. 8 election into a referendum on abortion. But Evers’ GOP opponent, Tim Michels, Johnson and other Republicans are focusing instead on crime and public safety in arguing that Democrats have failed to keep the state safe. “What people want to talk about (is) reducing crime, they want to talk about reducing inflation, they want to talk about getting more money in their pocket, and they want better schools in Wisconsin,” Michels said at a campaign stop in Baraboo when asked for his reaction to the Legislature’s action. A Marquette University Law School poll last month showed both the state’s governor and U.S. Senate races to be about even, while a majority of voters support abortion rights. The Wisconsin Senate convened for all of 15 seconds, to gavel in and adjourn, the special session called by Evers to pass a constitutional amendment that would create a pathway for an up-or-down vote on the state’s abortion ban.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: An owl at the Teton Raptor Center has tested positive for avian influenza, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reports. It’s the first case of the deadly disease this fall in Teton County, and the great horned owl was euthanized humanely, the center said in a statement.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/07/20/sinkhole-swallows-van-navajo-code-talkers-female-blue-angel-news-around-states/50506581/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Alan Eugene Miller, 57, a truck driver convicted of killing three men in a workplace shooting rampage more than two decades ago is set to be put to death on Sept. 22, the Alabama Supreme Court said. The clerk’s office announced the scheduled execution date of Miller, who was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death in the slayings, which occurred in Shelby County in 1999. Testimony indicated Miller was delusional and believed the two men he killed were spreading rumors about him, including one that he was gay. Although a defense psychiatrist testified Miller was mentally ill, he also said Miller’s condition wasn’t bad enough to use as a basis for an insanity defense under state law. Another Alabama inmate already is set for execution later this month. A federal judge last week ruled the execution of Joe Nathan James Jr. could go ahead as scheduled on July 28, refusing the condemned man’s request for a postponement. James was convicted of killing his former girlfriend, Faith Hall, in Birmingham, almost three decades ago.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Officials ended their search for a woman whose 2-year-old grandchild was found alone last week in a locked car stuck in mud on a rural road, authorities said. No clues to the whereabouts of Mary Dawn Wilson, 69, have emerged since her Ford Focus was found last Thursday with the child and personal items believed to belong to Wilson, the Alaska Department of Public Safety said in a statement Saturday. Authorities believe the child was alone in the car for two days. The search was changed from “active” to “reactive,” meaning that a search could be launched again if officials receive new information or evidence, the statement said. The statement added that at “this time, there is no evidence of foul play associated with Wilson’s disappearance.”\n\nArizona\n\nMesa: Thunderstorms packing wind gusts of up to 80 mph knocked down some power lines in the Mesa area and destroyed a mobile home, sending a woman to a hospital by ambulance. Maryjane Garcia Stanley told Phoenix radio station KTAR that her 61-year-old mother was trapped under debris after the monsoon hit Sunday night, with her legs pinned under a stove. Stanley said her mother was being treated for a broken vertebrae. Video from the scene showed the mobile home reduced to piles of rubble with debris scattered across the property and roadway. Thousands of homes reported electrical outages and State Route 87 was closed in both directions near Mesa because of fallen power lines that authorities say might take several days to repair. National Weather Service meteorologists said north Mesa received almost 1 ½ inches of rain from the thunderstorms as the Phoenix metro area continues to have an active monsoon season.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A former Little Rock police chief who fired his gun at an armed suspect on New Year’s Eve won’t face charges in the shooting. Prosecutor Larry Jegley said in a letter to Arkansas State Police dated Friday that Keith Humphrey was justified in the use of force in the shooting outside a convenience store. A state police spokesman said the letter formally closes the agency’s investigation into the shooting. Humphrey had stopped after seeing a fight among a crowd in the parking lot and was approaching the group when a 29-year-old woman shot and critically wounded a 22-year-old woman, state police said. Humphrey then opened fire, but did not strike the 29-year-old, who was later arrested, state police said. The woman has pleaded not guilty to first-degree battery. Humphrey had been briefly placed on administrative leave after the shooting.Humphrey, who was hired as chief in April 2019, retired in May.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: An Oakland man was arrested for allegedly reporting a false bomb threat over the weekend, prompting the evacuation of hundreds of people from the San Francisco International Airport’s international terminal, police said. Terry Addison, 53, was charged with reporting a false bomb threat and malicious report of a false bomb threat, the San Francisco Police Department said in a statement. Addison was booked into jail in San Mateo County, where the airport is located. It was not immediately known if Addison has an attorney who can speak on his behalf. San Mateo County prosecutors did not immediately return an email seeking comment. The bomb threat was reported Friday night, and authorities said they discovered a suspicious package. Investigators at the airport “deemed the item possibly incendiary.” Police said Friday that a man had been taken into custody, but released no other information. Police said they removed “several suspicious packages” from the international terminal and that it was safe and clear to enter just after midnight Saturday.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins:The Larimer County Sheriff’s Office is investigating the cause of a fire in Red Feather Lakes that damaged multiple structures Sunday. Initial reports indicated the fire started about 5 p.m. in a shed on Lone Pine Court and spread to a cabin on the same property, spokesperson David Moore said. From there, the fire spread to a cabin on the next property over and caught the grass on fire. The fire burned the surrounding grass about 100 feet out from the cabins, but moisture on the grass from recent rain helped prevent the fire from spreading more quickly, Moore said. No one was injured in the fire, according to the sheriff’s office. Moore said the sheriff’s office sent an investigator to the scene Monday to investigate the cause of the fire.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: Waterbury police have largely stopped using vans to transport prisoners in response to a man becoming paralyzed in a New Haven police van last month. Waterbury Police Chief Fernando Spagnolo and Mayor Neil O’Leary directed the city’s two police vans be used only for bringing prisoners to and from court until seat belts are installed and officers are trained how to use them, the Republican-American newspaper reported Sunday. The directive took effect July 1, and the seat belt installation and training are expected to be completed by the end of the summer. In New Haven, Richard “Randy” Cox was seriously injured in the back of a police van with no seat belts June 19 when, police said, the officer driving the vehicle braked suddenly to avoid an accident. Cox, who was handcuffed, flew headfirst into the metal divider between the driver’s cab and the back and became paralyzed. Cox’s family and the state NAACP are calling for federal civil rights charges against New Haven police.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A man was arrested Monday and charged with arson and other offenses in a Target store fire that police said he started “as a diversion to steal a cart full of merchandise.” The 26-year-old man started the fire in the linen section of the store on July 10 and the store was quickly evacuated, Dover police said in a news release. No injuries were reported, but $3 million to $4 million in merchandise was damaged by smoke or fire, police said. Target spokesperson Brian Harper-Tibaldo said the store will remain closed for several weeks for repairs and restocking, The News Journal reported. The Dover man was arrested at home and charged with first-degree arson, 19 counts of first-degree reckless endangering, criminal mischief of $5,000 or greater, shoplifting under $1,500 and wearing a disguise during the commission of a felony, police said. He was committed to Sussex Correctional Institution on $137,000 cash bond.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Residents along the 1900 block of C Street NE and D Street NE said they are concerned about flooding and are hoping the DC Department of Transportation will do something to fix the problem, WUSA-TV reported. WUSA-TV reached out to DDOT for a statement but has not received a reply yet. Dorothy Wright who said she has lived along the 1900 Block of C Street NE for 20 years and she believes the problem is a result of this construction project steps away from her front door. “I just saw water streaming down the street like I’ve never seen before,” Wright said about the rain Saturday afternoon.\n\nFlorida\n\nPensacola: The U.S. Navy’s Blue Angels have named Lt. Amanda Lee, of Mounds View, Minnesota, the first woman as a demonstration pilot for the 2023 air show season. Women have served with the Blue Angels in other capacities for more than 55 years, but Lee is the first to join the iconic flight squadron as a pilot, the Navy said. Lee, a member of the “Gladiators” of Strike Fighter Squadron 106, graduated from Old Dominion University in 2013, the Blue Angels said Monday in a Facebook post announcing the new team. The Blue Angels also named five other new members of the team based at the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, including pilots Navy Lt. Cmdr. Thomas Zimmerman, of Baltimore and Marine Corps Capt. Samuel Petko of Osceola, Indiana. Lt. Cmdr. Brian Vaught, of Englewood, Colorado, was named events coordinator. Lt. Cmdr. Greg Jones, of Cary, North Carolina, will be an aviation maintenance officer and Lt. Philippe Warren, of Williamsburg, Virginia, is the new flight surgeon. The new team members will report to the squadron in September for a two-month turnover period. Once the 2022 show season concludes in November, they will embark on a rigorous five-month training program at NAS Pensacola and Naval Air Facility El Centro, Calif.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Michael Boggs was sworn in Monday as chief justice of the Georgia Supreme Court. He replaces David Nahmias, who announced in February he was stepping down from the court. Georgia chief justices are chosen by their colleagues to serve a single four-year term leading the state’s judicial branch. The chief justice speaks for the high court and the rest of the state’s judiciary and presides over oral arguments and deliberation meetings. The chief justice also chairs the Georgia Judicial Council, which makes policy for the judicial branch. Georgia Supreme Court justices run for six-year terms and can be reelected. Justice Nels Peterson was sworn in Monday as the court’s presiding justice. Typically, the presiding justice is next in line to be chief justice.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Towering waves on Hawaii’s south shores crashed into homes and businesses, spilled across highways and upended weddings over the weekend. The large waves – some more than 20 feet high – came from a combination of a strong south swell that peaked Saturday night, particularly high tides and rising sea levels associated with climate change, the National Weather Service said Monday. A wedding Saturday night in Kailua-Kona was interrupted when a set of large waves swamped the event, sending tables and chairs crashing toward guests.\n\nIdaho\n\nTwin Falls: The Idaho Republican Party has rejected adding language to their platform to allow an abortion to save the life of the mother. KMVT-TV reported a majority of the roughly 700 delegates from across the state rejected the change to the party’s existing platform during its three-day convention that ended Saturday. The platform does not have the force of law but states the party’s position it wants Republicans in elected office to follow. Delegates also chose U.S. Rep. Dorothy Moon to replace more moderate Tom Luna as the party’s chair. Moon ran unsuccessfully in the Republican primary in May for secretary of state, contending the 2020 presidential election was fraudulent and Joe Biden wasn’t president.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield:Gov. JB Pritzker has tested positive for the coronavirus. The governor’s press team sent out a release Tuesday morning which said the governor tested positive after being notified of several close contacts. “I’ve tested positive for COVID-19 and am experiencing mild symptoms,” the governor said on Twitter. Pritzker will work from home until he is feeling better. The governor is fully vaccinated and double-boosted, according to his press office. Last week, the governor signed an updated executive order that amends testing requirements for some unvaccinated health care employees and removes mandates for some other industries, including schools.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state sales tax on gasoline will rise slightly starting Aug. 1 even though pump prices have dropped more than 11% from a month ago. A total of 62.4 cents per gallon in state taxes will be charged during August, the Indiana Department of Revenue announced Monday. That will be up three-tenths of a cent from July’s record-high rate based on the agency’s calculations of statewide average gasoline prices over the past month – despite AAA reporting Indiana’s average price dropping to $4.58 a gallon as of Monday from $5.15 a month earlier. Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb and GOP legislative leaders have rejected calls from Democrats since March to temporarily suspend state gas taxes to aid residents amid the high national inflation rate. Holcomb, instead, has asked legislators to approve $225 payments from the growing state budget surplus to all taxpayers during a special legislative session that starts next week.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A former lottery computer technician convicted in a scheme to rig computers to win jackpots for himself, friends and family has been paroled after serving more than five years in prison. Eddie Tipton, 59, was released from prison Friday, according to online prisoner records. Tipton pleaded guilty to ongoing criminal conduct in 2017 and was ordered to pay restitution of $2.2 million to Colorado, Wisconsin, Kansas and Oklahoma. He shared some of the restitution obligation with his brother in Texas, who collected some of the winnings and served a 75-day jail sentence. It’s not known what happened to the money Tipton and his associates won between 2005 and 2011. Out of the seven known winning tickets that netted more than $2.2 million, Eddie Tipton claimed to have ended up with only $351,000.\n\nKansas\n\nSouth Hutchinson: A small fire in a vacant store under remodel in a strip mall led to the evacuation Monday of several other businesses in the center. The fire was discovered on the back of the building at 507 N. Main St. just after 10:30 a.m., said South Hutchinson Fire Chief Shae Barajas-Brooks. South Hutchinson dispatched two trucks and called for assistance from Hutchinson for one truck as backup because of the size of the building, which contains six storefronts, including a Dollar General, local pharmacy and liquor store. The local fire units knocked the fire down while Hutchinson firefighters helped open the roof to vent smoke. Also assisting were the South Hutchinson Police and Hutchinson Police departments and the Reno County Sheriff’s Office, who blocked streets so lines could be laid and evacuated the other buildings. The Fire Marshal was investigating the cause, but preliminary investigation indicated it was an accidental electrical fire.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The Kentucky State Fair is hiring workers for next month’s festival in Louisville. News outlets reported the fair is hiring workers for dozens of roles including admission, traffic control, guest services, operations, maintenance, outdoor cleanup and housekeeping. Morning, day, evening and overnight shifts that include indoor and outdoor work are available, the fair said in a news release. The fair runs from Aug. 18 through Aug. 28 at the Kentucky Exposition Center in Louisville. Hiring will take place through Aug. 28. Pay ranges from $11 to $13.50 an hour, and can be $16 to $20.25 during overtime. Those who apply must be at least 18 years old and have a photo identification and social security card. Those interested can apply on the fair’s website and by calling the fair’s human resources department. Applicants can also visit the exposition center for hiring from Wednesday through Friday.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBridge City: Another group of six youths has escaped from a suburban New Orleans juvenile detention center that was rocked by a June riot. The Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office said the six broke out of the Bridge City Center for Youth about 2:30 a.m. Sunday. Five were recaptured after stealing a vehicle. A sixth youth, a 17-year-old from Orleans Parish, is still on the loose. It’s the fourth escape this year from the facility. Jefferson Parish officials are pushing to close it after a June riot in which 20 juveniles took over parts of the complex. No one escaped during the uprising, but nearby residents said they feel unsafe.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A judge has granted class-action status for an American Civil Liberties Union of Maine lawsuit over the system that provides attorneys to those who can’t afford them. The lawsuit contended there’s a failure to train, supervise and adequately fund a system to ensure the constitutional right to effective counsel. It originally named five defendants. The ruling by Kennebec County Superior Justice Michaela Murphy late last week means it’ll become a class-action suit with plaintiffs numbering in the thousands in the state. Maine is the only state in the nation without a public defender’s office for people who cannot afford to hire an attorney. Instead, the state relies on private attorneys who are reimbursed by the state and the number of lawyers willing to take court-appointed cases has declined in recent years.\n\nMaryland\n\nPiney Point: Searchers found the body of a 10-year-old girl who disappeared while swimming in southern Maryland over the weekend, authorities said Monday. Genesi Elizabeth Sosa-Bonilla was found dead near where she was last seen in the water on Sunday, the St. Mary’s County Sheriff’s Office said in a news release. The sheriff’s office, Maryland Department of Natural Resources and members of volunteer fire and rescue companies responded to Camp Merryelande in Piney Point about 1 p.m. Sunday for a report of swimmers in distress, the sheriff’s office said. Two 10-year-olds and a man were swimming when the current pulled them farther out into the Potomac River. The man was able to swim to shore and people nearby were able to rescue one of the two children from the water, the sheriff’s office said. The U.S. Coast Coast and agencies from Maryland and Virginia were involved in the search that continued overnight into Monday.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Lawmakers approved a $52.7 billion state budget Monday, more than two weeks into the state’s new fiscal year. The unanimous votes in both chambers came after a six-member House and Senate conference committee finished hammering out the details of the final compromise budget plan over the weekend. The agreement was crafted after each chamber approved their own versions of the spending plan earlier in the year. The budget – which now heads to Republican Gov. Charlie Baker for his signature – does not include any new broad-based taxes.\n\nMichigan\n\nGreenville: The FBI on Monday raided a western Michigan company that manufactures aluminum alloy wheels for automotive giants Ford, General Motors, Stellantis, Honda, Toyota and Nissan. According to FBI spokesperson Mara Schneider, the FBI executed a search warrant at Dicastal North America in Greenville on Monday morning. She provided no other details, beyond saying the investigation is ongoing, though the Detroit Free Press has learned from a source familiar with the raid that computers were seized and employees were sent home.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMorris: Local leaders in this western Minnesota city have voted to disband the police department, which has dwindled to just two officers, including the chief. The city of Morris, like other communities across the country, is dealing with changing attitudes about policing and challenges in recruiting and retaining officers. Morris, with a population of about 5,200 residents, has budgeted for eight full-time officers and an administrative specialist. The Morris City Council plans to sign a contract for law enforcement services with the Stevens County Sheriff’s Office and shut down a police department that has been around for more than 140 years.\n\nMississippi\n\nPass Christian: A lawsuit alleges that a Mississippi high school soccer player with a rare skin disease was bullied and physically assaulted for months, with school officials failing to respond. The parents of the 15-year-old boy have sued the Pass Christian school district, a principal and Jones College in Ellisville, seeking unspecified damages, saying all three failed to protect their son. The Sun Herald reported the lawsuit said the student has Darier disease, which can cause wart-like blemishes to flare up on skin that is contaminated or irritated. The parents said soccer teammates would rub muscle pain ointment or bleach on their son’s socks, or drag his clothes through the dirt, mostly during practice or before games in the 2020-21 school year. The assaults intensified when the team attended soccer camp in June 2021 at Jones College, a community college in Ellisville, the suit alleged. There, it claimed players stripped off the boy’s clothes, poured hot liquids on the boy’s face, or shoved a canned sausage in his throat, and that the players showed videos of the assaults on social media.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Charles: Police said a convenience store customer shot and killed an armed robber in a St. Louis suburb early Saturday. The QuikTrip customer, who St. Charles police identified only as a 26-year-old man from St. Louis, grabbed a gun from his vehicle and confronted the robber after he saw the man grab the clerk and hold a knife to her throat, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Police said investigators believed the suspect was also responsible for a burglary and second robbery at two other gas stations that happened shortly before he went to the QuikTrip about 3:20 a.m. Saturday. He was also driving a black Toyota Highlander that had been reported stolen on Friday. St. Charles police said the suspect who died was 26-year-old Lance Bush of St. Louis who was homeless. But they wouldn’t identify the customer who shot him until prosecutors review the incident to determine if the killing was justified.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A California woman who was fatally mauled by a grizzly bear in western Montana last summer was the victim of a rare predatory attack by a food-conditioned bear that was likely attracted to food in and near her tent and scents left behind from recent Independence Day picnics, wildlife officials said. Leah Davis Lokan, 65, of Chico was pulled out of her tent and mauled in the predawn hours of July 6, 2021, in the small town of Ovando, along the banks of the Blackfoot River, made famous by the movie “A River Runs Through It.” The town borders a huge expanse of forested land that is home to an estimated 1,000 grizzlies. About an hour before the mauling, the bear had approached the tents of Lokan and a Texas couple who were camping behind a museum. They were able to scare the bear away. Lokan, a retired nurse, told the couple that the bear “huffed at my head,” according to the incident report by the Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee’s Board of Review. Lokan declined an offer to go sleep at a hotel where her sister and their friend were staying, investigators reported. The women were participating in a long-anticipated bike ride along the Great Divide Mountain route. The bear that mauled Lokan was shot thee days later while raiding a chicken coop near Ovando. DNA tests confirmed it was the same grizzly that also raided a different chicken coop in the hours after the mauling. The bear was 4 to 7 years old, investigators said.\n\nNebraska\n\nTorrington: The body of a missing kayaker was recovered early Monday from the North Platte River, authorities said, the Lincoln Journal Star reported. The victim’s identity has not been released, except a report that it is a 48-year-old woman.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Incumbent Democrats have raised more than their Republican opponents in every statewide race, according to the latest expense reports. The reports, filed Friday, document fundraising and spending from April 1 to June 30. In the governor’s race, incumbent Steve Sisolak raised almost $3.3 million, and Republican opponent Joe Lombardo raised $1.65 million. Yet, Lombardo outspent Sisolak during the quarter by just over $2 million.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nCarroll: New Hampshire’s latest historical marker commemorates clergyman Henry Ward Beecher’s open-air sermon site from the 1870s near a glacial boulder in the White Mountains area. Beecher, an abolitionist, proponent of women’s suffrage, and brother to author Harriet Beecher Stowe, came to the area to escape seasonal allergies, according to the marker installed near the intersection of Routes 3 and 302 in a part of Carroll known as Twin Mountain. “While a guest at the Twin Mountain House, located near this site, Beecher conducted sermons that sometimes drew crowds over 1,000,” the marker said. The marker was unveiled earlier this month as part of Carroll’s 250th anniversary celebration. It is the 274th marker in New Hampshire’s Historical Highway Marker program.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nClifton: A former silk mill and textile manufacturing building that dates to the Industrial Revolution will be demolished to make room for a residential building if city zoning officials approve the proposal. The owners of International Veiling Corp. are seeking zoning board approval to raze the three-story red brick building with large metal multipaned windows and replace it with modern apartments. The Wiley family has led International Veiling for three generations, guiding the textile company since 1904. The company, a mill for the spinning of broadcloth and ribbons, was set up in the Hazel Street building that dates to the early 1880s.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nBreadsprings: Efforts continue on building a museum in Tsé Bonito that honors the Diné men who used the Navajo language to transmit secret military messages during World War II. Although there have been some studies done on the land that will hold the museum, the project needs money, presenters told New Mexico lawmakers on the Indian Affairs Committee during a July 11 meeting at the Bááháálí Chapter house. With four code talkers still alive, it is urgent to have the museum built and operating, said Regan Hawthorne, chief executive officer of the Navajo Code Talkers Museum Inc. His father, Roy, was part of the elite group that numbered about 400. The elder Hawthorne died in April 2018. Approximately 300 acres has been designated for the structure near the Navajo Division of Transportation complex and its cost is estimated at $46.6 million.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Street repairs were underway Tuesday after a van fell into a giant sinkhole in the Bronx. A sinkhole the length of three cars opened on Radcliff Avenue in the Morris Park neighborhood after heavy rain Monday. Videos that aired on local news stations showed a white van tip over on its left side and then plunge into the hole. The van’s owner told reporters at the scene that he wasn’t worried. “I’m all right,” he said. “Lose the van … it’s life.” The sinkhole was being filled on Tuesday and the New York City Department of Environmental Protection was investigating the cause of the roadway collapse, department spokesperson Edward Timbers said. Meanwhile, the van was hoisted out of the hole and set upright; the owner got in and drove it off, Timbers said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nHolden Beach: A shore-based shark fishing tournament has been rescheduled after coastal officials expressed concerns about the event’s impact on tourism. Event organizer Marty Wright said fishermen could fish for sharks from Ocean Isle Beach to Oak Island, and that participants would only be using baitfish dropped from kayaks about 300 to 600 feet offshore, WWAY reported. The event was scheduled for last weekend, but it was moved to October after Wright said he received a call from Oak Island’s mayor asking him to move the event to after Labor Day, when there are fewer swimmers at the beach.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Animal health officials are ending a ban on poultry events that was instituted when cases of bird flu were on the rise. However, the decision by the State Board of Animal Health came too late for State Fair poultry exhibits this year. The board in March canceled all shows, public sales and exhibitions of poultry within the state at the request of the North Dakota Turkey Federation to help stem the spread of the bird flu. Private sales, catalog sales and retail sales were still allowed. Early last month, the board extended the ban indefinitely. But, now that summer weather and bird migration has decreased the risk of avian influenza, the board has lifted the ban. But State Fair organizers said they don’t have enough time to arrange for poultry shows this year. The fair begins Friday in Minot.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A conservative podcaster who has embraced former President Donald Trump’s claims the 2020 election was stolen will be on the November ballot for Ohio secretary of state. Terpsehore Tore Maras gathered more than the required 5,000 signatures to get on the ballot as an independent, Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose said. Maras will face LaRose and Democratic nominee Chelsea Clark in November for the job of overseeing Ohio’s elections. She initially sought to challenge LaRose in the May Republican primary, but could not make that ballot.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The City Council established a human rights commission Tuesday for the first time since 1996. The nine-member commission will be charged with investigating and addressing complaints about employment, housing and public accommodations discrimination. The City Council approved forming the commission by 5-4 vote, with councilmembers Bradley Carter, Barbara Young, David Greenwell and Mark Stonecipher voting against. The previous human rights commission was disbanded by the City Council in 1996 after commissioners sought to extend protection to the city’s LGBTQ+ residents.\n\nOregon\n\nEugene: A judge has sentenced a 27-year-old man to at least 50 years in prison for the murder of his grandparents. Nicholas Borden-Cortez was sentenced last week in Lane County for two counts of first-degree murder, The Register-Guard reported. Borden-Cortez pleaded guilty in June to the May 6, 2021, murder of 85-year-old Nancy Loucks-Morris and 87-year-old Gerald Morris. As part of his guilty plea, prosecutors dropped two charges of second-degree abuse of a corpse and a charge of attempting to elude a police officer, as well as a separate but related case with two charges of unlawful firearm use. Investigators found his grandparents dead inside a home in the Falconwood Mobile Home Park, police said. Later that day, police named Borden-Cortez as a suspect. Borden-Cortez was arrested on May 7, 2021, in Springfield after a vehicle chase. Police said he initially challenged officers to shoot him before he was taken into custody. Borden-Cortez will be eligible for parole after serving a minimum 50 years of his sentence.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The first of six people charged with setting fire to police vehicles in Philadelphia during the 2020 protests after the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police has been sentenced. Ayoub Tabri, 25, was sentenced Monday to 364 days behind bars – less time than he has already served in custody, and short enough to avoid triggering deportation proceedings for the Moroccan immigrant. Attorneys for Tabri, of Arlington, Va., said the green card holder has been in the U.S. since he was 6. A longer sentence, which he and the others faced under the original arson charges that carried a minimum sentence of seven years in prison, could have sent him to a country where he knew no one and didn’t speak the language, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported. Former U.S. Attorney Bill McSwain had vowed to pursue the harsher arson charges against the six people arrested. After he left office last year, federal prosecutors worked out plea deals with a handful of those defendants, including Tabri and Lore-Elizabeth Blumenthal. Still, prosecutors argued for a longer sentence in court Monday. Tabri pleaded guilty in March to one count of obstructing law enforcement during civil disorder, according to court records. Once released, Tabri will serve three years probation and have to pay about $87,000 in restitution for the Pennsylvania State Police car destroyed after he and others threw lit road flares into the vehicle.\n\nRhode Island\n\nEast Providence: Two on-ramps in East Providence that connect to westbound Route 195, just before the Washington Bridge, will be closed for four days starting July 28, as the state moves the ramps to free up land. The ramps onto Route 195 west, from Veterans Memorial Parkway and Warren Avenue, will be closed starting at 8 p.m. July 28, through 6 a.m. Aug. 1, Department of Transportation Spokesman Charles St. Martin wrote in a news release. Traffic from the two ramps merge before being directed onto Route 195. The ramps need to be moved slightly to the south so work can begin on a new off-ramp onto Waterfront Drive, part of the larger $78 million Washington Bridge project, which lasts until 2026. That exit is expected to open in two years and allow for easier access to the East Providence waterfront and the east side of Providence, St. Martin wrote.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSpartanburg: City Councilwoman Meghan Smith has been named to a short list of prospective candidates for lieutenant governor by Democratic gubernatorial nominee Joe Cunningham. Smith is among nine people on Cunningham’s short list. Reached Monday, Smith said she is “very humbled and honored.” The others on the short list include: Tally Parham Casey, CEO of Wyche Law Firm, and first female fighter pilot in the South Carolina Air National Guard; Rosalyn Glenn, financial planner and former Democratic nominee for state treasurer; state Rep. Jermaine Johnson, a small business owner and former professional basketball player; state Rep. Kimberly O. Johnson, assistant director of the F. E. DuBose Career Center; Ed Sutton, and Air Force pilot and commercial realtor; state Rep. Spencer Wetmore, a former prosecutor and former city administrator for Folly Beach; Kathryn Whitaker, chief marketing officer of Burr & Forman, LLP; and Teresa Wilson, city manager for the city of Columbia.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nAberdeen: The National Weather Service said it has issued 561 severe thunderstorm warnings in the state as of July 5. That’s 131 more than in 2007, when the previous record for that time frame was set. “But you know, this is just the first half of the season, so you got to kind of take that into account comparing that to the previous seasons,” said Ryan Vipond, NWS meteorologist in Aberdeen. Although there does appear to be an increasing trend in the number of severe thunderstorms, the National Weather Service said it’s important to note the way storms are predicted has become more precise and the standards have changed over time, South Dakota Public Broadcasting reported. State climatologist Laura Edwards said it’s too early to say what’s causing the increase in storms this year.\n\nTennessee\n\nKnoxville: Officials are conducting a census to learn more about the economic impact and demographics of the equine industry in the state. The University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture and the state Department of Agriculture are handling the project. Data will be used to assist with future state programs, support and resources for the equine industry, the institute said in a news release. Anyone who owns or leases a horse or other member of the horse family or who is involved with the industry can participate. Local barns, farriers, veterinarians, trainers, coaches, feed and forage producers, equine service providers and others involved in the industry are included, the release said. To complete the survey, go online to UTHorse.com and look for the Tennessee Equine Census logo. The census will continue through Aug. 15. Participants must be over the age of 18 and live in the U.S.\n\nTexas\n\nGraford: A wildfire has burned at least five homes and resulted in about 300 homes being evacuated around a lake in north Texas amid sweltering temperatures and dry conditions, authorities said. The residents returned home Tuesday, according to Texas A&M Forest Service spokesperson Adam Turner. The fire at Possum Kingdom Lake about 95 miles west of Dallas began Monday afternoon, has burned about 500 acres and was 10% contained Tuesday, Turner said. No injuries have been reported and the cause was under investigation, but it isn’t believed to have been intentionally set, Turner said. Turner has said drought conditions in the region have left the area ripe for fire. The National Weather Service has issued a Red Flag fire warning for the area for Tuesday, in addition to an excessive heat warning with high temperatures near 110 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A man pleaded guilty Tuesday to fatally shooting his mother and three siblings when he was a teenager in 2020. Colin “CJ” Haynie, 19, killed his his mother and one of his sisters as they returned from her school pickup, then waited for two more siblings to arrive home and killed them, prosecutors said. His father came back to the home later that night and was shot in the leg but survived after wrestling the gun away from his son. After the father subdued him, the then 16-year-old said he had planned to kill everyone in his family at their home in the small town of Grantsville, near Salt Lake City, authorities said. Authorities have said they don’t know his motive. CJ Haynie pleaded guilty to four counts of aggravated murder and one count of attempted murder on Tuesday. Several other weapons charges were dismissed in the plea agreement, court documents showed. He had been charged as an adult by prosecutors because of the seriousness of the crime. The family’s oldest child, Danny, was not home at the time of the shootings. At a funeral for the family members in 2020 at their local Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints’ congregation, Danny said CJ was still loved and part of the family. Sentencing is scheduled for Dec. 7. Aggravated murder in Utah typically carries the possibility of the death penalty, but state prosecutors cannot seek it for people convicted of crimes that happened when they were under 18, even if their their cases are moved to adult court. So Haynie faces a prison sentence of 25 years to life for each aggravated murder conviction under state law.\n\nVermont\n\nNewbury: Fire has gutted an historic schoolhouse in Wells River. Firefighters from Vermont and New Hampshire said the flames were in the roof when they responded within minutes of the call on Monday, WCAX-TV reported. Three hours later, flames were visible in the steeple of the old grade school. The 1870s building is on the the National Register of Historic Places but hasn’t been used as a school since the 1970s. It has had various commercial and residential uses since then.\n\nVirginia\n\nWilliamsburg: Archaeologists began excavating three suspected graves at the original site of one of the nation’s oldest Black churches on Monday, commencing a monthslong effort to learn who was buried there and how they lived. The First Baptist Church was formed in 1776 by free and enslaved Black people in Williamsburg, the colonial capital of Virginia. Members initially met secretly in fields and under trees in defiance of laws that prevented African Americans from congregating. A total of 41 apparent burial plots have been identified. Most are 4 to 6 feet long and up to 2 feet wide. The soil is discolored in places where holes were likely dug and filled back in. Only one grave appears to be marked, with an upside-down empty wine bottle. Before excavations began Monday, a private blessing was held. First Baptist’s original church was destroyed by a tornado in 1834. The second structure, built in 1856, stood there for a century. That building was bought in 1956 and razed to build a parking lot for Colonial Williamsburg, a living history museum that was expanding at the time and that now has more than 400 structures.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: As midterm voting kicks into high gear, Republican activists in Washington are organizing surveillance of ballot drop boxes, generating complaints and concern from some elections officials. Signs were posted near ballot boxes in several Seattle-area locations over the weekend. They had red letters warning the boxes are “Under Surveillance” and stating that accepting money “for harvesting or depositing ballots” might violate federal law, the Seattle Times reported. A scannable code on the signs pointed to a section of the King County Republican Party website with a form encouraging people to submit “election incident” reports, including photos and video. Although it is legal for people to observe the county’s 76 ballot boxes, which are located on public property, the signs raised concerns about possible intimidation. King County Elections has notified the County Prosecutor’s Office “to check on the legality” of the effort.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nClendenin: Three shop students and their teacher from Herbert Hoover High School in Clendenin are working this summer to build furniture for the new Intermediate Court of Appeals courtrooms. The school won the bid to produce benches, podiums and tabletops for the main courtroom in Charleston and five satellite courtrooms. The satellite courtrooms in Grant, Lewis, Morgan, Raleigh and Wetzel counties will allow parties to virtually argue cases.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Wildlife officials said they don’t know when they will release their new wolf management plan after initially saying the document would come out this spring. The Department of Natural Resources’ wolf management plan dates to 1999 and calls for capping the statewide population at 350 animals. Wolf hunt supporters have repeated cited that number as justification for higher quotas. The DNR’s latest population estimates, compiled over the winter of 2020-21, put the number of wolves roaming the state at 1,126. DNR officials began working a stakeholder committee last year to draft a new plan. The department’s timeline called for releasing the draft for public review in the spring of 2022. The department has yet to put out anything and DNR spokeswoman Sarah Hoye said she didn’t have a release date. A federal judge placed most wolves in the continental United States back on the endangered species list in February, outlawing wolf hunting in those states, including Wisconsin.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The state Bureau of Land Management began fire restrictions for its land in Campbell County on Monday because of especially hot and dry weather, the Casper Star Tribune reported. On Friday, the same rules go into effect on BLM lands in Weston and Cook counties.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/01/20/pigeon-hats-cushion-cash-chaka-khan-news-around-states/41032359/", "title": "More pigeon hats, cushion cash: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The nation’s first memorial to lynching victims is expanding. The Equal Justice Initiative on Saturday opened a new welcome center and exhibition space that will add to the existing lynching memorial and museum that documents the history of racial inequality in America. The downtown pavilion will serve as a hub for visitors to the two previously opened sites: EJI’s National Memorial for Peace and Justice, which documents the era of racial terror lynchings between 1877 and 1950, and the Legacy Museum. The Legacy Pavilion will include a monument to women, men and children who were victims of racial terror lynchings in the Civil War’s aftermath. It will also honor civil rights figures including Martin Luther King Jr., Claudette Colvin, John Lewis, Rosa Parks, Jonathan Daniels, Jo Ann Robinson, and E.D. Nixon and describe Montgomery’s role in fueling a civil rights movement. It’ll also include a gift shop, soul food restaurant, and a shuttle service to the memorial and museum.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The University of Alaska Southeast and other schools in the state university system have proposed increasing tuition starting in the fall to combat a decrease in state funding. The 5% increase was brought about after significant cuts to the state’s funding of the University of Alaska system, the Juneau Empire reports. The increase would generate up to $500,000 for the system and apply to resident undergraduate students, university chancellor Rick Caulfield said. Students taking 15 credit hours of courses a semester would pay about $400 more each year, university officials said. Only three students participated in a meeting scheduled for them to address university officials about the proposal, Caulfield said. Teacher education, marine biology and science programs, and mining and maritime-oriented vocational training are some of the university’s most successful programs, university officials said.\n\nArizona\n\nHeber-Overgaard: U.S. Forest Service officials confirm that seven more wild horses have been found dead in eastern Arizona after eight others were found earlier this month and say that at least some were shot. “Several horses died due to bullet wounds,” but other carcasses were too badly decomposed to determine the cause of death, Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests officials said in a statement Friday. The statement said the 15 carcasses were found in a ranger district headquartered in Heber-Overgaard, a rural community 109 miles northeast of Phoenix. According to the statement, evidence was limited because some of the carcasses “had been exposed to extreme weather conditions over extended periods of time.” Forest officials said law enforcement officials had taken steps to more quickly deploy equine experts and veterinarians to incident scenes to help collect evidence.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A state commission has approved nearly $9 million in funding to repair levees damaged by record flooding last year. The Arkansas Natural Resources Commission approved the $8.8 million in grant funding Thursday for 14 groups overseeing levees along the Arkansas River that were damaged last year, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. The largest grants were for $1.6 million for the Riverdale area in Little Rock and $1.5 million for a levee district in Dardanelle. Last year, Gov. Asa Hutchinson created a task force to study how to improve the state’s aging levee system. The group presented its final report earlier this month and recommended increased oversight, consolidation of some levee districts, and state grants to fund improvements. Last year’s springtime flooding along the Arkansas River occurred because of heavy rainfall in Kansas and Oklahoma.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state increased its efforts Friday to keep the federal government from allowing oil and gas drilling on more than 1 million acres of public land, suing to block the Trump administration from issuing new permits in the central part of the state. The federal lawsuit against the U.S. Bureau of Land Management follows a new state law also intended to counter Trump administration plans to increase oil and gas production on protected public land. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra sued on behalf of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration, saying the permits would allow the controversial extraction method called hydraulic fracturing, commonly called fracking. Newsom in October signed a law barring any California leasing authority from allowing pipelines or other oil and gas infrastructure to be built on state property. Federally protected areas are adjacent to state-owned land.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: After former Gov. John Hickenlooper came under fire for how he spent money from a little-known account in his office, similar accounts have been noted throughout state government that hold millions of taxpayer dollars, KCNC-TV reports. The money in the accounts comes from sources like federal dollars and legal settlements, and departments don’t have to disclose it to the Legislature. Democratic Sen. Dominick Moreno plans to change that with a bill he says the powerful Joint Budget Committee is drafting this year. As vice chair of the committee, Moreno has in-depth knowledge of state finances. But he says even he didn’t know about all the money state departments take in that isn’t reported and over which the Legislature has no control. The Colorado Sun reports the Hickenlooper account is paying ongoing legal bills related to an ethics complaint against the current U.S. Senate candidate.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The Democratic speaker of the state House says lawmakers should consider whether to ban Native American athletic nicknames and symbols at public high schools after one school restored its Redmen mascot just months after dropping it. “I’d like to see a bill introduced to have a public hearing and have the discussion,” Joe Aresimowicz told the Hartford Courant. The school board in Killingly voted in June to drop the high school’s Redmen nickname and then replaced it with Red Hawks in October. The board, with an infusion of new Republican members, restored Redmen last month. Aresimowicz called the mascot “highly offensive.” Across the state, 19 public high schools use Native American-themed nicknames or imagery. Opponents of such names say they are racist and perpetuate stereotypes. The defenders of Native mascots and symbols say they are signs of respect.\n\nDelaware\n\nHockessin: A local temple is now home to a statue of a Hindu god said to be the tallest in the country. Hundreds of people celebrated the arrival of the 25-foot granite statue of the Hindu god Hanuman on Saturday morning at a temple in Hockessin. A welcome ceremony was held after a truck delivered the 60,000-pound statue. “Across India, Lord Hanuman is often enshrined and worshipped in the form of a towering statue, and we are proud to bring that tradition to Delaware,” says Patibanda Sarma, president of the Hindu Temple Association. Organizers of the effort to bring the statue to Delaware had said it would be the tallest statue of a Hindu god carved out of a single piece of stone in the United States. Sculptors in India spent about a year carving it.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Thousands gathered on Freedom Plaza on Saturday as part of the nationwide Women’s March rallies focused on issues such as climate change, pay equity, reproductive rights and immigration, though crowds were noticeably smaller than in previous years. The 2017 march drew close to 1 million people. Last year about 100,000 held a rally east of the White House. This year’s protesters planned to march around the White House, but President Donald Trump wasn’t there, as he was spending the weekend at his resort in Florida. Organizers faced criticism from some local African American activists for failing to focus on local issues and damaging the ability of local activists to organize. “Local D.C. is a domestic colony and the actions of national organizers have to recognize that,” Black Lives Matter D.C. wrote in a letter last week to Women’s March organizers. “Here in D.C., these unstrategic mass mobilizations distract from local organizing, often overlook the black people who actually live here and even result in tougher laws against demonstration being passed locally.”\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The Legislature set a lot of lofty goals for its annual 60-day session: passing a budget expected to top $90 billion; lowering the cost of health care; preventing blue-green algae; and boosting teacher pay. But also on the agenda entering the second week of session are measures banning iguana breeding, protecting nude sunbathers, making shelter animals the official state pet, banning sunscreen bans, and giving hunters a sales tax break on guns and ammo. The full Senate will take up a bill that would ban local governments from banning sunscreens, while a House committee takes up its version of the bill, in reaction to Key West banning the sale of sunscreens containing oxybenzone or octinoxate, which some researchers say can harm coral reefs.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state is on track to have its new election system ready for the presidential primaries in March, lawyers for the state assured a judge Friday, but critics pushed for a more concrete backup plan in case things don’t go as planned. U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg tried throughout a conference call to strike a balance between the interests of the two sides while making it clear that she does not consider herself a “guarantor” for the state’s election system rollout. Totenberg is presiding over a lawsuit filed in 2017 by election integrity advocates and individual voters who alleged that the state’s outdated touch-screen voting machines and election management system, in use since 2002, were not secure and were vulnerable to hacking. Critics argue that the new system has many of the same security vulnerabilities as the old system and that voters can’t be sure the barcode read by the scanner accurately reflects their selections.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The U.S. Navy is honoring a World War II hero in naming a new aircraft carrier for Mess Attendant 2nd Class Doris Miller. The announcement is expected to be made at Pearl Harbor on Monday, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Miller was the first African American to receive the Navy Cross for valor. He was recognized for manning a machine gun on the USS West Virginia and returning fire against Japanese planes during the Dec. 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor. USS Miller, a destroyer escort, was previously named in his honor. An African American was not allowed to man a gun in the Navy in 1941, said Doreen Ravenscroft, a team leader for the Doris Miller Memorial. “Without him really knowing, he actually was a part of the civil rights movement because he changed the thinking in the Navy,” Ravenscroft said. Two of Miller’s nieces are expected to be at Pearl Harbor for the announcement.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state has the nation’s sixth-highest growth rate for spending on corrections in the past 25 years, and with the governor proposing a 12.1% budget increase for the Department of Correction, the department’s director says the state is at a “critical juncture,” the Idaho Press reports. Idaho increased spending on corrections by 207% between 1992 and 2018, according to a report by the Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy in Boise. Idaho’s expenditures outpace its spending during the same time period on education, which increased by 94% for public schools and 39% for higher education. At least some of that spending is the result of policy decisions the Legislature made in the past 40 years, according to the report. Idaho is one of only three states in the country where inmates are required by law to serve 100% of their fixed terms, the result of truth-in-sentencing legislation passed in the 1980s, according to the report.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The city will test updated bus routes on the West Side under a pilot program recently approved by the Chicago Transit Board. City officials tout the change as part of Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s promise to invest in neighborhoods outside the downtown core. The pilot program is designed to provide streamlined service along the city’s grid system and improve connections to city trains, according to city officials. For example, riders will have more access to jobs, services and schools near the University of Illinois at Chicago, where there are also several hospitals. The changes take effect in April and will last one year. Chicago Transit Authority staff will determine whether to make the changes permanent. The changes will cost about $550,000 and be funded with CTA operating funds, according to officials.\n\nIndiana\n\nBloomington: Portions of two parks are getting a special designation because of a rare tree species. Areas in Brown County State Park and Yellowwood State Forest will be considered high conservation value forest areas in an effort to preserve the yellowwood tree population. The Forest Stewardship Council’s certification is a way to ensure that 591 acres where the trees are growing are managed so they remain part of the landscape, says Mike Spalding, resource specialist with Monroe-Monroe and Yellowwood state forests. Civilian Conservation Corps workers in Brown County State Park first discovered the trees in 1933. Forester T.E. Shaw and Charles Deam, Indiana’s first state forester, verified and documented the discovery. One theory was that the yellowwood trees were brought north by Kentucky settlers, but that was proven false when the trees were analyzed. The results showed the trees were genetically distinct and had been in the area for thousands of years.\n\nIowa\n\nWaterloo: Organizers of an emergency warming shelter say they will have to close because the space doesn’t meet fire code regulations. The Waterloo Warming Center opened Jan. 6 at Jubilee United Methodist Church’s Freedom resource center. But after an inspection, officials noted the space didn’t have a sprinkler system and ordered that the center close by Tuesday. Organizers began searching for a new location and implored city officials not to force them out of the current site until a replacement can be found. Temperatures are supposed to remain below freezing until later this week. “We understand and appreciate the need for fire safety regulations, but we cannot close this location down until a new appropriate location has been secured,” Black Hawk County Supervisor Chris Schwartz told the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier. “The alternative is leaving folks out to freeze to death on our streets.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Former governor and plastic surgeon Jeff Colyer is about to add Chaka Khan backup singer to his resume. Colyer is part of a student and faculty choir that will join the “Queen of Funk” on stage for a Martin Luther King Day event hosted by Georgetown University at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, The Kansas City Star reports. “I get to be a backup singer for Chaka Khan. That’s pretty cool,” said Colyer, who was was a fellow at Georgetown’s Institute of Politics and Public Service during the fall semester. The performance will include a piece composed by Khan, who achieved success in the 1970s as a vocalist in the funk band Rufus and as a solo artist in the 1980s with her hit single “I Feel For You.” Colyer, of Overland Park, was lieutenant governor in 2018 and rose to the top job after fellow Republican Sam Brownback resigned to take an ambassadorship.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Inmate populations and deteriorating prisons are sapping the state of money needed for priorities like education and health care, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear says. Stepping up his push for criminal justice reform as the “fiscally responsible thing to do,” Beshear said Friday that the state needs to reduce incarceration rates, which in turn would create opportunities to consolidate prisons. “Criminal-justice reform isn’t just the right thing to do – and I believe it is – it’s the moral thing to do,” he told reporters at the Capitol. “It is absolutely necessary to do for this budget and most especially for every budget” after that. Beshear, who previously served as the state’s attorney general, stressed that he wants to revamp the criminal-justice system in a way that doesn’t compromise public safety.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Plans are on again to implode a hotel building that partially collapsed last fall, killing three workers, city officials said Friday. Mayor LaToya Cantrell and Fire Superintendent Tim McConnell said at a news conference that the implosion is expected to take place in mid-March. Implosion had been considered and then rejected in the weeks after the Oct. 12 collapse at the planned Hard Rock Hotel on Canal Street, at the edge of the French Quarter. But on Friday, officials said the implosion plan was back on. It was deemed safer than having workers dismantle the structure. “Putting more people at risk, I cannot live with that and will not support that,” Cantrell said. And it will mean commerce and traffic can return to the area around the unstable building more quickly. Implosion will also bring the building down ahead of hurricane season, which begins June 1.\n\nMaine\n\nWestbrook: What goes around comes around. An ice disk appears to be forming in the same river where an unusually large one formed last winter and quickly gained international fame. The City of Westbrook tweeted an aerial view of the disk in the Presumpscot River with the message: “ICE BREAKING NEWS: Ice Disk 2020 is making a run for it…It’s not a perfect circle yet, but it is rotating counter-clockwise again & the seagulls are along for the ride.” The ice formation comes just about a year after a disk measuring about 100 yards in diameter was spotted in the Presumpscot River. It eventually had a devoted webcam; social media users compared it to an alien spacecraft and the moon; and ducks used it as a raft. A video of the disk shows a nascent ice blob that is thinner and less circular than the famous disk of 2019.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The city will formally name a courthouse after the late U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings in the first half of 2020. Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young on Friday unveiled the renderings of the bronze plaques that will be affixed to the building’s exterior. One includes an image and biography of the congressman, and the other reads “Elijah E. Cummings Courthouse.” The powerful Democratic congressman and civil rights champion died Oct. 17 at age 68 of complications from long-standing health issues. He had represented Maryland’s 7th Congressional District, which encompasses a large portion of Baltimore, since 1996. Cummings graduated from the University of Maryland School of Law and practiced in Baltimore. “Elijah was a son of Baltimore. He was proud of Baltimore,” his widow, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, said during the unveiling ceremony. “His career as a legal professional started in this courthouse.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A push to expand school breakfast programs is making its way through the Legislature. The state Senate last week unanimously approved legislation aimed at increasing participation rates in the programs. The bill would require public schools with 60% or more of students currently eligible for free or reduced-price meals under the federal National School Lunch Program to offer breakfast after the school bell rings. Massachusetts currently requires all high-poverty schools to provide breakfast to every eligible student. Because breakfast is typically offered before the bell, participation levels are less than 40%, compared to up to 90% participation for free and reduced lunch. Supporters of the bill say moving breakfast to after the bell will boost participation and ensure all students have the nutrition they need.\n\nMichigan\n\nOwosso: A whopping $43,170 in forgotten cash was discovered inside a footstool donated to a resale shop. Howard Kirby bought the piece and other furniture for $70 after Christmas. He was stunned Sunday when his daughter-in-law unzipped the cushion and shouted. After the shock wore off, he began the extraordinary step of returning the money to the former owners. “I do what I can to be as much like Christ as I can, and this is the moral thing to do,” said Kirby, 54. “This is going to help them. I’m so happy for them.” The footstool was part of a living room set donated to a Habitat For Humanity store by Kim Fauth-Newberry and her husband. The furniture had belonged to her grandfather, Phillip Fauth, who died in July. Fauth-Newberry said Fauth was a frugal man who always paid in cash, even $9,000 for a new roof. The newly discovered money was separated with paper clips and topped with handwritten notes.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state’s voters on Friday became some of the first in the country to cast ballots in the presidential primaries as early voting began for the Super Tuesday contest. Eligible Minnesota voters can now vote at county courthouses across the state and early voting stations in some cities, and they can also request absentee ballots for the March 3 primary. But the votes won’t be counted until primary night. Fifteen candidates are on the Democratic ballot, even though some already have dropped out of the race. The GOP ballot lists only President Donald Trump, though write-in votes are allowed. It’s Minnesota’s first presidential primary since 1992 after years of using precinct caucuses to kick off the process of selecting national convention delegates. Voters must request either a Democratic or Republican ballot, and their names will be shared with the state’s major parties.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Board of Education is keeping the state’s U.S. history exam, despite months of pressure from teachers and others to cut testing. The board voted unanimously Thursday to keep the test, one of four public school students must take in high school. A testing task force in August had recommended the state do away with what’s the only state test not required by federal law. “It was extremely disheartening that board members placed so much confidence in a staff recommendation over the recommendations of the task force, commission, and multiple surveys of practitioners throughout the state that favored elimination of the assessment,” Mississippi Professional Educators, the state’s largest teachers group, wrote in a message to members.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The president of a predominantly black police union says the city prosecutor’s lawsuit is correct in pointing out racial concerns in St. Louis, including biases within the police department itself. Ethical Society of Police President Heather Taylor stopped short of endorsing Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner’s federal lawsuit accusing “entrenched interests” of impeding her efforts to reform racist practices, but Taylor questioned how anyone could ignore the department’s “long history of racial discrimination.” She said in a statement that denying racial bias within the department is “a slap in the face to minority and non-minority officers with whom we are proud to serve.” She said the union has often cited racial disparities in discipline, promotions and job placement.\n\nMontana\n\nChoteau: An ice jam that has caused flooding along a creek in central Montana had nearly submerged a town park and was rising into residents’ basements and crawl spaces, leading the city to declare a state of emergency Friday. The ice jam came after subzero temperatures and was exacerbated by high ground water. It is likely to remain until warmer temperatures thaw the blocked culverts and stream beds. Water up to 6 inches deep was reported on some streets after ice traveling down Spring Creek was backed up, weather officials said. The ice jam came after temperatures dropped to 20 degrees below zero, officials said. Residents were encouraged to take shorter showers and reduce the amount of times toilets are flushed to avoid overwhelming the sewer system. Sewer main lines were completely filled, and crews sandbagged manholes in the area to avoid further surface water infiltration, city officials said.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Want to try your hand at waterfowl or turkey hunting, but leery of the expense of buying blinds and decoys? The University of Nebraska-Lincoln has a solution. UNL’s Outdoor Adventure Center is now offering that equipment for rent to the public. The rentals had previously been offered for about a year only to the university’s students. Officials recently decided to expand the policy to allow the public to rent the equipment, too. Micaela Rahe with the National Wild Turkey Federation and the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission said it’s the first program of its kind in the state. Hunting gear currently available for rent includes a pop-up blind, layout blind, duck decoy set of 14 birds and a jake/hen turkey decoy combination. Each is individually available to the public for $6 per day, $12 for three days or $16 for a full week.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A pigeon wearing a tiny sombrero was discovered following sightings of its cowboy hat-wearing cousins in Las Vegas, a city manager says. Reno City Manager Sabra Newby tweeted about the bird Wednesday, saying it’s quirky and fun but still inhumane, KOLO-TV reports. It is the first known sighting of hat-wearing birds in the region, Washoe County Regional Animal Services officials say. The sighting comes after a pigeon in Las Vegas with a miniature cowboy hat glued to its head died last week, animal officials say. People who see the bird are encouraged to call animal service dispatch officers, officials say. It is unclear who put the hat on the bird. “Reno cares about our animals,” Newby says. “They need protection and don’t need to become a punchline.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A group that organized a big memorial bike ride following the deaths of seven motorcyclists in a collision with a pickup truck is presenting the state agencies that helped out with a custom-made, wooden U.S. flag. The flag is etched with the victims’ names from the June crash in Randolph. A presentation by the Ride for Fallen 7 Foundation is scheduled for 9 a.m. Thursday at the state Incident Planning and Operations Center, where the flag will be displayed. The building houses agencies from the safety and transportation departments. An estimated 3,000 motorcycles, with 4,500 riders from around the country, took part in the Ride for the Fallen 7 in July. They rode 90 miles from Laconia to the crash site in Randolph, where a memorial service was held. Those killed were members of the Jarheads Motorcycle Club.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Barring health insurance that excludes coverage for preexisting conditions and letting children stay on their parents’ plans until 26 would be preserved under a slate of new laws the state enacted last week, even if the Affordable Care Act is struck down in court. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy signed the nine bills Thursday. They’re aimed at shoring up key provisions of the federal Affordable Care Act, which is opposed by Republicans in Congress and the White House. Democratic and Republican attorneys general are fighting in court over the law, sometimes referred to as “Obamacare.” New Jersey has about 800,000 people benefiting from the law, with about half a million people getting covered through Medicaid expansion under the law and 300,000 on the individual marketplace.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nJemez Springs: A national preserve in northern New Mexico that is sometimes referred to as the “Yellowstone of the Southwest” has added another piece of property to its land holdings that contains sulfuric acid hot springs, volcanic fumaroles and steaming mud pots. The National Park Service announced last week that it recently completed the purchase of a 40-acre parcel known as Sulphur Springs within the Valles Caldera National Preserve. Many of the geothermal features on the property are found nowhere else in New Mexico, and similar sites are very rare in the Western United States, officials said. The acidic pools and streams in the area also are home to a range of “extremophile” algae and bacteria. Acquiring Sulphur Springs was critical to protecting the breadth of geothermal features within the preserve, officials said. The $500,000 purchase was made through the Land and Water Conservation Fund and nonprofit groups.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Federal authorities are turning to a new tactic in the escalating conflict over the city’s so-called sanctuary policies, issuing four “immigration subpoenas” for information about inmates wanted for deportation. “This is not a request – it’s a demand,” Henry Lucero, said a senior U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official. “This is a last resort for us. Dangerous criminals are being released every single day in New York.” Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration said Saturday that the city would review the subpoenas. “New York City will not change the policies that have made us the safest big city in America,” spokeswoman Freddi Goldstein said in an email. The development came days after ICE sent similar subpoenas to Denver, a move that reflected the agency’s mounting frustration with jurisdictions that do not honor deportation “detainers” or provide any details about defendants going in and out of local custody.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWilson: Wilson County plans to add four new historical markers this year to commemorate African American heroes, including a 1946 effort to organize tobacco workers. Called Operation Dixie, the unionization effort was led by black women demanding better working conditions in the tobacco industry. The state unveiled a historical marker in Rocky Mount in 2011. The local chapter of the Tobacco Workers International Union formed in Wilson in 1946. Other markers to be unveiled in Wilson this year will honor the Wilson Normal and Industrial Institute, Dr. Frank S. Hargrave, and Charles H. Darden, the Wilson Times reports. The marker for Hargrave describes him as the founder of Mercy Hospital, which treated African Americans in an era when even hospitals were segregated by race. In 1914, he was elected president of the National Medical Association, which was the African American equivalent of the American Medical Association.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum announced Friday that he has pardoned 16 people convicted of low-level marijuana crimes, the first wave in what may be thousands under a new policy the first-term Republican said gives former offenders a second chance. The policy adopted last year allows people with low-level marijuana convictions to petition to have their records wiped clean if they avoid unlawful behavior for five years. The pardons erase the convictions as if they never occurred, and records are shielded from public view. Burgum and Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem both supported the change, which brings North Dakota in line with some other states and cities. Past convictions can be problematic for people trying to find jobs and housing. Burgum has said the policy change could help address North Dakota’s workforce shortage and grow its economy, while removing the stigma for what are minor cases from years ago.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A woman who was among the “Freedom Riders” who challenged racial segregation in the 1960s will be the keynote speaker at a breakfast honoring civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. The National Underground Railroad Freedom Center says Betty Daniels Rosemond will speak Monday at the King Legacy Awards Breakfast recognizing participants in a youth leadership program. Three students will be given awards for their work. Rosemond grew up in New Orleans and joined the Congress of Racial Equality, a leading civil rights organization. She was among bus riders, black and white, who braved possible violence to advocate for racial equality in the segregated South. The center invites guests to join in the 45th annual MLK Coalition March in downtown Cincinnati after the breakfast that will include an interfaith prayer service at Fountain Square.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A state panel that includes appointees of Gov. Kevin Stitt has approved more taxpayer subsidies for the Jenks-based company the governor founded and ran until after his election in 2018. The three-member Quality Jobs Program Incentive Approval Committee on Thursday voted unanimously to approve an application from Gateway First Bank. The contract was first reported by the online publication The Frontier. Two of the members who approved the application, Department of Commerce Director Brent Kisling and Oklahoma Tax Commission Chairman Charles Prater, were appointed by Stitt. Under the program, companies that create up to $2.5 million in new annual payrolls within three years can qualify for quarterly cash payments of up to 5% of new payroll costs. The company already has received more than $876,000 in taxpayer subsidies under an existing contract under the program, state records show.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state’s changing climate and ocean conditions are already harming its native fish and wildlife, officials from the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife say. That’s making it difficult for ODFW to meet its statutory mandate to manage the resources in its care. In response, the department is developing a Climate and Ocean Change Policy that will help shape where its limited resources are spent. On Friday, the public and the Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission had their first chance to hear about the proposal. “Our climate and ocean are changing in ways that are not favorable for fish and wildlife,” said Shaun Clements, ODFW senior policy analyst. “We’ve been working on trying to address these impacts.” For example, Oregon may have to abandon spending in some areas where species are unlikely to survive, in order to focus on those where they will, said Davia Palmeri, the department’s conservation policy coordinator.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf says he will follow through on his plan to close another state prison, announced originally in August as a cost-cutting step amid a declining inmate population and rising prison costs. Wolf’s administration carried out the required hearings on its plan, which was criticized by the corrections’ officers union and state lawmakers whose districts surround Retreat state prison in northeastern Pennsylvania. Retreat, about 10 miles west of Wilkes-Barre, has about 400 employees and about 940 inmates. Closing could occur in four months at an annual savings of $40 million, the administration said. Employees will be offered jobs at another state prison within 65 miles of Retreat, it said. Retreat was particularly vulnerable to closing: Its original buildings date back to the 19th century, and it has the fewest beds of any of Pennsylvania’s 25 state prisons.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Political, community and religious leaders are celebrating the life of Martin Luther King Jr. at the state’s annual commemoration of the civil rights leader. The public is invited to the event, beginning at 4 p.m. Monday at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Providence. Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo, U.S. Sens. Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse, and other elected leaders plan to attend. The Martin Luther King Jr. State Holiday Commission organizes the annual celebration. State Rep. Raymond Hull, a Providence Democrat, leads the commission and will serve as the master of ceremonies. Hull said Friday that with the turmoil in the nation today, it’s important to look back and reflect on what King stood for and how he brought people together to cure injustices. The commemoration includes speeches, awards and performances by the Ebenezer Baptist Church Choir and RPM Voices of Rhode Island.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: A feature that has helped Furman University receive past honors as one of the most beautiful campuses in America has been taken away. Forty of the decades-old oak trees that lined Furman’s Mall have been cut down. They’ll be replaced with new species of oaks with life spans from 250 to more than 400 years: overcup, Nuttall’s, scarlet and swamp white, the university says. The nearly 70-year-old trees were starting to die, and limbs were starting to fall and become hazardous, according to Clinton Colmenares, spokesman for the university. Their removal is the latest phase in a multiyear project to replace original trees with better species that live longer and are just as big, Colmenares says. Furman broke ground on its current campus in 1953. The trees along the mall were planted between 1956 and 1958, the university says.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Gov. Kristi Noem was the sixth-most-unpopular governor in the country in the final months of 2019, according to the Morning Consult’s latest polling. Forty-five percent of South Dakotans surveyed disapproved of the job Noem was doing as governor, and 43% approved, while 12% said they didn’t know, according to the 2019 fourth-quarter governors poll released Thursday by Morning Consult, a research services company. The poll had a 3% margin of error. Meanwhile, U.S. Sen. Thune was among the top 10 most popular senators in the Morning Consult’s 2019 fourth-quarter poll. Thune had an approval rating of 52%, and U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds had an approval rating of 50%, with a 3% margin of error, according to Morning Consult. Both of their Morning Consult approval ratings have remained in the low- to mid-50s range throughout 2019.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee will introduce legislation this year that would amend a law requiring the state to honor Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest, an early leader of the Ku Klux Klan. Lee’s office confirmed Friday that the Republican, who has previously expressed his displeasure over the honor, was working on the bill. The office did not provide further details. According to the law in question, Tennessee governors must sign six proclamations throughout the year designating as days of special observance Robert E. Lee Day (Jan. 19), Abraham Lincoln Day (Feb. 12), Andrew Jackson Day (March 15), Confederate Decoration Day (June 3), Nathan Bedford Forrest Day (July 13) and Veterans Day (Nov. 11). Lee received national backlash in July when signed the Nathan Bedford Forrest proclamation and declined to answer questions about whether he thought the law should change. Lee later clarified that he didn’t like signing the proclamation and would prefer to see the law changed.\n\nTexas\n\nCorpus Christi: Demolition of the last of the city’s three Columbus ship replicas began Thursday morning despite efforts to raise funds for repairs. The demolition of the La Nina comes after the Columbus Sailing Association was unable to raise enough money to support the reconstruction of a new bottom and main deck. The ship is one of three Columbus ship replicas that first sailed to Corpus Christi in 1992 as part of Spain’s 500th anniversary of the “Voyage to the New World” celebration. La Pinta and La Santa Maria were too costly to repair. The association created a GoFundMe campaign in 2017 to raise $100,000 to fix the damaged La Nina. The fundraiser has raised $4,335.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: About a third of the state’s registered voters are at risk of not being able to participate in March’s Super Tuesday presidential primary if they don’t request ballots. State and county election officials have been sending letters and trying to get the message out before it’s too late. This will be the first time Utah takes part in Super Tuesday, when 14 states vote, after lawmakers moved up the primary to make the state more relevant in the process. The state’s nearly 510,000 independent voters can request a ballot for the Republican or Democratic primary, but the process is slightly different. The Republican primary is closed, so voters who want to cast a ballot must return the form to become GOP registered voters by Feb. 3. The Democratic primary is open, so independent voters can get a ballot without registering with the party. They have until Feb. 25 to request the ballot if they intend to remain unaffiliated but need to send it in by Feb. 3 if they want to become a registered Democrat.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: State transportation officials said they are hopeful upgrades to the rail line between Rutland and Burlington can be ready sometime next year, which will make it possible to resume Amtrak rail service between the cities. Officials have been working for years to upgrade the 75 miles of rail and complete a number of other projects, such as station improvements and rail crossings. One of the major projects on the route, a new rail tunnel through downtown Middlebury, is slated for completion next year. Rutland Mayor David Allaire, who serves on the Governor’s Rail Advisory Council, said he was hopeful the line will be done by the end of next year, the Rutland Herald reports. Once the improvements are completed, officials plan to have Amtrak’s Ethan Allen Express, which now travels between New York City and Rutland, continue to Burlington.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: State officials and U.S. hate-monitoring groups are warning about the potential for violence ahead of a gun-rights rally expected to draw a mix of militias, firearms advocates and white supremacists to the city. Citing credible threats of violence, Gov. Ralph Northam declared a temporary state of emergency days ahead of Monday’s rally, banning all weapons, including guns, from Capitol Square. Virginia’s solicitor general last week said law enforcement had identified “credible evidence” that armed out-of-state groups planned to come to Virginia with the possible intention of participating in a “violent insurrection.” Online, threats of violence have been “rampant” among anti-government and far-right groups, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks white supremacists and other extremists. Conspiracy theories and other misinformation have also proliferated.\n\nWashington\n\nNewhalem: The National Park Service is investigating the desecration of an archaeological site in the North Cascades National Park Service Complex, and the Upper Skagit Indian Tribe is hoping to bring those responsible to justice. The Skagit Valley Herald reports evidence of digging was found over the summer at the Newhalem Rock Shelter camp used by the ancestors of the Upper Skagit tribe. “We were shocked and dismayed that someone would do something like this at a cultural site,” the tribe’s Natural Resources Director Scott Schuyler said. “Some of these places are thousands of years old, and the fact that someone would want to come in and purposely destroy, damage or steal, it’s just unbelievable.” The tribe is working with the Park Service on the investigation and offering a $5,000 reward for information that leads to those responsible.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nRipley: Health officials are hoping a new initiative will help Jackson County residents quickly inform first responders about their medical conditions. WCHS-TV reports the Jackson County Health Department is offering free seat belt covers that will display personal and medical information that first responders can use during a car crash or other emergency situations. Known as “Medical Seat Belt Safety Days,” the county will provide the free covers March 26-27. People interested should bring their medical insurance information and a list of medications they currently take. Car seat safety checks also will be provided during that time at no charge.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: Much of the west side of downtown and some areas east of the Milwaukee River will be inside a security zone during next summer’s Democratic National Convention, officials announced Friday. Police Chief Alfonso Morales said every resident and business in the zone will have access to their property. The main inconvenience for residents will be travel times, officials said. It’s still not known which part of downtown will be behind barriers or fences. Officials said they have outlined a broad security footprint, and the small, more restricted area should be announced later. The main convention venues include Fiserv Forum, UW-Milwaukee Panther Arena, Miller High Life Theatre and the Wisconsin Center.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: State wildlife managers are criticizing plans by Grand Teton National Park to shoot nonnative mountain goats by helicopter. Inclement weather has so far prevented the aerial gunning, though park officials recently closed off a wide area of the Teton Range where shooting is to occur. “Having government personnel kill mountain goats from helicopters and leaving them to rot and be wasted is unacceptable,” Wyoming Game and Fish Commission President David Rael wrote to acting park Superintendent Gopaul Noojibail in a recent letter. The commission last week approved a resolution opposing the plans, favoring the use of volunteers to hunt the goats on the ground. The governor-appointed commission sets official policies and procedures for wildlife management, including hunting seasons and quotas, across Wyoming.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/07/04/flagpole-feat-death-row-kidney-donor-civil-rights-medals-news-around-states/50450533/", "title": "Flagpole feat, death row kidney donor: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: State officials said Thursday that they will move forward with plans to build two supersize prisons despite a bond sale falling more than $200 million short amid a volatile market and pressure from activists. The Alabama Corrections Institution Finance Authority hoped to sell $725 million in bonds for the construction project but was only able to sell $509 million. The bond issue is a key funding piece for the $1.2 billion construction price tag. State Finance Director Bill Poole told reporters that the state had hoped to “sell a little bit more,” but officials were pleased with the result. He said the outcome would not affect the construction, and the state still anticipates opening the prisons in 2026. He said the state will look at options for the remainder of the money, including seeking additional funding from the Legislature or conducting another bond issue when conditions are more favorable. Gov. Kay Ivey called the bond sale a “significant and positive step forward in our prison construction process.” While state officials blamed a volatile market, a group of activists and impact investors had urged buyers to stay away from the the bond offering. “They didn’t just fall short. They fell well, well, well short,” said Eric Glass, an adviser to Justice Capital, an investment fund that joined the call for a boycott.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Dozens of people experiencing homelessness will now camp at a city-owned site where bears recently tumbled through belongings, as a major local shelter closes. The Sullivan Arena, which provided shelter for hundreds of people nightly for more than two years, closed Thursday. The use of Anchorage’s Centennial Campground as a place for people to stay is seen as a stopgap measure, with indoor shelters full and Mayor Dave Bronson’s administration clearing illegal campsites, citing fire danger, the Anchorage Daily News reports. On Wednesday, the sound of an air horn blasted through the campground as a black bear and two cubs sauntered into the site. Individuals who were camping there and local health department workers tried to scare the bears off with the horn, shouts and claps. Jimmie Hartley said he planned to string cans filled with gravel on a fishing line around his site to warn him of approaching bears. Many of those who were arriving at the campground from Sullivan Arena had minimal gear. One major question is determining how many people the campground can safely accommodate, along with site rules, local Parks and Recreation Director Mike Braniff said. “Right now, we’re not allowing any fires here,” he said. “Food safety and bear safety is at the top of our list.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The elected county recorder and the elections director in Yavapai County are resigning after more than a year and a half of threats and heated criticism from backers of ex-President Donald Trump who accept his lie that he lost the 2020 election because of fraud. County Recorder Leslie Hoffman said Friday that she is fed up with the “nastiness” and has accepted a job outside the county. Her last day will be July 22. She said longtime elections director Lynn Constabile is leaving for the same reason, and Friday is her last day. “A lot of it is the nastiness that we have dealt with,” Hoffman said. “I’m a Republican recorder living in a Republican county where the candidate that they wanted to win won by 2-to-1 in this county and still getting grief, and so is my staff. ... I’m not sure what they think that we did wrong. And they’re very nasty. The accusations and the threats are nasty.” Constabile was busy Friday doing a required pre-election “logic and accuracy test” for the upcoming primary and unavailable for comment. Arizona’s 15 county recorders are responsible for voter registration and ensuring mail ballots are properly sent to the more than 80% of voters who vote by mail. They earn just $63,800 a year, a salary set by the Legislature that has not risen in the decade Hoffman has been in office.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: The market for industrial hemp has not grown as fast as the plants in Arkansas, despite a promising climate for the crop touted a few years ago as a moneymaker and a new source for clothes, textiles, building materials, fuel and food. Although hemp plants with 0.3% THC became legal on the federal level when the 2018 farm bill passed, the market has not been as exciting, said Jim Correll, a University of Arkansas professor of plant pathology who has been studying hemp in the state. “There was a lot of excitement about the crop and how to make money. It has waned,” said Correll, who is studying diseases and other conditions that affect the quality of hemp and the yield. “The number of growers has dropped substantially.” There are about 20 industrial hemp growers currently in Arkansas, said Bill Morgan, a hemp research farmer who farms west of Fayetteville. Some farmers’ hemp has tested too high in THC, meaning the crop had to be destroyed. There were just 49 licensed hemp growers in Arkansas in 2021 – 78 fewer than when the program opened in 2019. The total number this year is expected to drop again. In 2020 there were 121 growers, and the first growing season for legalized hemp in 2019 started with 125 growers.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday signed a new state law that will stop police from arresting people for loitering for prostitution, an issue that divided sex workers and advocates during a rare nine-month delay since legislators passed the bill last year. “To be clear, this bill does not legalize prostitution,” Newsom said in a signing message. “It simply revokes provisions of the law that have led to disproportionate harassment of women” and transgender adults, he said, nothing that Black and Latino women are particularly affected. The bill will bar police in California from arresting anyone for loitering with the intent to engage in prostitution. State Sen. Scott Wiener and other supporters said such arrest decisions often rely on an officer’s perception. While Newsom said he agreed with the intent of the repeal, “we must be cautious about its implementation.” He said his administration will track crime and prosecution trends “for any possible unintended consequences” and, if found, work to correct them. “For far too long, California law has been used to profile, harass and arrest transgender and gender-nonconforming people simply for existing in public spaces,” Tony Hoang, executive director of the LGTBQ rights group Equality California, said in praising the repeal. The measure also will allow those who were previously convicted to ask a court to dismiss and seal the record of the conviction.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Life expectancy in the state dropped for the second straight year in 2021. Driven by the pandemic, it’s the kind of decline not seen in decades, data from the state health department shows. The average life expectancy for Colorado residents fell to 78 years last year. That’s slightly lower than 2020, the first year of the pandemic, when it was 78.4 years, but the slide represents a persistent and significant drop of nearly three years compared to 2019. “The last time life expectancy dropped like this was in 1943, which was the most fatal year of World War II, for the nation,” said Dr. Eric France, the state’s chief medical officer. “It is tragic that we see life expectancy drop. Death rates increased by 20%.” Key drivers for the decline were COVID-19 and overdose deaths. The data vary by demographic group. COVID-19 was the leading cause of death among Hispanics, as well as non-Hispanic Native Hawaiians or other Pacific Islanders and American Indians or Native Alaskans, the data shows. Dr. Lilia Cervantes, an associate professor in the Department of Medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, said she wasn’t surprised by the new numbers. “The Latino community makes up the majority of the essential workforce,” said Cervantes, a member of the Colorado Vaccine Equity Taskforce.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont signed an executive order Friday creating a new commission charged with planning the state’s multiyear celebration and commemoration of the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence signing. The Connecticut Semiquincentennial Commission will be a state-level group, similar to the United States Semiquincentennial Commission recently established by Congress. The executive order requires the panel of volunteers to be wide-ranging, including not just representatives from historical organizations and state officials but also designees from the state’s two federally recognized tribes. The 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence and subsequent formation of the U.S. will occur July 4, 2026. Former Secretary of the State Denise Merrill, who officially resigned from her post Thursday to spend time with her ailing husband, noted that Connecticut requires all high school students to take a civics class before they graduate. “This is a chance for all of us to have that lesson and to have everyone included and to have a chance to review the incredible history here in Connecticut of the founding of this country,” she said during a ceremony at the Old State House. “And this time, we can retell it. We can include everyone.”\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The jury in the corruption trial of State Auditor Kathy McGuiness acquitted her Friday of felony charges of theft and witness intimidation but found her guilty on three misdemeanor counts. Jurors deliberated for about four hours over two days before finding McGuiness, a Democrat elected in 2018, guilty of conflict of interest, official misconduct, and structuring a contract with a consulting firm to avoid compliance with state procurement rules. It marks the first time in Delaware history that a sitting statewide elected official has been convicted on criminal charges. Even though fellow Democrats quickly called on her to resign, the misdemeanor convictions don’t prevent McGuiness from holding public office, and she said she still plans to seek reelection in November. The conflict of interest charge involved the May 2020 hiring of McGuiness’ daughter, Elizabeth “Saylar” McGuiness, who still works for the auditor’s office. Prosecutors alleged Saylar McGuiness, 20, was hired even as other part-time workers in the auditor’s office left because of a lack of work in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. Authorities said McGuiness then allowed her daughter special privileges, including access to a state vehicle and permission to work remotely while away at college in South Carolina, that were not available to other “casual-seasonal” workers.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A truck hit a bicyclist and careened into a fireworks stand Saturday evening at an intersection in northeast Washington, killing the bicyclist and a man working in the stand, police said. No other injuries were reported. The accident at the corner of Minnesota Avenue and Nannie Helen Burroughs Avenue NE occurred about 5:30 p.m., the Metropolitan Police Department said in a statement. The adult male victims were pronounced dead at the scene. Assistant Police Chief Wilfredo Manlapaz said the driver of the truck apparently was suffering a medical emergency when the accident occurred and was being treated at a local hospital. The bicyclist was in the crosswalk when he was struck, Manlapaz said. A photograph posted online by the MPD showed a demolished stand amid scattered debris.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: A person using a flamethrower set fire Saturday to a Pan-African flag flying on a pole outside the headquarters of the Uhuru Movement, a Black international socialist group based in Florida. Security video released by the group shows the driver of a white Honda sedan pulling up outside the group’s St. Petersburg headquarters, removing a flamethrower from the trunk and shooting a tower of fire at the flag flying about 30 feet above the ground. The group says the man stopped when a worker inside the building yelled at him. The video shows him putting the flamethrower back in the trunk and then driving away. A photo supplied by the group shows the flag with a large hole. St. Petersburg police said they were investigating the fire and working to identify a suspect. The Uhuru Movement is part of the African People’s Socialist Party, which says it is “uniting African people as one people for liberation, social justice, self-reliance and economic development.” Akile Anai, the group’s director of agitation and propaganda, said the attack is in the same vein as the May killing of 10 Black people at a Buffalo, New York, supermarket. Police say the arrested suspect in the Buffalo massacre is a white nationalist. Akai said such attacks are caused by the decline of a “social system and facade of normalcy based on oppression, colonialism and exploitation.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: A group of students want U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’ name scrubbed from a building at the Savannah College of Art and Design. At the dedication of the building in 2010, Thomas praised his hometown’s hospitality. “You always long to go back to a place of comfort. The roots are here, and the roots are very, very deep here,” he said. The Clarence Thomas Center for Historic Preservation is located in the former convent where Thomas spent his early years attending school. The university has removed the sign from the building but did not respond to emails asking for the reason. An online petition that had garnered more than 1,800 signatures by Sunday cites Thomas’ comments on the Dobbs vs. Jackson Women’s Health Organization ruling, in which the court repealed the constitutional right to abortion. Thomas indicated he would like to see a repeal of protections for gay marriage, access to contraception and privacy in the bedroom, calling the initial rulings that granted those rights “erroneous decisions.” He also has been accused of sexual harassment by Anita Hill, who testified against him during his 1991 confirmation hearings, and, more recently in 2016, by Alaska lawyer Moira Smith, who alleged that Thomas groped her in 1999.\n\nHawaii\n\nPearl Harbor: A Navy investigation released Thursday revealed that shoddy management and human error caused fuel to leak into Pearl Harbor’s tap water last year, poisoning thousands of people and forcing military families to evacuate their homes for hotels. The investigation is the first detailed account of how jet fuel from the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility, a massive World War II-era military-run tank farm in the hills above Pearl Harbor, leaked into a well that supplied water to housing and offices in and around the sprawling base. Some 6,000 people suffered nausea, headaches, rashes and other symptoms. After months of resistance, the military in April agreed to an order from the state of Hawaii to drain the tanks and close the Red Hill facility. A separate report the Defense Department provided to the state Department of Health on Thursday said December 2024 was the earliest it could defuel the tanks safely. The investigation report listed a cascading series of mistakes starting May 6, 2021, when operator error caused a pipe to rupture and 21,000 gallons of fuel to spill when fuel was being transferred between tanks. Most of that fuel spilled into a fire suppression line and sat there for six months, causing the line to sag. A cart rammed into this sagging line Nov. 20, releasing 20,000 gallons of fuel. The area where the cart hit the line isn’t supposed to have fuel, so the officials who responded to the spill didn’t have the right equipment to capture the liquid.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: It’s not clear whether a pair of laws from the early 1970s making it a felony to “knowingly aid” in an abortion or to publish information about how to induce one will be enforced alongside the state’s newer, near-total ban. In the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, lawyers in Idaho Attorney General Lawrence Wasden’s office are going through all the state’s abortion statutes with a fine-toothed comb, said Wasden spokesman Scott Graf. When the Legislature passed a trigger law in 2020 that would automatically prohibit nearly all abortions 30 days after the fall of Roe, lawmakers took some steps to avoid conflicts by making it clear that the law would supersede other bans. Lawmakers put similar language in another ban passed earlier this year. But they may have overlooked a few clauses in the decades-old statutes. The 2020 trigger law says the person seeking the abortion can’t be charged with a crime, instead focusing prosecution efforts on the provider. That would seem to override a 1973 law that makes it a felony for a person to undergo an abortion, but it’s not clear if another portion of the older law making it a felony to knowingly aid in an abortion could still be enforceable. It will be up to individual county prosecutors, at first, to decide how to proceed, said Twin Falls County prosecutor Grant Loebs, who is also president of the Idaho Prosecuting Attorneys Association. From there, judges will figure it out. Ultimately, he expects legislators will have a lot of fine-tuning to do in the years ahead.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A yearlong suspension of the state’s sales tax on groceries began Friday. Illinois’ tax relief program will also postpone a gas tax increase until January and cut school supply taxes from 6.25% to 1.25% from Aug. 5 to 14. “Starting tomorrow, every Illinoisan will get tax relief on essentials: groceries, gas, your home, and back-to-school supplies, with even more tax relief going into effect next year,” Gov. J.B. Pritzker said in a news release Thursday. The measures are part of a $1.8 billion state tax-break deal signed by Pritzker in April. GOP leaders derided the measures as a campaign tool for Pritzker and other Democrats in an election year. The plan also provides automatic $50 income tax rebates for individuals who made less than $200,000 in 2021, $100 for couples filing jointly who made less than $400,000, and $100 per dependent claimed in 2021, up to three. Additionally, the Illinois state earned income credit will increase from 18% to 20% of the federal credit, and eligible homeowners will receive property tax rebates equal to their 2021 property tax credit, up to $300. Illinois’ 1% sales tax on groceries will be suspended through June 30, 2023, which will net $400 million in consumer savings, the governor’s release said.\n\nIndiana\n\nJeffersonville: Police are investigating after more than 30 bodies, some decomposing, were found inside a southern Indiana funeral home. Police in the Louisville, Kentucky, suburb of Jeffersonville responded to Lankford Funeral Home and Family Center on Friday evening and found 31 bodies, including some “in the advanced stages of decomposition,” Maj. Isaac Parker said. He said the county coroner’s office had reported a strong odor emanating from the building. Inside, officers wearing hazmat gear found bodies “in different places around the building.” Some of the bodies had been at the funeral home since March, Parker said. Police also found the cremated remains of 16 people. “It was a very unpleasant scene,” Parker said. “The conditions were not good.” The owner of the funeral home has been speaking with police since Friday, Parker said, and an investigation is ongoing. The owner did not immediately respond to an email from the Associated Press seeking comment Sunday. The remains were taken to the Clark County Coroner’s Office for identification, and police asked anyone who may have information to contact the coroner’s office.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state Supreme Court on Thursday reversed a long-standing precedent that allowed landowners to sue for damages when a neighboring hog farm causes water pollution or odor problems that affect quality of life. The court concluded, 4-3, that a 2004 decision was wrong. The earlier ruling established that a portion of Iowa’s law providing immunity to livestock farms from neighbors’ nuisance lawsuits violated the inalienable rights clause of the Iowa Constitution. It also found neighbors could sue if they had lived in the area long before the farm began operating, had sustained significant hardship, and did not benefit from the nuisance immunity granted to the livestock farm. Justice Thomas Waterman wrote in the Thursday decision that “protecting and promoting livestock production is a legitimate state interest, and granting partial immunity from nuisance suits is a proper means to that end.” Iowa is the nation’s leading pork producer with 23 million pigs, most kept in large confinement buildings that collect nitrogen-rich manure from the animals and use it to fertilize fields. The court said judges must use a rational basis to review future court challenges – a standard that will be difficult to overcome because it presumes state laws are passed for the benefit of the public.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: A local government has agreed to pay $12.5 million to a man and his mother after he spent 23 years in prison for a double murder he did not commit. The Unified Government of Wyandotte County and Kansas City approved the settlement Thursday and said in a statement Friday that it admits no guilt in the wrongful conviction of and two life sentences given to Lamonte McIntyre in the mid-1990s. McIntyre was 17 in 1994 when he was arrested in Kansas City for the shooting deaths of 21-year-old Doniel Quinn and 34-year-old Donald Ewing. McIntyre was freed in 2017 after a local prosecutor asked the court to vacate his convictions and drop all charges, calling his case an example of “manifest injustice.” Prosecutors presented no physical evidence tying McIntyre to the killings, and their case largely hinged on testimony that was allegedly coerced. The following year, McIntyre and his mother sued the unified government and former Kansas City police Detective Roger Golubski, whom they have accused, along with other police, of framing McIntyre for the killings. Their lawsuit sought up to $123 million in damages. McIntyre and his mother have said Golubski coerced her into sex and then framed her teenage son for the double homicide because she rejected the detective’s later sexual advances. They also allege that he abused dozens of Black women for years and that many officers were aware of his conduct. Federal authorities are investigating Golubski.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The Kentucky Court of Appeals rejected Attorney General Daniel Cameron’s effort to stop abortions in the state just two days after a court order allowed them to resume. Cameron is now asking the state Supreme Court to consider his case. In an order issued Saturday, appeals court Judge Glenn Acree denied Cameron’s appeal of a temporary restraining order issued Thursday by Jefferson Circuit Judge Mitch Perry. That means abortions may continue for now while a legal challenge to a state law banning almost all abortions in Kentucky continues before Perry. Cameron had argued that Perry erred in allowing abortions to resume in Kentucky and sought to have the restraining order blocked by the appeals court. Lawyers for Kentucky’s two abortion providers filed a response Friday, arguing procedural rules and case law bar lifting Perry’s restraining order. Cameron said in a brief statement Saturday he was “disappointed” with the decision, and on Sunday, he announced he had filed his request with the high court, saying his office is “exhausting every possible avenue.” Meanwhile, Perry has scheduled a hearing Wednesday on whether to grant an injunction, which would continue to block the law while the case proceeds.\n\nLouisiana\n\nMonroe: A former north Louisiana police officer pleaded guilty Friday to kicking a man in the face as he lay on the ground with his hands behind his back during an arrest in 2020, federal prosecutors said. Jared Desadier, 44, of Monroe, entered the plea before U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Foote to a charge of deprivation of rights under color of law, U.S. Attorney Brandon B. Brown’s office said in a news release. At the time, Desadier was an officer with the Monroe Police Department. Authorities said he and other officers detained a man for questioning and found he was carrying drug paraphernalia. The man ran, and officers pursued him. Another officer caught up with the man and ordered him to the ground. The man complied, and as the officer prepared to handcuff him, Desadier ran up on them and kicked the man in the face, authorities said. Desadier admitted in court that his assault was without justification, as the man did not present a threat to any officer or other person on the scene, Brown’s office said. Desadier also admitted he knew his actions were unjustified and unreasonable under the circumstances. Desadier faces up to 10 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of up to $250,000. Sentencing is set for Nov. 21.\n\nMaine\n\nKittery: Children from 47 families using the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard’s child care center are being removed from the program due to a U.S. Department of Defense order. Shipyard families were notified June 17 that the Navy is reimplementing a priority child care program access policy, which puts children of active military members ahead of children of the Navy’s civilian employees. The policy was scheduled to take effect two years ago but was delayed by COVID-19. “In accordance with the Policy Change Concerning Priorities for Department of Defense Child Care Programs Memorandum, your child has been identified for supplanting to accommodate a higher priority family,” the families were told in a letter. Given 45 days to find alternative child care services, the last day will be Aug. 1 for children from the affected families using the shipyard’s Child Development Center. “Child care is a workforce issue that directly impacts the efficiency, readiness and retention of the total force,” said Jeremy Lambert, spokesperson for Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. He said the “supplanting” policy prioritizes single and dual active military member households, active-duty service members with a spouse working full time, combat-related wounded warriors, and children of staff at the Child Development Center.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: New restrictions on crabbing in the Chesapeake Bay will take effect this year after the blue crab count plummeted to its lowest level since surveys began in 1990. Tighter harvest limits are being issued as officials and industry leaders try to protect the iconic species and boost reproduction in the nation’s largest estuary. The Baltimore Sun reports Maryland’s Department of Natural Resources is issuing the first-ever limits on how many bushels of male blue crabs can be hauled in each day. Limits typically regulate the harvesting of female crabs to ensure that enough of them spawn. The new rules starting this month for Maryland limit the number of bushels that can be hauled in each day. The cuts will translate to about 15% to 25% of daily commercial harvest limits compared to the 2021 crabbing season, depending on the license. It’s unclear how much of an effect the new restrictions will have because watermen don’t hit their limits every day. The Chesapeake Bay Foundation, an independent conservation group, said the harvest limits are an encouraging step, but more needs to be done to address the likely causes behind the low crab count. Those include “poor water quality, loss of key habitat such as underwater grasses, and the proliferation of blue catfish and other invasive predators,” said Allison Colden, the foundation’s Maryland senior fisheries scientist.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A Republican former state senator who’s running for Congress has been charged after allegedly stealing a gun from an elderly constituent and misleading investigators about what happened, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said Friday. Investigators said Dean Tran, 46, of Fitchburg, used his position as a public official to intimidate the constituent into parting with her late husband’s firearms, making her sign a pre-prepared contract and giving her $1,500 in cash for at least eight guns while visiting her in June 2019. When asked to return them the next day, Tran complied. But a day after he gave the guns back, he returned to the woman’s home, forced his way in and demanded a key to the gun safe, according to investigators. He then stole a Colt .45 while the constituent hid in her bedroom, investigators said. That gun was also later returned to the woman. Tran issued a statement Friday evening, calling the allegations “untrue and categorically false.” His lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Investigators say Tran allegedly gave conflicting stories and reasons for taking the guns when interviewed by police, including denying any type of firearm sale, later producing a sales contract for the weapons, and disparaging the constituent’s mental capacity before demanding a written apology from her. Investigators also allege Tran made false statements on his May 2019 license-to-carry renewal application.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Elevated levels of arsenic have been found at seven sites where buildings were demolished in 2017-18 and filled with soil, The Detroit News reports. The results followed concerns raised by federal inspectors that 200 sites may have been filled with risky dirt. Tests show unsafe levels of arsenic at seven sites so far, and an eighth “did not fully meet quality standards,” the city said Thursday. Detroit ordered a contractor to replace soil at seven sites and test or replace soil at another 127 sites, according to the newspaper. “Whenever we become aware of a breach of contract instance, we require the contractor to address the situation at their own cost,” said Raymond Scott of the buildings department. Arsenic is a natural element found in water, air and soil. Chronic exposure can cause health problems. “Scientists, pediatricians, and public health professionals are concerned about subtle and long-range health effects of low-level exposures to arsenic in people,” according to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. Detroit said temporary fences would be installed around the sites.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: More households in the state are qualifying for a federal program that provides assistance with food at a time when inflation has caused grocery prices to rise. The Legislature, during its last session, increased the income limit for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program from 165% of the federal poverty level to 200%. That means households of three making $3,600 a month or less are now able to receive food stamp benefits. Peter Woitock, a government relations specialist with Hunger Solutions, advocated for the change and said about 1,400 additional households in Minnesota will be eligible. He said many people were above the income level to qualify for SNAP, but they were still struggling to put food on the table. “We saw during the early part of the (coronavirus) pandemic a lot of policies that were put into place to help put food on the table for those who are struggling. But many of those policies and waivers were temporary,” Woitock said. Food shelf operators say visits to their pantries have risen 39% since January 2022, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. Woitock said SNAP also contributes to the local economy. “I think in 2020, it served over 412,000 individuals, so that was about $780 million of federal funds that came into the state,” he said.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A look at how African Americans traveled during the Jim Crow era is on display at the Two Mississippi Museums. The Negro Motorist Green Book, a Smithsonian traveling exhibition, opened Saturday at the downtown venue, which is part of the Mississippi Department of Archives and History, a Smithsonian affiliate. It includes artifacts from business signs and postcards to historic footage, images and firsthand accounts to convey not only the apprehension felt by Black travelers but also the resilience, innovation and elegance of people choosing to live a full American existence, officials said. Mississippi artifacts include items from the historic Riverside Hotel in Clarksdale and Hotel E.F. Young Jr. in Meridian. Two Mississippi Museums director Pamela D.C. Junior said she was ecstatic to have the exhibit housed at the venue. “During the Great Migration, families moved across the U.S.; thus, the necessity to travel and visit relatives was born,” Junior said. “Postal worker Victor Green innovatively responded to this need with a roadmap of havens to eat, rest and visit. This safety net was a key guide for people of color throughout the Jim Crow South and other parts of America.” The exhibition will run through Sept. 25 in the Medgar and Myrlie Evers Exhibition Hall at the Two Mississippi Museums.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: A legislator has resigned her seat after being convicted of falsely claiming she was giving patients stem cell treatments for COVID-19. State Rep. Tricia Derges, R-Nixa, sent her resignation letter to Missouri House Speaker Rob Vescovo on Friday. She was convicted in June on 22 counts including wire fraud, illegal distribution of controlled substances and making false statements to investigators. Federal prosecutors argued she claimed nearly $900,000 in federal funding for COVID-19 treatments that weren’t performed or had already been performed. They also alleged she promoted amniotic fluid as a COVID-19 treatment and other diseases by falsely claiming it contained stem cells. Her narcotics license was placed on probation for three years in January. At the time, she refused to resign her House seat but was stripped of her committee assignments and barred from party caucus meetings. The state GOP prohibited her from running for reelection as a Republican this fall. Her sentencing on the federal charges will be determined in the coming months, and the jury voted to allow the government to keep $300,000 in CARES Act money she received for her clinic’s COVID-19 testing that had already been reimbursed. Derges pushed in the Legislature to allow assistant physicians like herself a path to licensing.\n\nMontana\n\nBrowning: A Blackfeet researcher has received a $75,000 federal grant to run a yearlong study to train dogs to sniff out chronic wasting disease and toxic waste that might otherwise be ingested by people who hunt wild game and gather traditional plants. The project aims to protect tribal members’ health by letting them know where the disease has been detected and where toxic waste has been found to preserve safe spaces to conduct traditional practices, Kaiser Health News reports. Chronic wasting disease has been detected in just one white-tailed deer on the Blackfeet reservation, but once it’s present, it’s impossible to eradicate, according to wildlife managers. The disease is already forcing tribal members to alter or abandon some traditional practices, said Souta Calling Last, executive director of the nonprofit cultural and educational organization Indigenous Vision. And some families depend on meat from the deer, elk or moose they can hunt several months out of the year. That’s where the dogs come in for Calling Last’s study. Standing near a wetland full of cattails, she said the dogs trained by the nonprofit organization Working Dogs for Conservation will detect chronic wasting disease in deer and elk scat at such sites that serve as watering holes for herds. The dogs also will sniff out mink and otter scat so it can be tested for chemicals and contaminants in illegal dumpsites of old cars, furniture and appliances.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A special election that was the tightest race in decades in a GOP-dominated U.S. House district is boosting confidence among Democrats hoping to energize voters by tapping into public outrage over the U.S. Supreme Court’s abortion ruling. Republicans still won the open seat as expected last week, but the margin surprised even some Democrats who have grown accustomed to lopsided, morale-crushing defeats. Republican Mike Flood beat Democrat Patty Pansing Brooks with 53.2% of the vote in last Tuesday’s special election, according to unofficial results. Pansing Brooks received 46.8%, with less than 7,200 total votes separating the candidates. The win was the narrowest in decades in the Republican-heavy, mostly rural 1st Congressional District, which hasn’t elected a Democrat to the House since 1964. The two were competing to replace disgraced former U.S. Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, a Republican who routinely claimed at least 60% of the vote in his district before he was convicted in March on charges that he lied to FBI agents about an illegal campaign donation. He resigned shortly after a jury found him guilty and was sentenced to probation Tuesday in a federal court in Los Angeles. He began the process of filing an appeal Wednesday. Flood and Pansing Brooks will face each other again in November to determine who will serve a full term starting in January 2023.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A sunken boat dating to World War II is the latest object to emerge from a shrinking reservoir that straddles Nevada and Arizona. The Higgins landing craft that has long been 185 feet below the surface is now nearly halfway out of the water at Lake Mead. The boat lies less than a mile from Lake Mead Marina and Hemenway Harbor. It was used to survey the Colorado River decades ago, sold to the marina and then sunk, according to dive tours company Las Vegas Scuba. Higgins Industries in New Orleans built several thousand landing craft between 1942 and 1945, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. About 1,500 “Higgins boats” were deployed at Normandy on June 6, 1944, known as D-Day. The boat is just the latest in a series of objects unearthed by declining water levels in Lake Mead, the largest human-made reservoir in the U.S., held back by the Hoover Dam. In May, two sets of human remains were found in the span of a week. Experts say climate change and drought have led to the lake dropping to its lowest level since it was full about 20 years ago. As both Lake Mead and Lake Powell drop, states in the West increasingly face cuts to their supply from the Colorado River. U.S. Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Camille Touton said last month that the agency would take action to protect the system if the seven states in the Colorado River basin don’t quickly come up with a way to cut the use of up to 4 million acre-feet of water – more than Arizona and Nevada’s shares combined.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLittleton: Graffiti that was spray-painted on an anti-abortion pregnancy center is being investigated as a potential hate crime, police said. Someone spray-painted the words “fund abortion abort God” on the side of the Pathways Pregnancy Care Center last Tuesday, Littleton police said. The act happened days after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and gave full leeway to ban abortion back to the states. Pathways is a Christian ministry founded in 1996 that offers programs and information about alternatives to abortion. Police said the people who work and volunteer at Pathways are concerned for their safety and are taking internal steps to increase their security.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: The city’s largest casino employer said Friday that a new contract it reached with a key union provides for “historic” raises. And the parent company of the city’s top-performing casino said the pact is “a good agreement for everyone.” Caesars Entertainment owns a third of Atlantic City’s nine casinos: Caesars, Harrah’s and Tropicana. It reached an agreement late Thursday night with Local 54 of the Unite Here union on a tentative deal to avoid a strike that had been threatened for the July Fourth weekend, traditionally one of the busiest times of the year for the casinos. The Borgata also reached a deal earlier Thursday. In a statement issued Friday, Caesars Entertainment said it has operated in Atlantic City for over 40 years “with an unwavering commitment to the community and its residents.” MGM Resorts International, which owns the Borgata, also praised the deal it reached with the union. Terms of the deal were not immediately released. But union President Bob McDevitt said Thursday night that the deal is “the best contract we’ve ever had.” The union said it was seeking “significant” wage increases in a new contract to help workers keep pace with rapidly rising prices for gasoline, food, rent and other expenses, as well as to compensate them for helping the casinos get through the worst of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Renewed efforts are underway to investigate and possibly discipline two attorneys who helped the Donald Trump campaign challenge New Mexico’s 2020 presidential election results in the weeks prior to the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. A group including former Albuquerque Mayor Martin Chavez on Thursday asked the state Supreme Court to intervene and ensure an investigation in public view of the two attorneys who represented the Trump campaign for possible violations of standards of professional conduct. The complaint cites possible violations of conduct rules by New Mexico-based attorney Mark J. Caruso and another attorney, Michael Smith, who lists a Texas address and a Washington law license. The state’s chief disciplinary counsel and disciplinary board chairman previously determined in confidential proceedings that there was no violation of rules against frivolous litigation by Caruso and Smith. Caruso said by email that he was confident the Supreme Court would stand behind the previous finds, describing the accusations as “political claims by N.M. Democrat attorneys.” President Joe Biden won the 2020 vote in New Mexico by about 11 percentage points, or nearly 100,000 ballots. But the Trump campaign still filed a lawsuit with the U.S. District Court in Albuquerque that sought to invalidate absentee ballots cast at drop boxes and halt the certification of New Mexico’s presidential electors.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Legislators approved a sweeping overhaul Friday of the state’s handgun licensing rules, seeking to preserve some limits on firearms after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that most people have a right to carry a handgun for personal protection. The measure, signed by Gov. Kathy Hochul after passing both chambers by wide margins, is almost sure to draw more legal challenges from gun rights advocates who say the state is still putting too many restrictions on who can get guns and where they can carry them. Hochul, a Democrat, called the Democrat-controlled Legislature back to Albany to work on the law after last week’s high court ruling overturning the state’s long-standing licensing restrictions. Backers said the law, which takes effect Sept. 1, strikes the right balance between complying with the Supreme Court’s ruling and keeping weapons out of the hands of people likely to use them recklessly or with criminal intent. But some Republican lawmakers, opposed to tighter restrictions, argued the law violated the constitutional right to bear arms and predicted it too would end up being overturned. Among other things, the state’s new rules will require people applying for a handgun license to turn over a list of their social media accounts so officials could verify their “character and conduct.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The General Assembly wrapped up its chief work session for the year Friday by finalizing proposed state budget adjustments for the new fiscal year, crossing off other must-do legislation but leaving some big policy matters unresolved or thwarted. The Republican-penned spending measure, which alters the second year of a two-year budget plan enacted last November, received strong bipartisan support again, as it did while securing initial House and Senate approval on Thursday. The bill would spend $27.9 billion for the new year that began Friday while setting aside several billion additional dollars in reserves and construction projects. It also contains additional pay increases for teachers and state employees, although they’re not as large as those sought by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, who was reviewing the measure, a spokesperson said. He’ll have 10 days to decide whether to sign the bill into law, veto it or let it become law without his signature. With more than 30 legislative Democrats voting for the measure, Cooper appears hard-pressed to have any veto he issues stick should GOP leaders attempt an override later this month. The House voted 82-25 and the Senate 36-8 for the measure with little debate Friday, approving it after Thursday’s more robust discussion.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: The state’s attorney general has found the sale of more than 2,000 acres of prime farmland to a group tied to Bill Gates complies with a Depression-era law meant to protect family farms because the land is being leased back to farmers. Republican Attorney General Drew Wrigley had inquired into the land sale and on Wednesday issued a letter saying the transaction complied with the archaic anti-corporate farming law. The law prohibits corporations or limited liability companies from owning farmland or ranchland, but it allows individual trusts to own the land if it is leased to farmers. The purchase of the land had raised legal questions, as well as concerns that ultra-rich landowners do not share the state’s values. Gates is considered the largest private owner of farmland in the country, with some 269,000 acres across dozens of states, Gates’ firm, Red River Trust, purchased $13.5 million worth of land in two counties from wealthy northeastern North Dakota potato growers Campbell Farms. In a curious move, the Campbell family in February filed a partnership name certificate with the North Dakota secretary of state naming their farming operation the Red River Trust – the same name as Gates’ firm. But an attorney for Gates’ firm wrote to the attorney general’s office that the Campbells registered the name without his knowledge.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A new law taking effect this fall will establish uniform rules for carrying knives across Ohio to prevent municipalities from enforcing local regulations, proponents say. The bill’s main sponsor, state Sen. Kristina Roegner, R-Hudson, said varying regulations create a confusing patchwork of laws that are tough to follow and enforce. Her legislation restricts local regulations on knife-carrying but doesn’t change the types of knives the state allows people to carry. In committee hearings, Democrats questioned the need for the mostly Republican-backed bill. Rep. Tavia Galonski, D-Akron, asked whether a change in law was necessary if no data exists to show the patchwork of knife regulations is a problem in Ohio. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine signed the bill in June. It takes effect in mid-September. Similar legislation was passed in Arizona in 2010 and has since been passed in at least 10 states, Roegner said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s Court of Criminal Appeals on Friday set execution dates for six death row inmates, just hours before an attorney filed a motion for a rehearing in one case. Execution dates for James Coddington, Richard Glossip, Benjamin Cole, Richard Fairchild, John Hanson and Scott Eizember were scheduled, starting Aug. 25 with Coddington and followed on Sept. 22 with Glossip. Glossip, whose first conviction and death sentence were overturned, was hours from being executed in September 2015 following a second conviction and death sentence when prison officials realized they had received the wrong lethal drug. It was later learned the same wrong drug had been used previously to execute an inmate, and executions in the state were put on hold. Executions in Oklahoma resumed in October with John Grant, who convulsed on the gurney and vomited before being declared dead. Glossip’s attorney, Don Knight, later Friday filed for a new hearing based on an investigation by a Houston law firm that contends Glossip is innocent. The report by the law firm Reed Smith alleges that evidence was lost or destroyed and that a detective improperly asked leading questions to co-defendant Justin Sneed to implicate Glossip in the slaying of Barry Van Treese, the owner of the motel where Glossip worked.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Fender’s blue butterflies are only found in the Willamette Valley, living in prairie meadows among the Kinkaid’s lupine. But their numbers have shrunk as their habitat has disappeared. Environmentalists and federal officials are trying to change that. One of the largest known populations of the butterfly exists in the Baskett Slough National Wildlife Refuge, in Polk County west of Salem. In 2020, the Trust for Public Land secured 183 acres adjacent to the refuge to protect the habitat for the butterfly. Now, a secluded area of woods and prairie southeast of Brownsville is being targeted for a habitat restoration project by the Bureau of Land Management, which could include cutting down conifers in a commercial timber sale to protect its Fender’s blue butterfly population. BLM is seeking the public’s input on the tentative project through July 13. Over the years, conifer trees have encroached on the prairie meadows of the Oak Basin Prairies, reducing them by at least 20% since 1875. BLM now is stepping in with the goal of protecting both the butterflies and their host plant, Kincaid’s lupine, which is federally threatened. Cutting down the trees would in turn expand meadows for butterflies and reduce competition for oak trees.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A state court on Thursday permanently blocked Gov. Tom Wolf’s plan to toll as many as nine major bridges on interstates in Pennsylvania, siding with three Pittsburgh-area municipalities that argued his administration had violated procedures in getting to the advanced stage of considering the idea. A panel of Commonwealth Court judges granted the municipalities’ request to effectively declare the plan dead because Wolf’s Department of Transportation had not followed the law. One key element on which the court agreed with the municipalities is the claim that PennDOT was required to propose specific bridges to toll when it asked the Public-Private Transportation Partnership Board in 2020 for permission to move forward with a bridge-tolling plan. PennDOT did not, however, identify specific bridges it wanted to toll until months after the board approved a bridge-tolling plan. As a result, parties potentially affected by a tolling project, such as municipalities, had no opportunity to meaningfully give input to the process before the board’s decision, the court said. Republican lawmakers hailed the decision, while Wolf’s administration would not immediately say whether it would appeal it to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. The loss for Wolf’s administration was the second in a row: A Commonwealth Court judge in a separate case in May had imposed a temporary injunction on the tolling projects.\n\nRhode Island\n\nJohnston: In a town where politics is often a family affair, the Democratic primary for state House District 42 could wind up looking more like a family feud. Dennis Cardillo Jr. has filed to run against his uncle Edward T. Cardillo Jr., who currently holds the seat. A second challenger, Kelsey Coletta, is the daughter of another lawmaker from the opposite side of the state, Rep. John “Jay” Edwards, D-Tiverton. The younger Cardillo, who oversees the night shift at a Pepsi-Cola plant, said he’s more educated than his uncle and wasn’t expecting him to seek reelection. The elder Cardillo, a former mechanic, did not respond to interview requests. Coletta – a social worker who said she’d be a more active representative than the incumbent – has her own unique family dynamic. She’s advocated at the State House for liberal causes such as reproductive rights and a less punitive approach to addiction, while her father tends to be slightly more conservative. Over time, she’s been able to inform his views on some issues, she said. Dennis Cardillo Jr. didn’t cite any specific disagreements with his father’s brother, who has typically been aligned with the conservative faction of the Rhode Island Democratic Party. “I don’t believe in talking badly about someone, but there is a difference in education level,” said the younger Cardillo, who has a bachelor’s in business administration from the University of Rhode Island. “I believe his highest level is just a high school diploma.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: A cache of civil rights-era items with a local provenance has finally returned to the city, part of the holdings of the College of Charleston’s Avery Research Center thanks to a donation from the Merrill C. Berman Collection. Avery staff plan to mount an exhibition in 2023 contextualizing and interpreting the materials for public consumption, The Post and Courier reports. The collection includes the original tape of a Martin Luther King Jr. speech delivered July 30, 1967, at Charleston County Hall, as well as a recording surreptitiously made of a Ku Klux Klan rally the night before King’s appearance. It also contains audio of Ralph Abernathy’s lengthy speech of April 1, 1969, delivered during the Charleston Hospital Workers Strike. The items had belonged to Columbia-based journalist Eugene Sloan, who covered the events and made the recordings when he worked for The State newspaper. Avery Director Tamara Butler said the collection will help her team update a narrative that has long portrayed Charleston as a relatively mild-mannered place that saw far less confrontation and violence than cities such as Birmingham or Montgomery in Alabama. There’s a reason King came to Charleston in 1967, she said, with groundwork laid by local activists over many years in one of the freedom movement’s essential hubs. Butler wants to use the new gift and the history it represents as a tool to find related testimonies of racial resistance and rebellion.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem on Friday said she has applied for permission to hold a fireworks show at Mount Rushmore to celebrate Independence Day 2023, persisting even though the National Park Service has denied her requests for the past two years. In 2020, a fireworks display, featuring a fiery speech from then-President Donald Trump, was held at the monument after a decadelong hiatus. The Park Service has cited environmental concerns and objections from Native American tribes in denying subsequent permit applications. A federal judge last year rebuffed the Republican governor’s lawsuit that sought to force the Park Service to allow her to shoot fireworks over the granite monument. Noem has appealed that decision. “As Americans all across our great country make preparations to celebrate their Independence Day, we have once again been denied the opportunity to celebrate at our nation’s enduring symbol of freedom, Mount Rushmore National Memorial,” the governor said in a statement last week. The Department of Interior declined to comment on Noem’s application. Noem is running for reelection and is widely considered to be a potential Republican contender for the 2024 White House ticket. She often cites 2020’s fireworks celebration, when she shared the stage with Trump, as a highlight of her first term.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Nashville civil rights veteran Diane Nash, who led sit-ins, coordinated freedom rides and was jailed while pregnant for teaching minors nonviolent protest tactics, will be honored with a Presidential Medal of Freedom. The White House press office announced that Nash, and 16 others will receive the prestigious award Thursday. Famed Alabama civil rights lawyer Fred Gray, who attended school in Nashville and later led some of the most pivotal legal cases of the civil rights movement, will also receive the honor. The Medal of Freedom is the nation’s highest civilian honor, reserved for those who have made significant contributions to the “prosperity, values, or security of the United States, world peace, or other significant societal, public or private endeavors,” the White House said. Nash, born in Chicago, moved to Nashville when she transferred to Fisk University in 1959. Incensed by the overt racism she saw, Nash joined the Rev. James Lawson’s nonviolence workshops, where participants role-played as demonstrators and attackers to ready themselves for all possibilities. Nash was elected chairperson of the Nashville movement, and she and the Student Central Committee staged sit-ins at lunch counters across the city. The city’s lunch counters were the first in the South to desegregate.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: An inmate who is set to be put to death in less than two weeks asked that his execution be delayed so he can donate a kidney. Ramiro Gonzales is scheduled to receive a lethal injection July 13 for fatally shooting 18-year-old Bridget Townsend, a southwest Texas woman whose remains were found nearly two years after she vanished in 2001. In a letter sent Wednesday, Gonzales’ lawyers, Thea Posel and Raoul Schonemann, asked Republican Gov. Greg Abbott to grant a 30-day reprieve so the inmate can be considered a living donor “to someone who is in urgent need of a kidney transplant.” They included a letter from Cantor Michael Zoosman, an ordained Jewish clergyman from Maryland who has been corresponding with Gonzales. “There has been no doubt in my mind that Ramiro’s desire to be an altruistic kidney donor is not motivated by a last-minute attempt to stop or delay his execution. I will go to my grave believing in my heart that this is something that Ramiro wants to do to help make his soul right with his God,” Zoosman wrote. Gonzales’ attorneys say he’s been determined an “excellent candidate” for donation after being evaluated by the transplant team at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. His rare blood type means his donation could benefit someone who might have difficulty finding a match.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Managers of the Switchpoint Community Resource Center held a ribbon-cutting and hosted tours Thursday to celebrate the first harvest of the center’s new RISE Garden, a grant-funded venture that endeavors to grow fresh food in a water-efficient way for southern Utah residents. Not only does the RISE Garden provide for those using Switchpoint services, but 80% of the harvest also goes toward the Southern Utah community each week, according to Linda Stay, Switchpoint’s development director. St. George Mayor Michele Randall and City Councilwoman Danielle Larkin made appearances at the ceremony and were among the first to purchase greens and goods from RISE Garden. “Switchpoint is the model for the entire state of Utah – and I think the country – and we are mentioned all the time, over and over and over again, for the great things we’re doing,” Randall said. Switchpoint uses towers that reuse water in order to take a more water-conservative approach to gardening. Subscriptions will be made available for those who want to make weekly pickups. According to the Switchpoint website, the garden uses aeroponic or vertical farming, and the RISE Garden saves 95% more space and water with no pesticides or genetically modified seeds.\n\nVermont\n\nPlymouth: The community of Plymouth Notch – birthplace of Calvin Coolidge, the only U.S. president born on the Fourth of July – commemorated his 150th birthday this holiday weekend. The President Calvin Coolidge State Historic Site in Plymouth Notch hosted the celebration of Coolidge’s 150th birthday Monday, with a Vermont National Guard delegation leading a march to the Plymouth Notch Cemetery, where a birthday wreath from the White House was placed at Coolidge’s gravesite. “Calvin Coolidge preferred understated events, but the celebration of what would have been his 150th birthday, on the 246th birthday of our great nation, deserves some pomp and circumstance,” Vermont State Historic Preservation Officer Laura Trieschmann said in a news release. The Coolidge Cup, a national invitational speech and debate tournament sponsored by the Calvin Coolidge Presidential Foundation, also brought competitors to town for the weekend to compete for more than $15,000 in scholarship money. Coolidge served as the 30th president of the United States from 1923 to 1929, elevated from the vice presidency after Warren Harding died unexpectedly from a heart attack. Coolidge, a Republican, then won the 1924 election. The President Calvin Coolidge State Historic Site includes his boyhood home, the homes of relatives and family friends, his family’s cheese factory, and his father’s store, which was used as the Summer White House in 1924.\n\nVirginia\n\nLynchburg: As American citizens celebrated freedom and liberty in their nation on Independence Day in 1961, a government founded on notions of the inalienable human rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness took action at a local level to deny those rights to their fellow citizens whose skin was not white. This little-taught chapter of local history is being brought to life in an original play, “Buried Deep,” produced through Endstation Theatre Company, affiliated with Randolph College. On that sweltering July day in Lynchburg, as many residents sought the relief offered by public pools, the city closed those pools down because some Black residents went to swim in the whites-only pools at Miller and Riverside parks. They were exercising their civil rights and making intentional strides toward integration and equality when many people were content to drag their feet despite a federal court’s recent ruling that mandated desegregation nationwide. Today, if one visits Riverside Park, an indentation in the ground where a pool once stood remains as a permanent scar of racial tensions in the not-so-distant past. “Buried Deep” is part of Endstation’s New Works initiative, a program that supports playwrights who create a script based on some aspect of Lynchburg-area history.\n\nWashington\n\nEverett: A nonprofit land trust has made its largest purchase ever to conserve 175 acres of forest and 3,500 feet of nearly pristine shoreline. Staff at the Whidbey Camano Land Trust said they knew they had to act quickly when a 226-acre beachfront property south of Coupeville came on the market last December. From the water, boaters may have seen the red house, old windmill, and cattle grazing atop the bluffs. The property near Keystone is home to one of the oldest farms on Whidbey Island. It also features a large forest and long stretch of beach. The site was at risk of being sold and developed into 22 high-end homes, according to the land trust. In late April, the land trust bought the property for $9.1 million, the most expensive purchase in the nonprofit’s nearly four-decade history. “We don’t get many opportunities to protect a chunk of habitat that size,” conservation director Ryan Elting told the Everett Herald. With the new property, called the Keystone Preserve, the trust will focus on habitat improvement and marine restoration. There are also plans to open public beach access as soon as 2024, as well as a trail network. The land trust has partnered with the Organic Farm School to manage the site. The nonprofit school on Whidbey Island will oversee the 50 acres of prairie and farm.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Hershel W. “Woody” Williams, the last remaining Medal of Honor recipient from World War II, will lie in honor at the U.S. Capitol, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Sunday. “Woody Williams embodied the best of America: living a life of duty, honor and courage,” Pelosi said in a joint statement. Schumer called Williams “an American hero who embodied the best of our country and the greatest generation.” Williams, who died Wednesday at 98, was a legend in his home state for his heroics under fire over several crucial hours at the battle for Iwo Jima. As a young Marine corporal, Williams went ahead of his unit in February 1945 and eliminated a series of Japanese machine gun positions. Facing small-arms fire, Williams fought for four hours, repeatedly returning to prepare demolition charges and obtain flamethrowers. Later that year, the 22-year-old Williams received the Medal of Honor from President Harry Truman. The Medal of Honor is the nation’s highest award for military valor. In remarks at a memorial Sunday in Charleston, U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin said Williams “never quit giving back.” That included raising money for gold star families – immediate family members of fallen service members – with an annual motorcycle ride. “It’s raised hundreds of thousands of dollars,” Manchin said. He joked that “it’s not going to be stopping, because Woody would come after me in a heartbeat.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nSheboygan: In four years, the city will lose its claim to having the world’s tallest free-flying American flag. The Acuity Insurance flagpole – the “World’s Tallest Symbol of Freedom” – stands 400 feet high. On July 4, 2026, the Flagpole of Freedom Park near Maine’s southeast coast is proposing to erect a flagpole larger than the Empire State Building. As the site is on a hill 315 feet tall, the 1,461-foot-high flagpole will reach 1,776 feet above sea level, which Flagpole of Freedom Park spokesperson Sarah Martin said pays homage to the year the United States declared independence. Although the Wisconsin flagpole will lose its distinction in the coming years, Acuity Communications Manager Paul Miller said it will still be a landmark. “The flagpole is one of the most visible landmarks on the Interstate 43 corridor and welcomes people to the Sheboygan community,” he said. “Many people stop to visit the flagpole, which is seen by drivers and passengers in over 50,000 vehicles that pass by our headquarters every day.” In addition to the flagpole, Acuity has a veterans memorial. There are 766 pavers with names of Sheboygan County residents who passed away serving in the line of duty in conflicts dating back to the Civil War. Miller said Acuity has no plans to increase the height of its flagpole because notching a record wasn’t the goal for building it.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The U.S. Capitol insurrection dominated Thursday’s debate among U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney and her four Republican primary challengers, with Cheney pressing her Donald Trump-backed opponent on whether she agreed with the ex-president’s claim that widespread fraud cost him reelection. Harriet Hageman said there were “serious concerns” about the 2020 election but stopped short of repeating Trump’s false claim that drove thousands of his supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Even so, Hageman was dismissive of the U.S. House commission vice-chaired by Cheney that has been investigating the insurrection and events leading up to it. “They’re focusing on something that happened 18 months ago. They’re not focused on things that are important to the people of Wyoming,” said Hageman, a Cheyenne ranching and natural resources attorney. Republicans, she said, were being punished for “exercising their First Amendment rights” – a remark on which Cheney pounced as suggesting the insurrection was justified. Cheney’s role as one of just two Republicans on the Jan. 6 panel has stirred a backlash in deep-red Wyoming. The state GOP last year censured Cheney and voted to no longer recognize her as a Republican. “I will not violate my oath of office, and if you’re looking for someone who will, you need to vote for someone else on this stage,” she said during Thursday’s debate.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/06/12/black-union-regiment-flag-notorious-big-pikachu-mini-pony-news-around-states/39572557/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuscaloosa: University of Alabama officials say spots remain open for a youth forensic science camp on campus. Middle school and high school students are eligible for the camp run by the university’s Office of Archaeological Research in July. The camp offers experience dusting for fingerprints, examining blood spatter and other forensic science techniques. OAR Cultural Resources Analyst Lindsey Gordon tells the Tuscaloosa News the camp is ideal for students interested in forensic science, anthropology, sociology, human biology and criminal justice. The camp will have two sessions, July 8-12 for middle school students and July 22-26 for high school students. Each session costs $275. Students must register before June 30.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: State officials are reconsidering whether special events like outdoor concerts are a responsible use of state park land. The Anchorage Daily News reports a concert in Chugach State Park was canceled following complaints about potential negative environmental impacts. The manager for folk band Blackwater Railroad Company says the proposed concert at Williwaw Lakes was intended to provide an intimate, outdoor experience encouraging conservation. He says the band expected attendance would be no more than 200 people due to the 12- to 16-mile round-trip hike to the event. More than a thousand people registered interest on social media. A park official says some outdoor enthusiasts feared the concert would damage the environment and backcountry experience at the site southeast of Anchorage.\n\nArizona\n\nFlorence: An outbreak of mumps among immigrants detained in federal facilities in Pinal County is fueling a statewide spike in cases. Mumps in Arizona this year has reached 42 confirmed cases – a 10-year annual high number less than halfway into 2019, state data shows. Mumps is a contagious viral disease that in most infected people will cause swelling of the salivary glands, causing puffy cheeks and a tender, swollen jaw. The Arizona numbers likely will go up because the most recent data from the Pinal County Public Health Department indicates a higher case count than the state data reflects. As of Monday, nearly 300 immigration detainees at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities in Pinal County were under quarantine after being exposed to mumps, ICE officials said.\n\nArkansas\n\nHot Springs: A dapper-dressed statue of gangster Al Capone has been repaired, repainted and returned to a bar after a failed attempt to steal the welcoming figure. The Sentinel-Record reports the redone statue was returned Saturday to a seat near a bench outside The Ohio Club in Hot Springs. Its website describes the business as the oldest bar in Arkansas, established in 1905, and Capone was a known visitor. Investigators say two men in March tried to snatch the statue but dropped and broke it. Both were charged with public intoxication and criminal mischief. Club owner Mike Pettey says repairs cost $3,500. Part of Capone’s white suit has been painted black. About $2,500 generated through T-shirt sales, celebrating Capone’s return, will be donated to the Garland County Historical Society.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Alamitos: The California National Guard has announced the appointment of the first woman to lead a U.S. Army infantry division. Brig. Gen. Laura Yeager will take command of the 40th Infantry Division on June 29 at Joint Forces Training Base in Los Alamitos. Yeager currently commands Joint Task Force North, U.S. Northern Command at Fort Bliss, Texas. Yeager was commissioned in 1986 as a second lieutenant from the Reserve Officer Training Corps at California State University, Long Beach. She served as UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter pilot, left active duty when her son was born and continued her military career in the California Army National Guard. Yeager deployed to Iraq in 2011 as deputy commander of the Cal Guard’s 40th Combat Aviation Brigade, then served as a battalion and brigade commander.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: A long-running effort by the city to reduce train horn noise downtown is switching tracks. Officials have hired a lobbying firm to help find a federal legislative path for establishing a “quiet zone” along a section of the BNSF track near the Colorado State University campus. Trains rolling through a designated quiet zone don’t have to sound their horns before crossing intersections as required by Federal Railroad Administration regulations. The city’s move shows how frustrated officials are with trying to get the FRA to do what they want: waive a quiet zone rule that requires gates, lights and bells at every intersection a train crosses within a zone. City officials have argued there is not enough room for gates in all directions at every intersection.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The Department of Energy and Environmental Protection commissioner will soon be soliciting bids to develop 30% of the state’s entire energy load from offshore wind sources. Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont has signed legislation into law that gives the commissioner 14 days to begin the request for proposals process. Lamont says it will mark the largest authorization by load – up to 2,000 megawatts – by any state in the region. Democratic and Republican proponents say they hope Connecticut will become a central hub for the offshore wind industry in New England. Lamont predicts the emerging industry can lead to hundreds of jobs and drive economic growth along the shoreline.\n\nDelaware\n\nLittle Creek: Environmental officials say the state’s once-dwindling horseshoe crab population could be recovering. Data from a federal commission that studies horseshoe crabs along the East Coast shows stability in numbers and even an increase in some regions, now that some states have regulated their harvests. The paper says the crab population suffered for decades from overfishing. It’s used for fertilizer, livestock food, bait and also medicine. The crab has unique properties in its blood that make it coveted for some medical products. Some scientists say an alternative to the crab’s blood could do more to boost the population. A synthetic alternative to crab blood has existed for 15 years but has yet to be widely accepted.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The district’s financial leader says he won’t certify the city’s proposed $15.5 billion budget, saying it improperly diverts money that should go toward repaying city debts for a 2003 convention center. The Washington Post reports Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey S. DeWitt notified the City Council of his decision Monday. He previously warned of the rejection. The council moved ahead with it anyway. District law says DeWitt must certify the budget before it can be sent to the mayor or Congress for approval. DeWitt’s denial comes at a time when upcoming spending usually is finalized. The Post says this could lead to the loss of tens of millions of dollars meant for urgent public housing repairs. Chairman Phil Mendelson sought to fund the repairs by diverting money from other reserves.\n\nFlorida\n\nPanama City: It’s been eight months since Hurricane Michael ripped through the state’s Panhandle, but an effort to help victims is continuing. The News Herald reports local organizations have taken over for FEMA at the Community Recovery Center, offering medical and dental help and guiding victims of the October storm to the appropriate resources. A mobile medical truck is expected to stop at the center every Monday afternoon through the summer. Nurse practitioner Denise Miller says the offer a sliding scale base for people who don’t have insurance. Jo Shaffer, a site administrator for Doorways of Northwest Florida, says the group is in charge of data management at the center. If workers see someone needs something, they find a way to help. She says they connect with agencies like Catholic Charities.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A fundraising bash honoring the 90th birthday of philanthropist Bernie Marcus, one of Home Depot’s founders, has raised more than $117 million for Georgia charities. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports Sunday’s star-studded gathering at the Atlanta Aquarium, which Marcus built, quickly raised $102 million in pledges. Arthur Blank, another founder of Home Depot and an owner of the Atlanta Falcons and Atlanta United of the MLS, contributed an additional $15 million. The event drew hundreds, including Gov. Brian Kemp and Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. The paper says the funds will support charities including the Grady Health System’s Marcus Stroke & Neuroscience Center and the Marcus Autism Center in Atlanta. Home Depot is Georgia’s largest public company based on revenue, according to the newspaper.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state budget passed by the Legislature includes funding for repairs at Waikiki Beach, officials say. Lawmakers approved about $13 million for improvements to the crumbling Royal Hawaiian seawall and other man-made structures at the state’s most visited beach, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. “This is the largest appropriation for beach improvements on Oahu in recent memory. It allows us to move forward on several projects that have been discussed on and off for decades,” says Dolan Eversole of the University of Hawaii. The $13 million is sufficient to shore up the Royal Hawaiian seawall between the Waikiki Sheraton and Royal Hawaiian hotels and return a seawall to Kuhio Beach – structures officials say have been failing for years. Waikiki’s overhaul is scheduled to start by early fall.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A Treasure Valley woman is offering a healing practice called forest bathing to teach people how to stop and smell the roses – and maybe taste them, too. Forest bathing aims to ground people in nature using each of their senses. Sari Telpner is the only Association of Nature and Forest Therapy-certified guide in the Boise area. She began leading immersive nature experiences in the Idaho Botanical Garden this spring. There, she helps participants connect to the roses, irises, fir trees and, most importantly, themselves. “My practice is being in nature in a really intentional way,” Telpner told the Idaho Statesman. Sometimes that means feeling the grass beneath your feet or walking at “a pace that’s so slow it’s almost painful” while inspecting the scents, sights and sounds of the garden. Each session ends with a tea ceremony, brewed from plants like lilac and catmint Telpner gathers on-site.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A federal judge in the city says he’ll dismiss a lawsuit brought by a parks advocacy group that is trying to stop former President Barack Obama’s presidential center from being built in a lakefront park. U.S. District Judge John Robert Blakey said there should be no delay in building the $500 million center after hearing arguments in court Tuesday. Protect Our Parks argued the city illegally transferred land for a park to The Obama Foundation, a private entity overseeing construction of the center. City lawyers accuse the parks group of exaggerating potential environmental problems, misreading the law and misrepresenting how the approval works. The center was supposed to open in 2021, but the lawsuit and a federal review have delayed construction at Jackson Park. An attorney for the parks organization says it plans to appeal.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A new school is two years from opening and still needs a leader, a charter and even a location. Yet families are already lining up to get their kids enrolled, says its founder, Jenn Watts. The reason for the fuss? Watts is planning the area’s first all-girls STEM school, in partnership with the Girl Scouts of Central Indiana. The yet-to-be-named school is slated to open in the fall of 2021, eventually serving girls in kindergarten through eighth grade. The idea, Watts says, is to get girls into STEM before they start hearing the message that science, technology, engineering and math aren’t for them. She’s familiar with how early that messaging starts and how it creates a gap that only widens as girls turn into women and enter the workforce, where STEM jobs continue to be dominated by men. The STEM school will be a first for the Girl Scouts of Central Indiana.\n\nIowa\n\nNewton: A prison program aims to alleviate a lack of affordable housing while teaching inmates construction skills they can use when they’re released. Newton Correction Facility inmates enrolled in the Iowa Prison Industries program are currently building an office and a classroom. But they will eventually build entire homes that can be moved to rural communities to address the decline in affordable housing. Inmates can also pursue apprenticeships for jobs in demand in the state. The acting warden of the low-and-medium security prison describes the program as a “win-win.” Those who qualify for affordable housing purchase can buy homes for about $125,000. The inmates gain marketable skills for when they leave prison. Families earning below $73,100 annually would qualify to purchase a home.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: Local high school students are offering to digitally restore print photographs damaged when a tornado tore through Douglas County. The large storm last month damaged trees, struck power lines and left a trail of debris on the southeastern edge of Lawrence. County officials said six people were treated for injuries at a hospital. The Lawrence Journal-World reports that graphic design students at Free State and Lawrence high schools will start restoring photographs this fall. Lawrence teacher Jennifer Dixon-Perkins says personal items such as photos are irreplaceable and can provide a sense of normalcy after a catastrophe. Free State teacher Michelle Salmans says she tries to find ways for students to apply learning to real-world scenarios. She says students will take the assignments more seriously knowing they’re helping others.\n\nKentucky\n\nTompkinsville: The second annual Writers in the Park will be held this week at Old Mulkey Meetinghouse State Historic Site in Tompkinsville. A statement from Kentucky State Parks says more than a dozen authors will participate in the event Saturday, including Kimberly Bartley and Connie Hughes Goodman. Bartley is the author of “Until Death Parts,” “Life Goes On,” “Go Forth and Multiply” and the newly released “Pickin’ Up the Pieces.” Goodman has written several fiction pieces, a biography, and numerous documentaries including “Monroe County Poor House” and “Tell Me a Tale.” The event will include different writing genres and authors from around Kentucky and elsewhere. Participating authors will discuss, sell and sign books. There will also be a workshop offered for budding writers.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: For celebrated Creole chef Leah Chase, the goodbye had all the ingredients of a typical New Orleans sendoff – warm reminiscences and mourning mixed with a Mardi Gras-style celebration of her life. Fellow chefs, musicians, family and friends were among hundreds who filed through a church Monday to pay last respects to Chase, who ran a family restaurant where civil rights strategies were discussed over gumbo and fried chicken in the 1950s and ’60s. She died June 1 at age 96. After a rosary and funeral Mass at St. Peter Claver Catholic Church featuring longtime local musician and singer Deacon John, a brass band, pallbearers, and members of the Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure Club slow-walked beside her hearse as it drove the few blocks to Dooky Chase’s restaurant – her last trip to the place where she earned renown as a chef, civil rights icon and patron of the arts.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: State lawmakers have passed a “Student Loan Bill of Rights” aiming to protect borrowers. The Senate unanimously enacted the legislation Monday. Democratic Gov. Janet Mills has 10 days to act on the bill or let it go into law without her signature. Such legislation had failed in the last legislative session under a Republican administration. The bill creates a student loan ombudsman with responsibilities that include reviewing and possibly resolving complaints from borrowers. The ombudsman would also compile and analyze borrower data and help borrowers understand rights and responsibilities. Maine’s bill requires servicers who do business in Maine to obtain a license and undergo an investigation. The bill automatically licenses student loan servicers under contract with the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan is urging Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to reconsider delaying the redesign of the $20 bill to feature abolitionist leader Harriet Tubman. The Republican governor made the request in a letter Tuesday. Tubman was born on Maryland’s Eastern Shore. She escaped from slavery to become a leading abolitionist and helped other slaves escape through the Underground Railroad. The Tubman redesign was initially scheduled to be released next year. Andrew Jackson, the nation’s seventh president, is now on the $20 bill. Mnuchin said the delay had been prompted by the decision to redesign the $10 bill and the $50 bill first for security reasons. He has said the decision on whether to keep Tubman on the redesigned $20 will be left to whoever is treasury secretary in 2026.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The Legislature may renew a long-standing debate over whether the state should move to a graduated income tax. A proposal that would allow higher levels of income to be taxed at higher rates, as more than 30 states and the federal government do, could come up Wednesday when lawmakers hold a constitutional convention to discuss the so-called millionaire tax. A graduated income tax would go further than the millionaire tax, which calls for a 4% surtax only on individuals with annual incomes above $1 million. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker said Monday that he would oppose a graduated income tax, while House Speaker Robert DeLeo and Senate President Karen Spilka, both Democrats, did not immediately offer a position.\n\nMichigan\n\nSt. Ignace: Plans are in the works to enhance the Father Marquette National Memorial site in the Upper Peninsula. The state Department of Natural Resources says a draft plan for the site in Straits State Park in Mackinac County will be unveiled June 18 at St. Ignace Public Library. The Straits of Mackinac Heritage Center Collaborative is hosting an open house, and the public will have opportunities to comment online as well. The Meijer Foundation and several individual donors have contributed or pledged funding that will leverage time-limited matching funds from a $500,000 National Endowment for the Humanities Challenge Grant. Those involved in the project initially committed to raise $1.5 million. The site celebrates 17th-century French missionary Father Jacques Marquette, who was among the first Europeans to explore the Great Lakes.\n\nMinnesota\n\nDuluth: The state’s cash assistance program for low-income families will offer a $100 boost in monthly aid starting next year. Minnesota Public Radio News reports that state lawmakers approved the Minnesota Family Investment Program’s monthly grant increase in May. The extra funding will be available beginning February 2020. It’s the first increase to the program since it began 33 years ago. Minnesota officials estimate the change will help more than 30,000 families. Toshieka Washington and her children were homeless for two years, and she’s been relying on the program to get back on track. Washington says the $100-per-month increase will help her get basic necessities she can’t afford now, such as laundry detergent and more toilet paper. Washington says $100 doesn’t seem like much, but she feels like she won the lottery.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Officials are reminding charities that hire telemarketers to seek new donors that they now have to register under the state’s no-call law. Beginning July 1, charities that use paid telephone solicitors to prospect for new donors could be fined if they don’t register in Mississippi and allow people to opt out of telemarketing calls. Until now, all charities have been exempt from the rules. Under a law passed earlier this year, though, only charities that are contacting existing donors or making phone calls with volunteers are exempt. Senate Bill 2744 also allows businesses to register for the state’s no-call list. Until now, only individuals could register. The new law makes it illegal to cause a fake number to display on caller identification, a practice known as spoofing.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A new report shows that black drivers in the state are 91% more likely than white motorists to be pulled over by police. Data released by the attorney general shows disparities are sometimes even greater when only comparing stops of local residents. The 2018 report comes nearly five years after Ferguson protesters drew national attention to long-standing concerns about police treatment of black communities. Criminologist Richard Rosenfeld cautioned that the latest data is based on population data from the 2010 census but says changes in racial demographics alone don’t explain the disparity increase. Missouri Sheriffs’ Association Executive Director Kevin Merritt says law enforcement officials have no tolerance for racial bias. But he says law enforcement want to collect more information, including whether officers knew the race of the driver before stopping them.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: A man whose father signed up for cryogenic preservation after death is suing to obtain the older man’s remains. Laurence Pilgeram paid Scottsdale, Arizona-based Alcor Life Extension Foundation $120,000 to preserve his remains in a frozen state indefinitely. Pilgeram hoped if he were frozen, future technology might someday enable him to be restored to life. He died in 2015. Now, Kurt Pilgeram, of Dutton, Montana, claims in a lawsuit that Alcor severed his father’s head for freezing and sent him the cremated remains of the rest of the body. The son claims his father wanted his entire body preserved. Pilgeram seeks over $1 million in damages and the return of his father’s head. Alcor says it has honored its agreement with Laurence Pilgeram.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The Game and Parks Commission has scheduled special events at four state parks and recreation areas for Father’s Day this Sunday. The commission says there will be a fishing clinic at the Danish Alps State Recreation Area near Hubbard in northeast Nebraska. The event begins at 10 a.m. Bait and equipment will be provided. Barbecued ribs will be served from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. during a buffet at Fort Robinson State Park, west of Crawford in northwest Nebraska. There will be a special Father’s Day Buffet from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. at Platte River State Park near Louisville in eastern Nebraska. A fish fry that includes a Dutch oven cobbler dessert is scheduled to run from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. at Ponca State Park, north of Ponca in northeast Nebraska. Park entry permits are required for vehicles. More information is available online.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Authorities in the city say they’re worried about the risk of explosion in neighborhoods where gasoline thieves are storing flammable fuel. Lt. Shane Womack told reporters the concern is that flammable vapor during hot summer weather could ignite with catastrophic effect. Police are distributing a public service announcement after Womack says 25 people were arrested recently for using fake or stolen credit cards to buy large amounts of gasoline and diesel fuel with plans to resell it. He says the scheme seems to be organized, and suspects have used vans or pickup trucks modified with oversize fuel tanks to get gasoline to storage tanks in residential areas. Deputy Clark County Fire Chief Jon Wiercinski says investigators found almost no cases in which the flammable fuel was stored safely.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDurham: The University of New Hampshire has started a new center focused on the science of sound. The university currently focuses on underwater acoustics. The new Center for Acoustics Research and Education will initially focus on environmental acoustics, which takes into account sound movement through the air, on land and underwater. It will support expansion into fields like music, speech and medicine. Anthony Lyons, the center’s associate director for research, says he’s already heard from industry and government partners interested in opportunities for professional development and collaboration.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: Gov. Phil Murphy has signed a law requiring most of the state’s hotels to provide their workers with wearable panic buttons they can press to quickly summon help in an emergency. The Democratic governor signed the bill Tuesday. He and several nationwide unions say New Jersey is the first state to mandate the devices, although at least two others are considering similar measures. The law takes effect in January and applies to hotels with 100 or more rooms. That includes all nine Atlantic City casinos. Iris Sanchez, a room cleaner at Caesars, says she’s relieved to know she’ll be going home safely each night after working. In 2018, a room cleaner at Bally’s casino was pushed into a room by a man who then sexually assaulted her.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nFarmington: Once a staple in the Four Corners region that connected Navajo weavers and artists to buyers, trading posts are facing challenges to their survival – increased competition from online retailers and large regional grocery store chains, as well as working to navigate changing demands. The Shiprock Trading Post in Farmington now focuses exclusively on Navajo rugs, jewelry, pottery and other works of art. It used to provide all sorts of goods to Navajo customers. Farmington Museum at Gateway Park director Bart Wilsey says trading posts that have survived into the 21st century have become art galleries that deal almost exclusively in Native art or become convenience stores. Wilsey says they also can become wholesalers for Navajo rugs and art in order to remain healthy.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A street in the city has been named for rapper Notorious B.I.G. Community members and elected officials gathered in a downpour Monday at the intersection of St. James Place and Fulton Street. Rapper Lil’ Kim – embracing the event’s themes of social justice and making a difference – exclaimed: “We did it, Brooklyn!” B.I.G., who was born Christopher Wallace, was shot to death in Los Angeles in 1997. He detailed street life in Brooklyn in songs and on albums that dominated the pop charts. Voletta Wallace recalled telling a friend amid her heartbreak: “My son was well loved.” But she said the street naming evoked “happy tears.” The new Christopher “Notorious B.I.G” Wallace Way is in Brooklyn’s Clinton Hill area.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state House is reconstituting an oversight committee that will keep monitoring challenges state government has had in distributing federal long-term housing grants to hurricane victims in eastern North Carolina. House Speaker Tim Moore announced Tuesday that the House Select Committee on Disaster Relief has been authorized to meet again. The panel met in 2018 and scrutinized why the state was slow giving out $237 million in federal community development grant funds received after Hurricane Matthew in 2016 for housing repairs. A report by the legislature’s government watchdog agency last month quantifying that slowness again led House Republicans from eastern North Carolina to seek the committee’s reauthorization. The agency issued a follow-up report Monday.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state’s congressional delegation is calling on President Donald Trump’s administration to address North Dakota’s year-old request for $38 million to cover the cost of policing protests against the Dakota Access oil pipeline. The Bismarck Tribune reports that U.S. Sens. John Hoeven and Kevin Cramer and U.S. Rep. Kelly Armstrong sent a letter Thursday urging Attorney General William Barr and Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan to settle the state’s claim. North Dakota’s attorney general filed a claim against the Army Corps of Engineers last year, accusing the agency of letting protesters illegally camp on federal land in North Dakota in 2016 and 2017. It also argued the Corps didn’t maintain law and order.\n\nOhio\n\nReynoldsburg: State officials plan to begin aerial treatments aimed at disrupting gypsy moth mating on more than 61,000 acres in 12 counties across the state. The gypsy moth is a non-native, invasive species that feeds on the leaves of more than 300 different trees and shrubs and can permanently damage or kill them. The Ohio Department of Agriculture release says the organic product used in the treatments set to begin June 12 slows the spread of the moths by confusing the males as they search for a female mate. It doesn’t kill the moths. Airplanes will apply the treatment from approximately 100 feet above treetops and buildings. Treatments are scheduled for parts of Allen, Franklin, Guernsey, Hancock, Hocking, Jackson, Licking, Morgan, Muskingum, Noble, Perry and Wyandot counties.\n\nOklahoma\n\nNorman: A judge is declining to approve the state’s proposed $85 million settlement with an opioid maker until he’s assured it complies with a new law targeting such deals. The attorney general’s office says Cleveland County Judge Thad Balkman on Monday ordered attorneys for both the state and Israeli-owned Teva Pharmaceuticals to file additional paperwork before he approves the settlement. Attorney General spokesman Alex Gerszewski says the judge wants both sides to address how distribution of the money conforms to the new law. Concerned about how the state’s $270 million settlement with Purdue Pharmaceuticals was structured, the Republican-led Legislature passed a law directing any settlement funds directly into the state treasury.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Four of the state’s public universities will defend substantial tuition increases this week in front of the Higher Education Coordinating Commission amid protests from frustrated students. The University of Oregon is proposing a 9.7% increase, the Oregon Institute of Technology seeks a 9% increase, Portland State University wants an 11% increase, and Southern Oregon University is looking at a 13.5% jump, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports. The commission must OK tuition hikes of more than 5%, and Portland State students have vowed to express their anger at a tuition hike approved by the school’s board at the commission meeting Thursday. Oregon State, as well as Eastern and Western Oregon universities, approved increases that are less than 5%.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nDenver: A hand-painted flag carried into battle by a black Union regiment during the Civil War is going up for auction. Morphy Auctions will sell off the piece of history Thursday. Pre-bidding is underway online. It’s one of 11 such flags painted by African American artist David Bustill Bowser, the son of a fugitive slave. It’s the only known surviving flag. The auction house says seven others are known only from photographs. They were sent to the military museum at West Point in 1906 but were thrown out in the 1940s. The flag up for auction depicts a black soldier waving goodbye to Columbia, the female personification of America, beneath a banner reading, “We Will Prove Ourselves Men.” The 127th Regimental banner is expected to fetch about $250,000.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Environmental officials are asking for the public’s help in tracking the state’s wild turkey population. The Department of Environmental Management is providing a form online that can be submitted when anyone sees a wild turkey, either an adult hen or a young turkey, known as poults. DEM believes the state’s wild turkey population is growing, based on the number of young turkeys reaching maturity and an increase in harvests reported during the spring hunting season that ended last month. The 2019 spring harvest was 270 birds, an increase of 42% from the 2018 season. DEM says the increase of 80 birds is likely due to an increase in the spring season bag limit from one to two birds. DEM receives hundreds of brood reports annually that assist biologists.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nFountain Inn: The owner of a miniature pony named Pikachu believes the animal was stolen from her South Carolina home. Hidden Pasture Farm owner Kate Nichols tells news outlets that the miniature palomino filly disappeared overnight last week. Nichols tells WAPT she has searched for the pony extensively, and there are also no signs that it was taken by a predator. Instead, Nichols thinks someone in the area is to blame. The station reports Pikachu was well-known in the community for making appearances at children’s parties dressed as a unicorn. Pikachu is 2 months old and weighs 60 pounds. Nichols posted on Facebook that she believes Pikachu is in danger and is offering a $1,000 reward for its return. She also wrote that “someone knows where she is.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: A man has scrapped plans to open a museum honoring recipients of the Congressional Medal of Honor. John L. Johnson of Rapid City had planned to open the museum Aug. 1 at the Rushmore Mall. But he told the Rapid City Journal last month that he has abandoned that plan after receiving threats. Instead, he says he plans to open an art gallery for Native American artists on that date in the same space planned for the museum. Johnson sparked controversy in an interview with the newspaper when he referred to efforts to rescind medals given to U.S. cavalry soldiers for the 1890 Wounded Knee Massacre. Johnson said many of those soldiers who went on to receive the medal acted heroically.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Jack White-led rockers The Raconteurs, multiple Grammy award-winning singer-songwriter Brandi Carlile and rap legends Wu-Tang Clan lead the lineup for the 2019 Mempho Music Festival. The third edition of the annual concert fest will take place Oct. 19-20 at Shelby Farms Park. The festival made its official lineup announcement Monday during a press event at the Sam Phillips Recording Studio. Organizers confirmed most of the nearly 20 acts who will appear at the two-day weekend fest, including Americana favorite Margo Price, West Tennessee native and roots songstress Valerie June, Memphis rap great DJ Paul, New Orleans rockers the Revivalists, and California pop combo lovelytheband.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A member of the iconic rap group the Geto Boys is hoping to trade beats and rhymes for politics. Scarface, whose real name is Brad Jordan, announced over the weekend that he plans to run for a Houston City Council seat. The Office of the City Secretary confirmed Monday that Jordan had filed paperwork naming his campaign treasurer. The 48-year-old Jordan first made his announcement on Instagram on Saturday, saying, “I’m offering myself for service as the next Houston City Councilmember for District D.” Jordan, who grew up in Houston, gained fame in the late 1980s with the Geto Boys before launching a successful solo career. The announcement comes after another Geto Boys member, Bushwick Bill, died Sunday of pancreatic cancer.\n\nUtah\n\nOgden: A Utah mom of two intersex children born two decades apart is rejecting the secrecy that often surrounds people born with both male and female traits. After Amie Schofield’s eldest child was injured in a violent attack, she and her husband became determined to speak out for 5-year-old Victory, who was born with ambiguous genitalia. Doctors have long performed surgery on intersex kids to make their bodies more like typical boys or girls, but families like the Schofields are refusing surgery and pushing for intersex kids to be accepted as they are born. Schofield says she’s like any other parent; she doesn’t want her daughter to think there’s anything wrong with her because she’s different.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Proponents of a bill that would have imposed a 24-hour waiting period to buy handguns say a veto Monday by the Republican governor was a political move that will cost the lives of people contemplating suicide and victims of domestic violence. Gov. Phil Scott’s veto also drew condemnation from Democratic leaders of the Vermont House and Senate, which both passed legislation last month that contained the waiting period and a change to an unintended consequence of separate gun legislation signed into law by the governor last year. While gun rights activists said they appreciate Scott’s veto, they are still upset by a series of gun control measures signed by the governor last year. Proponents say the legislation would have helped save lives of people considering taking their own lives because they won’t be able to get firearms as quickly. It was also hoped it would prevent homicides.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The state’s tourism industry generated $26 billion in visitor spending across all communities in 2018, a 4.4% increase over 2017. Gov. Ralph Northam announced Monday that the tourism industry also provided $1.8 billion in state and local revenue in 2018. That’s an increase of 2.9% compared to the previous year. The slogan “Virginia is for Lovers” was developed in 1969 by Richmond-based advertising firm Martin & Woltz, now the Martin Agency. It is the longest-running state tourism slogan in the country. Destinations around the state are participating in the commemoration of “50 Years of LOVE” and celebrating the impact tourism has on Virginia’s economy and communities. The travel industry is the fifth-largest employer in Virginia.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The City Council has approved a long-delayed plan to redevelop unused Army land next to Discovery Park into about 240 affordable homes and open spaces. The Seattle Times reports the $90 million plan was updated by Mayor Jenny Durkan in February and approved Monday. It calls for the 34-acre Fort Lawton property in the Magnolia neighborhood to be replaced by 85 studio apartments for formerly homeless seniors, 100 rentals for low-income individuals and families, and up to 52 affordable homes for sale. The city would also convert land into two athletic fields, make 13 grassy acres available for picnicking and incorporate several more wooded acres into Discovery Park. Nonprofits including the United Indians of All Tribes Foundation, Catholic Community Services and Habitat for Humanity would build the housing using city, state and federal funding.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nGlen Jean: New River Gorge National River has several projects planned this summer to improve the area for visitors. The projects include replacing the Sandstone Falls boardwalk and the boardwalk at Brooks Falls, replacing roofs at the Canyon Rim Visitor Center and the Thurmond Depot Visitor Center, upgrading the Army Camp Campground, and adding two new parking areas. New River Gorge Superintendent Lizzie Watts told the Charleston Gazette-Mail that work on the Sandstone Falls boardwalk is expected to last all summer, but the park will try to keep it open on weekends. Goats will also return to the park this summer to remove kudzu and other brush and weeds from the Thurmond area.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The popular China Lights festival will return to Boerner Botanical Gardens from Sept.13 through Oct.20, according to a press release from County Executive Chris Abele. This will be the fourth year in Milwaukee for the colorful China Lights at the gardens. The festival drew more than 100,000 visitors each of the past three years. This year’s event promises new cultural gems re-created as handmade lantern displays ranging from 3 feet to three stories tall. The 2019 China Lights festival also will include an expanded interactive exhibit area, two stages for Asian folk-culture performances, a marketplace, two dining areas, and vendors offering a variety of Asian and Western menu options. More information is available online.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: Overcrowding is a concern among members of the task force working on a plan to build $300 million worth of new student dormitories at the University of Wyoming. The Laramie Boomerang reports that UW Vice President for Student Affairs Sean Blackburn says large dorms only make the transition to college more difficult for freshmen coming from rural areas of the state. He noted that White Hall has a comparable population to the town of Big Piney. Blackburn is pushing for an approach with the new dorms that will create a “sense of place,” something he says Wyoming students have a particular affinity for. Blackburn is asking for freshmen to be housed in “small-scale communities of 20 to 30 aggregated into a larger building.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/02/11/cold-case-cards-firework-record-monkey-treatment-news-around-states/41214017/", "title": "Cold case cards, firework record: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: The state’s oyster harvest is back underway near Dauphin Island after a shutdown prompted by high water levels. The state conservation agency said in a news release that boats resumed harvesting oysters by the sackful last week. Reefs are more productive than expected, and young oysters are being left undisturbed for next year, said Scott Bannon, director of the Marine Resources Division. Boats had gathered about 9,500 sacks of oysters before health officials closed the season in late December as a precaution to prevent bacterial contamination from high water levels. “The 9,500 sacks harvested in this season to date has been good,” Bannon said. “That was more than the last five years combined. I feel like we’re turning a corner.” Elevated water levels last year resulted in a shutdown of oyster production across much of the northern Gulf Coast.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A hotel chain plans to begin construction in May of a $60 million, aviation-themed hotel, officials say. The 13-story building downtown will be the first major hotel construction in the city since the Anchorage Marriott Downtown was built in 1998, The Anchorage Daily News reports. The project by national chain Hotel Indigo is expected to be completed in mid- to late 2021. The building site is a short walk from the Alaska Center for the Performing Arts and the Denaina Civic and Convention Center. Rooms will be pre-built in China and shipped by barge to Anchorage to speed up construction, project officials say. The pre-constructed rooms will include furniture, art, plumbing, and electrical and heating features, says Monica Sullivan, one of the building’s designers. The building will also feature 32 one- and two-bedroom apartments, also to be constructed in China.\n\nArizona\n\nFlagstaff: An agreement to drop a lawsuit over federal oil and gas leases in eastern Arizona won’t do much to stop companies from exploring for helium in the region. The two companies that won the U.S. Bureau of Land Management leases already have access to other plots of state and private land nearby where they plan to drill that aren’t covered by the lawsuit. The bureau approved the trio of leases last September in Navajo and Apache counties. The agency later suspended them, citing a lawsuit by environmentalists that accused the agency of failing to adequately analyze the potential impact on local communities, public lands, animals and water resources. The oil and gas industry’s renewed interest in helium is driven by a shortage in the light, versatile gas used for balloons as well as in aerospace, electronics and the medical field.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The city’s schools shut down for two days starting Monday after hundreds of staff members called in sick, though the local teachers’ union hinted the absences are tied to ongoing complaints about the state’s control of the district. The Little Rock School District announced late Sunday afternoon it had canceled classes for the first two days of the week after more than 250 staff members called in sick. The 23,000-student district said the number of absences nearly doubled from recorded absences the previous week. The decision comes after other Arkansas school districts closed because of the flu. Little Rock last week closed two elementary schools for two days because of a large number of sick students. Flu activity has been high in Arkansas, and the state Department of Health says at least 36 people have died from the flu this season.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSouth Lake Tahoe: A gust of 209 mph was recorded atop a peak Sunday, a potential state record that wowed forecasters monitoring a cold storm that moved south through California dumping snow, rain and hail. The blast of wind was captured about 7:45 a.m. by an instrument at 9,186 feet on Kirkwood Mountain south of Lake Tahoe, said National Weather Service forecaster Alex Hoon. He and his colleagues at the NWS office in Reno, Nevada, watched in surprise as wind speeds across the crest of the Sierra Nevada hit 150 mph and kept rising. “It went up and up,” Hoon said. It could take months for state climatologists to verify the record, he said. “But the way that the winds did ramp up, it looks legitimate,” Hoon said. “It’s an exciting moment for sure.” The previous record was a gust of 199 mph at Ward Mountain west of Lake Tahoe on Nov. 16, 2017.\n\nColorado\n\nSteamboat Springs: A massive firework launched over the ski resort town has set a record for the world’s largest aerial firework. The 2,800-pound shell flew 2,200 feet above the Steamboat Springs Winter Carnival before it burst, turning the sky bright red and drawing gasps from the crowd, The Steamboat Pilot & Today reports. Tim Borden of Steamboat Springs headed the team that developed the firework over seven years. Borden first attempted to set the world record last year but failed when the shell exploded inside the mortar without lifting off the ground, the newspaper reports. Guinness World Records representatives witnessed both attempts. Christina Conlon of Guinness says she verified the shell launched Saturday was the world’s largest. The firework was 400 pounds heaver than the previous record-holder, a 2,397-pound explosive launched in the United Arab Emirates in 2018.\n\nConnecticut\n\nMiddletown: Politicians called for action to make workplaces safer as they gathered Sunday to mark the 10th anniversary of a deadly explosion at a natural gas plant. The memorial service was held near the Kleen Energy Systems plant in Middletown to honor the six lives lost in the Feb. 7, 2010, explosion. U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal told the crowd that those killed “didn’t give their lives. Their lives were taken from them as a result of a workplace that was unsafe,” The Hartford Courant reports. “We can grieve the dead, but we need to fight like hell for the living,” Blumenthal said. Politicians were joined at the remembrance event by labor union members and family members of those who were killed in the explosion, which occurred during construction of the plant. Authorities said crews were using natural gas at a high pressure to clean out pipes, and something sparked an explosion.\n\nDelaware\n\nDewey Beach: A young gray seal pup was rescued by volunteers Saturday after it was found injured on the beach near the Lifesaving Station south of Dewey Beach. The Lewes-based Marine Education Research and Rehabilitation Institute was called Saturday afternoon to help the pup, which was found with serious wounds around its neck. Suzanne Thurman, executive director of MERR, said in a Facebook post that the seal still had the soft, baby fur called “lanugo” on it, indicating that it was extremely young. Seals tend to shed that fur at about 3 or 4 weeks old. Eight MERR volunteers helped in the rescue of the seal, crating it and transporting it to a local rehabilitation facility. Seal sightings used to be rather rare in Delaware, but the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says they’ve become a rather common occurrence over the past decade.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A man was taken into custody after a barricade situation that affected traffic and forced two schools to be placed on lockdown, WUSA-TV reports. Police say the barricade started about 7:45 a.m. Monday after police tried to execute a search warrant in the area. It ended shortly before 11:30 a.m., officials say. There was no indication anyone else was with the man, police say. Traffic was affected for several hours, and the situation prompted a lockdown for several hours at MacFarland Middle School and Theodore Roosevelt High School, police say.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Augustine Beach: The city is looking to amend its code to allow for emotional support animal requests, allowing the family of a 9-year-old boy with disabilities to keep his eight chickens at their residence. The need arose after Jennifer Wildasin requested a variance hearing in front of the Planning and Zoning Board to allow her to keep chickens for her son, who has a traumatic brain injury. City code prohibits the keeping of bees, insects, reptiles, pigs, horses, cattle, goats, hogs or poultry. At the PZB meeting in November, the board discussed how a variance was not the appropriate route to allow for the exception to city code. The board voted unanimously to deny the variance but approve the request, allowing Wildasin to keep the chickens. But a neighbor of the family appealed the board’s decision, bringing the case in front of the City Commission last week.\n\nGeorgia\n\nFort Benning: The state’s two U.S. senators are urging military leaders to choose Fort Benning for the Army’s fourth corps headquarters. Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler called the busy Army post outside Columbus an excellent location for its “unmatched training, support and command facilities.” They also noted Fort Benning’s ability to rapidly send troops overseas with an Army airfield on post and Atlanta’s busy civilian airport about a 90-minute drive away. “Fort Benning is a crown jewel of the Army uniquely qualified to host the new corps headquarters,” the senators’ letter said. The Army recently announced Fort Benning is among three finalists to house the new corps headquarters, which will be led by a three-star general and oversee various Army divisions. The other finalists are Fort Drum, New York, and Fort Knox, Kentucky.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: Two bills introduced to the state Senate seek harsher penalties for parents, spectators and athletes who assault or terrorize sports officials such as referees, umpires and coaches. They would expand the state’s second-degree assault law to include causing injury because of a sports official’s performance at events, The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports. Second-degree assault is punishable by up to five years’ imprisonment. The bill would establish the offenses of first-, second- and third-degree assault of a sports official, as well as terroristic threatening against a sports official. First-degree assault against a sports official would be punishable by up to 10 years’ imprisonment. Second-degree assault against a sports official and the terroristic threatening charge would carry potential five-year prison terms. Third-degree assault against a sports official would be a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state’s residents are buying less beer and more liquor, according to the state Liquor Division. Director Jeff Anderson told the Legislature’s budget-writing committee on Friday that the Liquor Division returned a record dividend of more than $83 million in fiscal year 2019, the Idaho Press reports. That’s about $6.8 million more than the previous year. Idaho residents’ purchases mirror a national trend, Anderson said, with consumption of spirits increasing at the expense of beer. But Idahoans still consume less liquor overall compared to national averages. “Responsible stewardship, low outlet density and limited by convenient hours of operation again led to per-capita consumption of spirits that remains well below national averages,” Anderson said.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: State officials are allowing medical marijuana businesses to stay open later amid complaints that users have been at a disadvantage since a new state law allowing recreational sales took effect this year. The department also reminded retailers to prioritize medical cannabis patients during product shortages in a separate statement released last week. Problems due to limited supply have been widespread, leading some dispensaries to limit the amount of product people can purchase and to cut back on their business hours. The law broadly permitting adults to purchase and use marijuana products took effect Jan. 1. The statement said dispensaries can’t designate products only for recreational customers to purchase. It also said retailers limiting the amount of marijuana that customers can purchase should use higher caps for medical marijuana customers than for recreational.\n\nIndiana\n\nEvansville: An experimental stem cell treatment appears to be helping a monkey at the Mesker Park Zoo & Botanic Garden heal from spinal arthritis. After two of the cutting-edge treatments, K.J., a 17-year-old male colobus monkey, is showing considerable improvements, says Dr. Carrie Ullmer, staff veterinarian at the zoo. “We are seeing him doing several things he hasn’t been able to do for months,” she says. K.J. came to live at the zoo in August 2019. But by the fall, he was starting to have trouble moving around. Testing revealed age-related spinal arthritis was causing weakness in K.J.’s hind legs, Ullmer says, and CT scans showed he also had some bulging or ruptured intervertebral discs, conditions more often seen in humans. She says the stem cells were grown from a small piece of fat tissue taken from another colobus monkey at Mesker Park Zoo who was already scheduled for a routine surgery.\n\nIowa\n\nClive: A former governor and U.S. agriculture secretary claimed a $150,000 Powerball prize Monday. Tom Vilsack picked up his winnings at the Iowa Lottery’s headquarters in Clive. His ticket matched the Jan. 22 Powerball number and four of the remaining five numbers. He just missed out on the estimated $347 million jackpot. “Occasionally, when the Powerball gets above $250 million, I think, ‘What the heck?’ You know, you can dream, like everybody else,” he told lottery officials. He’d bought the ticket at a grocery store in Waukee, the Des Moines suburb where he and his wife live, then forgot about it for several days. “Then I woke up 10 days later on a Saturday morning, and I said, ‘Oh, geez, I wonder how I did?’ ” Before serving in the Obama administration, Vilsack was a two-term governor of Iowa, a state senator and the mayor of Mount Pleasant. He is president and CEO of the U.S. Dairy Export Council. His church will share some of his winnings, he said.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: The city is considering banning plastic bags or implementing a citywide tax to curb their use, officials say. The City Council voted unanimously last week to form a task force to consider how to reduce or eliminate single-use plastic bags in Wichita, noting how they’re difficult to recycle and are not biodegradable. Several other cities in the U.S. have either banned or taxed plastic bags in recent years. San Francisco and Portland have banned plastic bags entirely. Denver imposed a 10-cent tax per bag, while Chicago has a 7-cent bag tax. Of Kansas’ neighboring states, only Colorado has plastic bag ordinances. Wichita would be the first city in Kansas to ban or tax the use of plastic bags, The Wichita Eagle reports. City Council member Brandon Johnson said he was surprised by how many people and business support a ban.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: For the first time in the state’s 228-year history, a life-size statue of a woman will be displayed in the Capitol this summer. The nearly 7-foot bronze statue will be that of Nettie Depp of Barren County, a pioneer in Kentucky education in the early 1900s. She became an elected school superintendent in 1913, seven years before women got the right to vote. The sculptor, Amanda Matthews, of PROMETHEUS Foundry in Lexington, told the state Historic Properties Advisory Commission that Depp’s statue is “a proxy for all women who have contributed large or small to Kentucky.” Matthews says her only request is that the large statue be “physically carried” into the Capitol a few days before its Aug. 22 unveiling by women in the military and emergency units. It weighs about 400 pounds. Depp is a great-great-aunt of Matthews and actor Johnny Depp.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The city’s main shelter for homeless men is planning a move to a new home. Since 1955, the Ozanam Inn has been in its current building in an area that was once considered run-down. Now, it’s a part of the city where development of hotels and apartments is booming. The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports that the building’s owners – the Society of St. Vincent de Paul – sold it in November. The plan is for Ozanam Inn to move into an old medical building not far from the Superdome in an area largely occupied by light industrial workshops and warehouses. Clarence Adams, Ozanam Inn’s chief executive, said the plan is to move later this year after renovation work is completed on the new building. The Ozanam Inn provides meals and accommodations for hundreds of homeless men, as well as feeding and providing Salvation Army vouchers to homeless women, children and families.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A legislative committee has approved a proposal designed to help rural hospitals in the state hire more emergency medical technicians. The bill clarifies state law to allow the EMTs to practice within the scope of their training under the employment of a hospital, supporters said in a statement. The Legislature’s Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services Committee unanimously approved the proposal, made on behalf of Cary Medical Center in Caribou in northern Maine, last week. The bill’s sponsor, Democratic Senate President Troy Jackson, said the change will help fill gaps in the state’s health care worker shortage. Some hospitals in Maine are hoping to hire EMTs and paramedics to address the workforce shortage. The proposal will now head to the full Legislature for a vote.\n\nMaryland\n\nFrederick: School officials are investigating after a Nazi flag was pictured hanging in a classroom window over the weekend. Witnesses saw the flag while attending a basketball game at Governor Thomas Johnson High School in Frederick, and photos of it quickly spread online, news outlets report. The Nazi flag was used in a World War II history class and left hanging in the window, visible to the outside, Frederick County Public Schools Superintendent Theresa R. Alban said in a statement obtained by news outlets. Alban said officials would “take appropriate action” to figure out what led up to the flag being hung there. “The flag was removed as soon as our administrators were made aware. An apology was sent to the community,” Alban told WTTG-TV. “This does not reflect the values of our school system.” Principal Daniel Lippy said in an email to the school community that the administration has taken steps “to ensure that this never occurs again.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: There’s a silver lining to the Boston Symphony Orchestra’s coronavirus-induced cancellation of its Asia tour: free pop-up concerts back home. The acclaimed orchestra will throw open the doors to Symphony Hall free of charge Sunday for an impromptu performance dubbed “Concert for Our City.” It’s also planning a number of concerts at schools, homeless shelters and hospitals that won’t be open to the public. The orchestra had been scheduled to go on a four-city tour that included Seoul in South Korea, Taipei in Taiwan, and Shanghai and Hong Kong in China from Feb. 6 to 16. But last week, it backed out amid concerns about the deadly virus in China. The Asia trip was to be the orchestra’s first visit to Seoul since its founding in 1881. Sunday’s concert will include selections by Brahms, Dvorak, Tchaikovsky, Ginastera and George Walker, and it will feature Chinese composer Huang Ruo as vocal soloist in selections from his own “Folksongs for Orchestra.”\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The city has opened enrollment for an annual summer employment program for young people ages 14-24. The sign-up period for Grow Detroit’s Young Talent runs to May 1. About 8,000 youth are expected to be hired. Employers also are being sought. More than 8,200 Detroit youth were employed at 548 work sites last year. Organizations and companies can sponsor six-week paid work experiences for $1,800 per youth. Youth also can be hired through existing employment opportunities or summer employment programs already operating. Financial contributions to the program also are accepted. “Having a summer job is about so much more than just earning money,” Mayor Mike Duggan said. “Grow Detroit’s Young Talent is changing lives. One day, hundreds of future leaders will look back at their time with GDYT as the experience that set them on their path to success.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Thousand of janitors and security guards who work at Twin Cities retail stores and office buildings have authorized a strike if the two sides cannot reach an agreement. Members of the Service Employees International Union voted Saturday to authorize a walkout. The vote does not mean a strike is certain. The two sides continue to negotiate. SEIU Local 26 President Iris Altamirano told Minnesota Public Radio News that sick time is a key issue and that negotiators also remain far apart on wages. Attorney John Nesse, who represents the cleaning contractors, said they’re disappointed with the vote. “We have been meeting with the union since November,” Nesse said. “They have over 100 proposed changes to the contract that remain open at this point. We do expect to make significant progress in the near future.” More bargaining sessions are scheduled in the next two weeks, Nesse said.\n\nMississippi\n\nBiloxi: A contractor is threatening to stop work on a Mississippi Margaritaville Amusement Park, alleging developers haven’t paid in months, amassing $5 million in outstanding bills, according to a federal lawsuit. The Tindall Corp. is building a parking garage and a platform for rides at the Biloxi amusement park set to open in 2021, The Sun Herald reports. The company filed its lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Gulfport against Biloxi Lodging LLC, owner of Margaritaville, and the Stewart Family Trust, saying the companies stopped paying in July for work that was still being performed, the newspaper says. Margaritaville developers responded that the dispute is over how much work has been completed by Tindall, and they are in negotiations to resolve the issue. The $140 million project, an expansion of the existing site, is set to include a second hotel tower and an elevated amusement park to go with a current arcade, pool and indoor playground.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: State agriculture officials are asking for funding to hire more staff to address a backlog of nearly 600 complaints from farmers who claim dicamba-based herbicide drift has damaged their crops. The Missouri Department of Agriculture last week asked state lawmakers for money to hire four investigators and two staff members to review the cases, some of which date back to 2016, St. Louis Public Radio reports. “We had a team that was the right size for an average year of around 100 complaints, and the number of (dicamba complaints) coming in has been the No. 1 complicating factor,” said Sami Jo Freeman, the agriculture department’s spokeswoman. Farmers across the country have complained that dicamba drifts from other fields and damages their crops, particularly soybeans. In Missouri, most of the damage has been in southeastern counties.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: U.S. Forest Service officials have given conditional approval to a Canadian company to conduct exploratory drilling at 35 sites in Montana’s Beartooth Mountains. Vancouver-based Group Ten received authorization for the work over the next seven summers, pending acquisition of a reclamation bond, The Billings Gazette reports. The sites are outside Nye along the Beartooth Front, where the company acquired 282 mining claims. The company is working to determine the quantity and quality of precious metals in the area, including platinum, palladium, gold, nickel, copper and cobalt. Group Ten aims to assess the ore body and sell the development rights to another firm.\n\nNebraska\n\nGretna: The state’s bird lovers are being invited to the Great Backyard Bird Count event Saturday at the Schramm Education Center south of Gretna. Participants will join people across the nation in counting birds and submitting checklists to be used by researchers at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the National Audubon Society. The 9-11 a.m. and 12:30-2:30 p.m. sessions include instruction on bird identification basics, a feeder watch count and a guided bird hike count. Families may stay and count birds for as much time as they wish. A limited number of binoculars will be available. Registration is not required but recommended. Register by calling 402-332-5022, emailing amber.schiltz@nebraska.gov, or signing up at the Great Backyard Bird Count on the Schramm Facebook page.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Conservationists at Lake Tahoe have agreed to drop a lawsuit challenging plans to build a 2.2-mile gondola connecting two ski resorts in exchange for neighboring land purchases and other wildlife protection measures. The resorts, including one that hosted the 1960 Winter Olympics, and a wilderness protection group finalized the agreement last week as part of the U.S. Forest Service’s final approval of the gondola that will skirt federally protected wilderness that is home to an endangered frog. As part of the settlement with the Granite Chief Wilderness Protection League, Squaw Valley/Alpine Meadows agreed to permanently protect 27 acres of habitat for the Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog and contribute about $500,000 over the next decade toward land purchases and other protection efforts. It also prohibits any road construction within the Tahoe National Forest’s neighboring Granite Chief Wilderness Area and dictates the gondola will operate only during the winter.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: An annual event celebrating things that grow in the state is adding the word “Garden” to its title. Now in its 37th year, the New Hampshire Farm, Forest and Garden Expo is scheduled for Friday and Saturday at the DoubleTree by Hilton in Manchester. “We found that some people mistakenly think that you need livestock to be a farmer or acres of trees to own a forest,” said A.J. Dupere, chair of the expo and urban forester at the New Hampshire Division of Forests and Lands. “Adding ‘Garden’ to the name of the event more accurately explains what our attendees are interested in, as well as the focus of the expo’s exhibits and programming.” Three divisions from the state Department of Natural and Cultural Resources are participating at this year’s expo: the Division of Forests and Lands, the Division of Historical Resources and the Division of Parks and Recreation.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state’s new law requiring public schools to teach about the contributions of LGBTQ individuals doesn’t take effect until this fall, but a backlash is already brewing, with religious groups leading the opposition. From Jersey City to Paterson to Little Egg Harbor, clergy and parents are citing their faith in resisting the measure, which mandates that schools teach about social, economic and political contributions of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals. “By implementing this curriculum, you are breaking the First Amendment as it will be forced upon our children to learn something that is against our values, our freedom and our faith,” said the Rev. Thomas Nashed, of the St. George and St. Shenouda Church, at a Jersey City school board meeting last month packed with Coptic Christian and Muslim parents opposing the law.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: A spray-painting vandal has hit the headquarters of the New Mexico Republican Party. Surveillance video shows a man tagging the Albuquerque headquarters about 2:30 a.m. Saturday before fleeing in an SUV. Officials discovered Monday that the vandal had painted the words “still traitors” in front of the building. New Mexico Republican Party Chairman Steve Pearce said the headquarters has been struck a number of times in recent months, and the party has installed cameras. “I don’t think it’s an organized effort by any party,” Pearce said. “But it has no place here.” He said footage of the vandalism, which shows the man’s face, has been handed over the Albuquerque police. No arrests have been made. Democratic Party of New Mexico spokesperson Miranda van Dijk denounced the vandalism and called it sad.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The city is considering using traffic-camera violations to curb reckless driving by requiring frequent violators to attend a safety course. The City Council will vote this week on legislation that would require drivers with five red-light camera tickets or 15 speed-camera tickets in a year to complete the safety course or risk having their vehicle impounded, The New York Times reports. “The folks that this program will target are the worst offenders, they are the people that continue to continue to speed, speed, speed, violate, violate, violate,” said Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker and a proponent of the bill. The city has red-light cameras at 150 intersections along with more than 600 speed cameras and plans to add 2,000 speed cameras by 2021, according to the publication. The National Motorists Association advocacy group says traffic cameras are unconstitutional.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nOcracoke: More than 9,000 dump truck loads of debris have been hauled away from an island battered by Hurricane Dorian five months ago, according to numbers released last week. All of the lingering storm debris is set to be cleared from Ocracoke Island by the end of February, Hyde County emergency management director Justin Gibbs told The Virginian-Pilot. Crews have already disposed of about 6,650 tons of waste, including thousands of damaged trees, parts of hundreds of ruined homes, and even household appliances like refrigerators and washing machines, Gibbs said. The September storm inundated the Outer Banks island with waters surging to a record 7 feet in some places, according to news outlets. The storm heavily damaged homes, businesses and other infrastructure, and the recovery effort has been ongoing.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state’s Pardon Advisory Board is seeking more applicants under its new policy wiping criminal records clean for people with low-level marijuana convictions. Republican Gov. Doug Burgum pardoned 16 qualified offenders in January under the marijuana policy adopted last year. People can petition to have their records expunged if they avoid unlawful behavior for five years. The pardons erase the convictions altogether, and records are shielded from public view. In the first two rounds of applications, 26 people applied. State Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem listed a few reasons for why the number is so low: Word has not traveled far enough, some offenses took place so long ago that people might not care to apply, and some people may have not encountered barriers to housing or employment because of their convictions. Stenehjem estimated that as many as 175,000 cases, dating back decades, could be eligible.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: An organization that distributes playing cards featuring homicide victims and descriptions of where their murders occurred to try to help solve the crimes unveiled two new decks Sunday. The new Cold Case Playing Cards decks were unveiled at a news conference at the Hamilton County Justice Center in Cincinnati. Members of the advocacy group UCanSpeakForMe said they are placed in Ohio prisons, jails and other lockup facilities as crime-fighting tools. The group’s CEO, Hope Dudley, said she hopes they will spark conversations among inmates and encourage people to come forward with tips to help law enforcement solve the cases. The cards feature photos and information on homicide victims from Hamilton, Butler and Montgomery counties in southwest Ohio.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt has commuted the sentences of 147 people imprisoned for simple drug possession charges that would not be felonies if brought today. The Republican governor signed papers Friday to commute the sentences of 119 people to time served and another 28 sentences to one year, The Oklahoman reports. Steven Bickley, executive director of the state Pardon and Parole Board, told the paper that most people in the first group will be released Thursday. Those in the second are set to be let out as they finish their sentences over the next several months, he said. The commutations are the latest under a 2019 law that retroactively applied misdemeanor sentences for simple drug possession and low-level property crimes that state voters approved in 2016. Last year, more than 450 people walked out the doors of prisons across Oklahoma in the largest single-day mass commutation in U.S. history.\n\nOregon\n\nAstoria: The Port of Astoria has secured the state’s conditional approval for a plan that would provide more than $20 million to fix sinking docks that are critical to the seafood industry. The strategic business plan must be approved by the state before Business Oregon will offer any more financing. The Astorian reports. Business Oregon has already provided nearly $20 million since 2001 and backed several large infrastructure grants. Seafood processors at the port employ hundreds of workers each summer, but critical repairs are needed. The warehouses are slowly sinking because of a failing seawall where fishermen deliver their catch, and a causeway substructure is so rotten it’s been closed to all traffic. The port spends more than any other similar agency on dredging to remove sediment flowing down the Columbia River and filling up slips and marinas. It could also face millions to clean up petroleum contamination along the central waterfront.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nScranton: Current and former employees of the city’s school district claimed in a lawsuit filed Monday that officials knew for years that unsafe levels of lead and asbestos posed potential health risks for students and staff but never disclosed the information to them or the public. The plaintiffs are asking for a medical monitoring program for current and former Scranton school district students and staffers, as well as undisclosed damages. They are also seeking class-action status. The lead plaintiffs are an elementary school principal, a reading specialist and a retired maintenance worker. In the suit, they allege the district received test results from environmental studies, starting in at least 2016, that made officials aware of the issues, but they never informed students, parents, and staffers until last month. District officials have announced high lead levels at 38 sinks and water fountains in several schools.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: More than 1,200 residents who were victims of violent crimes received financial assistance from a program in the state treasurer’s office in 2019. The beneficiaries of the program last year, including about 200 children, received more than $1 million in total financial assistance from the Crime Victim Compensation Program, managed by the office of Treasurer Seth Magaziner. “The toll of being a victim of violent crime is high enough without the victims having to endure financial costs to overcome the challenges they face,” Magaziner said in a statement last week. According to his office, there were 42 victims of domestic violence among those who received assistance from the program in 2019, and they received emergency relocation funding to immediately escape unsafe, life-threatening living situations. The program also paid for mental health counseling for 36 minors who witnessed acts of domestic violence or homicide.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A state lawmaker who once had his passenger window shattered by a piece of metal thrown up by a roadside lawn mower is pushing a bill to require contractors to clean up trash before they mow near highways. Rep. Richie Yow’s bill would also require contractors to make sure the highway is clear of grass and other debris after the workers finish mowing, The Post and Courier of Charleston reports. The Chesterfield Republican was driving on a rural highway in his district when the metal was flung onto his window. “If the window would’ve been down, it could’ve been dangerous,” Yow said at a subcommittee hearing on the bill last week. And the aftermath of mowing can be dangerous too. Columbia attorney Chad Fuller said he is representing a Horry County motorcyclist whose medical expenses have topped $400,000 after breaking his leg in four places after wrecking his bike on a clump of mowed grass in the road.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Legislation aimed at stopping physicians from providing puberty blockers and gender confirmation surgery to transgender children under 16 failed to get enough support Monday in a state Senate committee. A Republican-dominated Senate committee voted 5-2 to kill the proposal, likely ensuring the issue won’t be considered by the Legislature again this year. Proponents already had amended the bill to get rid of criminal charges for doctors who provide gender confirmation treatments, including puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgery. But it would have allowed children to sue if they later regretted the treatments. LGBT advocates and Democrats argued that the proposal would have stopped children with gender dysphoria from receiving medically necessary health care that improves their mental health. They demonstrated outside the Capitol before Monday’s Senate Health and Human Services Committee meeting. Quinncy Parke, a 17-year-old transgender teenager, testified before the committee and had one word to describe the feeling of seeing the bill die: “ecstatic.” “It’s gone,” Parke said. “I don’t have to worry about it until next year.”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Authorities say they busted a well-organized burglar after he allegedly dropped a notebook during a break-in that contained a list of other places he planned to target. Robert Shull Goddard, 49, is accused of smashing a glass door and breaking into a Nashville-area home Jan. 29, stealing a TV and a gun from the residents, according to records filed in Davidson County court. But prosecutors said Goddard left something behind that allowed authorities to solve the case – a notebook that listed multiple addresses, including one for another home a few miles away that had been burglarized that same day. Investigators were able to identify the suspect, in part, through notes his daughter left in the journal, along with her address. Goddard was caught on video kicking in the back door of another house the next day, court records state.\n\nTexas\n\nArlington: Police say a 16-year-old boy was fatally shot by another teen who the victim had stopped from bullying another boy a few days earlier. Police Officer Christopher Cook told reporters Friday that Samuel Reynolds had said that “he started having some trouble with the suspect” in the days after stopping the suspect from bullying a smaller boy. During a Friday night vigil for Reynolds outside Arlington High School, student Russell Laniyan said Reynolds once gave him shoes during a soccer game so he could play while Reynolds sat out. “I think this just encourages us to go out and to be like Sam and to follow the example that Sam has set for us,” Laniyan said during the vigil. Cook said the shooting was captured on security video, and a .40-caliber shell casing was found at the scene, but the weapon has not been located. Police said the suspect is being held in a juvenile detention center on a pending murder charge.\n\nUtah\n\nProvo: Mothers are challenging a ban on children and breastfeeding at Brigham Young University’s annual Women’s Conference, and they are asking The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to change the rule. School officials say kids and babies are not allowed at the event at the Marriott Center at BYU, an arena that doesn’t ban children under 16 for any other event, according to The Salt Lake Tribune. The two-day conference begins April 30 and is considered the largest gathering of Latter-day Saints women. Topics include sisterhood, marriage and the gospel around family. “It’s just really bizarre that at a conference about family and womanhood that they wouldn’t allow nursing children to be there,” said Nataly Wixom-Burdick, a member of the church and mother of an 11-month-old. It’s unclear when the policy was implemented.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The youngest member of the Vermont State Police bow-wowed people at the Statehouse on Friday. Loki, the 10-week-old Plott Hound puppy, handler Detective Christian Hunt and top police officials visited the Statehouse in Montpelier, where the dog licked faces and warmed hearts. Loki is set to begin 15 weeks of training to serve as a state police tracking dog. The state police organized the Statehouse visit after the big-eared puppy was introduced to the public last week, and people considered going to the extreme to meet her. Due to the deteriorating weather conditions, a second public appearance scheduled for Friday afternoon at the state police barracks in Williston was postponed until Tuesday.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A conservative state lawmaker, irked that Democrats might mess with Virginia’s Confederate monuments, filed a bill that boiled down to a dare: If you want to take down statues, start with one of your own, The Washington Post reports. But legislators across the aisle have embraced that proposal, prompting Del. Wendell S. Walker, R-Lynchburg, to try to kill his own bill. House Bill 1305 calls for ridding Richmond’s Capitol Square of a 10-foot statue of Harry Flood Byrd, a former Democratic governor, U.S. senator and kingmaker who was also a renowned segregationist. “It’s kind of like playing chess,” said Walker, who hoped the bill would make Democrats think twice about removing any statues. “You’re just calling somebody’s bluff.” Turns out, some Democrats are calling his instead, saying Walker’s bill is a great idea and moving to keep his legislation alive, despite his newfound desire to back down.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: Democratic state lawmakers are pushing to create an office on firearm-violence prevention in order to improve data sources, collection methods and sharing mechanisms statewide. The Seattle Times reports Senate Bill 6288 would also help fund local evidence-based violence-reduction initiatives. The measure passed its committee vote in January and is currently in the Senate Ways & Means Committee. King County is home to many of these initiatives, which work with community partners to intervene in the lives of young people who may be headed toward violence or crime. Proponents of the bill say it would allow communities to decide how best to address their unique experience with gun violence. For example, some rural communities may face more gun-related suicides than interpersonal violence. But some Republicans say the bill is a partisan push for gun control.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state was awarded more than $22 million in federal funding to clean up and repurpose abandoned coal mines in fiscal year 2020. Interior Secretary David Bernhardt announced the grants from the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement last week. The agency provides grants to the 25 coal-producing states and three tribes based on past and current coal production, the Interior Department said in a news release. The grants are funded in part by a fee collected on all coal produced in the U.S., the agency said. The funds have helped close more than 45,000 abandoned underground mine shafts and openings, eliminate over 960 miles of dangerous highwalls, and restore over 850,000 acres of clogged streams and land, the release said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Farmers in the state would receive up to a $7,500 tax break this year under a bill that’s part of a fast-moving package of proposals Assembly Republicans unveiled Monday to dovetail with Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ special session call to help the struggling agriculture industry. It’s unclear whether the measures will have enough support to pass the Senate or be signed by Evers. The governor is reviewing the proposals and glad that lawmakers are working on efforts to help rural Wisconsin, said Evers’ spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff. Republicans touted their package of five new bills building off what the governor proposed as being “bigger and bolder” than the Evers plan but did not have a total cost estimate. The Evers proposals would cost $8.5 million over two years but did not include a pair of tax breaks Republicans are seeking.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: University of Wyoming trustees will now be able to revoke honorary degrees. Reasons for revocation include conduct that is inconsistent with the university’s mission or values or that harms the university’s reputation. Misrepresenting or undermining accomplishments cited as the basis for the honorary degree also may result in revocation. Trustees voted for the change during their January meeting, the Laramie Boomerang reports. Provost Kate Miller proposed the change after other universities recently revoked honorary degrees they’d given to disgraced public figures including comedian Bill Cosby. Schools have revoked dozens of Cosby’s honorary degrees after numerous women accused him of sexual abuse. He was convicted in 2018.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/04/19/egg-roll-valedictorian-delay-sunflower-summer-news-around-states/50088609/", "title": "Egg roll, valedictorian delay: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nHuntsville: The U.S. Space and Rocket Center is marking the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 16 lunar mission and looking ahead to the next U.S. spaceflight to the moon. A member of the Apollo 16 crew, former astronaut Charlie Duke, will be on hand in Huntsville on Wednesday as the space museum looks back on the April 1972 mission. The Apollo 16 capsule, nicknamed “Casper,” is housed at the museum, which cleaned up the spaceship earlier this year ahead of the celebration. Duke and NASA officials are among those who will participate in an event that also will focus on the space agency’s upcoming test of its new, 30-story Space Launch System rocket. NASA is targeting June for a test flight to send the rocket to the moon without a crew. The administrator of NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Jody Singer, and James Free, NASA’s associate administrator for exploration development, will discuss the space agency’s work to return to the moon. After the first launch in NASA’s Artemis program, the agency plans to send astronauts around the moon in 2024. A lunar landing attempt is planned for as early as 2025. People last walked on the moon during the Apollo 17 mission in December 1972.\n\nAlaska\n\nFairbanks: The final two F-35A Joint Strike Fighter jets have arrived at Eielson Air Force Base, completing the full complement of 54 aircraft. Col. David “Ajax” Berkland of the 354 Fighter Wing at Eielson called it “a really significant day for us in terms of the buildup of Eielson Air Force Base.” The base near Fairbanks was selected in 2016 to host F-35s, spawning a base expansion that cost more than a half-billion dollars and includes 36 new buildings and 54 housing units for the F-35s, Fairbanks television station KTVF reported Saturday, a day after the two final jets arrived. The Air Force says the fifth generation F-35 represents a “quantum leap” in air combat capability. Combined with two squadrons of F-22s at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska, will have more operational fifth generation assets than anywhere else in the world, Eleventh Air Force Commander Lt. Gen. David A. Krumm, told Air Force Magazine. Krumm is the senior military official in Alaska. “Gen. Billy Mitchell talked about it in the 1930s that whoever holds Alaska holds the world. So the strategic importance of competing and securing our nation’s interests, which were there then, remains as much now as ever,” Berkland told KTVF. The expansion also includes personnel, with about 3,500 new active-duty airmen and their dependents stationed at the base.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A cannabis dispensary is offering tourists traveling through Sky Harbor International Airport a free shuttle directly to its doors starting Wednesday. The Mint dispensary in Guadalupe is calling the shuttle the #420 and offering it to people 21 and older. The Mint has long captured attention with its kitchen serving marijuana-infused pizza, burgers and other snacks and by offering free marijuana products to people who visited for a COVID-19 vaccination. The Arizona-based dispensary chain is kicking off the service Wednesday, a pseudo-holiday for cannabis consumers sometimes referred to simply as “4/20.” “National Cannabis Day gives us the opportunity to celebrate how much our industry has evolved and grown,” CEO Eivan Shahara said in a statement. “It’s also a great day to make history by delivering more innovation and excitement, while also finding ways to thank our patients, customers, visitors, and the community at large for their support.” The shuttle will pick up at all three Sky Harbor terminals during certain hours, and travelers can reserve a seat online at mintdeals.com/shuttle. Other marijuana-themed airport shuttles exist for a fee in places like Denver, but The Mint claims the free service is the first of its kind.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state Supreme Court has reversed a judge’s decision to block a school district’s mask mandate that was implemented to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Justices on Thursday reversed the temporary restraining order issued against the Bentonville School District’s mask requirement. Bentonville was among dozens of districts that imposed the requirement last year after a state law banning such mandates was blocked in a separate case. A group of parents had sued challenging the mandate. The court said that Arkansas’ laws give schools broad authority to determine their policies. “Based on this precedent, we conclude that the district properly authorized its policy,” Chief Justice Dan Kemp wrote in the court’s ruling. A spokeswoman said the district has no plans to reinstate the mask requirement at this time. In a separate opinion, Special Justice Howard Brill said parents have a right to be informed and to be heard on issues such as whether masks should be worn. But, Brill wrote, that doesn’t mean they have the right to “micromanage” schools. “If parents are dissatisfied with the school board decisions, they have a remedy,” wrote Brill, who was appointed to hear the case after Justice Rhonda Wood recused. “It is the ballot box.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: A Northern California woman pleaded guilty Monday to faking her own kidnapping and lying to the FBI about it, leaving her motive unanswered in the carefully planned hoax that set off a massive three-week search before she resurfaced on Thanksgiving Day in 2016. Sherri Papini, 39, of Redding, offered no explanation for her elaborate hoax during the half-hour court hearing. “I feel very sad,” she said tearfully when Senior U.S. District Judge William Shubb asked her how she was feeling. “Were you kidnapped?” he asked her later in the hearing. “No, Your Honor,” she replied. “Did you lie to government agents when you told them you were kidnapped?” Shubb continued. “Yes, Your Honor,” she responded. Papini agreed to plead guilty in a deal with prosecutors reached last week and is scheduled to be sentenced July 11. Prosecutors agreed to recommend a sentence on the low end of the sentencing range, estimated to be between eight and 14 months in custody, down from the maximum 25 years for the two charges.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state’s high school athletics authority has ambitious plans to expand esports into half of Colorado high schools. Rashaan Davis, who oversees esports for the Colorado High School Activities Association, said this year’s season is the busiest yet. “There are over 100 teams playing multiple titles across our state,” Davis said. “We offer League of Legends, Rocket League, Madden and (Super Smash Bros. Ultimate).” Gamers have traditionally been labeled as socially awkward geeks. Harrison High coaches Tom McCartney and Sean Hart want to break that stigma. When they were in high school, they found comfort in video games, but schools didn’t tolerate gaming on school grounds, much less encourage it. As teachers, and now coaches, they want to foster a safe environment for those awkward geeks to develop and build their talents. “Those are the people who ended up being the entrepreneurs, the vanguards for new ideas and opportunities and waves,” said McCartney, an English and drama teacher. “Let’s build their confidence now, so they don’t have to wait until 33 or 34 when they find themselves and accept themselves to finally get started with building a new world.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nWest Haven: Members of a state oversight board have decided they need greater control over the finances of the city, which has been under the microscope after a former state representative and others were accused of stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars in COVID-19 relief funds awarded to the municipality. The Municipal Accountability Review Board voted Thursday to recommend that West Haven, which is currently under a level of state oversight known as Tier III, be upgraded to Tier IV. That means the state board would have additional management tools, including the ability to hire a financial manager for the city. It will ultimately be up to Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont to decide whether to approve the stepped-up oversight, following a 30-day public comment period. City officials, including the mayor, opposed the move. They argued that West Haven, which has a long history of financial struggles, has made progress in recent years since working with the state board. Michael Last, the city’s treasurer, said he didn’t think the city of more than 55,000 people met the criteria for such a severe step. Board members countered that the alleged theft would not have occurred if proper financial safeguards recommended by the board were put in place.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: People living in the shadows of Croda’s New Castle-area manufacturing plant say it’s not a matter of if but when the plant has another dangerous leak along the Route 9 corridor. And it’s an even bigger concern now, as ethylene oxide, a highly flammable and explosive chemical that has been linked to various types of cancers, was found to be 30 times more cancerous for adults than previously thought, according to a report published by the Environmental Protection Agency’s independent Office of Inspector General. This chemical is the same one that leaked nearly 3,000 pounds into the air in 2018, shutting down the Delaware Memorial Bridge and scaring residents who were told to shelter in place as the flammable chemical leaked from the plant about a mile from their homes. “We’re living with a time bomb in our community – it already exploded one time,” said Jakim Mohammed, a local activist and Dunleith resident, as he stood within eyeshot of the plant. These concerns brought Croda, community members, and state and federal officials together Wednesday for a virtual meeting to discuss the company’s production of ethylene oxide and what that means for the health and safety of nearby residents. The meeting is one of the first sessions officials have held to update residents about the new risks associated with ethylene oxide since the federal watchdog urged the EPA to “promptly” hold public meetings in New Castle and 16 other locations across the country in March 2020.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Undaunted by soggy skies, President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, kicked off the first White House Easter Egg Roll since before the coronavirus pandemic Monday, welcoming some 30,000 kids and adults for the all-day event. The president encouraged one young egg-roller, coaching the child: “Go. You got it.” “My job is to keep it from raining for another two minutes,” he said in opening remarks on the South Lawn. The theme for the day was “egg-ucation.” The first lady, a community college professor, turned the South Lawn into a school community with a variety of educational stations. Besides the egg roll and an egg hunt, the event included a schoolhouse activity area, a reading nook, a talent show, a place to teach about farming, a photo-taking station, a physical “egg-ucation” zone with an obstacle course, and a “cafetorium” where children learned to make treats. The COVID-19 pandemic led the White House to cancel the Easter Egg Roll in 2020 and 2021. But the event is back this year, as the outbreak of coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths has eased. “This year we’re finally getting together again, and it’s so special,” the president told the guests. “Tonight Show” host Jimmy Fallon, singer Ciara and actor-singer Kristin Chenoweth were set to add a dash of celebrity splash to the event, which dates to 1878.\n\nFlorida\n\nLake Buena Vista: A baby zebra died at Walt Disney World’s Animal Kingdom after running full speed into a gate when it was spooked by two ostriches Thursday, a television station reports. WESH reports it spoke with a family who witnessed the incident and was told it happened after the enormous birds were released into the same enclosure. The family said the experience was upsetting and sent the station cellphone video of Disney employees trying to save the animal. “We are heartbroken over the loss of our Hartmann’s mountain zebra that passed away yesterday, and we ask that you keep our dedicated animal care Cast Members in your thoughts,” a Disney spokesperson said in an email to the station.\n\nGeorgia\n\nJekyll Island: A pair of rare sea turtles have returned to the ocean after veterinarians spent nearly a year nursing them back to health on the Georgia coast. The adult female loggerhead turtles were released into the surf Friday on the beach at Jekyll Island. Both had been patients at the Georgia Sea Turtle Center, the island’s hospital for sick and injured sea turtles. One was admitted last May after getting struck by a boat, according to a Jekyll Island news release. The other arrived in July after being found anemic and covered in barnacles and leeches. A few hundred people, including children on school trips, turned out to bid the sea turtles farewell. It was the first time the Georgia Sea Turtle Center had held a turtle release publicly since 2019. The turtles returned to the wild just before the nesting season for loggerhead sea turtles begins in Georgia on May 1.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The head of training at the state Department of Public Safety pleaded not guilty Thursday to charges accusing her of lying about her educational background. Public Training Officer J. Marte Martinez pleaded not guilty to perjury, tampering with a government record and unsworn falsification to authorities, according to her attorney Birney Bervar. Trial is set for June, Bervar said, declining to comment on the allegations. A complaint filed in court said Martinez made false statements about her educational background while testifying under oath before the Hawaii Labor Relations Board. The alleged false statements included having a liberal arts degree from a Virginia university. Martinez is also accused of submitting a transcript to the public safety department purported to be from an Oregon university, “which was falsely made, completed, or altered,” the complaint said. When applying for positions in the public safety department, she submitted an application that contained “statements about her educational background that she did not believe to be true,” the complaint said. The Department of Public Safety oversees Hawaii's jail and prisons, along with law enforcement divisions, including sheriffs.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The National Rifle Association on Monday endorsed Gov. Brad Little ahead of the Republican primary. NRA Idaho State Director Aiobheann Cline said in a statement that the endorsement reflects Little’s A-plus rating in the group and his support of Second Amendment issues during his first term. “Our members will interpret your ‘A+’ rating and endorsement as being a solid pro-gun/pro-hunting candidate who is a staunch defender of the Right to Keep and Bear Arm,” Cline said in the endorsement. Little has signed into law a number of gun-rights bills. Those include legislation protecting gun makers, sellers and weapons carriers during declared emergencies, along with another making it easier for nonresidents to carry firearms in the state. “With me, Idahoans have a governor who will always protect our Idaho way of life, and that includes my unwavering support for upholding our rights established in the Second Amendment,” Little said in a statement. His main challenger in the May 17 Republican primary is Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin, who has been endorsed by ex-President Donald Trump.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Almost four decades after a Black student graduated from Springfield High School at the top of her class, she’s finally been recognized as valedictorian. Tracey Meares, now a top legal scholar at Yale College of Law, was denied that honorific for 38 years until Saturday. Springfield School District 186 Superintendent Jennifer Gill presented Meares with the valedictorian medal and certificate after the screening of the documentary “No Title for Tracey” before a crowd of hundreds at the Hoogland Center for the Arts. Gill, who was a freshman at SHS when Meares was a senior, personally dug through old records, some on microfiche, to verify the ranking. “My first reaction is that it’s incredibly gratifying, but it’s also a lot to process,” Meares said after the presentation. Many, including Meares’ parents, believe systemic or institutional racism was behind the snub. The school typically had a valedictorian and a salutatorian, but as graduation neared in 1984, it opted for “top students” for Meares and a white student. It didn’t start naming valedictorians and salutatorians again until 1992. “It was not an individual act,” mother Carolyn Blackwell said. “That’s what makes it systemic.” The Southern Illinois University Institute for Plastic Surgery announced it had set up the “Tracey Meares Representation Matters” scholarship in her honor.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: An upcoming Netflix documentary will take a closer look at a local fertility doctor who for years inseminated patients with his own sperm without their knowledge. Years ago, several Indiana residents found out their father – whom some had believed to be an anonymous sperm donor or the man who had raised them – was actually their mother’s doctor: Donald Cline, once well respected in his field in Indianapolis. Those biological children will soon tell the story in their own words in “Our Father,” coming to the streaming service May 11. Cline’s secret was discovered in 2014, when Jacoba Ballard took a DNA test, expecting to have one or two donor half-siblings, but discovered seven whose mothers had all gone to Cline. He’d told them they’d be inseminated with material from anonymous donor, whose sperm would not be used more than three times to conceive a child. Ballard told the Indiana Senate Judiciary Committee in 2019 that she’s discovered at least 46 half-siblings. A fertility fraud bill to prevent a similar situation was passed and signed into law by Gov. Eric Holcomb that year. Cline’s license was revoked by the Medical Licensing Board of Indiana in 2018, but he did not spend any time in prison after pleading guilty to two counts of obstruction of justice after lying to officials.\n\nIowa\n\nDavenport: Armed with grant money, Humility Homes and Services plans to buy 60 housing units in its bid to end homelessness in the Quad Cities, nearly doubling the social service organization’s housing portfolio. In all, Humility Homes received more than $4.2 million from various agencies to help address an affordable housing shortage documented by several area organizations. “This is an important step in addressing the gap we have,” said Leslie Kilgannon, director of the Quad Cities Housing Council. “We have about 6,600 units we need in that extremely low-income category.” The bulk – 35 – of Humility Homes’ new housing units will be supportive housing, which combines services such as help with physical disabilities or health needs as well as mental illness or substance abuse treatment. The goal is to keep people who face challenges qualifying or keeping other housing in a stable place while they transition from an emergency shelter to more permanent housing. To provide the 35 supportive housing units, Scott County awarded Humility Homes $3.1 million from its allotment of federal COVID-19 relief funds from the American Rescue Plan Act. The other 25 units will provide more permanent affordable housing options for low-income families, some that rely on federal housing vouchers to pay rent.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A popular program for children to get free admission to some of the state’s coolest attractions is coming back this summer. Sunflower Summer – a Kansas State Department of Education initiative that gave over 70,000 residents free access to museums, parks and other attractions around the state in 2022 – is funded for the next few summers, Education Commissioner Randy Watson said. “We’re going to be doing it again, and we’re excited about it,” Watson told the Kansas State Department of Education. The department had used federal COVID-19 relief funding to start Sunflower Summer in 2021, in an effort to make sure all Kansas students had access to summer enrichment opportunities. This year, Gov. Laura Kelly decided to reallocate unused federal relief funds for private schools to the education department so it could continue to offer the program. To get free admission to Kansas attractions, parents or other adults download the Sunflower Summer app on their phone and register themselves and their children. The app then provides a single-use, free ticket for the child, as well as free tickets for up to two accompanying adults, to attend attractions around the state. In 2021, about 70 sites participated, including the Kansas Cosmosphere, Kansas Children’s Discovery Center and Eisenhower Presidential Library.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A judge on Monday blocked Republican-backed measures that would weaken Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s contracting authority and prevent him from challenging laws in court. The two new laws were temporarily blocked by Franklin County Circuit Judge Thomas D. Wingate after the GOP-dominated Legislature passed them last week over Beshear’s vetoes. One of the laws being challenged would designate Kentucky’s attorney general as the only statewide constitutional officer allowed to spend taxpayer funds on litigation challenging a bill’s constitutionality. The other contested measure would shift decision-making authority over executive branch contracts to a legislative committee. Both laws took effect immediately. In his order, Wingate said the plaintiffs, including the governor, had “more than sufficiently demonstrated that their rights are being or will be violated.” “Of particular concern to the court is that plaintiffs have alleged that under HB248 their access to the courts has essentially been blocked,” the judge wrote. The governor claims that both measures violate Kentucky’s Constitution. The lawsuit continues the long-running legal fight between Beshear and Republican lawmakers over measures seeking to rein in his executive authority. Wingate will hear arguments in the latest case May 31.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state says its weekends-only red snapper season for anglers will start May 27 in state and federal waters, with a daily limit of three of the popular sport and food fish. The season will run Fridays through Sundays except for three holiday weekends – Memorial Day, which opens the season; the Fourth of July, and Labor Day. Those three weekends extend through Monday. Each licensed angler may take up to three red snapper a day, with a minimum length limit of 16 inches, the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries said in a news release. The catch limit has been two fish a day for years but was raised to four during a 2021 year-end reopening. The department said anglers went nearly 7,000 pounds over the private recreational allocation last year, so that amount was taken from this year’s total limit. The agency said this year’s season will remain open until recreational landings approach or reach 809,316 pounds. LDWF also reminded anglers that amberjack and gray triggerfish season will overlap the red snapper season on the opening Memorial Day weekend but be closed from June 1 through July 30. Resident and nonresident recreational anglers who fish for offshore species must have both Louisiana basic and saltwater recreational fishing licenses, plus the free recreational offshore landing permit.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined an appeal by the Penobscot Indian Nation in its fight with Maine over ownership and regulation of the tribe’s namesake river. It was a bitter defeat for the tribe that sued a decade ago, claiming the Penobscot River is part of its reservation. Penobscot Chief Kirk Francis said it was a disappointing outcome in a legal case that goes to the “core identity of the Penobscot Nation.” “We see this as a modern day territorial removal by the state by trying to separate us from our ancestral ties to our namesake river,” Francis told the Associated Press. A federal judge previously ruled that the reservation includes islands of the river’s main stem but not the waters. There were appeals to a panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of appeals and then to the full appeals court. On Monday, the nation’s top court, without comment, declined to hear the tribe’s appeals over river regulation. The ruling came as the Maine Legislature was considering several measures that relate to tribal sovereignty. The Penobscots, whose reservation is on an island in the river, sued in 2012 after then-Attorney General William Schneider issued an opinion that the tribe’s territory was limited to islands. The tribe said the lawsuit was necessary to protect tribal authority over its ancestral river and ensure sustenance rights.\n\nMaryland\n\nJessup: The first cohort of students in Georgetown University’s degree program for prisons in Maryland has begun classes, officials announced. In-person classes at the Patuxent Institution, in Jessup, started Feb. 14 for the 25 students accepted into the program. Officials announced the liberal arts degree program last spring as an expansion of the Prison Scholars Program that Georgetown offers at the D.C. jail. Students completing the program will earn bachelor’s degrees from the university. Officials said they expect 125 students to enroll within the next five years in the 120-credit interdisciplinary program. The university’s admissions process for the program began last fall with the help of the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, officials said. After more than 300 applied from throughout the state prison system, those selected from other facilities were transferred to Patuxent Institution. Cultural humanities, interdisciplinary social science and global intellectual history are the program’s three available majors, officials said. Students this semester are taking introductory classes in writing and philosophy. The program will take about five years for most students to complete.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nLawrence: A wind-fueled blaze that damaged several homes Friday night displaced more than 70 people but resulted in no injuries, with one local leader calling it an “Easter miracle.” In all, 73 people belonging to 17 different families are residing in temporary housing following the blaze, Lawrence officials said Saturday. Fire officials said they believe the fire started on the third-floor balcony of a home in Lawrence before spreading to five other nearby residences. They said high winds helped the fire spread quickly in the densely settled neighborhood. All residents were safely evacuated, and no injuries were reported. No pets were reported missing or injured either. “An Easter miracle,” said City Council President Marc Laplante. “It’s amazing that we were able to walk away from this.” Crews from fire departments in Massachusetts and New Hampshire worked for more than three hours to extinguish the fire. The Red Cross is providing housing and assistance to the occupants of the damaged homes, and local community groups are helping to coordinate donations.\n\nMichigan\n\nGrand Rapids: Funeral services have been scheduled for Patrick Lyoya, an unarmed Black man fatally shot following a traffic stop and struggle with a white police officer. The Rev. Al Sharpton will deliver the eulogy Friday in Grand Rapids for Lyoya, according to Sharpton’s National Action Network and the office of attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Lyoya’s family. Services will begin at 11 a.m. at Renaissance Church of God in Christ in Grand Rapids. Lyoya, a native of the Democratic Republic of Congo, was facedown on the ground April 4 when he was shot in the back of the head. Video footage released Wednesday by the police department showed the officer straddling Lyoya’s back at the time of the shooting. Video also showed the officer stopping Lyoya for driving with a license plate that didn’t belong to the vehicle, Lyoya’s attempt to run away before being tackled to the ground, and a struggle over the officer’s stun gun. The officer could be heard repeatedly ordering Lyoya to “let go” of his stun gun, at one point demanding: “Drop the Taser!” Michigan State Police are investigating the shooting and the events that led up to it. Police Chief Eric Winstrom, citing department policy, said he only would release the officer’s name if and when he is charged. Lyoya’s family and Crump have demanded that the city identify the officer.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Researchers plan to study a group of Minnesotans who dunk themselves in icy Lake Harriet every winter day. The Star Tribune reports researchers from Rockefeller University’s Cohen Laboratory of Molecular Metabolism are studying so-called brown fat that generates heat in cold conditions in humans. They’re currently investigating possible links between controlled exposure to cold such as ice water dips or cold showers and improved health. They’re also investigating blood biomarkers of brown fat in young New Yorkers using cooling vests. The researchers want to validate the study in a larger group of people, so starting this summer they’ll collect blood from a group of 70 people who dip themselves in Lake Harriet at least twice a week for a month in winter. The researchers hope to compare molecules in their blood during the summer and winter months as well as their responses to anxiety, stress and depression. The Minneapolis Park Board allows people to swim in lakes Harriet or Cedar during the winter if they apply for a permit and sign a waiver. Data from the waiver system indicates about 1,000 people have taken dips in the lakes since December 2021.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Mississippi Department of Archives and History is granting the public access to additional papers from the late author Eudora Welty, including letters written by members of her family. The release came Wednesday on the 113th anniversary of Welty’s birth. She died July 23, 2001. According to her will, the family correspondence was to remain private for 20 years after her death. Welty, who lived most of her life in Jackson, was known for the lyrical quality of her short stories and was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1973 for her short novel “The Optimist’s Daughter,” published in 1972. While establishing herself as a writer, Welty photographed scenes of everyday life in Mississippi during the Great Depression for the Works Progress Administration. Welty’s niece, Mary Alice White, said in a news release from the archives department that the newly released letters begin with the courtship of Welty’s parents. White said they also include correspondence with relatives and papers and letters from others in the family. The Eudora Welty Collection was established in 1957, when she donated manuscripts, photographs and correspondence to the Mississippi Department of Archives and History.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: Hoping to end the tyranny of the Bradford pear tree, the state Department of Conservation is offering free replacements to residents who cut them down. The Bradford pear, also known as the Callery pear, can create unpleasant smells and, more importantly, is invasive and destructive to other plants and animals. While beautiful in bloom, it multiplies quickly and crowds out native plants, according to the Missouri Department of Conservation. “The Callery pear became a popular ornamental landscape tree in the 1960s because it was inexpensive, it grew fast, and provided those eye-catching blooms in the spring,” said MDC Forestry Program Supervisor Russell Hinnah. “But that’s where its benefits end. Different varieties of the tree were planted close to each other, which resulted in cross-pollination, and they took over natural areas.” The Bradford pear also has a poor branch structure, so the trees don’t fare well in storms. MDC encourages homeowners and landscapers to grow native when picking a tree to plant. “There are many great trees to substitute,” Hinnah said. “Serviceberry trees produce similar showy white blooms in the spring and have small red fruits that attract wildlife.” Other great alternatives include American plum, hawthorn, eastern redbud and Missouri’s state tree, the flowering dogwood.\n\nMontana\n\nEnnis: Instead of only responding to 911 calls, some emergency responders in the state are working with patients in their homes to prevent unnecessary medical emergencies. Community paramedicine services can range from home check-ins between doctor visits to follow-up care with discharged hospital patients, Montana Public Radio reports. According to the state Department of Public Health and Human Services, 10 emergency medical service agencies across Montana are doing this work as part of a pilot program established by the 2019 Legislature. The state received federal funding to help set up a training program at Missoula College that could offer its first class later this year. DPHHS also plans to use a separate $5 million federal grant to expand community paramedicine services in Montana. Nicole Steeneken, who works in the state health department’s EMS and trauma section, said the new federal grant will train nearly 50 first responders in community paramedicine services. The grant will also pay for those emergency responders’ salaries for a year and half. “We’re trying to hit at least two providers within each county and then build upon that with larger organizations that might fill in the gaps,” Steeneken said. Nearly 30 EMS agencies in Montana have submitted applications to take part in the program.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Gov. Pete Ricketts signed a law Monday that will allow the state to move forward with plans to build a canal in Colorado to divert water out of the South Platte River because of fears about its neighbor’s increased water use. Ricketts proposed the canal project to help protect Nebraska’s water rights as the population of Colorado’s Front Range increases, although Colorado officials have questioned the need for it. “Water is our most important natural resource after our people. We need to continue to manage, protect and steward it here in our state,” Ricketts said. The law will allow Nebraska to begin work on the roughly $500 million canal, but the measure includes only $53.5 million to design the project and potentially secure purchase options on land that might be used for it in the future. Officials estimate it will take eight to 10 years to complete the project, and the Nebraska Department of Natural Resources will have to return to the Legislature next year to obtain additional funding. Ricketts, a Republican, has said the South Platte River Compact agreement that was approved by Nebraska, Colorado and Congress in 1923 gives Nebraska the right to build the canal. That would give Nebraska the right to claim some of the water in late fall, winter and early spring and store it for use in drier times.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Officials who run elections are worried supply shortages could bring delays as they order the paper and envelopes needed for upcoming primary and midterm elections. The dilemma is the result of global supply chain issues coupled with an increase in demand for paper brought on by the pandemic, leaving ballot vendors worried about not getting their supply in time for the elections, the Las Vegas Sun reports. Lawmakers in Nevada, which has almost 1.8 million active registered voters, passed a law last year directing election officials to send every registered voter a mail-in ballot unless they choose to opt out. Some counties, such as Nye, are also pushing for 100% paper ballot elections. Both processes will require election officials to increase their paper supply to print ballots. The Nevada Secretary of State’s Office has known about the shortage for months and reached out to county officials to recommend they confirm with their ballot suppliers that they will get their supply in time. Joe Gloria, registrar of voters in the Las Vegas area, said he confirmed with the county’s vendors that the paper shortage would not affect Clark County in printing ballots or sample ballots for the 2022 election. The county, with more than 1.2 million active registered voters, has two different vendors, he said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Three people have pleaded guilty to wire fraud in opening accounts at financial institutions in their names or in the names of churches to allow another person to use the accounts to sell virtual currency. They pleaded guilty in federal court last week and await sentencing in July. Additional counts of wire fraud and conspiracy were dropped as part of a plea agreement. Two admitted to opening accounts in the names of the Crypto Church of NH and the Church of the Invisible Hand. The accounts were not used by churches but by Ian Freeman to trade virtual currency, prosecutors said. The third person signed blank checks and gave Freeman the login information or those accounts, they said. “Each of the defendants was aware that banks would close these accounts if the banks knew the accounts were used to operate an unlicensed virtual currency business,” the U.S. attorney’s office said in a news release Monday. Freeman and two others are scheduled for trial Nov. 1. He’s pleaded not guilty to charges of wire fraud, money laundering, operating a continuing financial crimes enterprise, and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. Freeman is a leader of the libertarian Free Keene group and hosts a radio show.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Legislation that proposes a later school start time statewide would not be ideal for all, say some educators who are advocating for the decision to be left up to local districts. Students who participate in after-school activities and sports or have part-time jobs would be at a disadvantage with the later start, some educators said, especially during the shorter days of winter. Some argue the change also won’t be ideal for those parents who have to drop off their children at school on their way to work. The bill introduced last month by Senate Education Committee Chair Vin Gopal and Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin proposes requiring all New Jersey public high schools to start later in the morning to benefit students’ mental health. The bill proposes later start times, no later than 8:30 a.m, beginning with the 2024-25 academic year. Currently, most of the state’s high schools start between 7:30 a.m and 8:30 a.m. The choice should be left to individual districts and their school boards, said the New Jersey School Boards Association. Despite “well-documented research indicating that adolescents are not getting sufficient sleep for their health and well-being,” NJSBA spokesperson Janet Bamford said a potential law must deal with practical hurdles such as transportation costs and family schedules.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Organizers of a festival held on the date known for celebrating marijuana have had two permits denied by local police. The 420 Fest, scheduled for Wednesday in downtown Albuquerque, had submitted permit requests for streets to be blocked off. Melissa Thompson, New Mexico 420 Fest organizer, told KOB-TV she and her team have been communicating with the city about this since June. Police spokesman Gilbert Gallegos said the request was rejected because the department doesn’t have the manpower to block off streets in the middle of the workweek. Officers already have to shut down roads in the same area at night because of traffic around the bars. The 420 Fest has been an ongoing event for six years but was shelved during the pandemic. Thompson said thousands of people are expected to show up. While recreational cannabis is now permitted in New Mexico, attendees won’t be able to buy or consume any because they’ll be out in public. This month the state joined 17 others that have legalized recreation pot without significant legal challenges. The change came 15 years after the state first began offering medical marijuana.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A lawyer for recently resigned Lt. Gov. Brian Benjamin said Monday that the Democrat has “very lively” legal issues from which to challenge corruption charges brought against him. Attorney Barry Berke told a Manhattan federal judge he expects to challenge on legal grounds the charges brought against Benjamin last week based on the U.S. Supreme Court’s skepticism toward criminal cases against politicians built solely on political contributions. In a statement issued after the hearing, Berke and defense attorney Dani James wrote: “This case is an unprecedented attempt to criminally charge an upstanding state leader for routine fundraising and support of a non-profit providing needed resources to Harlem public schools.” Benjamin’s arrest on charges alleging he promised to trade his political influence for a real estate developer’s campaign contributions created a political crisis for Gov. Kathy Hochul, seven months after she teamed up with Benjamin and pledged to restore order after ex-Gov. Andrew Cuomo, another Democrat, resigned amid a sexual harassment scandal. Hochul had been lieutenant governor under Cuomo. Benjamin is free on $250,000 bail after he pleaded not guilty last Tuesday following his arrest on multiple charges including bribery, fraud, conspiracy and falsification of records.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nHarkers Island: A newborn wild horse will be raised as a domesticated animal after well-meaning tourists took it with them as they left a barrier island, officials at a national park said. The foal followed a group of visitors on Shackleford Banks for two hours March 26 with no other horses around, according to a Monday news release from the Cape Lookout National Seashore. When the visitors moved their boat to leave the island, the young horse tried to follow them. The park said the tourists were worried the newborn would drown, so they lifted it into their boat and left. The tourists were cited for removing the horse, and the park said it’s working with them to assist with future educational opportunities and community service projects that will benefit the banks and its horses. A stallion trying to protect its group of mares might drive them away from where a foal is sleeping, according to the national park. The stallion’s goal is to keep a mare from going back to get her offspring because he doesn’t want to lose her. The newborn might lose its harem in such cases. Dr. Sue Stuska, the park’s wildlife biologist, said in the news release that young horses will follow other horses or even people when separated from their mothers. But visitors shouldn’t come closer than 50 feet to wildlife.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: McKenzie County residents are lukewarm on federal efforts to rename a hamlet on the Montana border. A federal task force is working to replace the names of more than 660 geographic features nationwide that American Indians find derogatory. One of the features is Squaw Gap. The Bismarck Tribune reports the hamlet is little more than a community hall and an old schoolhouse. The community is named for a rock formation that was said to resemble an Indian woman carrying a child, according to the book “North Dakota Place Names” by Douglas A. Wick. McKenzie County Commission Vice Chair Kathy Skarda, who grew up in the Squaw Gap area, said her friends and family thought the renaming effort was a joke. She said she doesn’t think the name was ever meant to deride any ethnicity. People will have to live with the name change, she said, but the area will always be Squaw Gap to residents. Possible replacement names include Spring Creek, One-O-One Creek, Phillip Draw, West Fork Badlands Draw and Phillip Spring. The task force will forward recommendations to the Board on U.S. Geographic Names in the coming months. Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation Tribal Chairman Mark Fox said he supports removing the term from place names. “It really causes serious and strong emotions and resistance to that term,” Fox said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: State regulation of streams that flow temporarily after rainfall would be restricted under proposed legislation months in the works. Construction companies, the mining industry and other business groups say removing so-called ephemeral streams from regulation would make Ohio’s practice consistent with federal law. The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency created a permitting system for development projects affecting ephemeral streams after the government removed them from federal oversight in 2020 and left their regulation up to states. The EPA says about 36,500 miles of the state’s 115,200 miles of primary headwater streams are ephemeral streams. Environmental groups largely oppose the legislation, saying the streams play an important role in maintaining water quality. They also question why Ohio would remove the streams from regulation at the same time it’s spending millions to improve water quality under Gov. Mike DeWine’s H2Ohio initiative. The state Senate approved the measure late last month along partisan lines. Some environmental groups softened their criticism after the Senate revised the bill to focus only on streams not already regulated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A former Kay County corrections officer faces up to 10 years in prison after a federal jury convicted him of excessive force and placing Black detainees in harm’s way by moving them into the same cell row as white supremacist inmates. Matthew Ware, 53, was found guilty of willfully depriving two pretrial detainees of their right to be free from a corrections officer’s deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of serious harm and of willfully depriving a third pretrial detainee of the right to be free from a corrections officer’s use of excessive force. Prosecutors said while Ware was serving as lieutenant at the Kay County Detention Center in Newkirk on May 18, 2017, he ordered lower-ranking corrections officers to move D’Angelo Wilson and Marcus Miller to a cell row housing white supremacist inmates who Ware knew posed a danger to Wilson and Miller. Ware later ordered the officers to unlock the jail cells of Wilson and Miller and the white supremacist inmates at the same time the following morning, prosecutors said. When the cells were unlocked, the white supremacist inmates attacked Wilson and Miller, causing injuries to both, including a facial laceration to Wilson that required seven stitches, prosecutors said.\n\nOregon\n\nOntario: Planned Parenthood is renting medical office space in a town on the Oregon-Idaho border. Planned Parenthood has not confirmed its plans for the space but has said it’s preparing for an influx of out-of-state patients seeking abortions in Oregon because of multiple legal challenges to abortion rights, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports. Earlier this year the group successfully lobbied the Oregon Legislature to set aside $15 million in an unrestricted fund for reproductive health equity. “No matter what happens, we will be there for our in-state and out-of-state neighbors and continue to meet the needs of our patients,” said Kenji Nozaki, the chief of affiliate operations at Planned Parenthood Columbia Willamette. “We are prepared to support anyone who seeks their legal right to decide whether and when to become pregnant.” The office space Planned Parenthood is renting in Ontario was previously home to the Four Rivers Health Clinic, a nonprofit serving people without health insurance. Joe Recla, the group’s executive director, said Four Rivers will use the rental income to continue to support uninsured patients. A Planned Parenthood clinic in Ontario could be a significant high desert outpost for access to abortion and other reproductive health care services. The town is about an hour’s drive from Boise, Idaho.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state’s acting health secretary is leaving the job, and Gov. Tom Wolf said Monday that his physician general will take over leadership of the department. Wolf said Keara Klinepeter’s last day is Friday. He plans to name Dr. Denise Johnson to succeed her as acting health secretary. Klinepeter has been acting secretary since her predecessor, Alison Beam, left at the end of 2021. Klinepeter has been deeply involved in the government’s handling of COVID-19, including as special adviser to the secretary and executive deputy secretary. Johnson said she was honored to lead the Health Department during what she called a transformative time in public health. Wolf spokeswoman Beth Rementer said Johnson will also continue to serve as physician general.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: More than 70 employees at Bally’s Twin River Lincoln Casino Resort are accusing the company of violating federal and state fair labor laws by failing to pay them adequate overtime wages and systematically undercutting their weekly paychecks. Three employees sued Bally’s Twin River last month in U.S. District Court, alleging the casino was willfully and repeatedly miscalculating its pay for hourly, tipped workers. Dozens more employees who worked at Twin River in the past three years are seeking to join the class-action lawsuit. Those affected include dealers and servers and other tip-based employees. “We think there’s substantial money involved,” Chip Muller, one of the lawyers representing the plaintiffs, said Friday. The state-operated casino is privately owned. Patti Doyle, a spokeswoman for Twin River, said the company declined to comment because the matter involves personnel and pending litigation. According to the suit, the employees worked more than 40 hours some weeks but were paid 1.5 times an hourly rate that fell below the required state minimum wage. Federal fair labor and state laws require the employer to pay an hourly rate of 1.5 times the regular rate, which cannot be lower than the state minimum wage, for any overtime hours.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nHampton: Authorities are investigating a shooting at a nightclub early Sunday that wounded at least nine people. It was the second mass shooting in the state and the third in the nation during the Easter holiday weekend. No one was reported killed in the violence at Cara’s Lounge in Hampton County, roughly 80 miles west of Charleston, according to an email from South Carolina’s State Law Enforcement Division, which is investigating the shooting. A phone call to the nightclub was not answered. Gunfire had erupted Saturday at a busy mall in the state capital, Columbia, about 90 miles north of Sunday’s nightclub shooting. Nine people were shot, and five people sustained other kinds of injuries while trying to flee the scene at the Columbiana Centre, Columbia Police Chief W.H. “Skip” Holbrook said Saturday. The victims ranged in age from 15 to 73. None faced life-threatening injuries. “We don’t believe this was random,” Holbrook said. “We believe they knew each other, and something led to the gunfire.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The chief federal prosecutor in the state announced Monday that he’s retiring. U.S. Attorney Dennis Holmes spent more than 43 years as a prosecutor in South Dakota. The Custer native began his career as a prosecutor in 1978 as an intern in the Pennington County States Attorney’s Office while he was still in law school at the University of South Dakota. He went on to serve as an assistant state attorney general, rising to become chief deputy attorney general. He joined the U.S. attorney’s office in Pierre in 1988 and moved to the Sioux Falls office in 1995, where he prosecuted a wide array of cases ranging from large-scale drug conspiracies to environmental crimes. Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed him as U.S. attorney for 120 days in December following U.S. Attorney Ron Parsons’ resignation.\n\nTennessee\n\nKnoxville: Demolition of the largest house in the state began Monday. The teardown of the 40,000-square-foot, 86-room Villa Collina is expected to take several days. Total Demolition Services is leading the work. The extravagant structure was purchased by LView Properties LLC for $6.5 million last October, according to Knox County property records. The property will be split into three lots for University of Tennessee board of trustees Chair John Compton, Jimmy and Dee Haslam, and David and Annie Colquitt. Mike and Deane Conley were the first owners of the Italianate-style mansion and built the house in stages between 1993 and 2000. It is the largest house in Tennessee and the 84th largest in the country, according to the Villa Collina website. The mansion has eight bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, a commercial-grade kitchen and a three-story library, among other audacious amenities. Perhaps the most jaw-dropping room is the $5 million master suite, featuring Swarovski crystal chandeliers and $200,000 doorknobs. In December, an auction that gained the interest of people from around the country was held to sell items in the home before demolition. From stained-glass panels to decorative bathroom fixtures, the auction was full of unique, luxury items.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to review the conviction of death row inmate Kristopher Love, who claimed his trial was improperly influenced by racial bias after a juror said he believed nonwhite races were more violent. No reason was given for rejecting Love’s appeal, but the court’s three liberal justices issued a dissenting opinion saying the inmate’s claim deserved closer scrutiny. “Racial bias is odious in all aspects, but especially pernicious in the administration of justice,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a dissent joined by Justices Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan. The legal challenge by Love, a Black man, focused on the jury selection portion of his 2018 trial in Dallas, where a potential juror said he believed nonwhite races were “more violent races,” citing statistics seen in news reports and in criminology classes he had taken. Defense lawyers tried unsuccessfully to strike the man from Love’s jury. Sotomayor criticized the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, which upheld Love’s death sentence in a unanimous ruling, finding last year that any error made at Love’s trial was harmless because the judge had given defense lawyers two extra peremptory strikes that let them reject potential jurors for any reason. Those two extra challenges, however, had already been used.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: The drought-stricken state continues to see below-normal levels of snowpack, and Utah water officials said Friday that they don’t expect the annual spring runoff to provide nearly enough water to refill the state’s reservoirs. Some late-season snow provides some help, but 99% of the state remains in severe drought, according to the Utah Division of Water Resources. Some 95% of the water supplies used by state residents comes from snowmelt that flows into state reservoirs. “Utah has been in drought eight of the last 10 years, and this year’s disappointing snowpack is not going to pull the state out of drought,” said Brian Steed, executive director of the state Department of Natural Resources. “The recent snowstorms were beneficial, however, they added less than an inch of water to our snowpack.” Of the 95 measured streams, 51 are flowing below normal despite spring runoff. Eight streams are flowing at record-low conditions. The statewide snow water equivalent, or how much water would be in the snowpack if it melted, peaked at 12 inches this year, which was 75% of the typical median peak of 16 inches. Twenty-eight of Utah’s largest 45 reservoirs are below 55% of available capacity. Overall statewide storage is 58% of capacity. At this time last year, reservoirs were about 67% of capacity.\n\nVermont\n\nPawlet: The owner of an unpermitted firing range is facing jail time if he won’t allow town officials to visit the property within 30 days, a judge said Monday. The town has been working for years to get Daniel Banyai to comply with its zoning regulations and later orders from the state Environmental Court. During the remote hearing, Environmental Court Judge Thomas Durkin also told Banyai that he must sign a contract within 10 days with a surveyor to complete an assessment of the 30-acre property in West Pawlet to determine what is located there. “I will caution Mr. Banyai that if you do not abide by this interim order in any respect I will then immediately … consider any request made by the town of Pawlet to have you jailed until you comply,” Durkin said. During the three-hour hearing, Banyai’s lawyer Robert Kaplan said he only began representing Banyai last month, but he would work with town officials and his client to find an acceptable date for a site visit. Banyai bought the 30-acre property known as Slate Ridge in 2013 and sometime in 2017 began operating what he calls a firearms training facility. The property is only permitted to have a garage with an apartment. Slate Ridge neighbors have complained for some time about gunfire at the facility and what they claimed were threats and intimidation by Banyai and his supporters. Many of the neighbors of Slate Ridge are afraid to talk publicly because of fears for their safety.\n\nVirginia\n\nBedford: Local officials are citing the COVID-19 vaccine mandate for health care workers among reasons for selling a county-owned nursing home in southwestern Virginia. The Bedford County Board of Supervisors is scheduled to hold a special meeting to consider selling the nursing home. The nursing home was established as the County Poor Farm in 1831. The News & Advance reports that county officials are considering selling the facility to Roanoke-based American HealthCare LLC. County officials released a statement saying that with an increasing regulatory environment surrounding nursing homes, industry experts who specialize in health care compliance, rather than local government officials with no such expertise, are in a better position to make decisions. The statement also noted that the COVID-19 pandemic further prompted local officials to explore their options, and that the vaccine mandate for health care employees is “contrary to the positions of all board members” and has complicated uniformity in how county employees are treated.\n\nWashington\n\nRenton: After years of protest, moratoriums and delays, King County has granted approval for a proposed asphalt plant to be built on the banks of the Cedar River. The county’s Department of Local Services ruled Thursday that the project, which has been fiercely opposed by neighbors and environmental groups, “does not pose a probable significant adverse impact to the environment,” as long as the company takes mitigation measures. The decision comes six years after Lakeside Industries bought the 25-acre parcel on Highway 169 and nearly four years after Lakeside, which has a dozen asphalt plants in Western Washington, first applied to build the plant, the Seattle Times reports. The county also said an environmental impact statement – which had been requested by the Muckleshoot Indian Tribe and others – was not necessary. The site sits about 50 yards from the Cedar River, separated by a five-lane highway and bike path. A traffic study found the plant will require 460 truck trips each weekday. The site was rezoned in 2008, in a little-noticed amendment to a massive piece of mandatory legislation. It was shifted from rural, with only one home allowed every 5 acres, to industrial. Lakeside bought the site in 2016 for $9.5 million, five times its assessed value.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: State residents have until close of business Tuesday to register to vote or update their registration for the May 10 primary. It is especially important for voters who have moved to a different address, changed their name or want to change political party to update registration, Secretary of State Mac Warner’s office said in a news release. Registration can be completed online at GoVoteWV.com by close of business Tuesday; by mailing a paper application to the county clerk, postmarked by Tuesday; or in person at the offices of the county clerk, secretary of state, Division of Motor Vehicles, pubic assistance, agencies serving people with disabilities and military recruiting agencies, the release said. More information on the primary election is also available at GoVoteWV.com.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway wants to spend $425,000 to design a system to filter PFAS chemicals out of a city well. The Wisconsin State Journal reports the mayor said the system would be the first in the state designed to filter the so-called forever chemicals out of drinking water. Rhodes-Conway and Alderwoman Nasra Wehelie said they’ve drafted a resolution authorizing city water officials to contract with AECOM for up to $375,000 in design and engineering services for the system. The resolution includes another $50,000 for staff time. City officials say a no-bid contract is necessary in order to submit the project for state grants in October. The money is part of $143 million the state is receiving through the infrastructure aid bill Congress passed last year. The bill provides $12.8 million in each of the next five years for projects targeting emerging contaminants in drinking water. Competition for the grants is expected to be stiff. The city’s water quality manager, Joe Grande, said the filtration likely would cost about $670,000 to install and between $136,000 and $300,000 annually to operate depending on the level of PFAS contamination allowed. The city closed Well 15 in 2009 after tests showed elevated levels of PFAS, likely stemming from the Dane County Regional Airport.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: In honor of National Donate Life Month, Donor Alliance is inviting residents to celebrate the gift of life by raising awareness for organ, eye and tissue donation at events across the state. Ranging from the upcoming Wyoming Donor Dash event – a 5K walk/run April 23 at the Tate Pumphouse in Casper – to celebrations at Driver Services and hospitals across Wyoming, there are plenty of opportunities for Wyoming residents to honor the lives of donors, celebrate the lives of recipients and raise awareness for those still waiting for a lifesaving transplant. “Wyoming continues to make an incredible impact when it comes to residents who have signed up as organ and tissue donors,” said Jennifer Prinz, president and CEO of Donor Alliance. “As we honor National Donate Life Month in Wyoming, we’re aiming to grow awareness and support of the generous gift of organ and tissue donation.” In honor of Blue and Green Day on Friday, twenty-one of the state’s Driver Services offices in addition to hospitals across Wyoming are honoring the day with celebrations and office decorations. Residents are encouraged to join the celebration by dressing in blue and green to raise awareness for organ, eye and tissue donation.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/19"}]}

Two years later, he was promoted to head coach.\n\nWhat followed was one of the most dominant runs in the history of Delaware high school sports. In nine years, the Cape Henlopen girls lacrosse team went 143-17-1, rolled up a 99-game winning streak against in-state opponents and stamped out eight straight state championships.\n\nKesmodel coached his final game on May 31, his 73rd birthday. Several family members, friends and former players traveled from around the country to watch the Vikings dispatch Tower Hill 16-4 in the championship game, and his players started the celebration by singing “Happy Birthday.”\n\nBut there is one more accolade for Paul Joseph Kesmodel Jr. to collect before riding off into the lacrosse sunset. He will receive the Coach of the Year award at the inaugural Delaware Sports Awards, which will celebrate the best in Delaware high school sports on Wednesday night at the University of Delaware’s Bob Carpenter Center.\n\n“The guy is special,” said Dave Frederick, sports editor of the Cape Gazette, who has chronicled Kesmodel’s entire Delaware run and watched three granddaughters play for him. “He will go down as the best high school girls lacrosse coach in the country, ever.”\n\nDeep roots\n\nPJ comes from a lacrosse family. His father, Paul Sr., played at Baltimore Poly in the 1920s and was one of the nation’s top goalkeepers at St. John’s College. He served as boys coach at Severn School, a private high school in Severna Park, Md., for 25 years, then became headmaster when PJ started playing for Severn in 1959.\n\nHis brother, Robert, also played at Severn and went on to star at Army, earning a spot in the 1966 North-South Game. PJ went to play in college at famed Johns Hopkins, but injured his knee twice.\n\n“I didn’t come back until my sophomore year,” he said. “By that time, I hadn’t played for two years. I couldn’t compete. I sat on the bench for a year, and then I was out of school for a couple of years.”\n\nHe filled that time with his first coaching job, serving as a volunteer assistant at 1964-65 at Severna Park, the first years the public school had a team.\n\nKesmodel worked as a guidance counselor and coached boys lacrosse at Mount Hebron, a public high school in Ellicott City, from 1978-83. He guided the team to a state title in 1983, then stepped away from the game until leading a Title IX effort to start a girls lacrosse program at Mount Hebron.\n\nIt took more than a year to cajole, convince and ultimately threaten the school board, but the Mount Hebron girls played their first season in 1988. And Kesmodel was back on the sideline.\n\n“After we got it, I thought I’d might as well coach,” he said. “I didn’t know anything about it, but I thought I’d better coach since I spent so much time fighting for it.”\n\nLearning curve\n\nHis sister, Kate Ellsworth, played lacrosse at Maryland and coached high school girls in the Atlanta area. But PJ had a lot to learn about the girls game, and he went to conventions and clinics to try to catch up. In his first game as a girls coach, his brand new Mount Hebron team defeated an established team handily in a scrimmage, much to the dismay of the opposing coach.\n\n“She was screaming at me, ‘You’re not playing girls lacrosse! You’re playing boys lacrosse!’” he said. “I said, ‘What are you talking about? We’re playing exactly the same rules you are, we’re just doing it a different way.’\n\n“We didn’t do it the traditional girls way. My kids couldn’t catch very well, so we ran the ball and went in and scored. In the girls game, you’re supposed to be passing it.”\n\nThe Mount Hebron girls learned the finer points soon enough, winning four straight state titles from 1992-95 and becoming known as one of the nation’s finest teams.\n\n“By the time I left, we had better skills than everybody and we passed it all over the place,” Kesmodel said.\n\nOne of his players at Mount Hebron was Cathy Reese, who has coached Maryland to three NCAA Division I women’s national titles in the last 10 years. Kesmodel also groomed Chris Robinson, now the girls coach at McDonogh School, which finished 22-0 and ranked No. 1 in the nation this spring.\n\nHis knowledge continued to expand with a four-year coaching stint at Baltimore City College, a public magnet high school in the inner city.\n\n“Most of my kids were African-American. Half of them had never played before,” Kesmodel said. “My first year, I think we were 2-9. The next three years, we had winning records and won the city championship.\n\n“That was a whole different world, and it was very humbling for me. It was good for me to get into that environment and start with kids who didn’t know how to play.”\n\nKesmodel noticed that some of his players weren’t getting home until 90 minutes after practice, because they had to transfer to at least two different buses. So he filled up his station wagon and dropped off players to get them home faster.\n\n“I went to their homes. I did college conferences. I got scholarships for a couple of kids,” he said with pride. “I got a good appreciation of the different life that these kids live. It was a good four years.”\n\nA two-year stint at Seton Keough, a private, all-girls school in Baltimore, and some more time away from the game brought him to retirement in Rehoboth Beach.\n\nSlow start\n\n“I didn’t really plan to coach at all,” Kesmodel said. “Then during the summer I said, ‘Well, I might as well see if the local high school could use some help.’ I knew they had a team, and maybe I could volunteer, help out as an assistant coach.”\n\nHe was turned down at first, but called back later. Kesmodel served as a volunteer assistant at Cape Henlopen the first year, a paid assistant the second year. Then he was offered the head coaching job at nearby Worcester Prep in Berlin, Md.\n\nHe was about to take that job when Cape coach Gretchen Haas-Wyshock, who was pregnant, decided not to coach the following season. Kesmodel was named head coach of the Vikings.\n\nThey made a run at a state title immediately, but let a 4-1 halftime lead slip away and lost to St. Andrew’s 6-5 in the 2008 state semifinals.\n\nKesmodel founded and still serves as president of Hero’s Lacrosse, a club that offers 1,000 young athletes a chance for offseason development in Howard County, Md. He knew how important club play was, so he helped establish and grow the Atlantic Lacrosse and Eastern Shore Lacrosse clubs in Rehoboth.\n\n“At that point [in 2008], we had two club players from Cape,” Kesmodel said. “Now, it’s everybody. But it’s been a long haul, with building the club program and getting all the kids involved in club play.\n\n“It kind of irritates me, because people are like, ‘Anybody could win with that team.’ That’s probably true now. But they don’t realize all the blood, sweat and tears that went getting us to where we are now. It’s been a 10-year process.”\n\nThe streak begins\n\nOn May 2, 2009, St. Andrew’s beat Cape Henlopen again 13-12 in a regular-season game. Nineteen days later, the Vikings turned the tables on the Saints in the state final, earning their first championship with an 11-7 victory.\n\nCape Henlopen hasn’t lost to a Delaware team since. The Vikings have won 99 straight over in-state foes, including 24 consecutive DIAA tournament games by a combined margin of 377-148. Their average margin of victory in the last eight title games has been 7.3 goals.\n\n“You would think, after 99 games, somebody would have gotten them,” Frederick said. “In a sport where three officials are very much variables in the game, you would think some bad game, some bad throw, some missed shot, somebody would have gotten them.\n\n“I don’t know if anybody ever goes on a run like that again. We won’t be around to count it, that’s for sure.”\n\nOf course, the Vikings have lost during that stretch. Just never to a Delaware team. Kesmodel annually schedules some of the region’s top competition. In 2014, Cape actually lost five times in a six-game stretch – to powerhouse teams from Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia. But when the state tournament rolled around, the Vikings won their three games by a combined 61-17.\n\n“Our kids are used to competing against really good people, and it pays off for us to do that,” Kesmodel said. “We lose some games. But as I tell the kids, the ultimate goal is to the win Delaware state championship, and this is going to get us ready.”\n\nHe also prepares his team by driving to watch the Vikings’ strongest opponents at least twice to produce detailed scouting reports. And he gets to know his players.\n\n“He’s amazing,” said Robert, PJ’s brother, who flew in from Miami Beach to watch his final game. “I asked him one time, ‘How do you win? How do you do that?’ He said, ‘I take an interest in the kids. It’s not just the coaching side. I go to their plays, I go their games, I get to know the parents. When you know the kids, you know what’s going on in their life.’”\n\nHe knows the Xs and Os, and how to reach inside a player to bring out their best.\n\n“He knows how to prepare the kids mentally and physically,” said Steve Waagbo, a longtime friend from Maryland who also came to PJ’s finale. “He encourages them, teaches them leadership, puts them in the right place to be successful.”\n\nOn to college\n\nAnd if you work hard enough, there’s a good chance to continue playing at the next level. More than 80 of Kesmodel’s former girls players have earned Division I college scholarships.\n\n“He just knows so much,” said senior Lizzie Frederick, one of the captains of this year’s team, who will continue her career at Temple University next season. “He has been coaching for over 50 years. He knows game strategies. He knows how to coach players up and get people the opportunities where they need to be.\n\n“He is the reason I’m going to be able to play college lacrosse. He is the reason any of the girls on this team will be able to play college lacrosse.”\n\nThat carries over to more than just Cape Henlopen. Kesmodel, who spent much of his active high school career as a college advisor, works to help players from neighboring schools realize their college lacrosse dreams.\n\n“He gets credit for Cape, but one of the things people don’t know is that he helps girls from all over,” said Bob Cilento, Cape Henlopen’s athletic director. “He tries to get them in school, through the Eastern Shore Lacrosse program he started. There are a lot of kids from a lot of schools that have come under his influence.”\n\nHonoring traditions\n\nKesmodel has had the markings of a lacrosse field painted on his dining room table for 25 years. At the start of each season, the players come to his house for an offensive meeting and a defensive meeting. The coach uses pennies and nickels to represent positions and explain his philosophies.\n\n“Every year, I’ve asked the captains, ‘Do you want to stop doing this?’” he said. “They say, ‘No. It’s tradition. We have to do this.’”\n\nThe Vikings follow some other traditions, too. They have a Crazy Hat Day practice, where the player with the hat judged to be the most outlandish wins a prize. They split the team by height for an annual Short vs. Tall Scrimmage, where Kesmodel has found that being taller isn’t automatically an advantage in girls lacrosse.\n\nThen there are the championship traditions. Several years ago, on the way to the state title game in Dover, a player approached Kesmodel on the bus with an urgent need to find a restroom. The bus made an impromptu stop, and a couple of players ran behind some RVs to do their business.\n\nThat isn’t a tradition you want to continue, so the Vikings modified it. The next year, the bus scheduled a restroom stop at a Dairy Queen north of Milford. Every year since, every player gets off the bus, whether they need to or not.\n\nThe bus also pulls into an empty parking lot in Dover, and Kesmodel takes the players through a visualization exercise of how they’re going to feel in the championship game, what the opponent is going to do, how fast and strong the Vikings are going to be.\n\nIt worked every time, so why stop?\n\n“The kids have bought into it,” he said. “They would be upset if we didn’t do those.”\n\nBuilding something\n\nNext season, it will be up to a new coach to try to carry on those traditions and build on the winning streak. Cilento said a decision on the new hire is months away.\n\nIt won’t be easy, but it wasn’t easy for Kesmodel. He tips his cap to all of the players and parents who have helped along the way.\n\n“What I really enjoy doing is building something,” he said. “People always told me I’m a project person, and this was a project. You have to do a whole lot of moving parts to make it happen, and it’s been a 10-year process. But it has paid off.\n\n“It’s kind of cool to build something that wasn’t there into something that’s really good. That’s very gratifying.”\n\nContact Brad Myers at bmyers@delawareonline.com.

Let's take a look back at the most admirable student-athletes of the high school season.\n\nPolytech girls lacrosse coach Lynn Richardson knew Ali McKay had the potential to score goals. That's why she moved McKay from defense to midfield before her sophomore season.\n\nMcKay was solid last year, earning second-team All-State honors. But this year, after some encouragement from her coach and teammates, she really turned it on. The junior led the Panthers with 104 goals, and was named the state's Player of the Year by the Delaware Girls Lacrosse Coaches Association.\n\n\"She's a well-rounded athlete, and she's a competitor, but I wouldn't say she is someone who is full of herself or overly confident,\" Richardson said. \"We had to encourage her to shoot and drive to the goal.\"\n\nOnce the Panthers convinced her she could do it, the sky was the limit.

Because Pettit finished his glittering career with school records for goals, assists and points, was a three-time first-team All-State selection and a two-time U.S. Lacrosse All-American. And this year, the Delaware Boys Lacrosse Coaches Association named Pettit the state's Player of the Year.\n\n\"What sets him apart are his stick skills and ability to create offense,\" Tower Hill coach Brad duPont said. \"He has tremendous vision, and he knows where everybody is. He can put the ball on people's sticks.\"\n\nHe can put the ball in the net, too. And he can do it from any angle.

Moving around is the best part of my game.\"\n\nLaz found enough openings this spring to be named the state's Girls Soccer Player of the Year by the Delaware Soccer Coaches Association. The senior never stopped in leading Sussex Tech to a 13-4 season and a spot in the DIAA Division I semifinals.\n\nSoccer is a long game, with a half lasting 40 minutes at the high-school level. Defenses threw everything but the kitchen sink at Laz, often shutting her down for long stretches.

The golfer best able to handle the stress of the big occasion emerges as the champion.\n\nFor the second straight season, Salesianum's Liam Murphy passed the test with flying colors.\n\nLast year, Murphy pulled away over the final nine holes at Dover's Maple Dale Country Club to win by four strokes. This year, the senior broke out of the pack again at Wilmington Country Club on May 26-27 to win by five and earn his second straight Golfer of the Year honor.\n\n\"There's really no better feeling than to be able to go in there and pull it off, and prove to yourself that you can do it,\" Murphy said. \"All of those hours that you put in were worth it.\" READ MORE\n\nALL-STATE GOLF TEAM\n\nIn a sport whose defining adjectives are \"faster,\" \"higher\" and \"stronger,\" Ashley Bailey is all of the above.\n\nSoaring 18 inches higher than any other Delaware girl ever before pole vaulted, excelling in five other events and leading her team to unprecedented success, the Middletown High senior won the Bill Thomson Award as the state's outstanding high school track athlete.\n\nJust this past Sunday, Bailey vaulted 13 feet at the Junior Olympic Regionals at Stockton (N.J.)

Asked to rate the severity of six specific mental health concerns, Americans put the opioid epidemic near the top, with more than two-thirds of people identifying it as a crisis rather than merely a problem. More than half identified mental health issues among children and teenagers as a crisis, as well as severe mental illness in adults.\n\nThe survey captured the perceptions of a nationally representative sample of about 2,000 adults over the summer – 2½ years into the Covid-19 pandemic and amid ongoing public health threats including racism and gun violence.\n\nThe broad concern is well-founded, rooted in both personal experience and national trends.\n\n“The Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated numerous social stressors that we know can increase the risk of both substance use and mental illness,” said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\nData from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that drug overdose deaths reached record levels in 2021 and suicide rates were back near a record high after two years of decline. And in 2020, mental health-related visits to emergency rooms jumped 31% among adolescents ages 12 to 17.\n\nAccording to the CNN and KFF poll, about half of adults say they have had a severe mental health crisis in their family, including in-person treatment for family members who were a threat to themselves or others, or family members who engaged in self-harming behaviors.\n\nMore than 1 in 5 adults describe their own mental health as only “fair” or “poor,” including extra-large shares of adults under the age of 30, adults who identify as LGBT and those with an annual income of less than $40,000. A third of all adults said they felt anxious always or often over the course of the past year, including more than half of LGBT adults and those under 30. About 1 in 5 adults said they were often or always depressed or lonely over the past year, too.\n\nMajor sources of stress for a third or more of adults include personal finances and current and political events. About 1 in 4 adults also identified personal relationships and work, respectively, as major sources of stress.\n\nAccording to the new survey, about 1 in 5 adults received mental health services in the past year. Earlier data published by the CDC supports that finding and shows that mental health treatment became more common over the course of the pandemic: Nearly 22% of adults got mental health treatment in 2021, up from about 19% in 2019.\n\n“Perhaps one of the only benefits of the pandemic and the shift that our country has been going through is the increase in our willingness to acknowledge and talk about when we might be struggling or in need of support,” said Sarah Brummett, director of the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention’s executive committee.\n\n“People are more willing to roll up their sleeves and talk about it and support folks. And I think that’s progress.”\n\nDespite increased willingness and commonly shared stressors among the public, most adults who have only fair or poor mental health said they don’t feel comfortable talking to loved ones about it – some to maintain privacy and some to avoid the shame and stigma attached to mental health issues.\n\nBut the vast majority – more than 4 out of 5 – of those surveyed say individuals and families should play a major role in addressing mental health problems in the US, equal to the share who say the same of health care providers.\n\nExperts say there is an opportunity to broaden perceptions about how mental health is part of overall physical health and how to respond to mental health crises.\n\n“Not everyone’s a cardiologist, but a lot of people are trained in CPR,” said Justin Baker, a psychologist and assistant professor at the Ohio State University College of Medicine. “If we only rely on the mental health force, we’re going to keep going around in circles and never actually get anywhere. I think we see this as all of our problems.”\n\nNonetheless, the groups most likely to say they need mental health care in the US are also less likely to say they can get it.\n\nNearly 6 out of 10 adults who say their mental health is only fair or poor say they have not been able to get needed care, as well as about half of adults younger than 30 and LGBT adults.\n\nFor those who have gone without help, the most common reasons cited were being too busy or unable to take time off work, being unable to afford the cost, and being afraid or embarrassed to seek care, according to the CNN and KFF survey.\n\nIn his first State of the Union address, President Joe Biden outlined a multipronged strategy to address the country’s mental health crisis, including goals to integrate mental health into primary care, investing in the work force and new approaches to programs that provide care.\n\n“Let’s get all Americans the mental health services they need, more people they can turn to for help and full parity between physical and mental health care,” he said in his address in March.\n\nAccording to the poll, most Americans see those issues as significant problems. A majority, 55%, say it’s a big problem that there aren’t enough mental health care providers, about three-quarters say that insurers not covering mental health the way they do physical health is a significant concern, and 80% say the same about the cost of mental health care.\n\nThrough the American Rescue Plan, the Biden administration has invested $5 billion in mental health and substance use programs through the US Department of Health and Human Services, with billions more proposed in future budgets.\n\nOne significant shift came this summer, with the transition of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline to a three-digit dialing code: 988. Early data suggests success, with calls jumping 45% in the first month compared with the same time a year before.\n\nBut according to the new survey, there is still work to be done.\n\nThe vast majority of adults (85%) say they would be at least somewhat likely to call the hotline if they or a loved one were experiencing a mental health crisis – and it’s a good alternative to 911, which about a quarter of adults, especially Black and LGBT adults, say would do more harm than good in a mental health crisis situation.\n\nIt also has potential to help Hispanic people and those who are uninsured, who are more likely than average to say they don’t know who to call if there is a mental health crisis and would not know where to find services.\n\nYet more than half of adults in the new poll say they have heard “nothing at all” about the new 988 hotline.\n\n“This can be a preventable public health issue, and we all have a role to play,” Brummett said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe fieldwork for the CNN/KFF Mental Health Survey was conducted by SSRS on July 28 through August 9 among a random national sample of 2,004 adults.

Subscribe to the Des Moines Register.\n\nHuppert told legislators that she and other patient advocates understand it will take time to set up the new system. But she said deadlines are crucial to ensure goals aren’t indefinitely pushed off.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds told reporters Wednesday morning she's committed to improving mental health care for children. \"It's a priority of mine,\" she said. \"… It's the right thing to do. We don't have a children's mental health system right now. We've been talking about it for decades. ... Now is the time to act.\"\n\nShe said the proposal her office introduced this week focuses on setting up a structure, and she's open to suggestions about improving it.\n\nThe Senate bill leaves out some recommendations from the children's mental health board Reynolds appointed last year. For example, the bill doesn’t call for regular mental health screenings of Iowa children. It also doesn’t include the council’s proposal for a statewide hotline to help parents find services for troubled kids.\n\nMary Neubauer of Clive, who serves on the state children’s mental health board, urged senators Wednesday to add the hotline proposal to the bill.\n\n“When a child is struggling, it is not just the child who is struggling. Family members are in crisis right along with that kid,” she told senators.\n\nNeubauer recounted how hard it was to find help for her son, Sergei, before he died of suicide in 2017. “Trying to find your way through the mental health system is truly a labyrinth,” she said. A centralized crisis line could help, and it shouldn’t be hard to set up, she said.\n\n► Suicides are rising in Iowa. Here's what people are doing to stop it.\n\nNeubauer thanked legislators for taking the overall issue seriously. “Here in the Capitol, momentum is a precious thing,” she said. “I beg of you not to delay implementation of this legislation.”\n\nThe bill calls for a new children’s system that would mirror the regional system now coordinating mental health services for adults. The 14 regional authorities use a mix of county property taxes and state and federal money to finance services.\n\nSeveral speakers at Wednesday’s subcommittee said legislators must commit to a steady source of state money for new children’s services, which would include help for kids in crisis. Polk County Supervisor Angela Connolly said counties want to help, but can’t do it alone.\n\n“You just can’t mandate all these services without a funding stream,” she told legislators.\n\nThe bill passed out of the Senate subcommittee Wednesday and will next be taken up by the Senate Human Resources Committee. A similar bill is being considered in the House.\n\nSen. Jeff Edler, R-State Center, who chaired Wednesday’s subcommittee meeting, said the bill is only the start toward a multi-year effort to build a functioning children’s mental health system. “This gives us the skeleton so we can create that system,” said Edler, who served on the state board that wrote last fall’s more detailed proposal.

Some said they also feel LCDF, an organization that's historically been a primary medical care provider, is failing to listen to its behavioral health clinicians.\n\nLCDF officials said the temporary freeze is needed because they are still ramping up operations after taking over as the main Medicaid-funded provider of mental health services in Las Cruces and southern Doña Ana County on Aug. 1 of last year, following the departure of the Arizona-based La Frontera.\n\nThe freeze on scheduling non-clinical behavioral health clients was effective Feb. 8, according to a Feb. 4 letter written by LCDF's Chief Mental Health Officer Rosario Olivera to the health plans that administer funding on behalf of the state.\n\nA system strained\n\nLCDF Executive Director Suzan Martinez de Gonzales said demand for mental health services has been on the uptick, likely reflecting that clients who'd dropped out of the system since the mid-2013 shake-up are again seeking care. While it has filled some positions, the organization has yet to fill nearly three dozen personnel vacancies. And, there are only so many clients a professional therapist can responsibly see in a given time frame. The quality of care suffers past a certain point, she said.\n\nAs it is, the system — and individual clinicians — are strained, Martinez de Gonzales said.\n\n\"They're doing the work of at least one and a half persons,\" she said. \"They're working hard. It's difficult.\"\n\nWhen La Clinica took over Aug. 1 of last year as the main provider for both adult and child behavioral health care, it took on about 1,700 new clients. But the caseload has continued to grow. Now, La Clinica is serving 2,040 people in its behavioral health division, about a 20 percent increase over six months ago, according to LCDF officials.\n\nLCDF said in August they created a job roster that took on not only staff who were transitioning from La Frontera but also added positions to accommodate the expected increase in demand and to recoup a certain number of staff who'd been laid off by La Frontera in late 2014. There were initially about 55 vacancies, a number that dropped to 45 in late November.\n\nMartinez de Gonzales said last week that the organization has made about 10 additional hires for behavioral health, some of whom still must go through certain processes to start work. That will cut the vacancies down to 35. The trend is in the right direction, she said, but it's still not enough.\n\n\"The demand exceeds the access,\" she said.\n\nOlivera, in the Feb. 4 letter, said four licensed therapists are in the process of being credentialed. They'll likely start work between March 1 and 15, allowing for the freeze to be lifted \"on or before April 1.\"\n\nOlivera specified LCDF is accepting clients who've been referred from a LCDF primary care clinic, the probation and parole office, and from a hospital.\n\nSome experts have said a key goal of routine outpatient therapy for people with a mental illness is to avoid the crisis situations that could lead to short-term or long-term hospitalization.\n\nThe New Mexico Human Services Department, which has an oversight role over behavioral health providers, didn't respond to a request for comment last week.\n\nMartinez de Gonzales in November had expressed concerns about the financial side of the clinic system's behavioral health operations. Last week, she said the organization did get a second infusion of money — the first being a pool of start-up dollars issued as part of LCDF's takeover of services — from the health plans to cover expenses for January. But she said much of the required licensing of practitioners and facilities — which is needed in order to be reimbursed for services provided — is falling into place. She expects the behavioral health division to be financially sound going forward. She credited the state and health plans for working with the cooperatively with LCDF.\n\n\"This will be sustainable,\" she said.\n\nConcerns raised\n\nSome staff who work at La Clinica, who aren't being identified because they expressed concerns about potential retaliation, told the Sun-News they've had increasing demands placed upon them, including requirements to hike individual caseloads. There's been turnover among the staff, with some personnel leaving LCDF because of the conditions.\n\nThey took issue, too, with the amount of supervisory and administrative staff in the LCDF behavioral health division. They said it's the clinical staff — not the non-clinical personnel — who provide the services to clients, which in turn generates the revenue through reimbursements for the organization to stay afloat financially.\n\nAsked to address the concern about numbers of supervisory staff, Martinez de Gonzales said she's putting in place the number of staff she believes will be necessary to run the behavioral health division — and comply with the many rules that apply to it. LCDF is what's known as a Federally Qualified Health Center, which comes with added layers of scrutiny from the state and federal governments.\n\nMartinez de Gonzales said the clinic system has to meet high standards, and to do that has \"added structure\" to the behavioral health division, including a chain of authority. Some employees don't like the changes, she said.\n\n\"There are supervisors for each program,\" she said. \"We're putting in a system of accountability. And it's hard. Our culture is different; the oversight is tremendous and we have to live up to those expectations. We're taking it seriously.\"\n\nMartinez de Gonzales said there has been re-structuring and the creation of a risk manager and compliance manager for behavioral health, but other than that, \"I don't have any more top staff than La Frontera.\"\n\nSome of the employees said there's poor communication between non-clinical administrators and clinical staff, who have experience in the field of mental health care. They said that includes not listening to feedback from clinical personnel.\n\nMartinez de Gonzales said the restructuring should address that, and supervisors are tasked with communicating with employees under them. She said she thinks much of the discontent and the turnover that has happened stems from the intense workload. And the experience of some employees having to switch between employers has been akin to a \"traumatic event.\"\n\n\"They're overwhelmed,\" she said. \"The workload is overwhelming.\"\n\nSome of the behavioral staff said the conditions will create hiring difficulties for LCDF because behavioral health personnel considering applying there often speak with existing personnel before doing so to find out what it's like.\n\nHealth plans respond\n\nThe state contracts with four health plans — called Managed Care Organizations — to administer Medicaid funding and pay claims for low-income residents in need of behavioral health care. The MCOs in turn contract with providers, such as La Clinica, who serve clients.\n\nAsked about the LCDF freeze, Leigh Woodward, spokesperson for Molina Healthcare, an MCO, noted that there are \"several contracted behavioral health providers in the Las Cruces area who are ready to serve our members.\"\n\n\"As part of our commitment to our members, Molina’s member services team is available to assist members with identifying a provider and help arrange appointments,\" Woodward said in an email. \"Additionally, Molina offers telehealth services — virtual office visits with licensed therapists and psychiatrists for behavioral health care. As always, we are working with providers to expand our network to continue to improve access to care.\"\n\nBecky Kenny, spokeswoman for Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Mexico, said in a statement: \"Our priority is to ensure that our members have access to appropriate service providers. La Clinica de Familia stepped into a difficult situation. We will continue to work collaboratively with La Clinica as they work through their transition and build the necessary staffing.\"\n\nSaid Liz Lacouture, executive director of Behavioral Health for Presbyterian Health Plan, \"by notifying us of the situation and continuing to respond to people in crisis, La Clinica de Familia is upholding their contractual obligations.\"\n\n\"At Presbyterian, our priority is always to make sure that our members receive the care they need, when they need it,\" she said. \"We will work closely with our members served by La Clinica de Familia to ensure that there are no disruptions in necessary services.”\n\nUnitedHealthcare is a fourth health plan in the state.\n\nSome mental health advocates highlighted that there are other clinics, such as private practices, where a person can seek help if he or she needs to schedule a mental health appointment.\n\nOngoing shortage\n\nMartinez de Gonzales said a proposal by some residents to recruit psychiatric and mental health professionals to Las Cruces on a community-wide basis, rather than individual clinics or hospitals recruiting them alone, is a promising idea to alleviate a countywide shortage of practitioners. The idea, which proposes to put together recruiting packages tailored to specific individuals who live in other parts of the country, was discussed during a Nov. 23 behavioral health forum at the Doña Ana County Government Center, 845 N. Motel Blvd.\n\nMartinez de Gonzales said if implemented, the strategy would be different from what's happened locally to date.\n\n\"It's a great community to live in,\" she said. \"We have to sell that.\"\n\nCommunity resources\n\nThough not a substitute for professional treatment, two National Alliance for Mental Illness support groups in Las Cruces aim to help both residents who have mental illness and their families cope with the stresses that go along with mental illness.\n\nSusan Michelson is the facilitator for the NAMI Family Support Group, which meets from 6:30 to 8 p.m. on the second and fourth Wednesdays of every month at Peace Lutheran Church, 1701 Missouri Ave., Las Cruces. She said a range of ages of people attend, and numbers of attendees vary at each session. But attendees try to share information and lend a compassionate ear to one another.\n\n\"It's all the things that we as family members of someone who has mental illness (experience) because unless you experience this issue of someone who has a mental disorder, it's mind-boggling,\" she said. \"People don't understand.\"\n\nOften, Michelson said, people don't realize that mental illness affects not only the person living with it, but also the friends and family of the person.\n\n\"It puts the whole family in crisis,\" she said.\n\nThe meetings are free to attend.\n\nA second group, called NAMI Connection, is a \"recovery support group for people living with mental illness in which people learn from each others’ experiences, share coping strategies, and offer each other encouragement and understanding,\" according to the NAMI website.

Last week, state Attorney General Hector Balderas cleared 10 providers — including three that had operated in Doña Ana County — of criminal wrongdoing, though he noted that there were regulatory violations. The allegations led to cuts in funding for the former providers, which led to La Frontera being installed as a new provider.\n\nBut La Frontera floundered financially. Some clients and staff reported disruptions in services. And overall numbers of clients served declined.\n\nLCDF has been told by a consultant that it will take another year and a half — two years after the initial Aug. 1, 2015 transition between providers — to reach a point of feeling comfortable about its behavioral health operations, including staffing levels, said Martinez de Gonzales.\n\nDiana Alba Soular may be reached at 575-541-5443, dalba@lcsun-news.com or @AlbaSoular on Twitter.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/02/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2022/01/13/black-owned-art-gallery-artist-with-a-purpose-opening-leesburg/9187979002/", "title": "Artist with a Purpose: New gallery that meshes art and mental health ...", "text": "Cindy Peterson\n\nSpecial to the Daily Commercial\n\nLEESBURG — What do you get when you combine Semeion Richardson’s passion for mental health advocacy and her love of art?\n\nYou get an Artist with a Purpose.\n\nRichardson is reeling in her mobile art studio and opening a new gallery in downtown Leesburg — the first Black-owned art gallery in the tri-county area.\n\n“My goal is to connect mental health and art together, but also create fun experiences for kids and adults,” Richardson said. “When we are able to express ourselves, we are able to see what is really going on inside. I want to build a bridge from community to unity.”\n\nOn Stage:Two comedies, including 'Yes Virginia,' opening this weekend\n\nLooking for something to do this weekend?:Martin Luther King events, trivia, a food truck rally and more set for the weekend\n\nIn the news this week:COVID-19 in Lake, Sumter: Cases rising in schools, community amid omicron surge\n\nRichardson has some big things planned for her gallery but the first thing she wants everyone to experience is love.\n\n“When you come in, we hope you just love the atmosphere and experience so much love,” Richardson said. “Sometimes people don’t even know if they like art, but this is a way for them to find out. I want to be able to go within and see what’s within you to bring it out on the canvas.”\n\nRichardson was a suicide-crisis counselor for more than seven years. Working with mainly teens and seniors really showed her how much hurt is in the world.\n\n“I took what I knew from there and then I had art,” Richardson said. “My degree is in art and behavior analysis so I combined those things together because I found it really helps. I have been able to connect more with people when creativity is involved.”\n\nOne of the children’s programs Richardson leads is SolePurpose, where kids paint on shoes to express things they are feeling or going through in their lives.\n\nShe has also experienced first-hand how grief can effect everyday life after her mother passed away from cancer five years ago.\n\n“Mental health is just not talked about enough,” Richardson said. “Grief is hard, especially with everyone dealing with COVID. People staying inside for a year can run people crazy. But it taught me how to appreciate time more, taking a breath to go outside and listen to the birds and not be in a rush.”\n\nRichardson said that art helped her tremendously in dealing with the grief of losing her mom. It clicked that if that worked for her, she could help other people as well.\n\nArtist with a Purpose is also partnering with the School of the Hands of God in Haiti, where more than 400 kids get to experience the expressiveness of art.\n\n“We find what’s inside and bring it out,” Richardson said. “It’s therapeutic art to express whatever you’re dealing with. Or it can be just a regular art class to just have fun. Either way, it’s expressing what you’re feeling.”\n\nArtist with a Purpose grand opening\n\nArtist with a Purpose is hosting its Caribbean-style grand opening on Saturday, Jan. 22 from 4 to 6 p.m. at 411 W.

I’m totally excited you volunteered to be a part of this,\" Nashville police Chief John Drake told the test team inside a Mental Health Cooperative classroom in Metro Center. \"Whatever resources we need to put into it, we will.\"\n\nThe pilot involves reality based training and scenario acting and was developed on the MNPD side by alternative policing office Inspector David Imhof.\n\n\"When calls for service come in, they will arrive together,\" Imhof said. \"Officers will stabilize the scene, and mental health experts will assess. The goal is to make sure people get all the help they need, avoid jail, limit the number of people who go to the hospital and avoid future incidents.\"\n\nThe team will receive 40 hours of training from mental health professionals, Amanda Bracht, the senior vice president of clinical services at the health agency, said.\n\nAll MNPD officers already receive 58 hours of de-escalation training, Drake noted.\n\n\"In the academy with those hours, the primary goal is for a person starting at zero knowledge of mental illness and bringing them to be familiar with the different types of mental illness, kind of like a basic 101 class you would have in college,\" said North Precinct Officer Mary Hall, who volunteered to be trained. \"You're not majoring in psychology or biology but you're going to take classes to introduce you to what's going on.\"\n\nOfficers currently are limited in how much help they can provide, she said.\n\n\"I'm not a professional and I don't have that person with me to provide what they need,\" the 24-year-old, two-year MNPD veteran said. \"We just leave depending on the situation.\"\n\nThe group will use the combined expertise of officers and behavioral health specialists to de-escalate situations and help link those with behavioral health issues to appropriate services.\n\n\"Being educated a little bit more about how to talk to them and be with them through this and give them services, as well as have someone else who completely dedicates their job to it, we're able to give more time, effort and energy in providing them with a service that will hopefully not only take care of the situation at hand, but prevent them from calling again,\" Hall said on day four of the week-long training.\n\nOn this issue:A Brentwood mother called 911 to get help for her son. Hours later, police shot him and he died\n\n'2000 calls in 2020'\n\nMNPD leaders chose to start the program with North and Hermitage precinct officers based on department call response numbers from last year. Imhof said officers responded to about 2000 calls in 2020 involving people experiencing a mental health crisis.\n\nThe pilot program team will work the North and Hermitage precincts for now, Imhof said. But, he said, they could get called into other precincts to help until officers there are trained.\n\nMNPD runs three shifts. Teams will work the 6:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. shift, followed by the 2:30 to 11 p.m. shift, Imnof said.\n\nAlthough the group is starting with six clinicians, that number will likely grow.\n\n\"If we go 24-7, we’re going to need a lot more clinicians,\" Bracht said.\n\nThe police department, Imhof said, is working in conjunction with Nashville Mayor John Cooper's office, the Metro Public Health Department, the Nashville Fire Department and more on the pilot.\n\n\"It’s been a true collaboration,\" he said. \"It’s a community program. The pilot program is to find out what works and what doesn’t. Every situation will be unique … a lot of times these calls are unpredictable.\"\n\nOther large metropolitan cities including Memphis, Denver and Houston have similar mental health response teams.\n\nMNPD is basing it's team on Denver's model.\n\nOn Friday, MNPD Office of Alternate Policing Strategies Capt. Terrance Graves said the department hopes the next group of about 50 officers will be in the classroom before September.\n\nMeanwhile, he said, MNPD will assess which precincts will enter the next training.\n\n\"Ultimately we want to train all of patrol,\" Graves said.\n\nActive scenario practice\n\nDuring one active scenario practice session this week, Mike Randolph, Mental Health Cooperative emergency psychiatric services program manager, discussed the importance of emotional labeling.\n\nThe team, ranging from officers who'd been on the job for just a few years to long-time department veterans, worked on active listening skills via conversations focusing on people with suicidal thoughts, domestic violence victims and others in crisis.\n\nPolice took turns role playing both officer and person in need with the six mental health pros.\n\n\"I’m embarrassed that you had to come out here,\" a counselor said during one exercise.\n\n\"I understand you are embarrassed but you called us and we had to come out here and we are here to help. Just tell me what happened today,\" an officer playing a person in need responded, his voice soft and soothing.\n\nRandolph said it is crucial for officers not to zone out during interactions with those in crisis.\n\n\"People don’t feel engaged. They feel hurt. Respond with, 'I can hear anger in your voice and it seems like this situation has hurt you also.' A person is going to hear it and feel heard. That is what we want for de-escalation.\"\n\nNatalie Neysa Alund is based in Nashville at The Tennessean and covers breaking news across the South for the USA TODAY Network.

The planned new facility will have an observation unit, a short-term inpatient unit, and a walk-in clinic. There also will be an on-site pharmacy.\n\nThe center will be built on a three-acre site that ADAMH owns on Harmon Avenue east of South Souder Avenue, across from the Franklin County Children's Services building south of Interstate 70 near Franklinton.\n\nThat's close to the county's new $360 million jail, being built on Fisher Road west of Downtown. In October, Franklin County Commissioner Kevin Boyce said people who end up in jail are often in crisis themselves, and a mental health facility nearby will help.\n\nThe planned facility has received $4 million in recent donations, including:\n\n• $2.5 million from the Osteopathic Heritage Foundations.\n\n• $1 million from the Robert F. Wolfe and Edgar T. Wolfe Foundation.\n\n• $500,000 from the Columbus Foundation.\n\nA summer groundbreaking is planned for the project, being led by the Alcohol Drug and Mental Health Board of Franklin County (ADAMH).\n\nErika Clark Jones, ADAMH chief executive, told The Dispatch she is optimistic that $50-million goal will be met.\n\n\"We’re mainly targeting corporate foundations,\" she said.\n\nADAMH is contributing $8 million, and officials have asked for $500,000 from the federal government, she said.\n\nEarlier funders include the state of Ohio, Franklin County, the city of Columbus, and the adult hospital systems in Franklin County: Mount Carmel, OhioHealth and the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center.\n\nDoug Kridler, the president and CEO of the Columbus Foundation, said discussions began a decade ago about the need for such a center.

The Class of 2019 grads said the hike is the first official action for their new organization called the “Concept Project,” which they want to grow to put on large-scale outdoor events to raise awareness for critical social issues.\n\nThe hike is called “Highs and Lows,” and by walking from the base of the highest point in New Hampshire to the state’s lowest point at the beach, it is meant to exemplify the emotional highs and lows everybody has felt over the past year, not just those with diagnosed mental illnesses. The group of friends are inviting hikers to join them for all or portions of the trek and have started a GoFundMe campaign to solicit donations to be donated to the New Hampshire chapter of the National Alliance of Mental Illness, they said.\n\n“The walk will represent the various highs and lows everyone experiences throughout their day; one minute you can be on top of the world and the next, you can find yourself in a bad place,” said Roberts, a sophomore at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. “We figured no one walks 108 miles from Mount Washington in the middle of December so we’ll raise attention just from doing that.”\n\nDelli Colli got the ball rolling for the Concept Project in November while attending Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Delli Colli completed a 150-kilometer walk around the province as a tribute to the 22 victims of the worst mass shooting in modern Canadian history back in April.\n\nDelli Colli said he and a friend raised more than 10,000 Canadian dollars by mimicking the route the shooter took during the 13-hour rampage around the province and met with surviving family members and had groups of people join them for stretches. He said the proceeds will be donated to help build a new community center outside Halifax.\n\n“My main goal for doing the first walk was to learn about the communities that were touched by the tragedy and meet people who were affected; on the last day of 10 hours of hiking, we were never alone for a minute,” said Delli Colli, now a sophomore at Dalhousie. “In the (U.S.), gun violence has been unfortunately normalized in a way but up here people don’t see it as a Canadian issue, so my mind was blown this was the largest shooting in Canadian history, but it doesn’t crack the top 10 in the U.S.”\n\nDelli Colli said he hopes to replicate the support for the Highs and Lows walk and lay the groundwork for future Concept Project endeavors, which Roberts said can be done in, “any place” to support solving pressing issues to any specific community.\n\n“I’m most excited to showcase the state that I live in, and for me personally, I’m doing this to benefit my own personal mental health,” Delli Colli said. “We’re so lucky for our mental health to live in a place where you can ski on a Saturday and go surfing on Sunday. It’ll be great to walk through the landscape and see the mountains disappear and turn into the beach.”\n\nDaswani said final preparations are being made and the group will rely on a number of fire stations between North Conway and the Seacoast to sleep in for the night before heading out bright and early the following morning. She said she anticipates them walking anywhere between 22 and 28 miles per day to complete the trek within five days.\n\n“A lot of my friends I know are having a hard time mentally getting through the pandemic,” said Daswani, a sophomore at Suffolk University in Boston. “It’ll be a really accomplishing feeling stepping onto the beach knowing that we made a difference for people who are struggling right now.”\n\nDelli Colli said by completing the Highs and Lows walk he and his friends hope to grow the Concept Project into a goodwill-inspiring social network of sorts so people feel empowered to lead relatively simple outdoor events, yet large in ambition and scale, to spread positivity following a gloomy year for everyone.\n\n“We are all truly in this together even if we seem so far apart, so this walk is a visual representation of that and it’ll hopefully put people in better head spaces,” Delli Colli said. “We want to cap off 2020 with some positive news, and while nothing is guaranteed, hope next year turns out better.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/york-star/2024/02/01/sweetser-opens-new-mental-health-clinic-in-sanford-with-4m-grant/72406131007/", "title": "Sweetser opens new mental health clinic in Sanford with $4M grant", "text": "SANFORD, Maine — After years of limited resources and capabilities, Sweetser in Sanford is now able to help more people than ever before and chart a course of growth in the coming years.\n\nSweetser, a statewide behavioral health provider, recently opened a new certified community behavioral health clinic (CCBHC) at 863 Main Street in downtown Sanford, thanks to a $4 million federal grant.

Reservations accepted only for parties of six or more.\n\nThe Buttery, one of Lewes' most recognizable restaurants, has been revamped and renamed.\n\nThe longtime eatery at the corner of Second Street and Savannah Road owned by Wilson Gates and family members was rechristened the 2nd Street Tavern on May 1. The family has owned the restaurant since 2016.\n\nThe Buttery has been a part of Lewes since 1994 when then longtime owners John Donato and Twain Gonzales created a thriving business, featuring fine French cuisine, at the former New Devon Inn, now the Hotel Rodney.\n\nThe eatery, featured in magazines such as the now-defunct Gourmet and Bon Appetit, eventually outgrew its site.\n\nIn 1999, The Buttery moved from its home to what is known as the Trader mansion off one of the town's main thoroughfares in the historic district. The partners brought in Lewes architectural designer John Lester to help restore the Victorian gingerbread, a landmark built about 1894.\n\nEarlier, it had been a private home of a sea pilot and the longtime home of the Trader family, who own a jewelry store in town. It also had been a boarding house and home to an antique shop.\n\nWhen a pipe burst in the restaurant in December 2018, The Buttery was closed for repairs.\n\nExtensive renovations were required, so the Gates family decided to change to a more casual concept. Gone are the heavy draperies and the old name. The restaurant has reopened with new flooring, a new bar area and a revamped seating area for patrons to enjoy drinks and snacks. The corner round table overlooking Savannah Road and Second Street now has a cool chandelier that looks almost like a glass octopus. It's a place to be and be seen.\n\nThe new menu includes some dishes that were on the menu of the Gates family's former Lewes restaurant The Gate House at 109 W. Market St,. which has been rebranded as Bushi Sushi.\n\nThe current 2nd Street Tavern menu has pork belly bao bun tacos ($12.95), pimento beer cheese ($9.95), stuffed clams with whiskey bacon butter ($15.95), the Impossible Burger ($16.95) and shrimp po'boy sandwiches ($14.95).\n\nThe restaurant will honor gifts cards and online gift card purchases made through The Buttery.\n\nHowever, any promotional cards such as \"Brunch for Two\" or handwritten cards will not be honored. The restaurant says they will try to accommodate a solution for those cards, but they were hit with a rash of “fake” handwritten gift cards.\n\nRaas\n\n210 Savannah Road, Lewes; raaslewes.com\n\nLast summer, the newly formed Masala Hospitality Group was in the initial stages of planning an Indian restaurant in a purple, three-story Queen Anne Victorian house on Lewes' Savannah Road.\n\nOver the past year, they've been renovating the former Ocean Retreat Day Spa & Hair Studio.\n\nThe house, built in 1899, has been repainted a much more soothing blue and will soon become Raas, an Indian fusion-Pan Asian restaurant.\n\nIt will be the second Indian restaurant in Sussex County after Indigo, which opened in 2017 on Rehoboth Avenue in Rehoboth Beach. The name Raas means a celebration of culture and food.\n\nRaas will be led by India-born Chef Gyandera Gupta, known as \"Chef GG.\" He has worked at Taj Mahal Bombay; Vivanta by Taj and Taj Holiday Village, both in Goa; Jai Mahal Palace of Taj in Jaipur; and in the Caribbean.\n\nNo menu was available yet. Stay tuned.\n\nGo to raaslewes.com for latest updates.\n\nChaps Pit Beef\n\nCoastal Station shopping center, 19791 Coastal Highway (Del. 1), Rehoboth Beach; chapspitbeef.com; 302-727-5284. Hours: 10:30 a.m. to 9 p.m.\n\nBaltimore's “World Famous” barbecue pit beef sandwich has made its way to Delaware.\n\nChaps Pit Beef, a Maryland favorite since 1987, opened a new location in March in Coastal Station off Del. 1, next to the Iron Hill Brewery & Restaurant in Rehoboth.\n\nOwners/brothers Chris and Gary Desch are continuing the Chaps tradition of cooking beef on a charcoal pit. You can smell the smoke before you enter the front door.\n\nThe eatery, where customers order at the counter, has high and low tables, as well as picnic-style seating and three outdoor tables with umbrellas. There also is a bar featuring craft beers and, coming soon, selected bourbons.\n\nWe stopped in recently for a $13.95 daily special which included the \"Famous Pit Beef Sandwich,\" small fries and a small soft drink.\n\nDon't believe what you read. A small fry is anything but small. It's actually a giant pile of hot, boardwalk-style French fries that are very good.\n\nThe counter clerk suggested we get the beef cooked medium and it was sliced thin and plentiful with a smoky flavor on a soft, almost squishy bun.\n\nYou'll get charged extra for add-ons such as lettuce and tomato ($.70), American cheese ($.75) ranch dressing ($1) and jalapenos ($1).\n\nBut the condiments bar does a variety of toppings including free horseradish and pickles, and sauces ranging from barbecue to \"tiger sauce,\" a blend of mayonnaise and horseradish.\n\nNalu Hawaiian Surf Bar and Grille\n\n41 Rehoboth Ave., Rehoboth Beach. Hours: 11 a.m. to midnight daily.\n\nIt's the second location for this Hawaiian-themed eatery that has been a part of Dewey Beach since 2008. The new site, the former Wilmington College location on Rehoboth Avenue, is just steps away from the boardwalk and the ocean.\n\nIt resembles a tiki bar from the outside with its thatched exterior.\n\nThe casual setting is in a perfect location. Recently, doors were wide open to let in the sounds of the squawking seagulls. Inside, ocean wave murals decorate walls, surfboards substitute for tables and the top of the bar continuously changes colors of the rainbow. (We really like the red.)\n\nNalu owner Regan Derrickson told our sister publication, delmarvanow.com, the restaurant will have \"its own identity\" from the original, Hawaiian-themed location in Dewey.\n\nThe menu has poke bowls, a spam BLT and Kona-braised short rib tacos. Kona Brewing Co. beers are on draft and Kapu drinks are served in a pineapple shell.\n\nThe coconut shrimp was hot and crunchy and a nice nosh to go along with a Mai Tai and a Maui Mule, a \"Hawaiian-style\" Moscow Mule which sounds funky but was very refreshing and satisfying.\n\nRise Up Coffee Roasters\n\n502 Rehoboth Ave, Rehoboth, riseupcoffee.com\n\nRise Up Coffee, an independent small-batch coffee roaster and retailer for the past 14 years, has popped up next to the traffic circle as you drive into downtown Rehoboth. It takes over a former 7-Eleven location.\n\nThe business was founded in St. Michaels, Maryland, by owner Tim Cureton in a tricked-out coffee trailer. The double-sided drive-thru is open all year.\n\nRise Up serves only organic coffees that are generally considered a medium roast.\n\nRise Up also has Maryland locations in Salisbury, Ocean City, Cambridge, Annapolis, Edgewater and a coffee roastery in Easton, Maryland, in a former gas station that dates back to the 1920s.\n\nThe Rehoboth location will serve breakfast with items such as smothered kimchi Tater tots, rockfish tacos, burritos and breakfast sandwiches made with bacon, sausage and scrapple.\n\nThe Pines\n\n56 Baltimore Ave., Rehoboth; thepinesrb.com; 302-567-2726. Hours: Dinner served daily at 5 p.m. Happy hour is from 3:30 to 6 p.m. Monday through Saturday.\n\nThe Pines has been a work in progress for more than a year and a half.\n\nRenovations began in 2017 to transform the old Hobos, which bowed out in 2016, into a \"modern coastal tavern\" with a menu that reflects both the land and the sea.\n\nOwner/partners are Bob Suppies, a Maine native and Rehoboth resident since 1997 who has had a career in retail, and Tyler Townsend, a former baseball player who was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles in 2009.\n\nThe building, dating back to least the 1970s, has been gutted inside and out. The main entrance is now on the side of the building. It's modern and sleek and unrecognizable from its darker and cramped Hobos years.\n\nThe restaurant opened in early December. During a recent weekday visit, the second floor, which has a lounge, live music and bar, was not open. There is a cool balcony and outdoor area overlooking Baltimore Avenue that kind of reminds me of some of the Bourbon Street buildings in New Orleans.\n\nThe building has a modern flair, but also pays homage to old Rehoboth. The Pines name comes from an old Rehoboth postcard that read \"where the pine forest meets the ocean.\"\n\nMany dishes are multi-layered. Hummus three ways ($11) in an intriguing idea and it came with little scoops of red wine fig, sweet potato and chickpea-flavored dips with sides of pickled carrots and asparagus and homemade chips.\n\nNone of the three flavors totally won my group over. Mostly we left wishing for just one great hummus. (Think of the fabulous Zahav in Philadelphia.)\n\nLobster spaetzle mac balls were two deep-fried bocce-size balls with a nice crunch, but seemed in need of a sprinkling of salt.\n\nTraditionalists might frown at the clams and housemade linguine ($19) given it's served with black and \"white\" pasta as well as spongy-tasting seafood sausage, sea beans and tasso butter. The clams, however, were nicely cooked and not too chewy.\n\nA better bet might be the ginseng and tea-brined, grilled pork chop ($31) with apple and juniper spelt pilaf, kimchi carrots and huckleberry gastrique.\n\nOther menu items include seared scallops and butterfly pea \"purple\" risotto ($33) with arugula and beet butter and a hand-ground T.A. Farms beef burger ($16) with fries.\n\nPlaya Bowls\n\n220 Rehoboth Ave., Rehoboth, www.playabowls.com\n\nAfter the wild success of the Newark restaurant, which opened in February 2018, the owners of Playa Bowls decided to increase their Delaware locations.\n\nA new site was added to the Middletown area at 832 Kohl Ave. in the Hedgelawn Plaza. And now another shop featuring the popular acai bowls is coming very soon to downtown Rehoboth, just across from the fire station.\n\nIt's not surprising Playa Bowls is opening at the Delaware beach given that the first one originated on the boardwalk in Belmar, New Jersey, in 2014.\n\nFounders Rob Giuliani and Abby Taylor are New Jersey shore natives and longtime surfers. They opened the business after being inspired by surf trips to Costa Rica, Puerto Rico, California, Hawaii, Nicaragua and Panama.\n\nAlmost every town they visited offered versions of acai or pitaya bowls.\n\nWe're fans of the Newark location and have become hooked on the Tropical Bowl ($9), pure açaí topped with granola, bananas, pineapple, coconut flakes and honey. Another favorite is Nutella ($11) which includes açaí, banana, strawberry, coconut flakes and Nutella drizzle.\n\nBreakfast Guru Restaurant & Bar\n\n19 Wilmington Ave., Rehoboth Beach; breakfast-guru.com; 302-567-2829 Hours: 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. daily\n\nThis family-owned breakfast restaurant, which opened in early May, takes over the spot of a short-lived Italian eatery, and there are still Italian seaside murals on the wall.\n\nBreakfast is always big in a beach town and Breakfast Guru is laser-focused on the most important meal of the day.\n\nThe menu includes the basics such as The Shore breakfast ($11), which is two eggs, a choice of sausage or two thick strips of bacon, house potatoes and a choice of bread or breakfast burritos ($14) made with ribeye steak or sausage, eggs, potatoes and pepper jack cheese wrapped in a soft tortilla served with fried tomato bacon sauce.\n\nThere are ham-and-spinach crepes, omelets, eggs Benedict, French toast, waffles, pancakes and breakfast tacos made with chorizo sausage and potatoes, a sunny side up egg along with garnishes of sliced radishes, sprinkles of feta or ricotta and fresh cilantro.\n\nLooking to satisfy the sweet tooth? The Campfire Delight ($10) is graham cracker-crusted challah bread topped with toasted marshmallows and chocolate sauce.\n\nSteamin' Blues Crabhouse\n\n29 Baltimore Ave., Rehoboth; visit Steamin’ Blues Crabhouse Facebook page\n\nComing soon to downtown Rehoboth will be Steamin' Blues, a new crabhouse from the owners of The Surfing Crab Restaurant & Bar at 16723 Coastal Highway (Del. 1) in Lewes.\n\nOwner Donald Vechery is taking over the former Jakes Seafood Restaurant site in Rehoboth at the corner of First Street and Baltimore Avenue. Renovations have been ongoing for several months.\n\nIt will be a second location for The Surfing Crab.\n\nWhat else:\n\n• El Dorado Mexican Restaurant, the Rehoboth Baja-style taco shop in business for more than 12 years, closed in late December. The 18766 John J. Williams Highway (Del. 24) site is now Dos Locos Fajitas & Stone Grill.\n\n• Crust & Craft pizza restaurant off Del. 1, formerly owned by chef Brenton Wallace, was sold in February to Rehoboth-based hospitality group SoDel Concepts, which owns such popular Sussex County eateries as Bluecoast and Matt's Fish Camp. Nina Maddox is the new executive chef at the Midway shopping center restaurant that specializes in wood-fired pizza, pasta and craft beer.\n\n• The former Sandy Pony Donuts food truck, owned by Brea and Ben Wang, has morphed into a brick-and-mortar location at 115 Garfield Parkway in downtown Bethany Beach. The shop also will be selling acai bowls. The Wangs will no longer be operating the Sandy Pony food truck in South Bethany Beach, nor their Wang's World food truck. Call Sandy Pony at 301- 775-2005.\n\n• Ristorante Zebra, the seasonal Italian eatery at 32 Lake Ave., Rehoboth, known for its safari-themed decor, has closed. It will become a coastal Italian seafood restaurant called Sazio run by Big Fish Restaurant Group. Italian is not a new concept for Big Fish. Previously, they ran Bella Coast Italian Kitchen & Market on Concord Pike in Brandywine Hundred before selling the restaurant in December 2017 to Touch of Italy.\n\n• Owner Chris McKeown of Agave Mexican Restaurant & Tequila Bar, a Lewes favorite since 2008 and one of Delaware's busiest restaurants, is planning a second location in Rehoboth next to the Summer House at 230 Rehoboth Ave. So far, only the sign announcing the new restaurant is standing at the location.\n\nContact Patricia Talorico at (302) 324-2861 or ptalorico@delawareonline.com and on Twitter @pattytalorico\n\nMore: Scrapple hot dogs topped with lobster?

But, before it had a chance to begin welcoming patrons, a fire – which caused $750,000 in damages – destroyed the building as well an adjacent lighthouse.\n\nThe lighthouse, deemed structurally unsafe after the fire, had been on the site for decades. It was not rebuilt.\n\nThe rest of the multimillion-dollar project survived the fire, including Delaware's first Hyatt Place, an expanded beach, luxury bayfront condominiums, and an event center with a 4,800-square-foot ballroom.

The May 7 party from 7 to 10 p.m. will give visitors a \"sneak peek tour\" of the 9,400-square-foot building. It will be the last day of food service at the pub until the other building is scheduled to open around mid May.\n\nThe original pub will remain open throughout the summer for guests to purchase merchandise and to fill growlers and crowlers to-go. The old building eventually will be razed and replaced with a beer patio that will connect the site to the Calagiones' seafood restaurant Chesapeake & Maine at 316 Rehoboth Ave., which they opened in March 2016.\n\nIt's a heady time for Dogfish Head, the smallest American brewery when it opened in 1995. The company, based in Milton, has grown into a top-20 craft brewery and currently sells beer in 35 states and Washington, D.C. It plans to expand sales into more states this year.\n\nSam Calagione, founder of the Milton craft brewery, has received his seventh consecutive James Beard Award finalist nomination in the category of most outstanding Wine, Beer, or Spirits Professional. The prestigious award, considered one of the highest U.S. honors for food and beverage professionals, is given to a beer, wine, or spirits professional who has made a significant national impact on the restaurant industry.\n\nSTORY: El Diablo Burritos moving into Pike Creek\n\nCalagione will be competing on May 1 in Chicago against fellow Beard nominees Diane Flynt of Foggy Ridge Cider in Dugspur, Virginia; Miljenko Grgich of Grgich Hills Estate in Rutherford, California; Aldo Sohm of New York City's Zalto Glass; and Rob Tod of Allagash Brewing Company in Portland, Maine.\n\nCalagione is the lone beverage and culinary professional representing Delaware at the Beard Awards this year. Chesapeake & Maine was named earlier this year by the James Beard Foundation as having one of the best bar programs in the United States. The Rehoboth restaurant focuses on seafood from the Chesapeake region and from Maine, and it serves creative cocktails using Dogfish Head's own line of distilled spirits.\n\nDogfish Head founder and CEO Sam Calagione also is planning to release a new book in August titled, \"Project Extreme Brewing: An Enthusiast's Guide to Extreme Brewing at Home.\"\n\nDogfish Head Brewings & Eats serves wood-grilled pizzas, steaks, seafood and sandwiches and customers know they can find in-house-only experimental brews and small-batch spirits at the restaurant. For more than 20 years, residents and tourists have been making year-round pilgrimages to Rehoboth to sample its latest \"off-centered,\" award-winning beer creations. In 2015, Wine Enthusiast named Dogfish Head its Brewery of the Year.\n\nYet, the quest to build a new Dogfish Head brewpub in Rehoboth initially had a rocky start.\n\nThe Rehoboth Avenue building that now houses the restaurant had once been home to a crab house, and later became \"a succession of failed restaurants,\" Sam Calagione has said. The Calagiones wanted to create a better atmosphere for customers and improve the aging restaurant's look with a new structure that's about 1,500 square feet larger than the original site.\n\nBut in April 2015, when the couple initially asked the city's Board of Adjustment for permission to expand and create a modern building, they were turned down. One board member even suggested they move the business out of downtown Rehoboth.\n\nSTORY: Dogfish Head fights to protect its brand\n\nMany in the Rehoboth business community were stunned and angry by the board's decision, citing that the year-round restaurant and distillery is not only a tourist destination with a well-regarded national reputation, but its popularity helps other businesses, especially during winter months.\n\nDogfish Head eventually received city approval to tear down the brewpub and create a new building that will feature an outdoor courtyard and a stage area for concerts. Co-owner Mariah Calagione has said the renovations will take place in two stages and the brewpub will remain open during construction.\n\nThe new Dogfish Head brewpub will likely be the last restaurant of its scale in Rehoboth. In November 2016, Rehoboth Beach commissioners voted on restaurant size limits. Eateries that serve alcohol within the city will now be allowed 2,500 square feet of seated dining area and 500 square feet of bar area, with no limits on storage or kitchen space.\n\nThis is a change from the previously allowed 5,000-square-foot total — an area regulation that had been in effect for two decades. The ordinance also regulates brewpubs, dining establishments which make, bottle and sell alcohol on site. Such establishments will only be allowed to produce up to 4,000 barrels of beer per year.\n\nDogfish Head's original brewpub, which clocks in at 8,280 square feet, has always been grandfathered in past that rule.\n\nContact Patricia Talorico at (302) 324-2861 or ptalorico@delawareonline.com and on Twitter @pattytalorico", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/04/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2018/10/24/restaurant-openings-and-closings-across-delmarva/1729472002/", "title": "Restaurant openings and closings across Delmarva 2018", "text": "When looking for the perfect restaurant experience, Delmarva has a variety of options.\n\nThe peninsula has seen its fair share of restaurants opening and closing this year.

The conservancy, which purchased the property in September 2021, is retaining the remaining 15 acres for programming.\n\nThe purchase price wasn't disclosed. The park service said the purchase is part of the park’s long-term plan for improved public access and habitat restoration in the area.\n\n“We are delighted that the transfer of the former Brandywine Golf Course property to the National Park Service is now complete, officially adding this beautiful acreage to Cuyahoga Valley National Park for the benefit and enjoyment of our visitors and our communities now and into the future,” CVNP Superintendent Lisa Petit said in a statement. “We are especially grateful to our partner, Conservancy for Cuyahoga Valley National Park, for their tireless efforts to protect and remediate this property for the American public.”\n\nWhy is the Brandywine golf course property still closed?\n\nThe park service said that remediation work on the property is set to begin early this year, with the conservancy overseeing the project with Mentor-based HZW Environmental Consultants. The conservancy received a $4.5 million Ohio Brownfield Remediation Program grant award from the Ohio Department of Development for the work.\n\nPeninsula and CVNP:'The heart of the national park': Peninsula seeks to mend relationship with CVNP\n\nAccording to the conservancy, the remediation work will include the removal of contaminated soil. Sampling on the property identified the presence of mercury in the shallow soil of the tee boxes, putting greens and some fairways. The use of fungicides and herbicides containing mercury dates to the 1950s and continued through the 1990s. The products were routinely applied multiple times per year using industry-standard practices.\n\nThe conservancy said that during the process, called a dig and haul, a firm with a background in handling toxic waste will dig down and remove the soil. The conservancy said that mercury in this form is relatively immobile, and there is no threat to humans on the property. The contaminated soil will be taken to a landfill equipped and approved to oversee the soil and will be managed there in perpetuity.\n\nThe conservancy said that mercury is a cumulative bioaccumulative toxin in wildlife, meaning that once ingested, mercury isn't excreted but instead accumulates in fatty tissues and organs. Wildlife potentially affected include animals that are consumed by “top of the chain” predators (like raptors that prey on shrews and voles), the conservancy said.\n\nThe conservancy said that plans for future conservation work include restoration of two streams that were channeled and buried to assist in creating fertile farmland and, later, the golf course.\n\n“Since 2019, the Conservancy worked diligently to save this property in the heart of our park to protect habitat as well as create a space for all to enjoy the land and Cuyahoga River,” Conservancy for CVNP President and CEO Deb Yandala said in a statement. “We are grateful to the community, especially the individuals and foundations who stepped up to join us in our efforts to preserve this land for the National Park Service.”\n\nCuyahoga Valley National Park involving village of Peninsula in site plan\n\nThe park service said that once the remediation phase is complete later this year, a site plan, including visitor amenities, will be established in coordination with community and public input, especially the village of Peninsula.\n\nPeninsula, as well as the Woodridge Local School District Board of Education, opposed the conservancy purchasing the former golf course. The village wanted the property to remain privately owned and developed, saying it was the only significant vacant tract of land in the village suitable for major economic development projects.\n\nBut the village in October approved a resolution recognizing itself as a Cuyahoga Valley National Park Gateway Community, deciding to leave the past in the past and reflecting the pair's commitment to each other moving forward, despite their difficult history.\n\nThe conservancy hired PROS Consulting from Indianapolis in the fall of 2021 to complete a conceptual plan for the acreage on the west side of Akron-Peninsula Road, with input from conservancy board leadership and staff, National Park Service staff, community stakeholders and partners.\n\nThe conservancy said the plan includes increasing opportunities for river access, supporting creative programming and welcoming new, diverse audiences to the national park. It also suggests possible amenities like accessible trails, access to the river, river vistas from pavilions and nature play spaces, space for public programming and a bridge connecting to the Towpath Trail.\n\nFor project updates, visit forcvnp.org/riverfront.\n\nContact Beacon Journal reporter Emily Mills at emills@thebeaconjournal.com and on Twitter @EmilyMills818.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2022/03/28/brandywine-country-club-plan-education-center/9452257002/", "title": "Brandywine Country Club saga continues with new plan, education ...", "text": "On a weekday afternoon behind the chain-link fence that guards the former Brandywine Country Club, cars hum past on a two-lane road that's been the subject of a seven-year debate.\n\nThis stretch of Shipley Road is less than a mile east of Concord Pike, northern Wilmington's central retail corridor.

The site is adjacent to the Virginia Kendall area of the park to the south, Camp Manatoc and Camp Butler to the east and the Cuyahoga River to the west.\n\nThe closure came after owner-operator Ryan Yesberger died by suicide at the property in 2018 after police said he attacked an officer and took his gun. Yesberger apparently took over ownership from his father, Brett Yesberger, sometime after he died in 2009. Brett Yesberger's father, Earl Yesberger, who died in 1988, designed Brandywine in the 1960s, according to his obituary.\n\nThe conservancy signed a purchase agreement in 2019 to acquire the property, with plans to convert it to parkland. Brandywine Country Club Inc. is still listed as the property owner in county property records.\n\nPeninsula Village Council is considering a resolution expressing its and the mayor’s “heartfelt displeasure” with the efforts of CVNP and the nonprofit conservancy to control the property, saying they “respectfully implore” the conservancy and CVNP to permit it to be privately owned and developed.\n\nThe resolution was introduced at the council’s September meeting. The council only meets once a month and is expected to give the resolution three readings, which means the council would vote on it at its November meeting.\n\n\"I think that the council feels and myself as the mayor feels that we needed to put in writing how much we think that the purchase of this piece of property just sets the village back more than it's already been set back by the national park,” said Peninsula Mayor Daniel Schneider Jr. \"I don't know that this is the answer; even that piece of property isn't the final answer to everything. But the more that we give up, we'll never get it back.\"\n\nBoston Township and CVNP:Boston Township trustee says community still feeling aftereffects of CVNP formation\n\nThings to do in Peninsula, Boston Township:Community Spotlight: Peninsula and Boston Township offer hiking, biking, shopping and more\n\nCVNP, conservancy respond\n\nA joint statement issued by Deb Yandala, president of the Conservancy for Cuyahoga Valley National Park, and Lisa Petit, superintendent of Cuyahoga Valley National Park, said they share the mayor and council’s concern for the well-being of Peninsula residents and “have always strived to work cooperatively with the Village to find answers to issues they have raised, including a sewage system.”\n\nThey said they support and promote visitor services, including those provided by merchants in Peninsula, and make it a priority to encourage visitation to CVNP and Peninsula as ways to support the region’s economy.\n\nTheir employees who work in Peninsula and Boston Township pay taxes to both communities, they said, adding that both the conservancy and CVNP provide annual support to local government entities, including the Valley Fire District\n\nBut Yandala and Petit said the former golf course has “unique environmental and recreational value and plays an essential role in protecting the water quality of the Cuyahoga River.”\n\nThey also said the purchase of the property was made possible by donations from residents and foundations throughout Northeast Ohio.\n\n“They made these contributions because they want to support a vision for this region that values our environment and the quality of life that open space and parks provide,” the statement reads.\n\nIn fall 2020, when they began working on ideas for future uses of the property, they said they invited the mayor and two representatives of his choice to join the planning team.\n\n“We look forward to hearing further from the public in the future as part of our master planning process,” the statement reads. “While some have expressed interest in seeing the property used for private development, we remain committed to safeguarding it for public good with value to the local community and the region.”\n\nBut Peninsula Village council member John Krusinski said the committee meetings — which he said he attended along with Schneider and Peninsula Planning Commission Chair Karen Walters — abruptly stopped.\n\nPark land is tax-exempt\n\nAccording to the 2020 census, the village’s population is 536 people. But some of the more than 2 million visitors venturing into nearby CVNP each year stop in the 4.4-square-mile village, using the roads and other village services — but not paying for them as taxpayers.\n\nThe village, which becomes the North Pole during the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad’s annual Christmas train ride, has several small shops lining the streets of its downtown catering to the hikers and bikers visiting the national park.\n\nBut other than tourism, there is little in the way of industry in Peninsula, where the 33,000-acre national park already owns a significant portion of the village's property, turning tax-paying parcels into tax-exempt — and non-revenue-generating — federal land. The village loses out on both property tax not paid on the land and income tax that would otherwise be paid by people living on the land if it weren’t owned by the park.\n\nAccording to the village, the more than 200-acre former Brandywine property is the only significant vacant tract of land in the village suitable for significant economic development projects.\n\n\"The village of Peninsula is a special place, and we cannot let it be completely erased by what the park is doing,” Krusinski said. “It's the final death knell on our revenue development.\"\n\nAccording to the village, if CVNP acquires the entire property, it would increase the size of the national park by less than 1% but would take away 14% of the existing taxed land mass from the village. The village said the park already owns half of the property area in the village.\n\n“The village still has to provide police, fire, all the services we provide on 50% of our village that we receive no income at all,” Krusinski said. “So only half of the village is still maintaining the entire village tax base.\"\n\nThe village said it effectively functions as the “gateway” to CVNP, and village taxpayers have funded the required infrastructure and workforce to service park visitors, with the number of visitors increasing each year.\n\nThe park’s visitation numbers were 2,423,391 in 2016 and increased to 2,755,628 in 2020, making it the seventh-most-visited national park in the country.\n\nThe support from the village includes safe roads, service department personnel, police and fire protection and emergency medical services, with fire and EMS services provided through the Valley Fire District.\n\nBut that’s all funded by only about 230 households and 15 small- to medium-sized businesses, which lack central sewer and water systems.\n\nSchneider also said he believes the village’s employees are underpaid.\n\n“We're told we're the centerpiece of the park, but at the same time, we get zero financial support, basically, from the federal government,” Schneider said.\n\nThe village said its tax base is currently negatively affected because of its inability to generate property tax and employment tax revenue from park-owned property; the relocation of almost all of the General Die Casters workforce to Twinsburg due to the lack of expansion space and central water and sewer systems in Peninsula; the relocation of Woodridge Intermediate School to Cuyahoga Falls; the closure of the Brandywine golf course; and the absence of remaining land in the village suitable for economic development other than the former Brandywine golf course property.\n\nWhen is Akron-Peninsula Road reopening:Summit County approves $717,000 bid to rebuild, reopen Akron-Peninsula Road in Peninsula\n\nWhy is Akron-Peninsula Road closed:Summit County expecting $1 million from state to reopen Akron-Peninsula Road next year\n\nLack of water, sewer systems hurt residents\n\nThe village said the lack of a central sewer system has hampered economic development and the ability of commercial and residential owners to maintain their properties due to the restrictions and cost of septic systems for properties near the Cuyahoga River and downtown.\n\nThe village said it adds to the cost of living and doing business, because downtown homes and businesses have no access to sources of clean water without trucking in water to be stored in cisterns, sometimes on a daily basis.\n\nBut the systems would impose additional tax burdens on village property owners.\n\n\"The county executive's office has been working with the village for a number of years, and affordability continues to be an issue. We are currently updating an engineering report, and we continue to engage with regional partners in water solutions and sewer access,” said Greta Johnson, assistant chief of staff to Summit County Executive Ilene Shapiro and the county’s public information officer. “We are hopeful that we are on a good path to achieve those services for the residents.\"\n\nThe village said generating additional revenue from the developable golf course property would support its infrastructure and service needs.\n\n“As a result of the burden on Village taxpayers to shoulder the necessary infrastructure and workforce costs to service Park visitors, avenues for the Village to generate additional tax revenues to sustain its partnership with the CVNP must be preserved,” the resolution states.\n\nThe village said the conservancy and park acquiring the property “could cause irreparable harm to the Village and its financial ability to support and partner with the CVNP to provide critical infrastructure and services utilized by Park visitors.”\n\nHistory of Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area\n\nInitially designated as the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area in 1974, it was renamed Cuyahoga Valley National Park in 2000.\n\nWhen the recreation area was created, the first superintendent, William C. Birdsell, began an aggressive program of land acquisition for the park, according to Beacon Journal records.\n\nNearly 50 years later, residents in the area still remember the effect it had on the community.\n\nAccording to the village, when CVNP was established — in order to receive support from officials and residents for the park's establishment, with the village providing infrastructure and services for park visitors — the National Park Service and CVNP officials promised the village that CVNP wouldn’t acquire additional land within corporate limits of the village.\n\nBut the village said CVNP has appeared to renege on that promise when it comes to the former Brandywine property.\n\n\"For 50 years, the people in this village have been giving up their tax money for infrastructure for what the park brings us — and we basically are their infrastructure in this area‚ and then they talk about buying that property. We request they don't; we request they work with us. And they completely shrug it off,” Krusinski said. “We have 50 years of experience with the park, 50 years of broken promises, 50 years of kind of not listening to us, while completely depending on our infrastructure.”\n\nThings to do at Cuyahoga Valley National Park:Everything you need to know about visiting Cuyahoga Valley National Park\n\nBlue Hen Falls:Closure of Buckeye Trail to Blue Hen Falls in Cuyahoga Valley National Park extended\n\nVillage would be open to part of property staying in private hands\n\nIf the conservancy and the national park aren't open to keeping the entire property in private hands, the mayor and council “beseech[ed]” them to work with the village and county, possibly including the Summit County Land Bank, with a portion going to the park and a portion staying in private ownership.\n\nBut the village has said it wouldn’t let just anything go in the space. The planning commission and council determined through zoning code that the property, if developed, “must be developed in an environmentally sensitive and recreation themed manner that preserves a significant amount of green space.”\n\nThe village would want it to be developed “in a manner that would support the mission of the Park and its visitors while still generating property taxes, employment taxes, and other taxes and fees for the Village and County.”\n\n\"We have said all along that we would not put anything there that would be completely out of line with fitting into the feel of the village itself and the park. In other words, we're not looking to put in strip malls,” Schneider said. “We would be looking for someone to put something in that would have multiple employees and add to places for people to visit while in the park.”\n\nKrusinski said possible ideas could include a winery or venue space.\n\nSummit County 2020 census results:Northern Summit County attracts new residents while southern communities decline\n\nWoodridge masks:Woodridge local schools will require masks starting Sept. 7\n\nWoodridge school board joins Peninsula in opposition\n\nThe Woodridge school board on Tuesday, Sept. 21, unanimously passed a similar resolution expressing its “heartfelt displeasure” with the efforts of the Conservancy for CVNP and CVNP to acquire the former Brandywine property.\n\nSuperintendent Walter Davis said the school district currently collects about $46,000 a year in property tax off of the property. If it becomes part of the national park, the district would lose that annual $46,000.\n\n“If the village of Peninsula is able to develop that property, chances are the value of that property in tax dollars would be higher than $46,000 because they would improve it ... and the tax value would go up, which would benefit the school district,\" Davis said.\n\nAccording to the village, the school district’s revenue loss from the property becoming tax-exempt would result in higher property taxes within the district to make up it.\n\nPaid parking, but what else is left\n\nKrusinski isn’t sure what the village will do if it the Brandywine property becomes part of the national park.\n\nThe village started charging for parking Aug. 2, with up to 320 paid parking spaces that include both on-street and off-street parking. According to the village, in the first week, it generated $1,700.\n\nKrusinski isn’t sure what other revenue-generating options they have left.\n\n“It's just illogical, and it's unfair, and there's not much we can do to stop it,” he said. “Once the park owns that property, there is basically very few ways that we're going to be able to increase revenue in the future in the village, and I don't know what that does to us five, six, seven years down the road.\"\n\nContact Beacon Journal reporter Emily Mills at emills@thebeaconjournal.com and on Twitter @EmilyMills818.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2022/07/01/brandywine-country-club-housing-plan-approved-school-debate-next/7693270001/", "title": "Brandywine Country Club housing plan approved, school debate is ...", "text": "Some 2,448 days after the last strokes were played at the Brandywine Country Club, New Castle County Council Tuesday night ruled on its future.\n\nOn the greens and fairways between Concord Pike and Shipley Road in Talleyville, 365 total single-family homes, townhomes and apartments will be built by developer Louis Capano III.\n\nThe Brandywine School District will be gifted about 44 acres of the property to build an early education center.

A recording on the club's phone system Friday said that \"as of Oct. 15, 2015, operations have ceased.\"\n\nLouis Capano Jr., who purchased the property that stretches from Shipley Road to Concord Pike in 2012, said he was only notified of the club's \"dire financial straits\" about four weeks ago, as he and his management company were not responsible for the actual workings of the country club and golf course.\n\nSince purchasing the property, Capano has leased the property back to the country club for $1 a year, paying property taxes and allowing the business to operate on its own terms and leadership, he said.\n\n\"At that point, there was nothing we could do about it,\" Capano said. \"It was their choice to close. ... I can assure you that if we operated the golf course, it would probably be successful.\"\n\nSituated on the second-largest plot of open space in Brandywine Hundred, the club's future has been one of the community's primary concerns since Capano purchased the property.\n\n\"The community has great concerns about the traffic impact and the aesthetic concerns about architectural excellence and quality of design of the ground surrounding the proposal, and the proposal itself,\" Weiner said.\n\nThe property is zoned for residential development and Capano said that's exactly what he and his son plan to do with the space. He said there are multiple concepts in the works, including a mix of apartments, twin homes and single homes. Capano also noted that he and his company are open to community input and providing the best use of the land available.\n\n\"It's a fabulous piece of property,\" he said.\n\nNewark Country Club sues city as new plan emerges\n\nNew law might allow protection of DuPont Country Club\n\nWith open space rare in northern New Castle County, multiple golf course owners are looking to cash in on the development potential for their property. The Newark Country Club is fighting with Newark city officials about future development of its 120-acre property. Residents in the Churchmans Marsh area have railed against a proposal to build 525 homes and nearly 379,000 square feet of commercial space on the 145-acre Cavaliers Country Club.\n\nWeiner urged Capano to seek community input before filing any plans with the county.\n\n\"We made it clear we would not support any non-residential uses,\" Weiner said.\n\nIn May, The News Journal reported how deed restrictions barring development on roughly half of the 525-acre DuPont Country Club property, the largest piece of open space in Brandywine Hundred, were quietly lifted in 2008. The club's future has been called to question during recent wars within the DuPont Co.\n\nNew Castle County Council has introduced legislation to create a new open space zoning category that could be applied to large pieces of open space, like golf courses, to prevent development. Weiner said that legislation is unlikely to take hold before plans to develop the Brandywine Country Club are formalized.\n\nA 2014 family membership at the Brandywine Country Club was listed at $4,500 for unlimited use of the golf course, driving range, swimming pool and tennis courts, as well as USGA handicaps, two lockers and club storage. Previous interviews with Capano indicated the country club was struggling before he bought the property, as was the case for many private clubs around the United States.\n\n\"The closure of the Brandywine Country Club is part of a nationwide pattern brought about by the fact that folks have less time to play golf and less extra dollars to play golf – and the millennials don't play golf,\" Weiner said.\n\nGeorge McNamara, who served as the club's golf pro for 29 years, said Brandywine was a beautiful place in its prime, with \"a whole bunch of great members.\"\n\n\"The club was really special,\" he said. \"And then they sold it to Capano and it had really gone downhill.\"\n\nMcNamara left the country club in December, as he said the future of the property became more and more clear. With dwindling numbers, he said, the golf course had essentially become public and few people spent much time there.\n\nThough he no longer worked at the country club, McNamara said he spoke to a former colleague who said employees received little notice of the closure. McNamara said he wasn't surprised.\n\n\"It's just sad,\" he said. \"Brandywine is a place.

The 111-acre course finally was sold to developer Louis Capano III in 2012 and ceased operations three years after.\n\nNow, Capano wants to use the grounds to build 408 apartment units in 12 three- to four-story buildings and 155 new homes ranging from small townhouses to larger single-family lots. The land's current zoning will allow less than half of that, so Capano plans to ask New Castle County Council to approve a rezoning in the coming year.\n\nNeighbors accustomed to a relatively quiet place say they will fight to stop that rezoning in an effort to protect their piece of Brandywine Hundred, Delaware's oldest and most densely populated suburb.\n\nThey fear two-lane roads will be overloaded with traffic.

And they worry the apartments will change the neighborhood's character with renters, who have less invested in their community.\n\nCapano said Brandywine Hundred is overdue for new apartment construction and maintains that the country club parcel is one of the last in the area where such a large project can meet booming demand from both millennials and older residents.\n\n\"Really there is no hole in the doughnut other than probably Brandywine Country Club and some redevelopments like Concord Plaza,\" Capano said. \"It is just dead. There are no large pieces of land.\"\n\nSheila Meara's backyard looks onto the golf course's 11th fairway. Over her 26 years living there, she became accustomed to the beauty in her backyard and even learned to play the game herself.\n\nIf Capano has his way, her backyard view will be transformed from the bucolic green of a golf course to the hardscape of asphalt and concrete when a two-lane boulevard is built to bisect the new housing development.\n\n\"It is very sad to see it go. I understand it happens,\" Meara said. \"But now it is being developed in a way that – I don't want to say greedy – but it seems like overkill.\"\n\nSTORY: With land limited, builders target Delaware golf courses\n\nSTORY: Push to redevelop old Hercules golf course begins anew\n\nCapano said he believes the plan is \"harmonious\" with the community because it transitions from the large, three- to four-story apartment buildings near Concord Pike to the smaller homes in the middle of the property and the single-family homes closer to Shipley Road.\n\n\"Of course, it is a business decision, and we are in the apartment business so that obviously lends itself to why we would like to build apartments,\" said Capano, whose company manages some 4,000 apartments throughout New Castle County. \"But we do think it fits into the community, and it is a thoughtful plan — not just a plan to make money.\"\n\nThe plan also includes the commercial reconfiguration of Capano's 200,000-square-foot Concord Square shopping center next door to the course on Concord Pike that is anchored by Giant grocery store and Marshalls.\n\nA portion of the shopping center's main building would be torn down to make way for the new boulevard stretching from Concord Pike through the new development to Shipley Road. To replace that lost retail space, two 5,500 square-foot commercial buildings would be situated in center's expansive and underused parking lot off Concord Pike.\n\nThe plan also calls for construction of a new 10,000-square-foot commercial building behind the existing shopping center near the planned apartments, and all of this would be wrapped together by sidewalks and special pedestrian crossings intended to make the center an attractive, walkable place for the apartment dwellers, homeowners inside the development and other nearby residents.\n\nCapano's plans to cluster the apartments near the shopping center's commercial offerings is similar to the recently approved redevelopment of the Concord Plaza office complex just south Capano's property.\n\nDeveloper Buccini/Pollin Group plans to reformat that underused office complex by building 340 luxury apartments in six new buildings ranging from four to five stories. Three of those buildings will feature ground-floor shops and restaurants with apartments on the floors above. The plan also includes new office space.\n\nCouncilman Bob Weiner, who represents the area, said Concord Plaza and the commercial aspect of the country club development harken back to villagelike developments that predate the automobile-dominated area.\n\nSTORY: Concord Plaza redevelopment off U.S. 202 given green light\n\nSTORY: DuPont Country Club's future in doubt to neighbors\n\nWeiner said the Concord Pike corridor was developed in the post-World War II expansion of suburban development north of Wilmington where the village model eventually was cast aside for strip malls where motorists were the only \"first-class citizens.\"\n\n\"It was developed in what was then the style of the day, which was a sea of asphalt parking lot that required an automobile to get to where you buy your milk and then drive somewhere else to do laundry, then somewhere else to get coffee,\" said Weiner, who emphasized his comments were addressing the commercial concepts of the plan, not his still-developing views on the suitability of the total country club development proposal.\n\n\"The demands of today are going back to the past, where people want a village with these mix of uses.\"\n\nTraffic is a concern\n\nWhile final plans have not yet been filed with the county, some 200 concerned residents blistered Capano and his cadre of attorneys and engineers at a public meeting recently when they presented the plan.\n\nTheir complaints ranged from impact to local schools, fears about stormwater runoff and an unwillingness to see the open space built over. The primary fear vocalized was the \"traffic nightmare\" hundreds of new residents would bring to the densely populated area off Shipley Road – a two-lane thoroughfare that runs roughly parallel to Concord Pike from Penny Hill to Naamans Road, sandwiching the club property.\n\nPaul Steiner lives in nearby Pierson Farms and said it can take two to three minutes just to wade through traffic to get on Shipley from his neighborhood.\n\n\"By the time the cars stop coming from the left now they are coming from the right,\" Steiner said. \"That is before you put in 700 new residents that need to leave at rush hour in the morning. It is just not feasible.\"\n\nConcord Pike is a popular Pennsylvania-commuter thoroughfare and artery for its many shopping options. It sees about 50,000 trips up and down each day. For some of the 80,000 residents of Brandywine Hundred, Shipley Road is their path to avoid the traffic of the pike. That road sees about 10,000 vehicles along its busiest stretch each day.\n\nJohn Tracey, Capano's attorney, said a preliminary traffic analysis showed the development would add some 4 percent to the traffic load on Concord Pike and 14 percent to Shipley Road. The development's traffic analysis has been blessed by state regulators; the analysis found none of the nearby intersections would be considered too clogged to block the project, he said.\n\nSTORY: Millennials, boomers fuel apartment construction uptick\n\nSTORY: County park proposal would derail housing project\n\nHe said the dense plan is favorable to a smaller plan that would concentrate traffic through one entrance and exit. He noted the traffic burden is being split between Concord Pike and Shipley and a less-dense development would not have the scale to make the cut-through to Concord Pike economically feasible.\n\n\"All that traffic would only be utilizing a single entrance and that would result in higher number of peak hour trips on Shipley Road,\" he said.\n\nTracey said the two-lane boulevard through the heart of the development to tie Concord Pike with Shipley would be lined with \"traffic calming\" features to slow down vehicles.\n\nAs a longtime resident, Meara said she knows and uses shortcuts to avoid Concord Pike traffic. She fears the planned boulevard would be a popular shortcut.\n\n\"I can't imagine I'm the only one doing that,\" Meara said. \"That is the benefit of knowing your local roads – at moments you can leave that huge traffic jam behind.\"\n\nTracey said residents are more likely to cut through using Naamans Road to the north or Silverside Road to the south of the new boulevard. Meara said the boulevard will be a more attractive shortcut because there will be fewer traffic lights to contend with.\n\n\"I think it opens up a much easier cut-through in our backyards,\" Meara said.\n\nDensity and zoning\n\nSome residents have called on government to end the debate and simply buy the property for open space. It's a common thread among other large developments of open space like the proposal to build nearly 300 new residences on a former orphanage property in Ogletown.\n\nWeiner said government doesn't have the money to buy the course, even if it were for sale. And making such a purchase would create a pricey precedent.\n\n\"There is this pesky document known the U.S. Constitution that ensures people life, liberty and property,\" Weiner said tongue-in-cheek. \"So if you buy land that is zoned residential, you have a constitutional right to build homes.\"\n\nWhile the traffic approval is based on a mathematical formula, Capano's concept will require County Council to approve a rezoning, which introduces some subjectivity into the equation.\n\nUnder the current zoning, Capano's firm would be able to build approximately 1.3 dwelling units for each of the property's 111 acres. There are some ways developers can boost that, but those would get the density nowhere close to the five units per acre Capano is proposing.\n\nPragmatic residents predict the rezoning decision will dominate this development fight. John Culin, whose home backs up to the 11th hole, said their priority will be making sure the zoning change fails.\n\n\"It is a pipe dream to just leave it a park,\" Culin said. \"I understand that is not going to happen. But in this area, every development is nice, normal single-family homes. Just make the development single family.\"\n\nSTORY: WilmU to start building Concord Pike campus\n\nSTORY: Concord Plaza redevelopment off U.S. 202 given green light\n\nCapano said his firm is not attempting to maximize density, insisting that he is sensitive to community standards.\n\nCounty standards for a zoning change weigh factors like the plan's consistency with the character of the surrounding area, the zoning of nearby parcels and effect on nearby properties.\n\nOnce a formal plan is submitted, it will be reviewed by a state board involving traffic, school and other public entities with opportunity for public comment.\n\nAfterward, the proposal will go to the county's Planning Board, which will evaluate the application and again take public comment before the board and the county's planning professionals make a joint recommendation. Tracey said the earliest that could happen would be in the fall, and the plan is likely to be tweaked over the coming months.\n\nRichard Hall, the general manager of the county's Land Use Department since February, said the department's recommendation will be based on some hard measures, but also more subjective judgments by the county's planning professionals. All decisions are not a \"binary check box,\" he said.\n\n\"Everything is driven by the code, but we are not robots either,\" Hall said. \"Our staff looks at what makes sense, uses experience and precedence and what we are hearing from the community and staff members. All that rolls together.\"\n\nThat recommendation is important because it motivates the decisions of County Council members who have no ties to the country club area. If the recommendation is negative, it takes a 10-member majority of the council to approve the rezoning instead of a simple, seven-member majority.\n\nThe plan also will require a much smaller commercial rezoning to accommodate the reworking of the shopping center and one new commercial building.\n\nTracey said he will argue the plan is consistent with the county's long-term plans for growth and introduces density in a responsible way with the apartments closest to Concord Pike and the larger, single-family units closer to the neighborhoods off Shipley.\n\n\"We believe the plan, as presented and will be modified, is absolutely consistent with the goals and desires of the (county's) comprehensive development plan,\" Tracey said.\n\nMeara argued the rezoning will change residents' quality of life and tank local property values.\n\n\"It begs the question of who does that benefit,\" Meara said. \"The zoning was put in place for the protection of residents. When the request comes it to change that, it put the needs of the developer ahead of the community.\"\n\nThe future of the pike\n\nThe proposal to develop the club and rework the adjacent shopping center comes alongside several, big-ticket and smaller development projects that seek to introduce better walkability to Concord Pike.\n\nWilmington University recently won approval — along with a rare waiver from county traffic rules — to build a new campus at the intersection of Beaver Valley Road and Concord Pike. Construction is set to begin on the apartments and retail shops in Concord Plaza later this year.\n\nMike Hare, executive vice president for the Buccini-Pollin Group, which owns the former DuPont Co. and AstraZeneca office complex, said his company saw an opportunity to \"kick off\" the mixed-use theme in Brandywine Hundred. He said his company is banking on the area's \"dormant need\" for modern apartment living as well as job expansion happening at places like JPMorgan Chase's technology campus further down the pike.\n\n\"I think it is a trend that is sustainable and you will see more of,\" Hare said.\n\nCapano described Concord Pike as the best real estate in Delaware, adding that its evolution into a more pedestrian-oriented setting is \"just a matter of time.\" It's a slow process because of the layout and the multitude of small parcels that make up the commercial stretch.\n\n\"It is hard to redesign smaller parcels on Concord Pike,\" Capano said. \"You are sort of limited by land. People will take advantage of it where they can, but it is difficult.\"\n\nWeiner has for decades been working with planning groups to envision a series of walkable villages that will slowly take the place of the maze of curb cuts and strip malls along the pike. It's a slow process but one that will come to fruition with time, he said.\n\nAdded Weiner: \"We as a community no longer desire to have silos of residential, commercial and office on our main street Concord Pike.\"\n\nContact Xerxes Wilson at (302) 324-2787 or xwilson@delawareonline.com.

He said he was not contacted with the news by the conservancy or CVNP.\n\nProperty has remained closed since owner's 2018 death\n\nThe property at 5555 Akron-Peninsula Road has been closed since 2018. The site is adjacent to the Virginia Kendall area of the park to the south, Camp Manatoc and Camp Butler to the east and the Cuyahoga River to the west.\n\nThe closure came after owner-operator Ryan Yesberger died by suicide at the property in 2018 after police said he attacked an officer and took his gun. Yesberger apparently took over ownership from his father, Brett Yesberger, sometime after he died in 2009. Brett Yesberger's father, Earl Yesberger, who died in 1988, designed Brandywine in the 1960s, according to his obituary.\n\nThe conservancy signed a purchase agreement in 2019 to acquire the property, with plans to convert it to parkland.\n\nThe National Park Service will purchase from the conservancy 192 acres of the 207-acre property, which is divided by Akron-Peninsula Road south of state Route 303, once environmental restoration is complete.\n\n“The inclusion of this land in the heart of the national park is an important part of our longterm plan for improved public access and habitat restoration,” CVNP Superintendent Lisa Petit said in a statement. “By taking a leadership role in the community to acquire this property, the Conservancy has helped make achieving this goal possible. This is a legacy gift of land everyone will be able to use and enjoy for generations to come.”\n\nConservancy will keep 15 of property's 207 acres\n\nThe conservancy will retain the remaining 15 acres, and has started a master planning process that will \"help inform the funds needed to be raised for activation and programming of the Conservancy’s acres,\" according to a news release. The property is not currently open to the public.\n\nThe conservancy said the land purchase was made possible \"through the generosity of individual donors and recoverable grants from Northeast Ohio community and national foundations,\" including the Akron Community Foundation, Connor Foundation, GAR Foundation and National Park Foundation.\n\n“CVNP is an asset to this community,\" said GAR Foundation President Christine Mayer. \"Over the years, the Conservancy has played a vital role in creating greater access to the park through thoughtful community engagement and diverse and inclusive programming. We are excited about the future of this property.\"\n\nPeninsula opposes Brandywine purchase:Peninsula, Woodridge oppose former Brandywine golf course becoming part of CVNP\n\nBoston Township and CVNP:Boston Township trustee says community still feeling aftereffects of CVNP formation\n\nPeninsula Village Council is considering a resolution expressing its and the mayor’s “heartfelt displeasure” with the efforts of CVNP and the nonprofit conservancy to acquire the property.\n\nThe resolution was introduced at Council’s September meeting. The elected body only meets once a month and is expected to give the resolution three readings, which means Council would vote on it at its November meeting.\n\nThe Woodridge school board on Sept. 21 unanimously passed a similar resolution, with the district saying it would lose about $46,000 a year in property tax if the property became part of the national park.\n\nVillage says plan takes away 14% of its land for park\n\nAccording to the village, if CVNP acquires the entire property, it would increase the size of the national park by less than 1% but would take away 14% of the existing taxed land mass from the village.\n\nThe village said the 33,000-acre national park already owns half of the property area in the village, turning tax-paying parcels into tax-exempt — and non-revenue-generating — federal land. The village loses out on both property tax not paid on the land and income tax that would otherwise be paid by people living on the land if it weren’t owned by the park.\n\nAccording to the 2020 census, the village’s population is 536 people. But some of the more than 2 million visitors venturing into nearby CVNP each year stop in the 4.4-square-mile village, using the roads and other village services — but not paying for them as taxpayers.\n\nThat’s all funded by only about 230 households and 15 small- to medium-sized businesses, which lack central sewer and water systems. The village says those limited taxpayers provide the required infrastructure and workforce to service park visitors.\n\n“As a result of the burden on Village taxpayers to shoulder the necessary infrastructure and workforce costs to service Park visitors, avenues for the Village to generate additional tax revenues to sustain its partnership with the CVNP must be preserved,” its resolution states.\n\nOpponents say purchase could harm ties between village, CVNP\n\nThe village said the conservancy and park acquiring the property “could cause irreparable harm to the Village and its financial ability to support and partner with the CVNP to provide critical infrastructure and services utilized by Park visitors.”\n\nVillage officials acknowledged there wasn't much they could do stop the purchase from happening but did ask the conservancy and park to work the village and county and allow a portion of the land to go to the park and a portion to stay in private ownership.\n\nThe village has said that the property, if developed, “must be developed in an environmentally sensitive and recreation themed manner that preserves a significant amount of green space.”\n\nYandala and Petit said in a statement last week that they share the mayor and Council’s concern for the well-being of Peninsula residents and “have always strived to work cooperatively with the Village to find answers to issues they have raised, including a sewage system.”\n\nBut they said the former golf course has “unique environmental and recreational value and plays an essential role in protecting the water quality of the Cuyahoga River.”\n\nAccording to the conservancy, along with the Cuyahoga River, the property has two significant stream beds and is home to rare species.\n\n“While some have expressed interest in seeing the property used for private development, we remain committed to safeguarding it for public good with value to the local community and the region,\" the statement reads.\n\nThis article will be updated.\n\nContact Beacon Journal reporter Emily Mills at emills@thebeaconjournal.com and on Twitter @EmilyMills818.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2020/12/28/delaware-development-projects-keep-eye-2021/5923741002/", "title": "Delaware development: The projects to keep an eye on in 2021", "text": "Here is a look at some of the development projects Delaware Online/The News Journal has reported on this year and will be tracking in 2021.\n\nThis list is not comprehensive, but rather a roundup of highlights of what could be coming soon to Delaware.\n\nThose interested in following the comings and goings of local business in the First State may want to join Delaware Online's Facebook group What's Going There in Delaware.

The warehouse is being developed off Route 13 in place of a former UPS customer service center and the former Blue Diamond amusement park, with plans to open in 2021.\n\nLa Grange development\n\nNew Castle County Council in October approved a plan to build a shopping center along Route 40 in Glasgow near the historic Samuel Henry Black house. The village-style center will feature six buildings, two of which will likely be filled by AutoZone and Taco Bell. The project's developer hopes to complete construction by mid-to-late 2021.\n\nLidl\n\nIn August, the German grocery store chain listed its future location at Pulaski Highway and Salem Church Road as one of 50 new stores in the U.S. that the company expects to open by the end of 2021. The 30,000-square-foot store, occupying space previously used by Countryside Nursery and Garden Center, received county approval in May.\n\nBrandywine Hundred\n\nBrandywine Country Club housing development\n\nCapano Residential is planning to build 365 single-family homes and apartments at the former Brandywine Country Club between Concord Pike and Shipley Road. The plan, which still requires New Castle County approval, is smaller in scope than previous proposals for the golf course, which closed in 2015.\n\nClaymont\n\nFirst State Crossing\n\nA plan is in the works to redevelop the 425-acre former Evraz steel mill on Route 13 into a large mixed-use property centered around a new Claymont train station. Preliminary plans submitted to New Castle County in July show nearly 60,000 square feet of retail space, including a grocery store and a convenience store, 184,000 square feet of office space and six four-story residential buildings.\n\nChristiana\n\nCavaliers Country Club housing development\n\nMore than 700 homes will be built on the former Cavaliers Country Club property just north of the Christiana Mall south of Churchmans Road. Years in the making, the project faced several hurdles through the approval process. Nearby residents voiced several concerns, mostly centered around increased traffic.\n\nHomewood Suites at Delaware Park\n\nPlans were approved in 2019 for a 133-room, four-story Homewood Suites just inside Delaware Park's entrance off Ogletown Stanton Road and Churchmans Road near Stanton.\n\nTrader Joe's\n\nAccording to New Castle County permits, the grocery store chain is preparing to open a second Delaware store in place of the former Saks Off 5th in the Christiana Fashion Center. Renovation work began in November. Trader Joe's and Allied Properties, which operates the shopping center, have not commented on the store.\n\nDelaware City\n\nRV park and campground on Fort DuPont\n\nSpearheaded by a quasi-public body created by state lawmakers in 2014, a redevelopment of Fort DuPont State Park along the banks of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, featuring an RV park, apartments, townhouses and more, won approval with a few stipulations at a city council meeting earlier this month.\n\nFairfax\n\nAvenue North\n\nDeveloper Delle Donne & Associates is planning a 335-apartment development to accompany a hotel, fitness center and retail complex at the Fairfax campus once occupied entirely by AstraZeneca on Concord Pike.\n\nGreenville\n\nHercules Country Club housing development\n\nRoughly a decade after the Delaware National Country Club closed, 258 homes will be built on the former golf course, long known as Hercules Country Club, off Lancaster Pike near Greenville. Newport developer Greg Pettinaro has controlled the property for several years. The housing plan won approval in September.\n\nWegmans\n\nPettinaro is redeveloping Barley Mill Plaza at Lancaster Pike and Route 141. His redevelopment plans, which received final approval in May prompting the beginning of demolition and construction, are centered around Delaware's first Wegmans. The grocery store is expected to open in 2022.\n\nKirkwood Highway\n\nChick-fil-A\n\nA Chick-fil-A will be built on one of two new pad sites in place of the former Sears Auto Center in the Prices Corner shopping center. The other will be a Chase Bank.\n\nMichael's\n\nMichael's will fill in the former A.C. Moore on Kirkwood Highway, one of up to 40 A.C. Moore locations the competing arts and crafts retailer is taking over. It is expected to open early next year, according to a Michael's spokesperson.\n\nTarget\n\nThe company's fourth Delaware location, coming as part of a redevelopment project at the Prices Corner shopping center, is expected to open in spring 2021, according to Arrow Real Estate Services. The exterior of the store, which took the place of the former Sears, appears near completion.\n\nMiddletown\n\nBayberry Town Center\n\nA shopping center with close to 250,000 square feet of retail space, 145 adjacent townhomes and office space is being planned at the Bayberry communities in Middletown. The project won approval in June.\n\nBreakthru Beverage\n\nThe wine, spirits and beer distributor will build a new facility in Middletown to replace its existing property on Churchmans Road near New Castle.

The developer told the outlet there is no timetable for the project's completion.\n\nSouthern New Castle County library\n\nConstruction crews broke ground for a new 28,000-square-foot library near Silver Lake Park earlier this year. It is expected to open in 2022. With costs estimated at $25 million, the library will be one of the largest in Delaware and has been touted by officials as one of the county's most environmentally friendly buildings.\n\nNewark\n\nCenter Square redevelopment\n\nLang Development in April submitted plans to build a new structure at 124 E. Main St. with retail space, a parking garage and 58 residential units. The building currently on the property – known as Center Square – houses Walgreens, Homegrown and 14 apartments. The plan is in preliminary stages of the approval process.\n\nCollege Square shopping center\n\nThe shopping center off Library Avenue is being transformed into a walkable mixed-use community with shops, restaurants and more than 300 apartments.\n\nDickinson apartments and townhomes\n\nA Pennsylvania developer is building 45 apartments and 46 townhomes targeted at students in place of the now-demolished University of Delaware Dickinson dormitories. Scheduled to open before the coming academic year, the complex features two-, three- and four-bedroom units. It will be called the Rail Yard.\n\nFinTech building on the University of Delaware STAR Campus\n\nBringing together startups managed by Delaware Technology Park and labs and research centers for the university's business and engineering schools, the financial services technology building is the latest expansion of the school's Science, Technology and Advanced Research Campus. Construction began in April and is projected to last through November.\n\nFulton Bank mixed-use building\n\nA three-story mixed-use building with retail space and 30 apartments is being built in place of the longtime Fulton Bank toward the north end of Main Street.

The developer, Lang Development, has not updated the timetable for the project.\n\nMixed-use building at 132 E. Main St.\n\nDeveloper George Danneman is proposing a five-story mixed-use building with retail space and 33 apartments at 132 E. Main St. The property now features Tasty Wok, Playa Bowls and the former Margherita's Pizza on the ground floor and a few apartments above. The proposal has not been approved.\n\nRenaissance-style mixed-use building at 141 E. Main St.\n\nThe Newark planning commission earlier this month recommended approving a six-story building with retail, apartments and a parking garage on Main Street where Duck Donuts, Del-One Federal Credit Union and Starbucks are located. The proposal still needs city council approval.\n\nStormwater facility and park\n\nA state-of-the-art stormwater facility designed to maintain clean water and lessen flooding in Newark is being built along Hillside Road where UD's Rodney dormitories stood for about 50 years. The roughly $9 million project, which also includes a park built around the stormwater facility, was originally slated to be completed in November. Officials now say the park will open in spring 2021.\n\nSuper 8 apartments\n\nThe owner of the Super 8 on Newark's Main Street is proposing replacing the hotel with a five-story building featuring a restaurant and 56 apartments. The plan requires a rezoning from city council among other approvals.\n\nNew Castle\n\nFormer Dutch Inn\n\nA Chick-fil-A and a Starbucks are taking the place of the former Dutch Inn on Route 13 near New Castle. Chick-fil-A plans to open the new store at some point in 2021.

The project's developer Greg Pettinaro decided to move forward once it became evident the group wouldn't be receiving the state money they needed to purchase the land from him amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDespite community resistance, the plan won relatively easy approval by a vote of 12-1 as it met code requirements. Councilwoman Dee Durham, who represents the district the project is in and worked with residents to preserve the land, voted against the development.\n\n\"County Council tonight really doesn't have a choice in how we vote,\" Durham said, noting the project's compliance. \"I know the public complains about these things, but their voices don't seem to really be heard.\"\n\nPREVIOUS COVERAGE: Housing development at former Hercules Country Club moves forward\n\nPettinaro's plan, introduced four years ago, will see new homes built straddling Red Clay Creek around Hercules Road and behind existing developments off Lancaster Pike on land originally home to the Hercules Country Club and later Delaware National.\n\nPettinaro expects to spend about $4 million to make road improvements recommended by the county and the state's Department of Transportation to improve traffic flow in the area, particularly at Centerville Road and Lancaster Pike.\n\nDebates over who should bear the cost of road upgrades derailed previous plans to build on the golf course, which Pettinaro has now owned for about 12 years.\n\n\"It's a last in line bears the burden type of system,\" said Michael Hoffman, a lawyer representing Pettinaro.\n\nBACKGROUND: With land limited, builders target Delaware golf courses\n\nThe group of residents, who organized under the name \"Hold onto Hercules,\" saw the course as an ideal place for walking, biking, bird watching and other outdoor activities. They shared concerns regarding traffic, water quality and loss of wildlife and forest.\n\n\"It's unfortunate that this is a by-right development because we see a lot of issues with it,\" said supporter Peggy Schultz.\n\nOver a roughly 18-month period, they posted green \"Hold onto Hercules\" yard signs in neighboring communities and garnered support from several organizations including the Delaware Nature Society and SUEZ Delaware Water. The group later adopted the name the \"Friends of (the future) Wooddale Preserve.\"\n\nUltimately their effort hinged on receiving money from the state's bond bill to buy the land from Pettinaro. Pettinaro said he wanted to know whether the state would contribute earlier this year. Still, without an answer when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, he decided to move forward.\n\n\"We will continue working to try to secure the funds until the bulldozers are there,\" Durham said before the vote.\n\nBefore filing affirmative votes, several members of the council begrudged the county's land use rules that they said do not allow them enough avenues to limit or change proposals affecting open space they wish to preserve.\n\n\"We have areas that we thought were open space yet we have not figured out a way to do reasonable open space zoning and tax changes, and changes like that to make it more equitable,\" Councilman David Carter said. \"Those are things that we have to work on.\"\n\nCONCORD PIKE: Developer updates proposal for Brandywine Country Club with fewer homes and school building\n\nDurham criticized members of the council and the county administration for not throwing more support behind the community group as they continue to emphasize the need for open space.\n\n\"They talked the talk, but where's the walk?\" Durham said. \"The land use process lets the community down.\"\n\nLike knowing what stores, restaurants and developments are coming and going in Delaware?

Richard S ...", "text": "Editor's note: Earlier versions of this story incorrectly stated when Richard S. Cordrey died.\n\nRichard S. Cordrey, or “the gentleman from Sussex County,” as he was sometimes called in his days as a state senator, died Sunday.\n\nThe state’s longest-serving president pro tempore was 88.\n\nA Democrat farmer from Millsboro, Cordrey served in the Delaware Legislature from 1972 to 1996 and was well-liked and respected among his colleagues, regardless of party. Cordrey joined the Legislature as Delaware Democrats were coming into power after many years of a Republican majority, according to his obituary. His willingness to compromise and work across the aisle became the greatest legacy of his 26-year tenure.\n\n“He came from a generation like I do where elected officials are expected to get along, try to find common ground, and work together to get things done,” U.S. Sen. Tom Carper said in a statement.\n\n“Cordrey was special,” then-state Sen. Robert Voshell, D-Milford, said in 1996. “He had the respect of everyone throughout the state.”\n\nCordrey’s most-lauded accomplishments during his time in the General Assembly were in the realm of finance.\n\nHe sponsored the legislation that created the Rainy Day Fund, requiring the state to put aside 5% of its projected revenue annually to serve as protection from unexpected financial blows. He was also a major player in the Financial Center Redevelopment Act, which brought big banks to Delaware, as well as jobs and money.\n\n“His leadership, commonsense and persistence helped Delaware transform from a state with the worst credit rating in the country – unable to balance our budget and a very poor track record in attracting new business – to a AAA credit rating, and a great place to live and work,” Carper said.\n\nMore:Why the University of Delaware still takes money from the family behind OxyContin\n\nGov. John Carney concurred.\n\n“His influence on Delaware’s economy – especially his efforts on financial stability – will have a lasting impact on our state,” he said.\n\nCordrey’s retirement in 1996 meant “the loss of (Sussex countians') most influential voice in a Legislature dominated by up-staters,” News Journal reporter Nancy Kesler wrote at the time.\n\nAmong the fans of Cordrey’s financial work was the late Gov. Ruth Ann Minner. Cordrey came out of retirement for four years in 2005 to serve as her secretary of finance.\n\nA Millsboro farm boy\n\nCordrey grew up in agriculture. His father, John A. Cordrey, owned and operated a large feed store in downtown Millsboro, but died when his son was just 16.\n\n“He had to grow up really fast,” said Cordrey’s son, Richard J. “Rick” Cordrey.\n\nAfter high school, he went to Goldey-Beacom College, where he met his wife, the late Mary Jane Bowen Cordrey. They married in 1953, and when Cordrey joined the Army, she followed him to Fort Gordon in Georgia.\n\nWhen they moved back to Millsboro, Cordrey started his business, RSC Farms. The couple had two sons, Rick and Stephen, and the family raised chickens and grew corn and soybeans.\n\nMore:Prison policy change makes sick prisoners needlessly suffer, says lawsuit\n\nThe farmer's entry into Delaware politics started with Millsboro community groups. He was active at St. Mark’s Episcopal Church and in the Millsboro Lions Club, and Rick Cordrey said it was winning the position of Lions Club District governor that set his father on the road to the Legislature.\n\nHe started by serving on the Millsboro Town Council from 1965 to 1973, during which time he was instrumental in the creation of Cupola Park.\n\nRick Cordrey helped his father campaign as a teen. One election night, a call came in reporting he had lost by 60 votes.\n\n“I put my head down, you know. I had worked with him for a year on the campaign,” Rick Cordrey said. “He said, ‘Son, hold your head up. We knew we could lose, and we did the best we could do.’ It was a real good life lesson.”\n\nA short while later, the call came that there had been a mix-up. Cordrey had actually won.\n\nHis son said a stroke led to a decline in Cordrey's health, followed by the death of his beloved wife in 2016. A few weeks ago, his grandchildren went to visit him.\n\n“After they left, it almost felt like he had some peace. He was on hospice within four or five days. He went fast,” Rick Cordrey said.\n\nA viewing is set for 9 to 11 a.m. Saturday, Aug. 27, at Watson Funeral Home in Millsboro, followed by a service. Cordrey will be interred at St. Mark’s Episcopal Church, after which the church will host a luncheon.\n\nCarney has ordered flags at state buildings and facilities be flown at half-staff until sunset on Saturday.\n\nMore:Changes in voting laws expected to boost turnout in Delaware", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2017/09/28/after-experience-irmiddletown-grad-godwin-rookie-receiver-nfls-bucs-launches-hurricane-charity-effor/710742001/", "title": "Chris Godwin's rookie year with Bucs includes hurricane relief effort", "text": "Motivated by the damage two hurricanes wreaked on familiar fronts, Tampa Bay Buccaneers rookie wide receiver Chris Godwin out of Middletown High has launched a fund-raising effort aiming to help victims from both.\n\nGodwin and his girlfriend Mariah DelPercio, daughter of ex-Middletown coach Mark DelPercio, had to evacuate their Tampa area apartment three weeks ago when Hurricane Irma stormed up the west coast of Florida. They drove to Mariah’s maternal grandparents Pat and Hal Moyer’s home in South Carolina.\n\nMark and Nichol DelPercio had just left there to return to Texas, which they had to evacuate when Hurricane Harvey slammed the Houston area. Mark DelPercio is in his first year coaching on the football staff and teaching math at Ridge Point High in Missouri City, located on the southwestern edge of Houston.\n\n“We just wanted to help in whatever way that we can to try to make a positive impact,” said Godwin, the Bucs’ third-round draft choice out of Penn State in April. “We don’t have a goal in mind as far as how much. It’s just any way we can help the cause.”\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nThrough their Team Godwin active lifestyle apparel brand, Godwin and DelPercio have created T-shirts with a “TG” logo on the front and the phrase “Stronger, Together” on the back.\n\nThey were being sold at Middletown’s home football game Thursday against St. Georges and future events there as well, said Joe Lahutsky, Middletown assistant principal.\n\n“We want to bring Middletown into the mix with Tampa and Houston, having that kind of connection there, and help these people out,” Lahutsky said.\n\nProceeds will go to the Global Giving Foundation, which has both Harvey and Irma relief funds, Godwin said.\n\n“Coming from Delaware, we’d never done this, so we were like ‘OK, first hurricane, let’s do it’ and we were just gonna stay,” said Mariah, who lives with Chris in an apartment about five minutes from the Bucs’ Raymond James Stadium. “Then it was late Friday night [Sept. 8], two days before it was supposed to hit. My mom texted us and said ‘Please tell me you’re leaving now.”\n\nThe storm had been upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane and was barreling directly toward Tampa.\n\n“The next day we woke up and it was mandatory evacuation,” DelPercio said.\n\nBy that time, the two had already decided to create specific T-shirts, hats, and hoodies through Team Godwin, which will also involve fitness programs and football-focused drills. They hope to have a website, teamgodwinfitness.com, online in October.\n\nWhen Godwin and DelPercio returned to Tampa, their apartment was not damaged but seeing the widespread destruction made them more determined to help.\n\n“We wanted to do something bigger than us just going online and donating,” DelPercio said of Hurricane Harvey’s initial fury. “Then the hurricane started coming straight at us, too, and we were like, ‘This is definitely a personal thing now.’ We just wanted to get more people involved and make it a bigger thing and raise more money to be more effective.”\n\nTampa Bay’s NFL opener at Miami was postponed and moved to Nov. 19, when both were scheduled to have a bye.\n\nGodwin made his NFL debut in a 29-7 win over the Chicago Bears Sept. 17 and caught his first pro passes – three for 44 yards – in last Sunday’s 34-17 loss at Minnesota.\n\n“I think as the season goes and I get more comfortable, you can expect more of that,” said Godwin. “It was good to get that first one out of the way. Now I just have to focus on playing ball.”\n\nGodwin caught 153 passes for 2,404 yards and 18 touchdowns in three seasons at Penn State.\n\n“At each level, there are certain nuances that come with the game that you have to learn in order to be successful,” he said. “There are things I did well in high school that didn’t necessarily work in college. Same goes in going from college to the pros.\n\n“I think this whole first year is going to be a learning process for me, trying to figure out what I have to do to be successful in this league.

Yet high levels of tetrachloroethylene in groundwater remain.\n\nIt’s a health risk and may require long-term cleanup, the EPA says. The agency is proposing to add the site to the Superfund National Priority List, which would make it eligible for federal funds.\n\nHere’s what you need to know.\n\nWhat is tetrachloroethylene?\n\nTetrachloroethylene is a colorless liquid with a sharp, sweet odor, used in dry-cleaning and metal degreasing operations, according to the agency.\n\nIn groundwater, it’s one of the most frequently detected industrial solvents in the country, the EPA says.\n\nThe agency classifies it as “likely to be carcinogenic to humans,” and studies have found exposure to be associated with several types of cancer, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma and bladder cancer.\n\nWATER:Delaware, Maryland rivers and streams among the most polluted, report says\n\nTetrachloroethylene is also known as perchloroethylene, PCE, PERC, tetrachloroethene and perchlor.\n\nHow did it get in Georgetown groundwater?\n\nTetrachloroethylene reaches groundwater after being spilled, leaked or disposed of on the ground.\n\nThe Georgetown groundwater plume has two known former dry-cleaning sources, according to the EPA: Georgetown Dry Cleaners (formerly of 305 N. Race St.) and Thoro-Kleen Dry Cleaners (formerly of 11 N. Railroad Ave.), though there may be other contributors, too.\n\nTetrachloroethylene is slow to break down in water, and plumes from the businesses “appear to have co-mingled,” the EPA says, in Georgetown's groundwater.\n\nIs Georgetown water safe to drink?\n\nThe Georgetown Water Department serves more than 7,200 people, according to the EPA. Both the agency and Georgetown officials say the water is safe to drink, meeting state and federal standards.\n\nAccording to Georgetown’s 2021 Water Quality Report, there was no tetrachloroethylene detected in the town’s treated drinking water for that period.\n\nThe EPA pointed to upgrades at Georgetown’s water treatment plant in 2017, and according to the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, Georgetown added an air stripping system in 2019 that removes dissolved gases and volatile substances.\n\n“It’s never been unsafe to drink,” said town manager Gene Dvornick. “I’ve been here 15 years, and we’ve always been in compliance.”\n\nSUSSEX:'Celebration of his life': Heacook Fest 2022 to honor slain Delmar officer\n\nAre there risks other than with water?\n\nWhen tetrachloroethylene vapors migrate through groundwater and soil to the air above, it’s known as a vapor intrusion. They can pose a risk to people in buildings near the groundwater plume, according to the EPA.\n\nAcute inhalation exposure to tetrachloroethylene vapors can include irritation of the upper respiratory tract and eyes and kidney dysfunction, and at lower concentrations, the vapors can cause temporary neurological effects, like mood and behavior changes, coordination impairment, dizziness and headaches, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe EPA will investigate possible vapor intrusions in buildings around the Laurel and Kimmey streets intersection in the coming months.\n\nHow is the state involved in the cleanup?\n\nThe state has been investigating potential sources of Georgetown groundwater contamination since 1985, according to the EPA, but didn't request assistance from the agency until 2018.\n\nDepartment of Natural Resources and Environmental Control spokesman Michael Globetti declined to comment, but the department has made some effort to cleanup the Georgetown Dry Cleaners and Thoro-Kleen sites over the years. Underground storage tanks at both locations were removed, according to the EPA.\n\nA 1987 DNREC inspection of the Georgetown Dry Cleaners site found a “waste pile” behind the business that had “notable concentrations” of tetrachloroethylene, documents state. A 2002 News Journal story references soil removal at the site.\n\nThe 1992 obituary of Georgetown's Robert Wood said he owned the business for 25 years until he sold it in 1980, but information on whether someone else then continued to operate it could not be found. The site is now a Latino convenience store.\n\nDepartment efforts at Thoro-Kleen are more recent. DNREC has been trying to force the business's last owners — Joe Booth, former Georgetown mayor and then-state senator, and his wife, Margaret — to pay for remediation since 2014.\n\nIn 1986, Joe Booth purchased Thoro-Kleen from his parents, who had owned and operated the business since the 1960s. He closed the business in 2010.\n\nIn 2016, the Booths donated the property to a church in order to enter the Brownfields Program, which includes grants and technical assistance toward cleanups. But the Delaware department said the couple was still liable for offsite contamination. The Booths hired a lawyer and have been in court ever since.\n\nIn January, Superior Court Judge Jeffrey Clark ordered the Booths pay the department about $105,500 for costs already incurred, associated with “investigation, study and planning” at the Thoro-Kleen site. DNREC withdrew its request for cleanup costs, according to court documents.\n\nThe Booths have appealed the ruling.\n\nBRIDGEVILLE:Sussex approves natural gas project despite opposition from environmental groups\n\nThe department announced the adoption of a plan to clean up part of the Thoro-Kleen site in December 2020, including treating groundwater.\n\nWhat’s next\n\nThe EPA will host two question and answer sessions regarding the potential superfund site:\n\nPhone-in: Thursday, April 14, 6-7 p.m.\n\nPhone number: 484-352-3221﻿\n\nConference ID: 307589259#﻿\n\n\n\nPhone number: 484-352-3221﻿ Conference ID: 307589259#﻿ In-person: Wednesday, April 20, 5:30-7 p.m.\n\nGeorgetown Public Library, 123 W.

It’s not OK to either break the law or do damage to our citizens.\"\n\nJennings' justice department had intended to file a massive lawsuit against DuPont, Chemours and Corteva earlier this year.\n\nThe department spent more than two years on its investigation, which consisted of environmental sampling, forensic analysis and a review of corporate records. The department sought monetary damages and costs necessary to restore impacted natural resources and funding for state-run public health programs.\n\n“This settlement could not have been achieved without the goodwill and assistance of all parties.” Ed Breen, executive chairman and CEO of DuPont, said in a statement. “That goodwill is borne out of the Companies’ more than 200-year relationship to the State, its people, and its economy.”\n\nDelawareans should not be panicked by the information contained in the settlement, Jennings said. The settlement is for damages done to the state's environment and does not link any of DuPont's negligence directly to human harm.\n\n\"Any environmental damage is concerning,\" Jennings said. \"The greatest concern that exists, not only in Delaware but elsewhere, is ‘What does our drinking water look like?’ So we want to make sure that the public is aware that they can contact their water supplier and make sure that PFAS is being filtered. That’s the No. 1 concern. That can be handled with filtration systems and is a major reason why we arrived at the figure, to make sure there was enough money for Delawareans to rest assure that their drinking water is safe.\n\n\"I don’t want people to be unduly alarmed. This is good news. This is to remediate against PFAS that has existed in the environment historically and that we’re aware of that exists historically and that we believe people should be protected from with safe drinking water and other measures.\"\n\nThe settlement funds announced Tuesday will be administered by the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) and the Department of Public Health. They will be used for the following purposes:\n\nPurifying drinking water and restoring natural resources, including wildlife, habitats, and aquatic resources.\n\nEnvironmental sampling and testing to ascertain the presence of PFAS and other contaminants in the ground, water, and air.\n\nResearch and development, with a focus on PFAS detection and abatement technologies.\n\nCommunity environmental justice and equity grants, including funding for community health clinics and initiatives in communities located near industrial and manufacturing areas known to be impacted by PFAS contamination.\n\nThe natural resources impacted include waterways and groundwater located in each of the state’s three counties.\n\nWhat are PFAS?\n\nFirst manufactured in the 1940s, the class of compounds known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances or PFAS includes more than 4,000 types of chemicals, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. They have been used in the manufacturing of nonstick items, textiles and carpets, firefighting foam and more.\n\nIn addition to their potential toxicity, the defining characteristic of PFAS is their longevity in the environment and in the body, which means they are very hard to get rid of and can build up over time. They are commonly known as \"forever chemicals.\"\n\nMost people in the U.S. are believed to have PFAS in their bloodstream because PFAS are present at low levels in some foods and in the environment (air, water, soil), according to the Agency on Toxic Substances and Disease Registry.\n\nWHAT ARE PFAS? They're in almost every person's blood, plus more things to know about the chemicals\n\nThe chemicals are understudied and there's a lack of clarity on whether or how PFAS cause problems and a lack of research into the vast majority of PFAS types.\n\n\"The more we learn, the scarier it is,\" said Collin O'Mara, the former DNREC secretary who is now president and CEO of the National Wildlife Federation. \"There is a generation of cleanup that needs to be done.\"\n\nExisting research says PFAS may affect the growth, learning and behavior of infants and older children; lower a woman's chance of getting pregnant; result in lower birth weights; interfere with the body's natural hormones; increase cholesterol levels; affect the immune system and increase the risk of cancer, according to the EPA.\n\nThere is no federal PFAS regulation, though policy watchers predict that might change during President Joe Biden's administration. Biden's infrastructure plan includes money to go toward monitoring and remediating PFAS.\n\nDelaware Sen. Tom Carper in 2019 introduced with other senators legislation to mandate that the EPA declare PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances eligible for cleanup funds under the EPA Superfund law and enable a requirement that polluters undertake or pay for remediation.\n\nEarlier this year, the EPA announced it was soliciting data on the presence and treatment of PFAS in wastewater discharges from formulators and manufacturers.\n\nO'Mara said he was hopeful that what is starting in Delaware will lead to a more national movement around the chemicals.\n\n\"The time has come to act nationally,\" he said.\n\nO'Mara and Delaware DOJ officials said Tuesday the science is still evolving.\n\n\"What we know is that PFAS is a carcinogen and when it exists in high enough quantities it poses serious health risks,\" Jennings said.\n\n'Most significant environmental legal settlement in Delaware history'\n\nThe legal trouble related to its chemical use is far from new for DuPont, but it marks a first with the state of Delaware, where the company was founded in 1802 as a gunpowder manufacturer at a mill located along the Brandywine Creek that 150 years later became the site of Hagley Museum and Library.\n\nThe du Pont family is responsible for Winterthur and the Nemours Estate, the construction of the Route 13 highway, the creation of Nemours/A.I. duPont Hospital for Children – which recently changed its name to Nemours Children's Hospital – and much more.\n\nDuPont, which once owned The News Journal before it sold the newspaper to Gannett in 1978, employed 10% of the state's workforce at one point. As recently as 1985, 26,600 Delaware residents received a paycheck from the company.\n\nFor years, as it was helping to build the state's economy, the company was harming Delaware's environment.\n\nCorporate records from 3M and DuPont showed that both companies developed a sophisticated understanding of health and environmental hazards that PFAS posed no later than the 1960s. Both companies concealed the information and submitted thousands of industrial applications for the chemicals, generating billions of dollars in revenue.\n\nAfter 3M was pressured by the EPA to withdraw from the manufacturing of PFOA, DuPont— despite fully understanding the compound’s hazards, having bought it from 3M and used it since the 1950s — decided to begin manufacturing on its own.\n\nDuPont started purchasing PFOA from Minnesota-based 3M in 1951 to use in the manufacturing of Teflon. It calls the PFOA C8.\n\nDuPont phased out its use of PFOA more than a decade ago, replacing it with GenX. In 2015, it spun off its fluoroproducts operations and some of those potential liabilities to a company it called Chemours.\n\nCorteva\n\nSince then, the companies have been involved in numerous lawsuits.\n\nChemours sued DuPont in 2019, saying the company deliberately misrepresented the cost of environmental liabilities Chemours would face in reimbursing DuPont for pollution related to PFAS.\n\nThat suit was dismissed in Chancery Court in March 2020, a ruling the state's Supreme Court upheld in December, agreeing that Vice Chancellor Sam Glasscock III had no jurisdiction to hear the case because the dispute was subject to mandatory arbitration.\n\nDuPont and Chemours reached an agreement in January that resolved legal disputes originating from the spinoff. The agreement established a cost-sharing arrangement and escrow account for potential future legacy PFAS liabilities. DuPont, Chemours and Corteva, previously the agriculture division of DowDuPont, also agreed to resolve nearly 100 pending cases in PFOA litigation in Ohio.\n\nDuPont and Chemours each agreed in 2017 to pay $335.35 million in cash to resolve the thousands of claims that arose from the release of PFOA into the ground, air and water from the Washington Works plant in Parkersburg, West Virginia.\n\nDuPont and Chemours were also sued in 2020 by the state of North Carolina, which alleged DuPont and then Chemours for decades knew the harm they were doing in dumping chemicals in the Cape Fear River.\n\n3M, DuPont, Chemours and Solvay were ordered by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection in 2019 to spend millions of dollars to assess the extent of the pollution in the state and eventually clean it up. The target of that directive came from PFAS produced at the Chambers Works factory near Penns Grove, New Jersey.\n\nUntil this year, DuPont's legal issues hadn't really been in Delaware.\n\nThe settlement is Delaware's way of proceeding with remediation, cleanup and trying to mitigate and eliminate those the best we can with dollars.\n\nSaid O'Mara, the former DNREC secretary: \"It’s the most significant environmental legal settlement in Delaware history.\"\n\nThe settlement is the first time a Delaware attorney general has resolved natural resource damages claims on behalf of the state, the DOJ\n\nIt's the latest environmental action Jennings has taken since she took office in 2019. Last year, she sued 31 fossil fuel companies, including Exxon, Chevron and BP, accusing them of deceiving the public about the role their products play in causing climate change and damaging the state's environment.\n\nShe's also a plaintiff or adviser in several lawsuits dealing with everything from clean power and interstate smog to oil drilling in the country's oceans and wildlife refuges.\n\nMore PFAS in Delaware\n\nIn 2018, residents and businesses in Blades, a Sussex County town just south of Seaford, were told not to use their tap water for drinking and cooking after PFAS were detected in the town's public water supply.\n\nFive of the small town's residents said in a 2019 lawsuit that they suffer from high levels of the toxins in their blood. They sued a defunct metal plating company, which had been accused of polluting the water, as well as 3M, DuPont and Chemours, the companies responsible today for past production of the chemicals.\n\n\"3M, DuPont, and Chemours had a duty to warn users of their ... products of the dangers of releasing (them) into the environment,\" the suit stated.\n\nThat suit came during a nationwide effort to respond to multiple reports of water pollution from the PFAS family of chemicals.\n\nIt wasn't just PFAS tainting the groundwater in Blades. Heavy metal, as well as copper, nickel and zinc, drove a proposal to include Blades' groundwater on a federal list of the nation’s most toxic sites.\n\nThe EPA last year designated Blades a Superfund site for the purpose of cleaning up industrial chemicals.\n\nAssignment to the Superfund National Priorities List qualifies hazardous waste sites for long-term federal funding towards their cleanup. The funding mechanism was established by Congress in 1980 in response to several high-profile toxic waste disasters, including Love Canal, New York.\n\nBeginning in February 2018, the state of Delaware supplied eight Blades residences with carbon filtration technology to remove PFAS from their private wells to meet quality standards. In spring of that year, the state of Delaware and the town installed a treatment system on public wells.\n\nWith the Superfund listing, EPA took over public water supply sampling and carbon treatment from the state.\n\nThe worst PFAS contamination site is in Dover, in and around Dover Air Force Base, where hundreds of gallons of aqueous film-forming foam were used to prevent a devastating fire from spreading after a 735,000-pound C-5 military aircraft bound for Kuwait came crashing down in Delaware in 2006.\n\nThe Air Force has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars trying to keep the contamination from spreading to neighbors’ drinking water sources. As of last year, five deep municipal wells on and near the base that provide drinking water have been found to be safe from contamination, officials said. Only six private wells out of dozens tested were found to be contaminated.\n\nAir Force officials last year declined to provide the exact level of contamination found in the six private wells in Dover, but Joseph Kowalski, a remedial program manager at the Air Force Civil Engineer Center, said they each had concentrations in the range of 3,000 ppt to 170,000 ppt – which would be 42 to 2,428 times the health advisory limit.\n\nFurther north, the CDC collected blood samples from people who may have been drinking tainted water near New Castle Airport. The results of those blood samples revealed a presence of PFAS much higher than the national average. But 13 tap water samples were below all federal and applicable state guidelines for PFAS in drinking water and urine samples also did not cause alarm.\n\nContact reporter Jeff Neiburg at jneiburg@delawareonline.com.

The agency recently released information about a proposal by the Huntsville airport and Nevada-based Sierra Space to use the site roughly 15 miles west of downtown to land ships that resemble a small space shuttle with upswept wings, WHNT-TV reports. The spacecraft would be launched elsewhere and land on an existing runway in Huntsville, which has the largest commercial airport in north Alabama and is a hub for the aerospace industry. The Huntsville-Madison County Airport Authority said the FAA is conducting a preliminary review of the proposal. A study completed in 2015 found the airport compatible for the so-called Dream Chaser, which Sierra Space describes as a “spaceplane” designed to take crew and cargo into low-Earth orbit. It would be launched on an Atlas V rocket. Both the airport and the company would need licenses before any landings could occur.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A split federal appeals court panel has sent back for further legal review a 2019 decision by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to withdraw proposed restrictions on large-scale mining in Alaska’s Bristol Bay region. A panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sent the matter back to a lower court to determine whether the agency’s action “was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or contrary to law.” The appeals court panel expresses “no view on that question,” the decision dated Thursday said. The EPA during the Obama administration proposed but never finalized restrictions on large-scale mining in response to the Pebble Mine project. In 2019, during the Trump administration, the agency withdrew the proposed restrictions, removing what it called an “outdated, preemptive proposed veto of the Pebble Mine” and allowing the project to be vetted through the permitting process. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers last fall rejected a key permit for the proposed copper and gold mine. Pebble’s developer, the Pebble Limited Partnership, is appealing that decision. Trout Unlimited and other groups sued over the EPA’s 2019 decision. Nelli Williams, Alaska director for Trout Unlimited, called the ruling “an important step toward providing immediate Clean Water Act safeguards for Bristol Bay.”\n\nArizona\n\nMesa: A wig store that serves people who’ve lost their hair to chemotherapy continues to require shoppers to wear masks to protect people with cancer from COVID-19. But last month, the suburban Phoenix shop started receiving harassing phone calls after the founder of an anti-mask group tried to ruin the business by posting its name, phone number and address on social media. Since then, Sunny’s Hair and Wigs has received an outpouring of support from concerned citizens and even a visit from Mesa Mayor John Giles and city Councilman Francisco Heredia. “It’s just been overwhelming,” shop owner Lisa Memberr said. Memberr said her staff has been inundated with phone calls and visits from complete strangers bringing food, treats and some cash and “just letting them know that people care and that we are not alone in this and that they support what we did and are taking action to show that.” The store recently received a check for $1,000 from a woman in New Jersey to help buy wigs for people undergoing cancer treatment. The store was targeted May 28 by Ethan Schmidt, the 23-year-old founder of an anti-mask group who travels around metro Phoenix confronting businesses that still require customers to wear masks to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 while claiming he is the victim of discrimination.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: The head of the flagship University of Arkansas campus announced Thursday that he was stepping down, citing the challenge of leading the school in “today’s polarized society.” University of Arkansas Chancellor Joe Steinmetz’s resignation, which took effect Friday, came after the UA Board of Trustees met in executive session but took no action. “I still strongly believe in the mission of higher education, yet given the many challenges found trying to manage a university in today’s polarized society, I need to do what’s best for my family and I feel ready to make way for others,” Steinmetz said in a statement announcing his decision. He did not elaborate. Steinmetz’s resignation also followed his recommendation last month to move a campus statue of the late Sen. J. William Fulbright in response to complaints about Fulbright’s support of segregationist legislation. Republican lawmakers during a hearing last week told Steinmetz that such a move would violate a new state law protecting monuments and could result in criminal charges. Steinmetz has served as the school’s chancellor since January 2016. The university said in a release that UA System President Donald R. Bobbitt would visit with the campus and the school’s supporters before announcing plans for choosing the next chancellor.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state is now offering residents a digital record of their COVID-19 vaccinations that they can use to access businesses or events that require proof they got the shots. The state’s public health and technology departments said the new tool allows Californians access to their COVID-19 records from the state’s immunization registry and includes the same information as the paper cards issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. To access the information, Californians will enter into a state website their name, date of birth, and the email or phone associated with their vaccine records, and they will be asked to create a four-digit PIN. The record will include a QR code that users can save to their mobile phones. With nearly 20 million people fully vaccinated in California and proof of vaccination already required in some circumstances such as travel, state health officials felt there would be demand for the tool, though it remains optional, said Dr. Erica Pan, the state’s epidemiologist. “The odds are someone is going to misplace their paper CDC card, and a digital COVID-19 vaccine record provides a convenient backup,” she told reporters Friday.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A coalition that wants to ask voters to approve higher taxes on recreational marijuana to help children make up for learning losses during the pandemic and address special needs for low-income and disadvantaged students said it’s been endorsed by former Democratic and Republican governors. Learning Opportunities for Colorado’s Kids is circulating petitions in hopes of collecting nearly 250,000 voter signatures needed by Aug. 2 to place its initiative on the November ballot. The campaign said former Democratic Gov. Bill Ritter, former Republican Gov. Bill Owens, state lawmakers from both parties, and a host of educational and advocacy groups, many serving Black and Latino children, have endorsed the effort. Initiative 25 would create a Colorado Learning Authority within the state education department to oversee out-of-school tutoring, English language instruction, special needs and disability instruction, mental health, and career and technical training for children ages 5 to 17. It would generally help children from low-income families and those falling behind their grade levels by certifying tutors, who can be teachers doing the work outside regular hours. To pay for the program, backers want voters to approve a 5% excise tax increase on recreational marijuana by 2024 to generate more than $137 million a year.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: One of the state’s legendary music clubs is reopening after a yearlong closure due to the pandemic, with the help of the federal government. Toad’s Place celebrated with its first live music, a jazz duo, Friday along with Sen. Richard Blumenthal and Rep. Rosa DeLauro. The club had been closed since March 2020. Blumenthal called the club “iconic.” Toad’s opened in the 1970s and has been a hot spot for local bands but also has hosted acts such as the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, U2 and, more recently, Cardi B and Kendrick Lamar. The club was awarded a $1 million grant through the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant program. Venues that lost at least 90% of their revenues during the pandemic are eligible. DeLauro said the federal government has received about 13,000 applications for aid from entertainment venues, and it appears there is enough money to provide support to those that qualify. Catherine Marx, Connecticut district director for the Small Business Administration, said grants had been prioritized for the venues that had been hardest-hit by the pandemic, and Toad’s is one of 10 Connecticut venues to receive funds so far, the New Haven Register reports. “We’ve missed our performing arts. We’ve missed going out,” Marx said.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Lawmakers want to add protections in the state constitution for the LGBTQ community and people with disabilities. House Bill 199 by House Majority Leader Valerie Longhurst, D-Bear, would add “sexual orientation,” “gender identity” and “disability” to the Delaware Constitution’s equal rights clause. The legislation would make the First State the first state in the U.S. to add these protections for LGBTQ people to its constitution, lawmakers said. In Delaware, constitutional amendments require lawmakers to pass one bill for two consecutive legislative sessions, which span two years. This bill would be the first of two, and the next one would not be voted on until 2023 at the earliest. Earlier this year, lawmakers amended the constitution to add anti-discrimination protections for people of color. In 2019, they amended it to prohibit discrimination based on sex. The new bill comes five years after lawmakers failed to agree on a similar, more inclusive proposal from then-Sen. Karen Peterson that would have added protections for race, sex and national origin, along with age, religion, creed, color, familial status, disability, sexual orientation and gender identity. Since then, several new Democratic lawmakers – including members of the LGBTQ community – have been elected to the Statehouse.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The fight for D.C. statehood continues this week at the U.S. Capitol as proponents prepare to make their case in front of a Senate committee, WUSA-TV reports. The hearing before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs is scheduled for Tuesday morning, according to a statement from D.C. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, who said it will be only the second time ever the Senate has held a hearing on statehood for the nation’s capital. Many of the arguments at Tuesday’s hearing will likely echo those made at another hearing earlier this year. In March, Norton told a House committee that “Congress can no longer allow D.C. residents to be sidelined in the Democratic ... process.” For Norton and many other supporters, statehood for the district is a civil rights issue. “Denying American citizens a vote in the body that taxes them goes against the founding principles of this great nation,” D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said at that same hearing. However, GOP opposition in the House was strong, with many Republicans calling the push for statehood a political power grab to tip the balance in Congress in Democrats’ favor.\n\nFlorida\n\nPalm Coast: A high school principal spent the last several months of the school year crafting personalized notes for each of 459 graduates and left them on their seats to read before receiving their diplomas. Matanzas High School principal Jeff Reaves scoured through transcripts, emails and his own personal memories to prepare the notes in time for the June 2 graduation. He wanted to do something special since the seniors’ last two years were marred by the coronavirus pandemic. “I want to be positive for our students, especially in a time where there’s a lot of negativity and turmoil in the world,” Reaves said. “I wanted to shine some light on the students and encourage them as they begin their next journey in life.” He said the process was especially beneficial to him because he got a chance to learn more about each student. “It’s easy to get caught up in the numbers, but it’s the names that really matter. I was doing my part to help them feel connected as a community and have their high school experience to be positive.” Reaves said he’s always tried to work in something special for each class, by recognizing certain students and through the songs played at commencements. Last June, seniors graduated at Daytona International Speedway, and the school put customized yard signs for each student on the football field.\n\nGeorgia\n\nBrunswick: The coastal county where Ahmaud Arbery’s slaying raised an outcry over racial injustice has hired its first full-time Black police chief. Glynn County commissioners voted Thursday for Jacques Battiste to lead an embattled department that some state lawmakers tried unsuccessfully to abolish last year. A former FBI agent now serving as a deputy constable in New Orleans, Battiste was chosen after a search conducted by the Georgia Association of Chiefs of Police with assistance from the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives. “I promise you I will bring my best game every day,” Battiste told residents during a community forum last week. Battiste’s hiring comes after a turbulent year for the Glynn County Police Department. The agency was widely criticized for making no arrests after Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man, was chased and fatally shot by three white men who spotted him running in their neighborhood Feb. 23, 2020. Charges came more than two months later after the Georgia Bureau of Investigation took over. Days after Arbery’s killing, Glynn County Police Chief John Powell was indicted on unrelated malfeasance charges in what prosecutors called an illegal effort to cover up a narcotics officer’s affair with a confidential informant.\n\nHawaii\n\nHana: Some people who live in east Maui say the famed Road to Hana is becoming a gridlocked maze of illegally parked cars driven by tourists. Residents are asking for state and county help to address the traffic and parking problem, Hawaii News Now reports. Maui has seen an influx of visitors as pandemic restrictions have eased. The drive to Hana is among the most popular tourist activities on the island. Now that 8,000 visitors a day are arriving on Maui, the narrow, winding road is getting jammed. The coastal roadway brings visitors past waterfalls and sea cliffs along a rural and lush Hawaii rainforest. The remote shoreline’s residents are among the most geographically isolated in the state. Officials say 400 to 600 people drive the road each day. The state recently installed signs warning people of parking fines. But residents want a more comprehensive traffic plan. “We know our visitors are important to our economy. But there comes a time where you really start to look at the numbers,” said east Maui resident Kamalani Pahukoa, who often sees traffic jams and illegally parked rental cars. “That becomes a problem to our quality of life, traditions, culture and access.” Toll roads and reservation systems are among ideas being looked at, said Lauren Armstrong, the Maui Metropolitan Planning Organization’s executive director.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Officials have approved a plan for Boise government to be carbon neutral by 2035 and the entire city by 2050 to fight climate change. The Boise City Council voted unanimously last week to approve the Climate Action Roadmap. The plan includes a goal for government to use only clean electricity by 2030. Carbon neutrality means cutting greenhouse gas emissions to “net zero.” The goal is to reduce carbon dioxide, the main heat-trapping gas warming the atmosphere. “Tonight is truly a historic moment for our city,” Mayor Lauren McLean said after the vote. “We’re the generation that must solve the climate crisis because our health and economy depend on us doing this now. Boise will be a climate innovation leader, and we will rise to the challenge of this moment.” The capital city has about 225,000 residents. Benefits of the plan include improving human health and growing a climate-friendly economy, officials said. Ways for the city to meet carbon neutrality include such things as switching to electric vehicles or sequestering carbon dioxide by planting trees that store carbon. The plan also calls for using less energy, traveling less and reducing waste. “It is a detailed plan with attainable goals,” Councilman Patrick Bageant said. “It’s not just a declaration of a wish list; it’s an actual plan that we will begin to execute.”\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The state’s primary election will be moved from March to June next year under a voter access expansion signed into law by Gov. J.B. Pritzker. The new law makes mail voting a permanent option, allows jail inmates awaiting trial to cast ballots and makes Election Day in November a state holiday, among other things. The move is in contrast with other states that are moving to restrict voter access. “With attacks on voting rights on the rise in states across the nation, Illinois is proud to stand up for a strong, secure, and accessible democracy,” Pritzker said in a statement Thursday. The law took effect immediately. Next year’s primary will move from March 15 to June 28 because lawmakers decided not to draw new post-census district boundaries for members of Congress until official 2020 census figures, delayed by the pandemic, arrive later this summer. Many changes continue or expand existing practices put in place last year to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. Election Day would continue to be a state holiday, with empty schools used as polling places. Also, Illinois counties would be required to establish at least one universal voting center to give voters alternatives sites.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A man who threatened his neighbor with anti-Black racial slurs, displayed a swastika and threw eggs in an attempt to intimidate the neighbor has been sentenced to 46 months in prison and three years supervised release for criminal violations of the Fair Housing Act and unlawful possession of firearms. Shepherd Hoehn, 51, pleaded guilty to the charges earlier this year. Among other racist actions, Hoehn burned a cross above the fence line facing his neighbor’s property and repeatedly played Confederate-era minstrel anthem “Dixie.” The intimidation began when Hoehn became angry as a construction crew began to remove a tree from the neighbor’s property, according to court documents. “Today, Mr. Hoehn was held responsible for his vile conduct,” Special Agent in Charge Paul Keenan of the FBI Indianapolis Division said in a press release Friday. The case was investigated by the FBI, with assistance from the Lawrence Police Department. “We are a diverse nation, bound together by shared values and beliefs,” Keenan said. “We are also a nation of laws. Those like Mr. Hoehn who would betray our shared values and beliefs through behavior such as this rightly suffer the penalties our laws prescribe.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A sharply divided Iowa Supreme Court on Friday stopped a lawsuit aimed at reducing the flow of fertilizer and hog farm waste into the state’s river and streams, finding that limiting pollution from farms was a political matter and not one for the courts. The 4-3 decision handed a significant defeat to environmental groups hoping to get the chance to prove that Iowa should scrap its voluntary farm pollution policy, order new mandatory limits on nitrogen and phosphorous pollution, and stop construction of new hog barns. It is the latest court rejection of an attempt to force the nation’s leading corn- and pork-producing state to clean up farm pollutants from its major rivers that provide drinking water to hundreds of thousands of Iowans. The lawsuit, which was brought by Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement and Food & Water Watch, contended that unregulated farm pollution is violating the rights of citizens to clean water in the Raccoon River for recreational and drinking water use. It said a legal concept that precedes Iowa statehood – the public trust doctrine – should apply to this case and require the state to ensure that citizens have a usable Raccoon River untainted by excess pollution caused by farm runoff of fertilizer and animal manure.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A team of archaeologists – Jay Sturdevant, Adam Wiewel, Nikki Klarmann and Robert Hoard – recently spent two days in the city laying the groundwork for an excavation project to take place next summer at the Brown v. Board National Historic Site. The Kansas Archeology Training Program field school will be held June 3-19, 2022. The public is welcome to help excavate land archaeologists believe will yield artifacts and the foundations of demolished buildings. Klarmann, public outreach archaeologist for the Kansas Historical Society, said the field school is an opportunity to get a taste of archaeology. “A lot of people think maybe it’s just going out, digging and collecting, but there’s a lot more to it than that. They get experience in the field excavating but also in the lab analyzing artifacts,” Klarmann said. The field school is open to anyone over age 12. Registration will open March 1, 2022, with a registration fee of $15-$90. Klarmann said most participants are people who are curious and don’t have an archaeology background. “Really it’s just people who are interested in history and learning more about their state,” Klarmann said. “We also have people who come from California to do this, and they’ve been coming for years.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Thousands of Kentuckians can now apply for a waiver that could clear them from having to repay the overpayments included in their unemployment benefits. The Kentucky Office of Unemployment Insurance says it has mailed notices to about 14,000 unemployment claimants identified as having been overpaid in 2020. The notices inform claimants how much they were overpaid and provide instructions on how to apply for the waiver, either online or by completing an enclosed form, the state agency said. Claimants have 30 days from the date postmarked on the letter to apply for the waiver and must attest that the overpayment was the result of no fault of their own, the agency said. Legislation allowing the state to waive the overpayment of some pandemic-related unemployment claims was passed by lawmakers this year and signed by Gov. Andy Beshear. The state has paid out more than $6 billion in unemployment benefits during the pandemic, Beshear’s administration said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nAvery Island: As storms grow more violent and Louisiana loses more of its coast, the family that makes Tabasco Sauce is fighting erosion in the marshland that buffers its factory from hurricanes and floods. Overall, the effort is probably a standoff, said CEO and President Harold “Took” Osborn, great-great-grandson of the McIlhenny Co.’s founder. But in a state that has lost 2,000 square miles of its coast since 1932, holding ground is a victory. The company has been brewing Tabasco Sauce since 1868 on Avery Island, the tip of a miles-deep column of salt. While sinking land is a problem throughout southern Louisiana, Avery Island and four smaller salt domes along the Gulf Coast are still slowly rising. But the danger from hurricanes remains. A 20-foot-high, $5 million earthen levee now encloses the 40 acres or so around Tabasco’s factory after Hurricane Rita’s storm surge pushed floodwaters within inches of it in 2005. Much of the wetlands work is low-tech, enlisting volunteers to plant marsh grass in the 30,000 acres around the island. Osborn holds a master’s degree in environmental science from Oxford University, and company founder Edmund McIlhenny was a self-taught naturalist. Osborn’s great-grandfather, E.A. McIlhenny, created an egret rookery at the island in 1895 because the birds were nearing extermination by hunters who sold their plumage to adorn women’s hats.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A statewide ban on single-use plastic bags will begin July 1. The Maine Department of Environmental Protection said it is working with retail stores and restaurants to make sure they are ready. The Legislature passed the ban in 2019, and it was initially scheduled to go into effect in April 2020. The state delayed enforcement of the ban because of aspects of the coronavirus pandemic. The first delay was due to concerns about the transmission of the virus and a second delay due to concerns stemming from disruption in packing supplies amid the pandemic, the DEP said. When the ban takes effect, stores and restaurants will not be allowed to provide single-use plastic bags, the DEP said. Grocery stores, box stores and other large retailers must collect a 5 cent fee for each such bag used, the agency said.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Replacing Amtrak’s Baltimore & Potomac Tunnel will take a least a decade or more to complete. But the $4 billion rail project has officially begun, and officials say it will eliminate the biggest passenger rail bottleneck between Washington and New Jersey. The Baltimore Sun reports officials kicked off the project’s start at an event Friday that included the great-great-granddaughter of Frederick Douglass. The tunnel will be renamed after the famed abolitionist. Douglass had escaped the bonds of slavery on Maryland’s Eastern Shore and eventually boarded a New York-bound train from Baltimore in 1838. “If it had not been for the railroad,” Nettie Washington Douglass told the Sun in an interview, “I would not be standing here.” Jeffrey Ensor, Amtrak’s senior director for the south end of the Northeast Corridor, said the new tunnel will increase train speeds to more than 100 mph from 30 mph. Construction will be funded by the federal and state government because the tunnel is used by Amtrak and MARC passengers. Negotiations are underway to determine how much each government will contribute.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: In a move likely to strike a chord with music fans, the Boston Symphony Orchestra has announced plans to reopen Symphony Hall and resume in-person performances for a complete season starting in September. The BSO will open the 2021-22 season Sept. 30 – after an 18-month live-audience performance hiatus because of the coronavirus pandemic – with Music Director Andris Nelsons sharing the podium with Boston Pops Conductor Laureate John Williams for a program featuring soloist Anne-Sophie Mutter. The program will feature Beethoven’s Consecration of the House Overture, the work that opened the orchestra’s inaugural concert in 1881. The reopening concert will also feature the Boston premiere of a new work by Williams, Violin Concerto No. 2, and Bartok’s Concerto for Orchestra. The season that runs until next April also features a new cycle of six major works by Richard Strauss; a performance cycle of five Beethoven concertos with soloist Mitsuko Uchida; orchestra works of Berlioz, Brahms, Ives, Mahler, Prokofiev, Rachmaninoff, Still and Stravinsky; and world premieres by Julia Adolphe, HK Gruber, and Kaija Saariaho and American premieres by Unsuk Chin and Jorg Widmann. To celebrate the reopening of Symphony Hall, the BSO will also present a free community concert Oct. 3 featuring Nelsons, Williams, Keith Lockhart and Thomas Wilkins.\n\nMichigan\n\nTraverse City: Organizers of a popular festival that was shut down last year due to the pandemic are encouraging people attending this summer to receive free COVID-19 vaccinations on-site. Masks will not be required at the 95th National Cherry Festival, scheduled July 3-10 at Traverse City’s Open Space Park, according to MLive.com. The Grand Traverse Health Department will offer the one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine at a tent at the park. Michigan lifted all indoor capacity restrictions and mask requirements Monday as the state’s vaccination rate increases and the numbers of COVID-19 infections continue to decrease. “With the impossibility of knowing when restrictions would be lifted or changed, we had to start planning in January to provide Traverse City with a safe, family-friendly event that allowed everyone to participate no matter how ready they are to fully enter back into ‘normal’ life,” said Kat Paye, festival executive director. The festival, a major northern Michigan summer destination for decades, typically offers parades, fireworks, concerts, farm tours, a carnival midway and cherry pie-eating contests. Many event spaces will be reconfigured this year. Some activities will be presented in new ways, such as the festival parade being stationary instead of participants marching along a parade route.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A new student group in the University of Minnesota School of Dentistry aims to continue the effort to advance diversity, equity and inclusion in the school. Better Together hosted its first event May 25, exactly one year after George Floyd was murdered in Minneapolis. Arpun Johal, a third-year student and one of the group’s founding members, said Floyd’s murder prompted the group’s formation, The Minnesota Daily reports. “Last year, I feel that many people did a lot of reflection about racism and the political climate in the U.S.,” Johal said. “From that, we noticed that there was a lot of work to be done in our own careers to help with the larger civil rights movement.” The group’s first meeting covered recent hate crimes against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, anti-Asian racism, the experiences of Asian dental students at the university and how to become a better ally to Asian students and patients. Zayna Jan, another third-year student and founding member of Better Together, created a toolkit for bystander intervention that students can review and utilize. “I wanted (the toolkit) to be something that people can look at easily and understand quickly – and for it to be dental school-specific,” Jan said.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The more than 1,500 Mississippi National Guard members who have been working throughout the state over the course of the coronavirus pandemic to help with virus testing, vaccinations and other initiatives are being withdrawn next month, Gov. Tate Reeves said Friday. The state will cease all operations with the Mississippi National Guard on July 15, Reeves said. The Republican governor also announced that he will lift the COVID-19 state of emergency order Aug. 15. While all pandemic-related restrictions have been lifted, the state of emergency order has remained in place to ensure that members of the National Guard continue to be paid while stationed in Mississippi. Guard members have been serving in Mississippi since March 2020, stationed at dozens of state-run vaccination and testing sites. Adjutant General of the Mississippi National Guard Maj. Gen. Janson D. Boyles said Friday that the governor’s timeline to lift Mississippi’s state of emergency declaration ensures his service members will “complete all necessary out-processing requirements and receive the benefits and entitlements they have earned during their dedicated service to our state.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Joseph: Summer classes have moved online for some elementary and middle school students because of COVID-19 cases. The St. Joseph News-Press reports Robidoux and Pershing schools will conduct classes virtually through July 1, when summer school ends. Only about 1 in 5 eligible residents, or 20.6%, have received a COVID-19 vaccine in Buchanan County, where St. Joseph is located. That’s below the still-low statewide average of 37%. The vaccine is generally available to all people 12 and older. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved any vaccine for those under age 12, which has been a cause for increased precautions regarding COVID-19 in an elementary school environment. “We just took a precautionary measure,” said Gabe Edgar, the district’s assistant superintendent, adding that because the district has a remote learning system in place, it “really doesn’t make sense to leave those kids in there, potentially at risk.” She said all other summer school locations will remain in person. Summer sessions already were being conducted online only for high school students.\n\nMontana\n\nWest Glacier: Glacier National Park says it’s seeing more visitors showing up early in the morning and evening when the park’s new ticketed entry system is not in effect. Glacier administrators say people who arrive at the park’s West entrance after 5 p.m. should expect heavy traffic and long waits. The park in northwestern Montana on the Canada border had almost 300,000 visits through May. That’s the highest year-to-date number on record. To ease congestion on the popular Going-to-the-Sun Road, Glacier this year began requiring visitors to obtain an entry ticket and reservation prior to arrival. About a quarter of Memorial Day weekend visitors arrived without a reservation at the park’s West and St. Mary entrances.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Work has begun on nearly $30 million in renovation projects that will change the entrance to Omaha’s Eppley Airfield and upgrade one of the national airport’s garages. The entrance to the airport terminal will be moved about a quarter-mile south, toward downtown along Abbott Drive, the Omaha World-Herald reports, under a project estimated at $20.8 million. The change comes following several studies in recent years showing the need for a longer, wider entrance that will give drivers more time to make maneuvering decisions. The $8.3 million in improvements to the airport’s south garage will include construction of an express ramp to provide access to premier parking and provide wider parking stalls. Both projects include new signs, lights and landscaping. Construction began Wednesday and is slated to be finished by late 2022. Both the terminal and south garage will be open during construction, although drivers may encounter occasional minor detours or closures. Most of the funding for the projects will come from Omaha Airport Authority revenues, but the terminal entrance project is getting a $12 million boost in grants from the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Amid a second year of intense drought, the Nevada Department of Wildlife’s water developments – the only source of water for miles for desert bighorn sheep – have hit perilously low storage levels in Valley of Fire State Park. Without the agency’s emergency intervention, animal populations will decline, and ecosystem viability is threatened. “We’ve had drought conditions before. We have had to haul water on an emergency basis, but not anywhere near approaching this magnitude, this scale of severity,” Wildlife Game Biologist Pat Cummings told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. “I have been in Southern Nevada since the mid-’70s. I remember 2001 and 2002 as being the worst, back-to-back dry years, even worse than 1996. But what we see now is even worse, even worse.” Last year, Las Vegas went 240 days without measurable rainfall. This year, 40% of the state is in exceptional drought, the highest level, according to the National Weather Service. “All animals, especially bighorn sheep, which have evolved to coexist with the desert environment, rely a lot on the vegetation for water,” Southern Region Game Supervisor Joe Bennett said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Disciplinary hearings for police officers accused of misconduct serious enough for decertification should not be automatically held behind closed doors, a judge ruled. The judge’s decision came as the Legislature voted to make disciplinary proceedings public. A spokesman for Gov. Chris Sununu told New Hampshire Public Radio that the governor supports the bill. The Union Leader newspaper sued over the disciplinary proceedings of a detective and an officer in Manchester, arguing that the New Hampshire Police Standards and Training Council’s practice of shielding hearings and certain records from public view, if requested by the officer, was a violation of the state’s Right to Know law. Judge Andrew Schulman agreed that the council should no longer automatically exempt the public from reading materials or viewing disciplinary proceedings. However, the order does not create a blanket requirement that all disciplinary proceedings be made public. The attorney general’s office is still reviewing the decision and hasn’t said if it will appeal.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: In a state where medical marijuana is often more expensive than flying elsewhere and buying it there, patients registered with some financial assistance programs could see their weed costs covered. The cost of New Jersey medical marijuana, among the highest of any state in the country, would be covered for patients enrolled in four different financial assistance programs meant to help children, seniors, crime victims and those with disabilities, under identical bills already approved by the Senate and Assembly health committees. The bills, sponsored by Sen. Joseph Vitale, D-Middlesex, and Assemblyman Herb Conaway, D-Burlington, could see votes as soon as this week. Under the legislation, patients enrolled in these programs could only have to pay a small copay for medical marijuana or have their costs covered: the Catastrophic Illness in Children Relief Fund, Pharmaceutical Assistance to the Aged and Disabled, the Senior Gold Prescription Discount and the Victims of Crime Compensation Office. “The cost of cannabis can run into the hundreds of dollars per month for individuals,” Conaway said. “This bill serves those who are financially distressed and ... ensures the benefits of medical cannabis are available to all who may need it.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state ranked 49th in a report released Monday measuring child well-being based on data gathered before the pandemic. That’s an improvement over last year, when New Mexico ranked 50th among U.S. states. “It’s encouraging to see that child well-being in New Mexico was improving before the pandemic hit,” said James Jimenez, executive director for New Mexico Voices for Children, which partners with the foundation. He said he’s cautiously optimistic that state policies “helped offset some of the health and financial problems caused by the pandemic.” The annual Kids Count report released by the Annie E. Casey Foundation tracks 16 metrics of children’s access to education, health, economic and social stability at home. It ranks New Mexico at or near the bottom on education, economics, and “family and community,” which tracks rates of single-parent homes, teen birth rates and whether the head of household has a high school degree. Roughly 1 in 5 New Mexico children lives in an area where 30% of the population is at or below the federal poverty line. Nationally, only 1 in 10 children lives in a high-poverty area, according to the report. The report ranks the state 37th in child health, with kids having average access to insurance (94%) and only slightly higher-than-average obesity (32%).\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The Stonewall Inn’s owners say they won’t serve certain beers at the famous LGBT bar during Pride weekend to protest manufacturer Anheuser-Busch’s political contributions to some politicians who have supported anti-LGBT legislation. Co-owners Stacy Lentz and Kurt Kelly said they would be instituting the ban Friday in support of the “Keep Your Pride” campaign, a recently launched effort highlighting five companies that it says advertise support during Pride but have also made contributions to anti-LGBT lawmakers. The campaign, a project of Corporate Accountability Action, used data compiled from the National Institute on Money in Politics to show that Anheuser-Busch contributed more than $35,000 to 29 legislators it described as anti-LGBT between 2015 and 2020. “We just felt Stonewall having the platform, the power to do this, it was important to stand up,” Lentz said. “We really just want Anheuser-Busch to stop donating to lawmakers who are trying to legalize discrimination.” In a statement, Anheuser-Busch said: “We support candidates for public office whose policy positions and objectives support investments in our communities, job creation, and industry growth.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: A museum criticized for a planned reenactment of a white slave owner being pursued by Union soldiers says its doors will be closed until further notice, a local department said. The Mecklenburg Park and Recreation Department announced Thursday that the Historic Latta Plantation is closed and that all previously scheduled events are canceled while the department assesses the future use of the county-owned property, the agency said on its website. The house and the grounds also will be closed, the department said. The 19th-century house is owned by Mecklenburg County, while a nonprofit operates the facilities and runs the events at the plantation site. Last Tuesday, Mecklenburg County announced it would let its contract with the museum expire next month over the controversial event that many deemed as racially insensitive. The reenactment was scheduled for June 19, the traditional commemoration date of the emancipation of enslaved people in the U.S. known as Juneteenth. On Thursday, President Joe Biden signed legislation making Juneteenth a federal holiday.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMinot: Officials say wildfires have burned about 156 square miles of land across the drought-stricken state so far this year – more than seven times the amount from all of last year. The North Dakota Department of Emergency Services and North Dakota Forest Service report that nearly 1,400 fires have been confirmed in 2021. A total of 921 fires recorded last year burned less than 20 square miles. North Dakota has experienced some of the driest winter and spring months in 127 years of recordkeeping, according to State Forester Tom Claeys. Limited moisture along with warm temperatures have increased the intensity and size of wildfires this year, the Minot Daily News reports. Several local, tribal, state and federal agencies responded to two large wildfires over the April 30-May 2 weekend. The Roosevelt Creek Fire in the Little Missouri National Grassland, north of Medora, burned more than 7 square miles, while another fire on the Fort Berthold Reservation, about 6 miles south of Mandaree, burned more than 15 square miles. “This year, it’s imperative that we all know how to mitigate against wildfires, especially as we make plans to enjoy the summer months by recreating outside with friends and family,” Claeys said, noting that the Fourth of July is “right around the corner.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Just like saving treats for furry friends waiting under the dining room table, utility company AEP Ohio will now donate its leftovers to the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium and The Wilds. Trimmings from trees and shrubs pruned throughout the Columbus area to keep electric power lines clear will soon be used to feed giraffes, beavers and a variety of animals at the zoo and the safari park near Cumberland. Through a new partnership called “Trim to Treat,” AEP Ohio will deliver those leftovers to the zoo twice a week. Those trimmings will then be sorted through to determine what should be used to feed the animals. “We’re just really thankful,” said Jan Ramer, interim senior vice president for animal care and conservation at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium and The Wilds. Ramer said browse – the ecological term for tree trimmings – is good for the animals’ physical and mental health alike. It provides them with fiber needed to aid in their digestion, but it also provides the feeling of being in nature as opposed to captivity. Before the AEP Ohio partnership, Ramer said horticulturalists at the zoo would cut browse from trees and shrubs on its grounds. While that process won’t end with the formation of the partnership, Ramer said AEP’s contributions will supplement and support the zoo’s browse supply.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Oklahoma Turnpike Authority, which pioneered the use of electronic passes 30 years ago, is preparing to take a long-awaited first step toward cashless tolls but has yet to comply with a 2016 deadline to integrate the PikePass system with tolling authorities across the country. When introduced, the PikePass system was hailed as a way to reduce crashes that occurred at toll booths with drivers stopping and slowing down as well as a cost savings for the trucking industry. The turnpike authority reports 2,093,460 vehicles are tagged with PikePasses that stick to the top of a windshield and record when drivers enter and exit toll roads in Oklahoma. Toll booths, however, are still operated on the state’s 11 turnpikes, and traffic backups still occur at toll plazas along busy corridors like the Will Rogers, Turner and Kilpatrick turnpikes. Later this summer, the Kilpatrick Turnpike will be the first to be switched to cashless tolls in which drivers without PikePasses will be billed by mail. “We continue to have accidents at cash lanes, so the impact of this is enormous,” said spokesman Jack Damrill. “It will not just help with safety; it with help with the environment also.”\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Authorities in Lake Oswego and Tigard are among communities asking residents to reduce water use during a chlorine shortage. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports water treatment facilities use the chemical in small amounts to prevent harmful bacteria growth in drinking water supply. State officials say they have a plan to help water districts get the chlorine they need if their stockpiles run low, and there’s no threat to the water on which the public depends. The shortage occurred after a power outage earlier this month at the Westlake chemical facility in Longview, Washington, the main provider of chlorine for Oregon. Matt Marheine, deputy director at the Oregon Department of Emergency Management, said the shortage is not unique to Oregon, and “the drinking water in the state of Oregon is clean and safe to use and drink.” The concern is how long the current chlorine supply will last. Most Oregon water districts have about a month’s supply of chlorine, according to Andre Ourso, administrator for the Oregon Health Authorities’ Center for Health Protection.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nCarlisle: The remains of 10 more Native American children who died more than a century ago at a boarding school in central Pennsylvania are being disinterred and will be returned to their relatives, authorities said. A team of archaeologists began work Saturday at the cemetery on the grounds of the Carlisle Barracks, which also houses the U.S. Army War College. Nine of the children were from the Rosebud Sioux tribe in South Dakota and one from the Alaskan Aleut tribe. The cemetery contains more than 180 graves of students who attended the former Carlisle Indian Industrial School – a government-run boarding school for Native American children. This is the Army’s fourth disinterment project at the school in as many years. The school founded by an Army officer opened in 1879 and housed some 10,000 Indigenous children before it shut down in 1918. Students were forced to cut their braids, dress in uniforms, speak English and adopt European names. Infectious disease and harsh conditions claimed the lives of many of the children buried there. The Army is fully funding the cost of the project – about $500,000 per year, including travel to the transfer ceremony as well as transport and reburial of the deceased children, said Barbara Lewandrowski of the Office of Army Cemeteries.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The administrator of the Rhode Island Division of Motor Vehicles said he had no idea that a sex business was allegedly operating in a building he owns. Cranston police raided the building owned by Walter “Bud” Craddock through his real estate holdings company following a months­long investigation into six properties where investigators suspect prostitution was taking police, according to a police affidavit. Craddock told WPRI-TV he knew there was a business but didn’t know about any illegal activities. “I personally had never gotten any complaints, otherwise this would have been rectified a long time ago,” Craddock said. “If I was aware of the things that were alleged to be going on there, the lease would have been terminated.” The 3,200-square-foot property is one of several owned by Craddock’s LUC Realty and was subject of a raid in 2017 “for the same activity, prostitution and massage without a license,” Cranston Police Chief Col. Michael Winquist told WPRI in an email. All six massage businesses that were raided were shut down, 11 people were arrested, and police are investigating whether women were working against their will, Winquist said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Beach towns are ticketing more people for public drinking as summer visitors flock to the coast. The Post and Courier of Charleston reports open container citations on Isle of Palms and Sullivan’s Island have risen above their pre-pandemic levels. On Folly Beach, not a single person received an open container ticket in the weeks leading up to Memorial Day in 2019. This year, officers handed out seven citations between the end of April and May 23. On Sullivan’s Island, beach officers wrote 180 open container tickets ahead of Memorial Day, a 120% increase from tickets in the same period in 2019. Town officials say the alcohol violations might be related to people enjoying their lives as vaccinations have emboldened some and helped keep many COVID-19 cases at bay. Sullivan’s Island Town Administrator Andy Benke said open container tickets usually pick up after Memorial Day because the beach service officers, who are Citadel cadets this year, get better at ticketing – and less reluctant to punish beachgoers having a good time – over the summer. “If you’ve driven that far to spend the day at the beach, maybe you’re more inclined to roll the dice and take a chance,” Benke told the newspaper. “But Sullivan’s Island and Folly and Isle of Palms don’t allow alcohol on the beach. That’s just the way it is.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: An abandoned gypsum mine in Black Hawk that was exposed by a sinkhole in 2020 may extend farther than current mapped areas show, according to a geophysical study. Mohammad Sadeghi, a professor of geological engineering at Montana Technical University who led the study, said there’s a possibility that the mine extends below Interstate 90. The study recommends further research be done in the area. More than 40 people from 15 homes in the Hideaway Hills neighborhood were forced to evacuate after the collapse in April 2020 in Black Hawk, about 8 miles northwest of Rapid City. At least two lawsuits have been filed in relation to the collapse, one of which is one step closer to class-action status, the Rapid City Journal reports. The Fitzgerald Law firm of Rapid City filed a lawsuit against developers and county and state entities. Fox Rothschild, a large national law firm, filed one against state government. Hideaway Hills residents are also seeking answers to a potential loss of sewage service due to the mine. Sadeghi has presented his team’s research methods to Hideaway Hills residents and said he believed the sinkhole opened due to surface water infiltrating the ground and seeping into the roof of the mine that dissolved gypsum.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The Tennessee Department of Correction announced it is participating in a service that provides the public with criminal case information and custody status of inmates. The Victim Information and Notification Everyday service will be used in conjunction with TDOC’s current victim notification system. That system already provides written notice of offenders’ location, transfer, sentence expiration, release and parole hearings. The VINE system will allow crime victims to have more control over the type of notifications they receive and choose the method by which they are notified, according to the Correction Department. Anyone wishing to receive updates can sign up at VINELink.com. Live operators are also available to provide support at 888-868-4631.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Families who opted for remote learning last school year will have to return to in-person classrooms when the next semester begins Aug.17. The Austin school district announced Friday that it plans to return all students to campus and will not offer a remote learning option for the 2021-22 school year. Austin joins the Round Rock, Lake Travis, Leander, Eanes and Hays school districts in announcing the return to on-campus-only learning. The Austin district cited low COVID-19 case numbers as well as the Legislature’s failure to pass a bill that would have authorized local public schools to count students in remote learning programs as part of their enrollment. School districts are funded based on their daily enrollment numbers. The bill became a casualty of House Democrats’ walkout to kill a Republican voting bill ahead of a midnight deadline last month. Austin and 29 other school districts around the state sent a letter to Gov. Greg Abbott on Wednesday asking him to take up this legislation in the special session he has promised to call this summer to focus on overhauling the state’s voting laws.\n\nUtah\n\nProvo: A local public health expert says an increase in opioid abuse amid the coronavirus pandemic was recorded throughout the state. Gabriela Murza, who leads Utah State University Extension’s HEART initiative in Utah County, presented data to the Utah County Commission during a work session last week while discussing the state-funded program, which “brings academic resources into the community, partnering locally and nationally to address the opioid epidemic and other pressing public health issues,” the Daily Herald reports. According to Murza, the program operates in nine counties, including Utah County, “where opioid use disorder has had some of the most devastating effects as far as overdose and deaths related to opioid use.” Other counties served by the program include Salt Lake, Davis, Tooele and Box Elder. Murza told the commissioners that the rate of opioid use disorder has “leveled off” in recent years, and “the trend seems to be getting a little bit better in Utah.” But “then 2020 hit, and everywhere the numbers went up, they did increase as far as deaths due to opioids,” the public health professor said.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: An innovative health care program set up to keep patients healthier while reducing costs missed its financial target between 2017 and 2019, a new report by the Vermont state auditor has found. The report released Monday by State Auditor Douglas Hoffer said that OneCare Vermont, the organization set up to run the program, missed its Medicaid financial targets over the three years by $11.1 million. And the state paid $14.5 million for OneCare’s operating costs to reach a total of $25.6 million total. Hoffer said the financial costs to run the program exceeded any Medicaid savings attributed to it. The goal of what’s known as the all-payer model is to keep patients healthier while reducing health care costs by paying a set amount of money for each covered patient rather than paying for each service provided. “I anticipate the people implementing the All-Payer Model will say the scale and complexity of the reform initiative merit patience before reaching conclusions, and that is reasonable … to a point,” Hoffer said in a statement. OneCare CEO Vicki Loner said she disagreed with the conclusions of Hoffer’s report, and the organization is proud of the work it is doing “tackling one of the most pressing issues of our time.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The state’s “dangerously” full mental hospitals are overwhelmed amid staffing shortages, a situation that has long plagued the hospitals and only worsened during the pandemic, according to state officials. But The Washington Post reports lawmakers and policy experts hope pandemic relief funds can help bring about systematic changes that free inpatient beds and develop community services to keep people out of hospitals in the first place. When the General Assembly reconvenes in August, it will decide how to spend about $4 billion Virginia is getting from a pandemic relief package earlier this year. A joint subcommittee studying mental health services is preparing recommendations for how to use the funds in time for the session. “We have the opportunity with these funds to really do something transformational. That is what we are asking for,” Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services Commissioner Alison Land said in a presentation to the subcommittee this month. The state’s nine inpatient psychiatric hospitals, which have a total of 2,124 beds, are operating at an average 98% capacity, she said. And efforts to contain the coronavirus have had unintended consequences.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: A federal judge has issued a summary judgment in favor of the state against two gold mining companies over years of water pollution stemming from the Buckhorn Mountain gold mine in Okanogan County. U.S. District Court Judge Rosanna Malouf Peterson on Thursday dismissed the companies’ main defenses, writing there was no support for their claims that the state attorney general cannot enforce all of the mine’s Clean Water Act permit. The lawsuit filed by Attorney General Bob Ferguson contended that Crown Resources and Kinross Gold violated the law by discharging illegal levels of pollutants into creeks in Okanogan County flowing into the Kettle River. Now the focus shifts to how much the companies will owe for the violations. They potentially face millions of dollars in penalties for their pollution, and the judge will decide how much. “Crown and Kinross knew even before the mine’s construction that it could release significant contamination, including arsenic and chloride, into surrounding waters, yet plowed ahead anyway,” Ferguson said. “Washington takes our water quality seriously.” Crown Resources and its parent company, Kinross Gold, extracted approximately $1.3 billion in gold from the mine from 2008 to 2017.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A new campaign is encouraging residents to support small businesses as the economy continues to reopen. The West Virginia Small Business Development Center launched its “Come In, We’re Open” campaign Sunday. It’s an invitation to people to visit local businesses in their communities, center Director Debra Martin told The Exponent Telegram. “Throughout the pandemic, small-business owners have adapted and persevered and continue to be the backbone of our economy. As West Virginia reopens, it’s critical that small businesses receive enough support to survive long term,” she said. Business owners around the state can get involved by displaying a “Come In, We’re Open” sign and posting to social media with “#WeAreOpenWV.” The campaign will last through September, officials said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Superintendents, school board members and other education leaders on Monday demanded that Republican lawmakers devote more state aid to schools. Superintendents and other school officials have been criticizing the amount of state aid for education that the Legislature’s Republican-controlled finance committee inserted in the state budget proposal last week. The full Legislature is expected to pass the budget, which would run from this July through mid-2023, as soon as next week. School leaders predicted that without more state funding, they might have to hold staff salaries flat or cut liberal arts classes. “All students and staff across our state deserve better than zero,” Verona Area School District Superintendent Tremayne Clardy said outside the state Capitol. “This budget simply does not meet the needs of students and families across the state.” Democratic Gov. Tony Evers proposed giving K-12 schools $1.6 billion over the next two years. Republicans on the Legislature’s budget committee scrapped that plan and instead allocated $128 million – about $400 million less than they needed to allocate to ensure the state’s schools would get about $2.3 billion in federal pandemic relief.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: With 80% of adults over 18 fully vaccinated in Teton County, health officials are launching an innovative effort to further increase the community’s protection from COVID-19. “The whole goal is to try to get to the people, to make it easier for people,” Public Health Response Coordinator Rachael Wheeler said. The Health Department’s new “Vaxi Taxi,” a repurposed START bus turned mobile vaccine clinic, aims to increase access to COVID-19 vaccines by reaching outlying populations that are unable to get their shots at the health department in town. “Having a more mobile unit where we can easily set up inside that unit becomes really convenient for us,” Wheeler said. Nurses check in patients under a tent outside the bus and ask patients about any potential COVID-19 symptoms or recent contact with infected individuals. Nurses also patiently describe side effects they might experience after the vaccine, usually a sore arm and mild fever, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reports. Patients then head onto the Vaxi Taxi, where they receive their shots in the seats passengers have generally used for transportation. The Vaxi Taxi sports two tables that can be set up and put away with ease, seats for vaccine recipients, medical forms and equipment for vaccine distribution, and a team of friendly professionals.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/04/26/school-satan-club-plane-swap-fail-amazon-helix-news-around-states/50142737/", "title": "After School Satan Club, plane swap fail: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: The state will remember the Holocaust, the systematic slaughter of Jews and other people by Nazis, with events planned for this week in Montgomery and Birmingham. The Alabama Holocaust Commission is sponsoring an annual gathering of remembrance Tuesday at the Alabama Department of Archives and History in the capital. A child survivor of the Holocaust, Inge Auerbacher, is scheduled to speak, and a state proclamation will be presented. A commemoration will also be held Thursday at Temple Beth-El in Birmingham. The program will feature George Nathan, the son of Alabama Holocaust survivors Henry and Sophie Nathan. The family lived in both Anniston and Birmingham after arriving in the United States. About 6 million people were killed by the Nazis in the early 1940s during World War II. The state Holocaust commission holds events each year to remember the victims.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Legislators are considering a request by Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s administration that the state take over part of a federal environmental permitting program, though some members of the state Senate’s budget-writing committee have expressed concerns with the potential costs. Administration officials have said the idea behind the proposal is to speed the construction of roads, bridges, mines and drilling projects, the Anchorage Daily News reports. While the state would have to follow federal standards, critics of the proposal say the state has traditionally favored development and underfunded oversight capabilities. Industry groups say the current permitting process is too slow. The House included a $4.9 million increase to the budget of the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, which expects to hire 28 new staff members. The funding was part of the House version of the state operating budget, which passed earlier this month; senators currently are working on their version. If the proposed increase is approved, department officials plan a two-year process to take over part of the federal Clean Water Act known as Section 404. Permits issued under that section determine whether a developer can fill wetlands, rivers or other bodies of water during construction.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Aviation history wasn’t made Sunday night, but disaster was avoided, as cousins Luke Aikins and Andy Farrington were unsuccessful in completing the first-ever “plane swap.” One plane spiraled out of control as the two pilots were thousands of feet in the air. Both pilots were safe with no reported injuries. The Red Bull-sponsored flight, which took place at an undisclosed location in Arizona, began as the two pilots ascended to the skies about 5:45 p.m. local time. Nearly an hour later, the two jumped out at 12,100 feet in the air with the airbrake system engaged on both planes. Aikins was able to successfully get into the other plane, but Farrington was unable to do the same. The plane spiraled out of control as Farrington could be heard saying on-air: “Blue plane is out of control.” Farrington then deployed his parachute and safely landed in a remote area. The uncontrolled plane had a parachute on it that automatically activated when it got to a certain altitude, and it was deployed before touching the ground. The condition and location of the plane weren’t immediately known. The 6-mile-per-hour winds created good conditions for the stunt, the pilots said leading up to the stunt, as the area had faster winds in the days leading up to the event. But Farrington was unsure what happened.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Friday said he was refusing most of $146 million in federal pandemic rental assistance the state was to receive, citing the state’s low unemployment rate and economic climate. With Hutchinson’s decision, Arkansas joins Nebraska in turning down the latest round of pandemic rental assistance funds. Hutchinson, a Republican, asked U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen that the state be allowed to use 39% of the funds — about $60 million — for “housing stability” programs offered by nonprofit groups that would include job training, education and treatment as well as some rental assistance. Arkansas still has about $20 million from the first round of rental assistance that was given to states. “Our economy has returned, there’s jobs aplenty out there and we have existing programs in place for rental assistance that were pre-pandemic,” Hutchinson told reporters at a news conference at the Capitol.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Nearly 2,000 homeless people died in Los Angeles County during the first year of the pandemic, an increase of 56% from the previous year, driven mainly by drug overdoses, authorities said. The findings released Friday in a report from the county’s Department of Public Health showed that despite initial fears, the coronavirus itself was not the main culprit in deaths among California’s largest-in-the-nation unhoused population. But it did cut people off from mental health and substance abuse treatment after services were drastically reduced to prevent the spread of the virus. Between April 1, 2020, and March 31, 2021, the county recorded 1,988 deaths of homeless people, up from 1,271 deaths during the same period a year earlier, the report said. During both of those years, drug overdoses were the leading cause of death, but they increased by 78% in the pandemic’s first year. In the pre-pandemic year, the Department of Public Health reported 402 fatal overdoses. In the year after the outbreak, the number nearly doubled to 715, the report said. The report found that 179 homeless people died from COVID-19 during the pandemic’s first year. A San Francisco study released last month showed similar findings: Between March 2020 and March 2021, there were 331 homeless deaths recorded in San Francisco, more than twice the number of any previous year, with the leading cause of death being drug overdose, according to a study conducted by the University of California San Francisco and the city’s Department of Public Health.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: Heading into what experts speculate may be one of the worst summers of wildfire the state has seen, Gov. Jared Polis and state fire officials are preparing for the future. “We are vastly improving our year-round fire response, expanding our arsenal of world-class firefighting tools and continuing to activate every tool we have to help our communities prepare for and respond to the threat of wildfires and climate change,” Polis said in a press release Friday. In the past two years, Colorado has experienced the three largest wildfires in state history – the Cameron Peak Fire, the East Troublesome Fire and the Pine Gulch Fire – and just five months ago it saw the most destructive fire in state history, the Marshall Fire. Just last week brought wildfires in Monte Vista, near Longmont; between Gypsum and Dotsero, in Custer County; and northeast of Las Animas, according to state officials. “Colorado could very well be headed towards the worst wildfire season in the state’s history. We need to take action,” state Senate President Steve Fenberg said. He is supporting legislation that would invest $15 million in first responders and communities to improve the state’s emergency dispatch system and add a second air tanker and two high-quality helicopters. The bill would also create the Office of Climate Preparedness.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew London: The recent appearance of two cruise ships in the city has raised hopes that Connecticut might stand to benefit from the return of an industry decimated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The two ships, part of American Queen Voyages, were on a tour of the East Coast and Canada and were the first cruise ships to stop in New London in four years. Both are scheduled to stop in New London on the way back south in the fall. The ships each brought about 90 passengers and 75 crew members and were met with gift bags, discounts in local restaurants and a driving tour of the city. Connecticut also has deep-water ports in New Haven and Bridgeport that can handle large ships, but the state often isn’t seen as a cruise destination. “It’s encouraging that with the industry just really trying to make a comeback, they picked New London,” Mayor Michael Passero told the New Haven Register. Connecticut ports could benefit from Canada’s reopening its own ports to cruises after two years, as well as from industry trends toward more domestic routes and smaller ships that cater to an older clientele, said Chris Gray Faust, managing editor of consumer review site Cruise Critic. “There has been a pivot toward more domestic cruises,” Gray Faust told the newspaper. “Some of these ports are ones that you don’t think of as cruise ports, necessarily.”\n\nDelaware\n\nNew Castle: The Wall That Heals, a traveling replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, is returning to the First State on Tuesday. The Vietnam War memorial will be escorted by Delaware State Police and veterans on motorcycles to New Castle, where it will be met by students and volunteers at Southern Elementary School about 1:45 p.m. Tuesday and at William Penn High school about 2:30 p.m. The Wall That Heals is a mobile exhibit that features a three-quarter scale replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. The replica, built in 1996, stands 7 feet 6 inches high at its tallest point and 375 feet long. Similar to the original, it is erected in a chevron shape and allows visitors to do name rubbings of individual service members’ names. Visitors can also experience the Wall rising above them as they walk toward the apex, a key feature of the Washington memorial. After arrival at William Penn High School – the first school in the nation to host the wall – the setup will begin Wednesday. The Wall will be open to the public 24 hours a day, starting Friday and ending Sunday at 2 p.m. More than 100 volunteers are needed to guard the wall, help with parking and assist with events in the coming days. An opening ceremony begins at 9 a.m. Thursday with a Prisoner of War keynote speaker. A candlelight vigil will be held at 8 p.m. Saturday to read the names of Hometown Heroes from the exhibit with a procession along the wall and a 21-gun salute.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Jon Stewart, accepting the Kennedy Center’s Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, warned Sunday night that speculation about the future of comedy amid increased audience cultural sensitivity was ignoring a true and enduring threat: authoritarian governments around the world. “Comedy doesn’t change the world, but it’s a bellwether,” Stewart said. “When a society feels under threat, comedians are who gets sent away first.” Stewart pointed in the audience to Egyptian comedian Bassem Youssef, whose Stewart-inspired political comedy show earned him both fame and self-imposed exile. Youssef’s story is “an example of the true threat to comedy,” Stewart said. The intersection of comedy and politics was the main theme as celebrities and comedy royalty gathered to honor Stewart, who set the modern template for mixing the topics during his 16-year run hosting TV’s “The Daily Show.” Stewart, the 23rd recipient of the prize, was honored in testimonials from fellow comedians and previous Mark Twain Prize recipients. And his political influence was apparent Sunday from a guest list that included House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and White House press secretary Jen Psaki. This was the first Mark Twain ceremony since Dave Chappelle’s in 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic scuttled the event in 2020 and 2021.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: The judge overseeing jury selection for a man who murdered 17 people at a high school declared Monday that the process will start over, conceding she should have questioned 11 potential jurors who said they would not follow the law before she dismissed them. In granting the motion filed by Nikolas Cruz’s prosecutors over the strong objection of his attorneys, Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer nullified two weeks of work by prosecution and defense lawyers, forcing them to begin the entire process anew Monday. As a result, almost 250 potential jurors who had said they could sit for a four-month trial will not be called back next month for further questioning. More than 1,200 candidates had been screened. Prosecutor Carolyn McCann made her argument after miscommunication caused 11 jurors who were improperly dismissed by Scherer two weeks ago not to be told to return to court Monday as had been planned for further questioning. Scherer said they would be brought in next week, but McCann argued that more time would be wasted if it turned out the potential jurors had to be struck anyway. She said the prosecution has just as much right to question potential jurors and to an untainted final panel as the defense. “This is not harmless error,” McCann said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Officials have put the brakes on the city’s largest road race. The Rock ’n’ Roll Marathon has brought tens of thousands of runners to Georgia’s picturesque founding city since first adding Savannah to its race roster in 2011. But Mayor Van Johnson said the city won’t be granting marathon organizers a permit or paying the $25,000 contract fee this year. Organizers released a statement saying a comeback in 2023 appears unlikely. They had intended to return to Savannah this fall, and runners had been registering for the race before City Hall announced its decision. Johnson told news outlets Savannah needs a break from the marathon to evaluate whether it’s worth the cost – not just in taxpayer money for sanitation and extra police but also in hassles to residents and businesses affected by street closures. He said the city has recouped “a relatively very small percentage” of what it has spent on the event. Visit Savannah, the city’s tourism bureau, reported the 2019 marathon had an economic impact of $23 million. Michael Owens, president of Savannah’s Tourism Leadership Council, said the race gave the city’s hospitality industry a needed shot in the arm during what’s otherwise a slow period for tourists right before the holidays. “To be honest with you, it’s devastating,” Owens told WTOC-TV. “I’ve gotten more phone calls about this than anything. I’ve gotten more calls about the cancellation of Rock ’n’ Roll than I did in the beginning of the pandemic.”\n\nHawaii\n\nWahiawa: The only skilled nursing and rehabilitation facility in central Oahu expects to close this summer. Wahiawa General Hospital said it plans to close its long-term nursing center July 22, citing insufficient insurance reimbursements and continued financial challenges, Hawaii News Now reports. It’s also been struggling to hire and retain staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. Wahiawa General, a small independent hospital, had received millions in taxpayers dollars to keep it afloat in the past, but it is still losing over a million dollars a year. It also doesn’t have the money to improve existing facilities, such as the long-term nursing center, which was built in 1966. Hospital administrators said many of the patients in Wahiawa are covered by the Supplemental Security Income program or Medicaid, which have low reimbursement rates. The long-term care center has 115 beds, according to its website. It currently has 60 patients. John McDermott, the state’s long-term care ombudsman, said Hawaii can’t afford to lose nursing homes, especially when the state’s senior population is increasing so rapidly. The nearest alternatives for skilled nursing and rehabilitation are in Kaneohe and Pearl City. Wahiawa General is giving 90 days’ notice and helping to relocate patients.\n\nIdaho\n\nLewiston: Jurors convicted a 17-year-old boy of first-degree murder after about three hours of deliberation Thursday. Demetri Ewing and his father Clyde Ewing were both charged with first-degree murder in connection with the Jan. 8, 2021, shooting death of Samuel Johns, The Lewiston Tribune reports. Clyde Ewing has pleaded not guilty, and his trial is scheduled to begin May 16. Ewing, who was 16 at the time of the shooting, was charged as an adult and could face up to life in prison when he is sentenced in June. During Demetri Ewing’s nearly two-week trial, Nez Perce County prosecutors said the father and son were in the midst of a family dispute over a missing gun and an Army bag that had belonged to Clyde Ewing’s late father. Prosecutors said the pair believed the bag had been left at Johns’ home, so they left their motel in Clarkston, Washington, and rode bicycles to Johns’ residence in the neighboring town of Lewiston, Idaho. Nez Perce County Prosecutor Justin Coleman said the Ewings used zipper-style cable ties to bind the hands of a woman in the home, and that one of them shot and killed Johns. Under Idaho law, prosecutors are not required to prove which defendant killed someone, only that a person was killed in the process of another planned felony like a burglary.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A man seen on video wheeling a bulky suitcase out of a woman’s apartment has been acquitted of murder. Cook County Judge Diana Kenworthy noted a lack of evidence against Jimmy Jackson, 75, and said the video was not enough to convict him. Daisy Hayes, 65, disappeared in 2018. Family members were stunned by the verdict Friday. “All I could do is scream and just run out the courtroom – like, what didn’t you see?” daughter Teresa Smith said of the video. Jackson, 75, and Hayes, 65, had an intermittent relationship. “You see him struggling with this suitcase. You see him actually put the suitcase in the dumpster. You actually see him take garbage from other dumpsters to put on top of her so it can be concealed,” Smith said. Jackson was arrested in Tennessee after Daisy disappeared.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Local native and 12-time Grammy-winning singer and producer Babyface will headline the Madam Walker Legacy Center on June 17 as part of a weekend­long Juneteenth celebration at the historic theater. Tours of the newly remodeled center, a family-friendly outdoor block party and other musical performances will be spread throughout Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Babyface, whose given name is Kenneth Edmonds, will also be inducted into the Madam Walker Legacy Center Walk of Fame. His credits include some 250 top-10 R&B and pop hits, working with the likes of Beyoncé, Aretha Franklin and Whitney Houston. He last performed in Indianapolis on the free stage of the Indiana State Fair in August.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The local school district plans to hold a series of discussions to address school violence following a shooting outside East High School last month. The five public meetings will give the school community a chance to talk about concerns related to violence in schools and communities and how to begin healing from the shooting death of Jose Lopez-Perez, 15. While Des Moines Public Schools is hosting the events, outside community groups will guide the conversations. Lopez-Perez was shot and killed outside the school March 7. Also injured were East High School students Kemery Ortega, 18, and Jessica Lopez, 16. Ten teenagers have been charged with Lopez-Perez’s death and the shooting. The meetings’ topics will be guided using information gleaned from earlier conversations with student following the shooting. East High School students focused their discussion on student health and well-being, school climate, culture, and safety, said Madeline Cano, the East community school coordinator. Students also said they wanted to see the school “bounce back from COVID.” The community school coordinators help support students and families within Des Moines schools and the community.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: A Wyandotte County judge struck down a GOP-authored congressional map enacted earlier this year and ordered the Legislature to take steps to address what he considered to be gerrymandered district lines. It is the first time a state-level judge has waded into redistricting for the U.S. House, though the ruling is all but certain to be appealed, setting up a showdown at the Kansas Supreme Court. Wyandotte County District Court Judge Bill Klapper called the maps passed over the veto of Gov. Laura Kelly earlier this year “motivated at least in part by an intent to dilute minority voting strength” and said state courts had the right to take up redistricting cases. Three lawsuits were filed challenging the map, arguing the new district lines illicitly divide the Kansas City area and improperly place Lawrence in the sweeping 1st Congressional District dominated by western Kansas. Supporters say the decision to divide Wyandotte and Johnson counties, as well as splitting Kansas City between the 3rd and 2nd districts, was born out of simple math, with population growing in the region. But critics argue the endeavor amounted to nothing more than racial and political gerrymandering, something cited by Klapper in his 200-plus-page opinion that quoted everything from the French philosopher Montesquieu to folk music.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: An arson unit is investigating after a fire destroyed a synagogue and worship center on the final day of Passover. Rabbi Avrohom Litvin, regional director of Chabad of Kentucky, said the blaze started as a grease fire in a building adjoining Louisville’s Chabad House early Saturday, WDRB-TV reports. Firefighters brought it under control, but it apparently rekindled around noon, and the Chabad House caught fire. Litvin said the Chabad House was quickly engulfed in flames, and the roof collapsed. No one was injured, but the sanctuary and nearly everything in it was destroyed, Litvin said. Only the Torah scrolls were rescued, having been removed that morning for an off-site remembrance service due to electricity being cut off at the synagogue. Litvin said it was a “miracle” the 75 congregants – including 25 children – were not in the synagogue at the time of the larger fire and in harm’s way. “There’s a story of a man who was on his way to a big vacation, and he breaks his leg, and he feels so bad that God let his leg be broken just before his vacation,” he said. “And then he reads that the plane went down, and he says, ‘God saved my life by breaking my leg.’ “So I absolutely see the hand of God here. ... Yes, this leg got broken; the core of the building is gone. But we can rebuild the building.” Litvin said officials told him they have not uncovered any evidence of arson, though their investigation is ongoing, including determining if the second fire was a reignition of the first.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A small, historically Black university known for its success in getting graduates into medical school announced Thursday that it is now planning its own medical school. The coronavirus pandemic emphasized the need for greater diversity in medicine because representation and trust are part of the reasons for health disparities affecting underrepresented populations, said Reynold Verret, president of Xavier University of Louisiana. “Xavier was founded with the mission of promoting the creation of a just and humane society through education,” he said in a news release announcing plans for a medical school and graduate school of health sciences in New Orleans. “The establishment of graduate education programs dedicated to the preparation of more black healthcare professionals is a natural extension of our foundress’ legacy as we approach our second century of service. It is also where we are called to answer a critical need of our nation.” For decades, the Catholic school founded in 1925 has graduated more African American students and students of color who go on to get medical degrees and health doctorates than any other higher education institution in the U.S., the news release said.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Democratic Gov. Janet Mills asked tribal chiefs and legislative leaders in a letter made public Monday to drop their effort to amend a 1980 land settlement deal that gave the state of Maine some governmental power over tribes. Mills said the proposal to expand tribal sovereignty could be a setback in tribal relations with her administration, instead of building on recent successes. “I do not wish to have a confrontation,” she wrote in the letter. “It would serve no constructive purpose and only inflame emotions on all sides of the discussion.” The letter was written Thursday night, the day before the bill failed to advance in the appropriations committee. Maggie Dana, chief of the Passamaquoddy Tribe at Pleasant Point, said previously she hoped the governor would be “on the right side of history” and agree to the long-sought changes. For the tribes, it has been a long, frustrating battle since they traded some rights to the state under the $81.5 million Maine Indian Land Claims Settlement Act of 1980, signed by President Jimmy Carter. Because of the settlement, tribes in Maine have less autonomy than tribes elsewhere across the country, and their reservations are treated like municipalities, subject to state law. Critics of extending tribal sovereignty feared there could be unintended consequences and further litigation if that changed.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: A potentially lucrative revenue stream for struggling commercial fishermen and women could become a reality as the state begins to research a shrimp fishery in Maryland’s warming waters. The bill, introduced by state Sen. Mary Beth Carozza, R-Worcester, would allow the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to establish a shrimp fishery pilot program for certain commercial licenses. “As a lifelong commercial fisherman, I have seen changes to our environment, our fisheries and our livelihood,” said Sonny Gwin, a fisherman based in Ocean City. “An abundant amount of shrimp has been seen in Maryland waters, both in the Atlantic Ocean and its tributaries. We would like to have the opportunity to participate.” Gwin said the first step in diversifying the industry on the Delmarva Peninsula is understanding the impact it could have. Warming waters in the Atlantic Ocean are among the reasons much of the seafood caught off Maryland’s coast is becoming more diverse. White shrimp, which typically thrive in the Gulf of Mexico and south Atlantic Ocean, used to only venture as far north as North Carolina in any significant numbers. But as water temperatures rise off the coast of Maryland, shrimp have moved farther north.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nNantucket: Scientists at MIT are proposing releasing hordes of genetically altered mice on the posh vacation destination of Nantucket to combat the growing scourge of Lyme disease. Researchers with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab’s Mice Against Ticks project explained their plan to residents of the island off Cape Cod at a recent meeting, The Boston Globe reports. The scientists said hundreds of thousands of native white-footed mice engineered to resist the bacteria that causes Lyme could help slow disease transmission. They say if Lyme were less prevalent among mice, then fewer ticks would contract the disease, leading to less cases among humans. The proposal would require review from regulators, not to mention local support, but Joanna Buchthal, the project’s research director, argues the idea offers a “real, if revolutionary, way” to address the disease. “With so many people suffering from Lyme every single day, which is an awful disease, we need a solution urgently,” she told the newspaper. Nantucket is one of Massachusetts’ hot spots for Lyme disease, which is now the most common infectious disease on the island, the Globe reports. Incidents of Lyme disease have nearly doubled nationwide since 1991, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nMichigan\n\nTaylor: A person taking part in a suburban Detroit police training program suffered a gunshot wound and was hospitalized, Michigan State Police said. The shooting happened Sunday afternoon during the exercise at a Taylor city park for the city’s volunteer auxiliary police program. The civilian was a “role player” in a training scenario when an auxiliary officer in the training fired a shot from his service revolver, hitting the person in the abdomen, state police said. The person was taken to a hospital in stable condition. State police investigators were reviewing the shooting at the request of Taylor police. The volunteers with Taylor’s auxiliary police assist the city police force during emergencies and help with other duties such as home and business checks and anti-crime programs, according to the city website.\n\nMinnesota\n\nCrookston: Volunteers and National Guard members in northwestern Minnesota spent two days sandbagging to fortify the city from an expected record flood along the Red Lake River. Gov. Tim Walz authorized 100 members of the Guard to assist with the flood fight after heavy rains forced the the tributary of the Red River to spill its banks. At least 50 Guard members were on hand over the weekend to aid efforts through Sunday. The National Weather Service has been predicting the Red Lake River to near 29 feet Monday or Tuesday. The record high water mark was 28.4 feet in 1997. No injuries or damages have been reported, and the city has not asked anyone to evacuate, Crookston Police Chief Darin Selzler said. Officials were switching from a sandbagging to monitoring stage late Sunday, the Crookston Times reports. Several counties in the northwestern Minnesota region have declared local emergencies and activated their emergency plans, according to Walz’s office. Many county roads were covered with water or washed out, and officials warned motorists about attempting to drive through flooded areas. The Red Lake River flows into the Red River at East Grand Forks and Grand Forks, North Dakota, where officials from both cities have started to activate permanent flood protection measures.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state is enacting a new law that says state and local government agencies cannot withhold services or refuse jobs to people who choose not to get vaccinated against COVID-19. The ban applies to state agencies, city and county governments and schools, community colleges and universities. COVID-19 vaccination mandates have not been widespread in Mississippi, but some lawmakers said they were acting against the possibility of government overreach. Republican Gov. Tate Reeves said Friday that he had signed House Bill 1509, and it became law immediately. “Government shouldn’t be in the business of forcing Americans to choose between the COVID-19 vaccine & putting food on their tables, sending their kids to school, or visiting a small business,” Reeves said on Twitter. The law specifies that COVID-19 vaccinations cannot be required for children to attend school or day care. It does not change Mississippi’s other childhood vaccination requirements, which are some of most stringent in the nation. The law also says anyone in Mississippi can cite “a sincerely held religious objection” to avoid a public or private employer’s COVID-19 vaccination mandate.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A bill approved by the state Senate would impose limits on Missouri’s public records law to exclude certain types of documents and communications and no longer classify some meetings of elected officials as “public.” Senate Bill 741 was initially designed to limit personal information of constituents from being public in records requested by members of the public but was amended Thursday by Sen. Andrew Koenig, R-St. Louis, to include a litany of other adjustments to the Missouri Sunshine Law. The law allows for members of the public, press and other organizations to request and acquire government documents. Under the bill, documents and communications “that do not have substantial administrative or operational value” would not be considered public records and could thus be made unobtainable through a request. “A lot of times when you’re working on a bill, you’re going to go through many drafts, and you want to be able to think out loud with your staff a little bit, and it might not even be a good idea,” Koenig said. “When it’s not a working document, I think it’s appropriate for that to not necessarily be public.” The legislation allows the state to close any document kept by lawmakers and staff “that contains information regarding proposed legislation or the legislative process.”\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A judge has temporarily blocked enforcement of a state law that required transgender people to have undergone a “surgical procedure” before being allowed to change the sex listed on their birth certificates. District Judge Michael Moses of Billings ruled Thursday that the law is unconstitutionally vague because it does not specify what surgical procedure must be performed. The law also required transgender people to obtain a court order indicating they’d had a surgical procedure. Because he could grant the temporary injunction based on the vagueness issue, Moses said he did not further analyze the constitutionality of the law. “We are thrilled that the court recognized the substantial and unnecessary burdens this law places upon transgender individuals in violation of their constitutional rights,” said Akilah Lane, staff attorney at the ACLU of Montana, which challenged the law. The plaintiffs – Amelia Marquez, of Billings, and a transgender man who is not identified in court records – wanted to change the sex on their birth certificates without undergoing costly surgical procedures. Both argue having a birth certificate that does not match their gender identity puts them at risk of embarrassment, discrimination, harassment or violence if they are asked to provide their birth certificate.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Google says it will invest more than $750 million in the state in 2022, including construction of a data center in Omaha. The Omaha World-Herald reports the investment also includes an expansion of Google’s existing data center in Papillion. Company leaders did not provide specific financial details for that or any of the other projects during an event with elected leaders in Papillion. The new northwest Omaha data center will be the third Google data center to open in the region. Along with the facility in Papillion, Google has one in Council Bluffs. The Nebraska projects are part of Google’s investment of about $9.5 billion in offices and data centers across the U.S. A company official said Google didn’t have any job figures for the Omaha area.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: An electric scooter sharing program years in the making has finally launched. The City Council approved an exclusive three-year franchising deal with Bird, a company that partners with cities to provide e-scooters and e-bikes. On Thursday, city officials and Bird representatives met for a ribbon-cutting ceremony to mark the official start of the program, which aims to bolster “micromobility” transport options downtown and in Midtown. Bird’s e-scooter fleet will deploy in phases over the next eight weeks, with the full fleet reaching approximately 1,000 scooters, a schedule released by City Council shows. The program operates at no cost to the city, which will receive a cut of every scooter ride around town. Riders will pay $1 to start the vehicle and 39 cents a minute thereafter, with Reno receiving 25 cents per ride and $20 per scooter in registration fees, though certain riders can get a 50% discount. The Bird deal has been years in the making as the city opted for a cautious approach to reimplementing an electric vehicle sharing program after its first partner, Lime, saw its electric bikes vandalized at the rate of nine per week in 2018.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state Senate has killed a proposed expansion of New Hampshire’s education tax credit program, arguing it would diminish the benefits for current beneficiaries. House Bill 1298 would have raised the upper income limit for the state’s tax credit scholarship program from 300% of the federal poverty level to 500%. Created in 2013, the program provides scholarships for students by allowing businesses to donate to the scholarship fund that administers the program and receive a credit on their business taxes. The scholarships may be used for private school tuition. Advocates for the bill had argued that the expansion would allow the program to boost families in the middle class. Currently, the program can benefit any family of four making up to $83,250 per year; expanding it would allow a family of four making up to $138,750 to access the funds. But a bipartisan group of state senators said the expansion would only mean more students would be competing for the same pool of funds donated by businesses. “The (Senate education) committee heard concerns about the neediest of students receiving less funding from this tax credit program as this bill would open the pool to a larger population of students,” said Sen. Denise Ricciardi, R-Bedford Republican.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nOcean City: The developers of a wind energy farm off the southern New Jersey coast said Monday they have hired two companies to connect the project to the electrical grid on land. Ocean Wind 1 has signed contracts with companies that will build electrical substations on land and run power lines from the offshore wind farm to the onshore connection points. Ocean Wind 1 – a joint venture between Orsted, the Danish wind power company, and Newark-based PSEG – hired JINGOLI Power LLC and Burns & McDonnell Engineering Company Inc. The moves come as New Jersey is working aggressively to become the East Coast hub of the fast-growing offshore wind energy industry. In February, six companies bid a combined $4.37 billion for the right to build wind energy projects on the ocean floor off New Jersey and New York in the U.S. government’s largest such auction in history. Before that happened, New Jersey’s Board of Public Utilities approved three offshore wind energy projects: two by Orsted and one by Atlantic Shores. Those three projects combined aim to provide enough electricity to power more than 1.6 million homes. The Ocean Wind 1 project is among those three and could provide enough power for 500,000 homes.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nCarlsbad: State environmental regulators are reviewing plans submitted by Mosaic Potash to investigate and define the extent of groundwater contamination from discharges associated with potash mining along the Pecos River in southern New Mexico. The state Environment Department announced earlier this month that contamination had been detected in nearby groundwater monitoring wells between the company’s Laguna Grande lake and the river. As a result, the company was required to submit a plan for monitoring and dealing with the pollution. Potash mining is a main economic driver in Eddy County. A salt rich in potassium, potash is used mostly as a plant fertilizer and in animal feed. Carlsbad was the site of potash’s first discovery in North America in 1925 during oil drilling. The discovery led to a boom in development in the former ranching town that predated the area’s prominence in fossil fuels. Mosaic’s mine, about 16 miles east of Carlsbad, produces the ore both through its underground mining and via surface operations. Waste resulting from mining the ore is moved around the facility into multiple disposal areas, potentially leeching into groundwater supplies. Extracting potash from underground generates tailings that are disposed of along with salty brine water.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Several dozen teachers and other school employees in the city who officials said submitted fraudulent proof of COVID-19 vaccination were placed on leave as of Monday. The United Federation of Teachers is challenging the disciplinary action, which it says violates its collective bargaining agreement. The employees in question were placed on leave after investigators determined they had provided false vaccine cards, a spokesperson for the city Department of Education said. “Fraudulent vaccination cards are not only illegal, they also undermine the best line of protection our schools have against COVID-19 – universal adult vaccination,” the spokesperson, Nathaniel Styer, said in a statement. “We immediately moved to put these employees – fewer than 100 – on leave without pay.” A COVID-19 vaccination mandate took effect for New York City school employees last fall and was later expanded to include all city employees. The school vaccination rule was a key component of the city’s policy of opening all classrooms to in-person learning this academic year, rather than offering a remote option as some school districts did. The UFT said in a notice of claim that about 82 members were notified last week they were being placed on unpaid leave because they’d provided false proof of vaccination.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Leslie McCrae Dowless Jr., the key player in an absentee ballot fraud probe that led to a do-over congressional election, has died. His daughter, Andrea Dowless Heverly, wrote that her father “passed away peacefully” Sunday morning, according to a social media post. He had been diagnosed with an advanced form of lung cancer and died at his daughter’s home in Bladen County, his friend Jay DeLancy said. Dowless was in his mid-60s. The political operative was set to go on trial this summer on more than a dozen state criminal counts related to absentee ballot activities for the 2016 general election and the 2018 primary and general elections. A half-dozen others were also charged. Witnesses told state officials that Dowless, with help of his assistants, gathered hundreds of absentee ballots from Bladen County in 2018. Those workers testified they were directed to collect blank or incomplete ballots, forge signatures on them and even fill in votes for local candidates. The 2018 general election results for the 9th Congressional District were ultimately thrown out, and a new vote for the seat was ordered by the State Board of Elections, following an inquiry. Dowless was working in the 2018 congressional race for then-Republican candidate Mark Harris. No charges were filed against Harris.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Secretary of State Al Jaeger has approved the formatting of a petition for a proposed ballot measure to legalize recreational marijuana in the state. The sponsoring committee behind the petition must obtain 15,582 valid signatures by July 11 for the measure to be placed on November’s ballot. That figure amounts to 2% of North Dakota’s population. If supporters miss that deadline but obtain the signatures by April 21, 2023, the measure could be placed on the June 2024 ballot or come to a vote if a special election occurs before then. The proposed measure seeks to allow people age 21 or older to purchase and use marijuana under certain conditions, the Bismarck Tribune reports. It also sets up the framework for the sale of marijuana within North Dakota, a process that would be implemented by the state Department of Health and Human Services or another entity as determined by the Legislature. The department could register up to seven marijuana manufacturing businesses and 18 dispensaries. Similar petition drives have failed twice in recent years to gather enough signatures to place a measure on the ballot.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: State regulation of streams that flow temporarily after rainfall will be restricted under legislation signed into law by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine. Construction companies, the mining industry and other business groups say removing so-called ephemeral streams from regulation would make Ohio’s practice consistent with federal law. The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency created a permitting system for development projects affecting ephemeral streams after the government removed them from federal oversight in 2020 and left their regulation up to states. The EPA says about 36,500 miles of the state’s 115,200 miles of primary headwater streams are ephemeral streams. DeWine signed the bill last week, saying it strikes a balance between protecting state waterways and providing consistency in state regulations to support economic development. Environmental groups largely opposed the legislation, saying the streams play an important role in maintaining water quality. They also questioned why Ohio would remove the streams from regulation at the same time it’s spending millions to improve water quality under DeWine’s H2Ohio initiative.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: After calling for the disestablishment of a tribal reservation in eastern Oklahoma and criticizing the lingering impacts of the U.S. Supreme Court’s McGirt decision, a candidate for the 2nd Congressional District is receiving pushback from tribal leaders. John Bennett, 47, who is stepping away from his post as chairman of Oklahoma’s Republican Party to seek a seat in Congress, said he believes the court’s ruling continues to be an issue for law enforcement and needs to be reversed. “Congress needs to go back, and they need to de-establish the Muscogee (Creek) Nation reservation. I say once they do that, then they can carry on as they have, you know, all of these years,” Bennett told the Washington Examiner last week. “So when I get to Congress, this will be one of my priorities because it hurts everyone in my district, tribal and nontribal.” The Inter-Tribal Council of the Five Tribes, which includes the Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Seminole and Muscogee Nations, said the anti-tribal rhetoric should not be welcome in Washington. In a statement signed by each of the tribes’ leaders, the group condemned Bennett’s comments for ignoring ongoing efforts to expand criminal justice systems alongside state and federal partners. They also said the call for a McGirt reversal is an attack on tribal sovereignty.\n\nOregon\n\nClatskanie: An investigator has determined that Clatskanie High School girls basketball players in northwest Oregon “more likely than not” used racist language against members of the De La Salle team during a December game. As a result, Clastkanie has been placed on probation by the Oregon School Activities Association until mid-February 2023, The Daily News reports. The association said the high school team’s players and coaches must engage with a guest speaker about equity and inclusion before next season, among other measures, and all Clatskanie student athletes and coaches must complete racial equity training and implicit bias training. A press release from Clatskanie High School athletic director and dean of students Ryan Tompkins on Wednesday confirmed the findings of the report more than two months after it was completed. Tompkins said the high school is prepared to meet the probation requirements. De La Salle North High School President Oscar Leong said he believes the drawn-out process of the investigation has resulted in positive change for student-athletes across Oregon. Additionally, the investigation found that Clatskanie school staff and referees assigned by the Lower Columbia Officials Association failed to address concerns about racially charged language after they were brought up during the game.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nDillsburg: A school board has denied a resident’s request form an After School Satan Club at Northern Elementary School. Hundreds from the community filled the auditorium for the Northern York County School District board meeting last week and erupted into applause when the votes were taken on the issue. Only board member Thomas Welch voted in favor of the club. The evening had more than two hours of citizen comments, with the majority opposed to the adoption of the club. Many comments focused on the age of the children the club would target, the cultural and biblical issues, and the content on the Satanic Temple’s website for the program. Many of the residents spent the evening rallying the crowd and quoting Christian scripture, saying regardless of any laws that allow freedom of speech, proposing the club is morally wrong. One said the introduction of the club would contribute to a social decline in school. “So nobody benefits from having an After School Satan Club, whether it be those who are against them or those who are in favor of them, because Satan always does harm all the time. That, philosophically, has been proven,” a resident asserted. There were some voices in support, saying that they understood the concerns but that the formation of the club was a constitutional right.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The U.S. Supreme Court will not take up a conservative advocacy group’s challenge to the state’s campaign finance laws. The Gaspee Project and national conservative legal groups appealed to the high court after two lower federal courts ruled against their 2019 lawsuit arguing Rhode Island’s campaign finance disclosure laws are unconstitutional. The Supreme Court denied Gaspee’s appeal petition Monday, according to Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha and the Campaign Legal Center, which defended the state’s campaign finance laws in the case. “To reduce political corruption, we need real transparency about who is spending big money in elections and to that end, voters in Rhode Island have a right to know who is attempting to influence their votes,” Campaign Legal Center Senior Vice President Paul Smith said in a news release. “This denial of review from the Supreme Court of the United States means that vital right will remain in place and continue to enable Rhode Islanders to be well-informed before heading into the voting booth.” The 2019 lawsuit from Gaspee and the Illinois Opportunity Project sought to strike down Rhode Island’s disclosure laws around “independent expenditures,” spending to influence an election that is not coordinated with any campaign.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nYork: A county is suing two cities inside its border, saying they are refusing to keep up with a deal to pay $73 per day to house jail inmates from the cities. York County said it will continue to take inmates from Rock Hill and Tega Cay until the court rules, The Herald of Rock Hill reports. Rock Hill officials said they don’t mind paying a fair fee, but York County has failed to give a detailed assessment of how it came up with a $73-a-day cost per inmate. The county originally wanted to charge $100 but lowered the assessment after Rock Hill asked for details, the city said in a statement. Documents obtained by the newspaper showed the cities were paying about $43 a day per inmate before the fees were increased. York County said other cities in the county like Fort Mill, Clover and the city of York have signed an agreement to pay the $73 fee. York County is asking a judge to decide if the county, which is legally required to have a jail, has to take inmates from cities without a written agreement on fees. Rock Hill officials said their residents and businesses pay York County $7.9 million in property taxes that help run the jail and the sheriff’s office.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Despite an annual $15 million given to the Bridge Improvement Grant program and other additional funding focused on bridges, the state continues to tread water when it comes to how quickly work is done, leaving hundreds of bridges requiring “high priority” corrective repairs and dozens closed. An analysis of data through the Federal Highway Administration’s National Bridge Inspection program focused on the vast amount of data that FHA collects on the nation’s bridges, looking at data from 2015 and the most recent data from 2021. To some, the bridge program, as well as other aspects of the 2015 transportation package, haven’t panned out the way they were supposed to. “I know I’m sounding a little bit negative about it, but I feel like we got duped a little bit,” Brown County Highway Superintendent Dirk Rogers said. The BIG program was created as a collaboration between the state and local governments. To be eligible to participate, counties had to enact local wheel taxes on vehicles so they had a source of local funds in the program. Since 2015, 37 counties have added a wheel tax, according to the South Dakota Department of Revenue, and only six counties in the state don’t have a wheel tax.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state will soon add harsh penalties against public schools that allow transgender athletes to participate in girls’ sports, under legislation signed into law by Republican Gov. Bill Lee. Lee quietly signed the proposal last Friday without comment. The governor had previously signed a measure last year mandating that student-athletes must prove their sex matches that listed on the student’s “original” birth certificate. If a birth certificate is unavailable, then the parents must provide another form of evidence “indicating the student’s sex at the time of birth.” This year, the GOP-controlled Legislature decided to add penalties to that ban, which is in effect even as a lawsuit challenging its constitutionality makes it way through court. A trial has been tentatively set for March 2023. According to the bill, Tennessee’s Department of Education would withhold a portion of state funds from local school districts that fail to determine a student’s gender for participation in middle or high school sports. The measure does not specify exactly how much money should be withheld by the state. The bill will go into effect July 1. “Telling transgender students that they can’t participate as who they really are amounts to excluding them from sports entirely – depriving them of opportunities available to their peers and sending the message that they are not worthy of a full life,” Henry Seaton, ACLU of Tennessee’s transgender justice advocate, said in a statement.\n\nTexas\n\nEagle Pass: Search crews on Monday recovered the body of a Texas National Guard member who went missing after jumping in the river on the U.S.-Mexico border to help a migrant who was struggling to swim across. The body of Spc. Bishop Evans was found three days after he was reported missing in the Rio Grande near the border city of Eagle Pass. The local sheriff has said Evans jumped into the river without his jacket or radio to help a woman who appeared in distress while trying to swim over from Mexico. “Our National Guard soldiers risk their lives every day to serve and protect others and we are eternally grateful for the way SPC Evans heroically served his state and country,” Gov. Greg Abbott said in a statement Monday. The body was found near the boat ramp of a bridge in Eagle Pass, said Democratic state Sen. Roland Gutierrez, whose district includes Eagle Pass. Migrant rescues are common in the river along the Texas border, and the attempted crossings are also sometimes deadly. Maverick County Sheriff Tom Schmerber said the bodies of as many as two migrants a week are sometimes found along his county’s section of the river. Evans was assigned to Abbott’s sprawling border mission known as Operation Lone Star. Gutierrez said Evans is at least the fifth Guard member known to have died during the mission that began last year. He called for an inquest into their deaths.\n\nUtah\n\nCedar City: Four people were killed when a single-engine airplane on a sightseeing tour crashed minutes after takeoff in rural southwestern Utah, authorities said Sunday. Deputies discovered the aircraft after responding to a report of a fire just before 7 p.m. Saturday about 5 miles east of Cedar City, the Iron County Sheriff’s Office said. Pronounced dead at the scene were pilot Steven Eatchel and his wife, Lindsay Eatchel, of Springville, Utah; Thomas Eatchel, of Heber City, Utah; and Danielle Deagostini, of Sandy City, the sheriff’s office said. The National Transportation Safety Board identified the aircraft as a Diamond DA-40 and said it was investigating the crash. No cause was immediately identified. The plane earlier in the day flew from Spanish Fork to Cedar City, where it had a layover of about 21/ 2 hours at the regional airport before taking off and heading east toward some mountains for a sightseeing tour of Zion National Park, the sheriff’s office said. Radar communication with the aircraft was lost about four minutes after it took off. The position of the downed aircraft and damage to foliage at the crash site suggested it was headed west when it crashed, the sheriff’s office said.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The share of Vermonters living with a disability is growing quickly, yet nobody is sure just how many people fall under this category – an uncertainty that may affect how the state allocates money for support. Vermont’s population of people who have at least one disability rose nearly 10% between 2011 and 2020 to over 14% of people in the state, according to a study by Avacare Medical Blog, which analyzed 2021 U.S. Census Bureau data. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says about 1 in 5 adults in Vermont has at least one disability. Even higher is the figure from the Vermont Department of Health, which says 24% of Vermont adults had at least one disability as of 2019. How people are polled and how disability is defined can make it difficult to understand the true number of those living with a disability in Vermont, said Sarah Launderville, executive director of the Vermont Center for Independent Living. “I think that there’s a bunch of people who might not think that they fit into that category of disability because of the way that we look at disability in society,” Launderville said. To be considered disabled by the Social Security Administration and receive financial support, a person’s disability cannot be “partial” or “short-term,” meaning a medical condition prevents ability to work, according to the agency website. However, not all types of disabilities prevent someone from working or living independently.\n\nVirginia\n\nFalls Church: The Arlington County Board gave unanimous approval Saturday to Amazon’s plans to build a unique, helix-shaped tower as the centerpiece of its emerging second headquarters in northern Virginia. Amazon announced the plans in February 2021 for the eye-catching, 350-foot tower to anchor the second phase of its redevelopment plans. The new office towers will support a second headquarters for Amazon that is expected to welcome more than 25,000 workers when complete. The helix is one of several office towers granted approval, but it stands out. The spiral design features a walkable ramp wrapping around the building with trees and greenery planted to resemble a mountain hike. Amazon has said the building is designed to help people connect to nature, and the outdoor mountain climb will be open to the public on weekends. The plans have gone through the famously thorough review process of Arlington County, including numerous public hearings. Earlier this month, the county planning commission voted 9-0 to support the project. On Saturday, the County Board voted 5-0 to approve the plans. They also include park space and will accommodate a community high school, along with ground-level retail. Amazon has said it hopes to complete the project in 2025.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympic National Park: The Olympic Peninsula has lost 45% of its glacier coverage since 1980, according to a new study by Portland State University professor Andrew Fountain and co-authors from Washington state and British Columbia. The peninsula’s remaining 250 glaciers, which covered about 2 square miles at last estimate, should be gone in another 50 years as humanity’s pollution continues to overheat the planet, the study found. Fountain told KUOW glaciers worldwide are getting a kind of double whammy, with less snow in the winter and more melt in the summer. Beyond the fascination they provide for a small community of researchers, glaciers serve as frozen reservoirs. “These glaciers provide water during the hottest, driest parts of the year,” Fountain said. Salmon and people in glacier-fed watersheds rely on nature’s ice chests to keep rivers flowing and cool each summer. Fountain said a rapid end to fossil fuel burning could delay the glacial melt-off by a few decades. “We have to encourage our lawmakers to start enacting legislation to cut greenhouse gases,” he said. “I think, for the foreseeable future, the fate(s) of the glaciers on the Olympic Peninsula are sealed.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nNorthfork: Several communities in the state’s southern coal fields celebrated the completion of a long-awaited project to bring clean water to local communities last week. The Elkhorn Water Project began in 2015 and included a new 400,000-gallon water storage tank on Elkhorn Mountain. The recently completed second phase brings county water to 112 McDowell County Service District customers in Upland, Kyle and Powhatan; 163 customers in Northfork and Algoma; and 101 in Keystone, the Bluefield Daily Telegraph reports. Many water systems in the area were installed in the early 1900s by coal companies and have been failing for years. Residents of Keystone, for example, were under a boil-water notice for more than a decade. U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., met with local and state officials Thursday to celebrate the completion of the second phase. Capito said clean drinking water is among the basic infrastructure rights, which also include good roads and broadband access.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWaukesha: Five months after an SUV plowed through the crowd and killed six people at a Christmas parade, the city continues to have the tragedy in mind in legislative decisions. Various committees have studied proposals for things such as a permanent parade memorial, safety barricades and public consideration of how to address the 2022 parade. The actions complement an effort by nonprofit organizations to collect and disperse funds to aid the hundreds of victims in the parade tragedy. Waukesha’s Christmas Parade in 2021 will forever stand for the tragedy that it was, and a special commission with the city has begun to try to figure out how to memorialize those who died. The Waukesha Parade Memorial Commission has considered creating three sites: a permanent large memorial, possibly in Grebe Park, and one or two smaller sites along the parade route on Main Street. “It’s about what we can to help avoid this anytime in the future, not just for Waukesha but for any community,” said Jerry Couri, the commission’s chairman, whose business, Couri Insurance Agency, has long been a fixture on Main Street. The commission began with the expectation of having the permanent memorial in place in 14 to 15 months. Couri said members are keeping that time frame in mind as they develop ideas.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Conservation groups are still seeking protections for a rare plant that scuttled plans for a gypsum mine in the Bighorn Basin area, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. The Center for Biological Diversity has joined with two smaller groups in announcing plans to file a lawsuit against the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service if federal officials don’t finish a status review on the thick-leaf bladderpod by mid-June, saying the agency is violating its own deadlines, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/11/02/uvalde-ofrenda-tulsa-graves-shrinking-salt-flats-news-around-states/50896331/", "title": "Uvalde ofrenda, Tulsa graves: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuscaloosa: Hundreds of Scouts from around west Alabama camped, played games, practiced skills and enjoyed the outdoor life at the Moundville Archaeological Park. The celebration, which marked the Black Warrior Council of the Boy Scouts of America’s 100th annual encampment, was held over the weekend at the park, one of the nation’s premier Native American Heritage sites. “We cover 12 counties. This anniversary is a testimony to Scouting’s relevance in today’s society. Go back a hundred years. It was relevant back then to young people, and it still is today,” said Bill Gosselin, CEO of the Black Warrior Council. Gosselin said he is excited about the future of Scouting. Membership in the various Scout organizations in west Alabama grew last year, and there were more than 700 people participating in the encampment. The kids participating Friday ranged from 5-year-olds in the Lion Cubs program to 20-year-old Venture Scouts. The 100th encampment included model rocket launch demonstrations, archery, sling shots, tomahawk throwing, camp cooking, ham radio demonstrations and the ability to visit the museum at the Moundville Archaeological Park.\n\nAlaska\n\nKipnuk: Students are learning remotely this week after an as-yet unexplained fight between a school district and tribal council led to a principal being banished from the village, Alaska Public Media reports. The Kipnuk Traditional Council last month barred students from attending in-person classes, pointing to safety concerns, and the Lower Kuskokwim School District said Monday that Chief Paul Memorial School would close. The council also formally banished Principal LaDorothy Lightfoot last week, saying she should be flown out by noon Friday. The causes of the developments remain unclear, according to Alaska Public Media.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A federal judge on Tuesday ordered armed members of a group monitoring ballot drop boxes in the state to stay at least 250 feet away from the locations following complaints that people wearing masks and carrying guns were intimidating voters. U.S. District Court Judge Michael Liburdi said members of Clean Elections USA, its leader and anyone working with them are also barred from filming or following anyone within 75 feet of a ballot drop box or the entrance to a building that houses one. They also cannot speak to or yell at individuals within that perimeter unless spoken to first. The temporary restraining order was requested by the League of Women Voters of Arizona after Clean Elections USA encouraged people to watch 24-hour ballot boxes in Maricopa County, Arizona’s most populous county. “It is paramount that we balance the rights of the defendant to engage in their constitutionally protected First Amendment activity with the interest in the plaintiffs and in voters casting a vote free of harassment and intimidation,” Liburdi said. A second set of defendants in rural Yavapai County – groups known as the Lions of Liberty and the Yavapai County Preparedness team, who are associated with the far-right anti-government group Oath Keepers – were dismissed from the case Monday after they pledged to stand down their operations.\n\nArkansas\n\nHorseshoe Bend: A man who was reported missing while hiking in the Ozark Mountains has been found alive after a four-day search, officials said. Clinton Preston Smith, 67, of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, was found “in good spirits” about noon Tuesday, according to a statement from the Buffalo National River, which is part of the National Park Service. He had been reported missing Oct. 27 after he failed to return home from a hike on a trail near the Buffalo National River in northern Arkansas, officials said. Crews found Smith near the river in the area of Horseshoe Bend, which is about 105 miles north of Little Rock. Newton County Sheriff Glenn Wheeler said Smith was sore, hungry and dehydrated but did not appear to have any serious injuries, Springfield, Missouri, TV station KY3 reports.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSanta Ana: A health emergency has been declared in Orange County due to rapidly spreading viral infections that are sending more children to the hospital, health officials said Tuesday. The county health officer issued the declaration Monday due to record numbers of pediatric hospitalizations and daily emergency room visits, the county’s health care agency said in a press release. The move allows the Southern California county of 3 million people to access state and federal resources and enlist assistance from non-pediatric hospitals to help care for sick children, said Dr. Regina Chinsio-Kwong, the county’s health officer. “Our concern here is that it is reaching even record levels,” Chinsio-Kwong told reporters. “We want to make sure we are prepared to care for any sick child in the county who falls ill and requires hospital care.” The county has seen a growing number of children with respiratory syncytial virus, which can cause severe breathing problems for babies, while flu cases are also starting to rise. The situation is similar in much of the country, where doctors are bracing for the possibility that RSV, flu and COVID-19 could combine to stress hospitals. Last week, neighboring San Diego County’s public health agency sounded a similar alarm.\n\nColorado\n\nBoulder: Seeking a second term as governor, Democrat Jared Polis is referring to himself as a “happy dad” as he fends off attacks from Republican Heidi Ganahl, who is trying to channel the angst of parents worried about underperforming schools, drugs and post-pandemic crime with the campaign slogan “#MadMom.” “We have skyrocketing crime, out-of-control inflation, a huge fentanyl problem that’s killing our kids, and our kids can’t read, write or do math at grade level,” Ganahl said in a recent debate. All are nationwide issues. Polis, a wealthy tech entrepreneur and former U.S. representative, counters with a rosy picture of the state under his watch and insists Colorado’s best days are ahead as it emerges from the pandemic with a strong economy and healthy state revenues bolstered by federal relief spending. “My opponent identified herself as a mad mom. I identify myself as a happy dad, of two great kids, 11 and 8, raising my kids in the best state of all the states,” Polis responded at the debate. Ganahl, a University of Colorado regent, mother of four and successful entrepreneur, faces stiff odds but is undaunted in a state that has become increasingly Democrat-controlled in the past decade, said Dick Wadhams, a former state Republican Party chair. “Heidi is very competitive, but it’s a high bar,” Wadhams said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nKillingly: A scathing report from the state Department of Education found the Killingly school board engaged in apparent “deliberate indifference” when it came to addressing student mental health issues. “And it is that systemic indifference that distinguishes this from other school boards confronting these issues,” according to the report from Commissioner Charlene Russell-Tucker which accused the Killingly board of “repeated failure and refusal to implement reasonable interventions to address students’ clear mental health, socio-emotional and behavioral needs.” The 38-page report, which includes information obtained by sworn affidavits of district officials and others, is the culmination of a months­-long state investigation into a citizens’ complaint filed in the wake of the board’s rejection of a grant-funded school-based health center in March and its alleged failure to offer substantial alternative behavioral health options. The report – and its recommendation that the Connecticut Board of Education order an inquiry into the matter – was released Monday, just days before the state board was scheduled to discuss the topic. State education investigators upheld the complainants’ allegation that the Killingly board “failed or is unable to make reasonable provision to implement the education interests” of the state.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: While overall college enrollment is dropping nationwide, Delaware State University has set an enrollment record, topping 6,000 students for the first time in its 131-year history. Enrollment of 6,268 for the fall 2022 semester is a jump of nearly 11% from last year’s previous record of 5,649 and an increase of 33% since 2017, said DSU director of news services Carlos Holmes. This semester’s first-year class totals more than 1,400, also a record. Meanwhile, the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center reported that undergraduate enrollment in the U.S. fell by 4.7%, with 662,000 fewer students in the spring 2022 semester than in 2021. Graduate and professional student enrollment dropped by 1% from last year. Delaware State University president Tony Allen said one of the goals in the DSU strategic plan is to reach 10,000 students by the end of the decade. He credits the success to a university-wide commitment to access and opportunity, including a stronger emphasis on online and graduate programs, enhancements to the state-funded Inspire Scholarship Program and expansion of its Early College School. Online enrollment soared by 56.8% compared to last year, while graduate enrollment rose by 5.7%.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Protesters opposed to the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision overturning abortion rights briefly interrupted arguments at the court Wednesday and urged women to vote in next week’s elections. It was the first courtroom disruption since the justices’ decision in June that stripped away women’s constitutional protections for abortion after nearly a half-century under Roe v. Wade. Three people stood up in the first few minutes of Wednesday’s session to denounce the abortion ruling. “Our right to choose will not be taken away,” one protester said. “Women, vote for our right to choose.” The justices did not appear to react to the disruption. The protesters did not resist when police led them away. The protesters, identified as Emily Archer Paterson, Rolande Dianne Baker and Nicole Elizabeth Enfield, were charged were violating a law against making a “harangue” in the Supreme Court building and another barring interference with the administration of justice, court spokeswoman Patricia McCabe said by email. After a 19-month closure because of the coronavirus pandemic, the courtroom was reopened to the public in October. The last time Supreme Court arguments were interrupted was in 2015 when opponents of rulings that lifted limits on money in political campaigns voiced their protest and even managed to get a camera past court security.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: A national anti-discrimination group is now involved in a discipline case at a Leon County charter school. A lawyer from the Southern Poverty Law Center is representing the parents of a child who they say was wrongfully expelled from Florida State University School. “I think that the administration response has been ... completely disproportionate, and it has escalated this issue terribly,” said Cecilia Chouhy, the child’s mother. “They have shown no concern for the welfare of my child.” Chouhy said in October the school issued a “withdrawal without invitation,” which means her son has been removed from the school and not allowed back. The parents appealed the decision, and at a private hearing between the school and the child’s parents Friday, the school did not make a final decision. The parents said the school unfairly disciplined their 6-year-old son, who they say does not have a disciplinary record, after he threw a temper tantrum and allegedly hit a teacher after he took away the child’s Pokémon card. The school allegedly told the parents and their son, who are Latino, that administrators contacted law enforcement and that the child could be charged with a felony for the incident. Florida law, however, prohibits arrests of children younger than 7 years, except for felonies such as murder or manslaughter.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Mayor Andre Dickens announced Monday that he has appointed the city’s interim police chief to fill the position permanently. Darin Schierbaum, who has served as interim chief since June, has been with the Atlanta Police Department for two decades. Dickens said in a news release that Schierbaum shares his vision for public safety in Atlanta and was selected after a national search. “He has earned my trust, the respect of our community, and the support of the women and men of the Atlanta Police Department,” Dickens said. “A proponent of 21st Century Policing, Chief Schierbaum will continue building deep ties between the Atlanta police and the community they serve.” Schierbaum joined the department in 2002 after graduating as valedictorian in his police academy class. He had previously worked for 10 years with the Johnson County Sheriff’s Department in Illinois. During his career in Atlanta, he has led the Community Liaison Unit, the LGBT Liaison Unit, the Hispanic Liaison Unit and the Graffiti Abatement Unity, the release says. He has also been involved in training officers and has overseen public safety for major events in the city. “I thank Mayor Dickens for the opportunity to serve this city and the incredible men and women of the Atlanta Police Department,” Schierbaum said in the release.\n\nHawaii\n\nJoint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam: The Navy on Tuesday said it will ask the public how it should use a fuel storage facility in the hills above Pearl Harbor once it has finished draining petroleum from its massive storage tanks. The Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility leaked petroleum into Pearl Harbor’s tap water last year and sickened nearly 6,000 people, mostly those living in military housing. The Navy said it would seek permission from the Hawaii Department of Health to leave the tanks inside the hillside, where they were built during World War II. Meredith Berger, assistant secretary of the Navy for energy, installations and environment, told reporters at a news conference that it would be safer for the environment to leave the tanks in place once they are cleaned. The Navy also said leaving them there would allow them to be put to another use. The Navy hasn’t determined what they will be used for yet, only that they won’t be used to store fuel again. The Navy plans to ask the public for ideas through meetings and webinars. One possibility is to use the tanks to store water for a pumped hydroelectric power facility.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The first confirmed case this year of chronic wasting disease has been detected in a deer in Idaho County, state wildlife officials said. Idaho Fish and Game last month said a white-tailed deer found dead along the side of the road tested positive for the disease. The agency said the cause of the deer’s death is unknown. The contagious and fatal neurological disorder was first detected in the state in the same area last fall. That area accounts for all seven detected cases in the state. The discovery of the disease last year prompted the Idaho Fish and Game Commission to designate a chronic wasting disease management zone. The disease found in game animals carries potential health concerns for hunters because it’s in the same family as mad cow disease and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends people not eat meat from animals with the disease, though it has never been documented to infect humans. The most recent deer testing positive was found in Fish and Game’s Management Unit 14, the only unit in Idaho where chronic wasting disease has been detected. All seven animals that have tested positive in the state were between the towns of Riggins and Grangeville.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A collection of valuable Lincoln artifacts, some of which were recently displayed in the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum’s Treasury Gallery, is no longer in Springfield. ALPLM spokesman Chris Wills confirmed Wednesday that the 1,500 or so items were picked up Monday by the Lincoln Presidential Foundation, which had a relationship with the ALPLM until last year. The story was first reported by WBEZ-FM, a National Public Radio affiliate in Chicago. The private foundation had originally been set up as a fundraising arm of the ALPLM, but the acrimony between the two culminated over pieces in what is known as the Taper Collection and money still owed by the foundation on its purchase. Louise Taper is a southern California historian and author who sold the collection to the foundation for between $23 million and $25 million in 2007. Taper was awarded the Order of Lincoln in 2009. In the collection was a pair of bloody gloves that Lincoln was carrying and one of the two cufflinks on the shirt he was wearing when he was assassinated at Ford’s Theatre in Washington on April 14, 1865. There was also a number of letters in Lincoln’s handwriting in the collection.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The sidewalks of downtown spilled over with students visiting from across the country for the 95th annual FFA convention last week, with more than 69,000 in attendance over four days. “It actually felt like a pre-COVID year for our convention,” said Mandy Hazlett, the associate director of convention and events at the National FFA Organization. “We were able to bring back events in our convention that we were unable to in person last year.” The Indiana Convention Center hosted nearly 1.3 million visitors by the end of September, marking a near-complete recovery for one of the city’s most important industries. That’s about the same number the facility hosted in 2019 in that time and a big jump from the 230,000 the center hosted in 2020 and 840,000 in 2021. By the first months of next year, “Indianapolis will probably be able to proclaim 100% plus recovery from the pandemic,” said Chris Gahl, an administrator at the tourism nonprofit Visit Indy. Hotel occupancy still lags slightly behind the year before the pandemic. The economic impact of convention tourism in the first nine months of this year, some $855 million, is a huge jump from $519 million in that time frame last year, according to Visit Indy.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A proposed massive development could turn the southwest corner of West Des Moines into a destination unlike any other in the state of Iowa. Developers announced plans Wednesday for The Grand Experience, a proposed $600 million, 226-acre entertainment district that could include a 100,000-square-foot indoor water park, a 400-room hotel and business conference center, a family entertainment center, a variety of dining options with different themes and experiences, new retail and office space, and 1,200 housing units with an emphasis on affordable homes for workers. The district would be located on Grand Avenue between 60th and 88th streets next to the future new campus of Des Moines University and the RecPlex. The Grand Experience would provide visitors to the newly opened sports and recreation complex with more options for entertainment nearby. “This is not scaled back,” said Riley Hogan, senior vice president for real estate services firm CBRE. “This is going big.” The centerpiece of the proposed development would be a water park two-and-a-half times the size of the Great Wolf Lodge water park in Kansas City, Kansas, and more akin to something found in the Wisconsin Dells, Hogan said.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Tourists who seek out every state’s replica of the Liberty Bell would no longer be directed to a storage room of the Kansas Statehouse parking garage if the Docking State Office Building renovation goes through as proposed. “The staff members of the visitor’s center brought it to our attention that a must-see or a bucket list of a lot of people coming into the capitol or with a passport is they want to see the Liberty Bell,” said Sen. Elaine Bowers, R-Concordia. “And we would say, where’s the Liberty Bell at? Well, now we discovered that the Liberty Bell was on display. It was removed during renovation. We found it.” The bell is in a locked room on the first floor of the Statehouse parking garage. The bells were part of a U.S. Savings Bond campaign in the 1950s, with the federal government giving replicas to each state and a handful of other locations. They are commonly displayed at or around state capitol buildings. Such was the case in Kansas until extensive renovation efforts began two decades ago, evicting the bell to storage. “There’s 57 total. Kansas is the only one not on display,” Bowers said. “So you can imagine the folks’ disappointment when they come to the capitol wanting to see the Liberty Bell. With permission with the security guards, the Capitol Police, they will take visitors down to see the bell so they can mark it off their passport list.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Visibly frustrated lawmakers on Wednesday questioned subjects of a recent investigation on whether they are serving the reading needs of the state’s students. George Hruby, executive director of the Collaborative Center for Literacy Development, and Lindy Harmon, director of Reading Recovery in the state, appeared before the panel of lawmakers in a Capitol annex meeting room. The morning questioning lasted about 40 minutes. Lawmakers’ inquiries primarily focused on Reading Recovery, an intervention program under national scrutiny for its instructional methods. State Rep. James Tipton, R-Taylorsville, Sen. Steven West, R-Paris, and Rep. Tina Bojanowski, D-Louisville, each sat on the committee. The three legislators, who pushed through a new state literacy law earlier this year, said they were not satisfied with the testimony. “I think they talk in circles,” Bojanowski said after the hearing. “It’s kind of more of the same,” West said. “It’s frustrating,” Tipton said. “And it’s frustrating because we want to see improvement now.” Spring 2022 testing results show less than half of Kentucky’s third through fifth graders were considered proficient readers, while nearly 30% outright failed their exams.\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport: A new study claims Louisiana is one of the worst states for millennials to live based on affordability, political and social environment, employment, quality of life, health, personal finance and safety. Members of the millennial generation – typically born between 1981 and 1996 – are currently among the biggest contributors to the economy. They have experienced slower economic growth than the previous generations due to the multiple recessions hitting at peak times of their lives. There are a number of challenges that will influence millennials’ decisions on where to live and work. Scholaroo’s newest report on the best and worst states for millennials gathered data on 52 metrics that affect the generation’s decisions on where to live. Considerations like the cost of living, homeownership rate, unemployment rate and more were the driving factors of this study. Louisiana came in dead last for the overall score of the worst place for millennials to live, with the breakdown ranking the state 31st for affordability, 50th for political and social environment, 33rd for employment, 28th for quality of life, 48th for health, 48th for personal finance and 46th for safety. As of 2022, Louisiana sits at the No. 2 spot for the highest mental distress rate of millennials at 21.9%, right behind Arkansas’ 23.6%.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The federal government has outlined a strategy to try to protect an endangered species of whale while also developing offshore wind power off the East Coast. President Joe Biden’s administration has made a priority of encouraging offshore wind along the Atlantic coast as the U.S. pursues greater energy independence. Those waters are also home to the declining North Atlantic right whale, which numbers about 340 in the world. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management released a draft plan this month to conserve the whales while allowing for the building of wind projects. The agencies said the ongoing efforts to save the whales and create more renewable energy can coexist. “As we face the ongoing challenges of climate change, this strategy provides a strong foundation to help us advance renewable energy while also working to protect and recover North Atlantic right whales, and the ecosystem they depend on,” said Janet Coit, assistant administrator for NOAA Fisheries.\n\nMaryland\n\nHagerstown: The management of a former city pesticide plant could last decades. In 2015, a federal Environmental Protection Agency official said operators of the contaminated former pesticide mixing site along Mitchell Avenue in Hagerstown “couldn’t have picked a worse place” to run it. Bob Wallace, a remedial project manager for the EPA, said at the time that groundwater runs in all directions from the site. In an attempt to track any contamination leaving the 19-acre property, remediation crews injected dye into sink holes on the property to determine where it might flow. Wallace, who was among a number of EPA officials and others who gave an update of the cleanup of the site Tuesday, said dye showed up 2 miles to the east. It also appeared 4 miles to the west, 4 miles to the southwest and 3 miles to the north, Wallace said. But he said previously that just because dye shows up at a location doesn’t mean it’s contaminated, and he said Tuesday that analysis continues on any possible threats to nearby groundwater supplies. He said the work will probably continue at least for another year. In the meantime, project officials have constructed a facility that treats groundwater at the old industrial site. It started operation in July and has treated about 5.4 million gallons of water, Wallace said. Asked how long the plant might be needed to treat the groundwater, Wallace said it could be at least 30 years. “This is like a forever Superfund site,” Wallace said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The general manager of the region’s troubled public transit system, who shepherded the agency through the pandemic when ridership plummeted and has faced calls to resign during a federal safety review, announced Tuesday that he will step down early next year. Steve Poftak said in a letter to employees of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority that his last day on the job will be Jan. 3, just days before a new governor is sworn in. “Serving as MBTA General Manager has been the experience of a lifetime and it has been my honor and privilege to work with all of you,” he wrote. “While we have faced and will continue to face challenges, I believe in the strength and resilience of the MBTA. As I look back on my four years as General Manager, I take great pride in what we have accomplished together.” The letter did not say what his plans were. Poftak, who was appointed to the MBTA’s fiscal control board in 2015 by Republican Gov. Charlie Baker, took over as general manager in December 2018 from Luis Ramirez, who spent just 15 months on the job. Baker’s term ends in January, and he is not seeking reelection.\n\nMichigan\n\nBenton Harbor: State officials said Wednesday that nearly all the lead pipes in Benton Harbor have been replaced roughly a year after a lead water crisis forced residents to avoid their tap water and use bottled water for simple tasks like cooking and drinking. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said last fall that the city would have its lead service lines replaced within 18 months, a fast pace for a process that often takes years or decades. Five months before the deadline, about 4,500 pipes have been replaced or confirmed not to contain lead. There are only about 40 more inspections to go, state officials said. “We are getting it done ahead of schedule,” Whitmer said in a statement. For three straight years, tests of Benton Harbor’s water system revealed lead levels in its tap water that were too high. Lead is a health hazard that can be especially harmful to young children, stunting their development and lowering IQ scores. Benton Harbor is a majority-Black community of just under 10,000 people. After complaints from activists last year that not enough was being done to combat the lead problem, officials said the city’s tap water should mostly be avoided and provided free bottled water to residents.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A Minnesota man has pleaded guilty to threatening a U.S. senator, according to federal prosecutors. Brendon Daugherty, 35, of Coon Rapids, entered the plea to one count of interstate transmission of a threat during a hearing in U.S. District Court in Minneapolis on Tuesday. According to court documents, Daugherty left two threatening voice mail messages for a senator who was unnamed but who lives outside Minnesota on June 11. In the first message, Daugherty said the senator and the Republican Party was pushing him to become a domestic terrorist, according to U.S. Attorney Andrew Luger. “Have a nice (expletive) day; can’t wait to kill ya,” Daugherty said. In the second message, Daugherty threatened to carry out “nefarious goals,” Luger said. “I also just wanted to note, thank God the Republican Party is against gun control laws because it would keep guns out of the hands of a person that was disabled and volatile like I am, but you guys are totally against that,” the message said.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves said Tuesday that he will ask legislators to approve about $240 million in state incentives for an economic development project in the northern part of the state. The Republican governor declined to name the company, saying he had signed a nondisclosure agreement. “Once we get through the legislative process and once we get final agreements signed, we will announce that the deal is done,” he said during a news conference. Reeves said the company is large and “has a long history of success.” Mississippi governors often have quick timelines to push incentives packages through the Legislature for large economic development projects, and it’s not unusual for them to try to keep company names secret until deals are complete. Some legislators have raised concerns about the special session that began Wednesday. “We don’t have many details at the moment, but we’re concerned that GOP leaders will try to push some kind of corporate welfare package through with little debate or oversight,” Republican state Rep. Dana Criswell of Olive Branch, a member of the Mississippi Freedom Caucus, said in an email Tuesday. Reeves announced Monday that he is calling legislators to the Capitol to consider incentives for a company that would create 1,000 jobs within the next few years. He said the average salary would be $93,000 – significantly higher than than the average pay for jobs in one of the poorest states in the U.S.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: With winter on the horizon, the city’s crisis cold weather shelters are preparing to house more than 230 unsheltered individuals this season. The crisis cold weather season is Nov. 1 through March 31. Shelters are only open when overnight temperatures are 32 degrees or below for four consecutive hours between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. Shelters open around 8 p.m. each night and close at 7 a.m. the following morning. In previous years, folks were asked to visit the Veterans Coming Home Center to sign up for shelter access and eat dinner. Then, they’d be transported to an appropriate shelter. However, this year is different. According to Lisa Landrigan, Community Partnership of the Ozarks crisis cold weather shelter coordinator, a home base for crisis cold weather shelter signup, dinner and transportation has yet to be determined. “We are still looking,” she said. “We have several asks out, and hopefully something will come through.” Crisis cold weather shelters need about six volunteers each night, Landrigan said. Right now, these volunteers are “critically needed.” Landrigan said January is the busiest month for crisis cold weather shelters. Last November, crisis cold weather shelters were open only five nights. In January, the shelters were open for 24 nights.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Affordable housing and affordable food are the top two needs in the state, and mental health services is the third, according to the results of a statewide needs assessment released last week from Montana State University Extension. “The results of this needs assessment are already being used by our MSU Extension faculty and staff as they continue to offer programs and resources,” Carrie Ashe, MSU Extension associate director, said in a statement. MSU Extension works with local partners to examine and address emerging needs in the state, The Daily Montanan reports. In a phone call, Ashe said MSU Extension counts 90 faculty across the state working in county and tribal extension offices, and they’re already taking steps to work on housing. She said it’s the first time in roughly seven or eight years the organization has conducted such a survey. Nearly 2,500 Montanans from all counties and reservations completed the survey, according to MSU Extension. Additionally, more than 800 people participated in listening sessions. Housing affordability and availability are top issues in Montana as real estate prices have soared across the state and people and families find themselves homeless.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Nebraska U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse won approval Tuesday from the University of Florida Board of Trustees to be the school’s next president despite vocal opposition from some faculty and students. Sasse, a Republican, was recommended for the top post by a unanimous vote of the trustees. A final vote to elevate Sasse as the school’s 13th president is set for Nov. 10 by the state university system Board of Governors. The recommended compensation package for Sasse comes to about $1.6 million, university officials said. That will also be finalized at the governors meeting. During a four-hour meeting Tuesday on the Gainesville campus, Sasse sought to allay concerns that he’s more a creature of politics than academia by saying he will take a “pledge of political celibacy” with regard to partisan issues. “I would have no activity in partisan politics in any way as I arrive at the University of Florida,” Sasse said, adding that his candidacy was not pushed by GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis or other Florida elected officials. “There is just tons and tons of learning and listening that I need to do.”\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A Nevada judge on Wednesday set an April trial date for a former Las Vegas-area elected official who has pleaded not guilty to killing a veteran investigative journalist who wrote articles critical of him and his managerial conduct. Robert “Rob” Telles, a Democrat who was stripped by court order of his position as Clark County administrator, appeared with his attorney, Ryan Helmick, for a brief scheduling hearing before Judge Michelle Leavitt. Telles, 45, did not speak in court. He remains jailed without bail in the Sept. 2 stabbing death of Las Vegas Review-Journal reporter Jeff German outside German’s home. Helmick declined to comment to reporters after the hearing. At trial, Telles could face a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole, after Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson said last month that he found no qualifying aggravating factors to make Telles’ trial a capital case. The April 17 trial date could be delayed pending a Nevada Supreme Court ruling about whether police and prosecutors can access German’s cellphone and electronic devices despite objections raised by his newspaper about revealing the slain journalist’s confidential sources. Attorneys for police, who have German’s cellphone and laptop computers, say the criminal investigation won’t be complete until those records are reviewed.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nExeter: Three major development projects bringing affordable housing to the Seacoast are receiving a financial boost this week to help make the projects a reality. The Gateway at Exeter, Epping Meadows and McIntosh Dover Apartments were among the 30 developments chosen to receive a combined $49,506,378 in grant money through the state’s InvestNH Housing Program. The Gateway at Exeter, which seeks to bring 56 affordable housing units to Epping Road across from the Mobil Station, was selected to receive $3 million. The McIntosh project will receive $2.8 million to help bring 52 new affordable units to Dover while Epping Meadows will receive $786,771 for 30 affordable units.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAsbury Park: A grand jury has declined to bring criminal charges against a New Jersey police officer who fatally shot a knife-wielding man during a standoff at the Jersey Shore in 2020. The New Jersey Attorney General’s Office said late Tuesday that the actions of Asbury Park Police Sgt. Sean DeShader were justified under the circumstances, noting that Hasani Best held a knife throughout the 45-minute encounter with police and was not deterred by being shocked with a stun gun. A spokesman for Best’s family on Wednesday denounced the decision. “Attempts to demonize Hasani Best, who was unnecessarily murdered, and vindicate Officer Sean DeShader, who murdered this Black man immediately following the national civil rights reckoning in the post-George Floyd world, tells us nothing has changed,” said Randy Thompson, CEO of the advocacy group Help Not Handcuffs. “There continues to be no transparency when police, prosecutors and judges abuse their positions and there are no protections for civilians within critical processes such as abuses within grand jury proceedings,” he said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The New Mexico Supreme Court has cleared the way for the state’s largest electric utility to delay issuing rate credits related to the recent closure of a coal-fired power plant. State regulators in June had ordered Public Service Co. of New Mexico to begin issuing the credits since the San Juan Generating Station was shutting down. The utility challenged the order and requested a stay. The utility has said the cost of doing business has gone up and that delaying credits would mean smaller rate increases for customers in the future. Utility spokesman Ray Sandoval told the Santa Fe New Mexican that the utility was pleased with the decision. “All parties had the opportunity to fully present their views to the court, and the court fully considered those positions in deciding that the stay should remain in place,” Sandoval wrote in an email.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A man has been arrested with the gun used in a shooting last month outside the Long Island home of Rep. Lee Zeldin, the Republican candidate for governor of New York, authorities said Tuesday. Noah Green, 18, was arrested Monday in Shirley on charges of criminal possession of a weapon and criminal possession of stolen property, Suffolk County District Attorney Raymond Tierney announced. Green’s possible involvement in the Oct. 9 drive-by shooting outside Zeldin’s house is still being investigated, the district attorney’s office said. Two 17-year-old boys were wounded in the shooting. Zeldin, who faces Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul in next Tuesday’s election, was not at home when the shooting occurred but said his twin teenage daughters were in the kitchen doing homework and heard gunshots and screaming.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper has quietly ended his litigation challenging the constitutionality of a powerful state commission that scrutinizes state agency rules, days before it was heading to court. Cooper’s private attorneys filed paperwork last Friday dismissing his August 2020 lawsuit against Republican legislative leaders. A hearing before three trial judges on the governor’s motion to have the composition of the 10-member Rules Review Commission struck down as unconstitutional was scheduled for Nov. 9. Cooper’s lawsuit alleged that a governor “lacks no meaningful control over” the commission because all of its members are picked by legislative leaders – five each by the recommendation of the House speaker and Senate president pro tempore – even though it acts like an executive branch agency. The lawsuit didn’t focus on a specific action by the commission, which decides whether to approve or reject temporary or permanent agency rules to carry out the details of state law. Rather, it examined broadly the commission’s actions in recent years and asked for a broad ruling throwing out the law. The lawsuit was dismissed “without prejudice,” which means Cooper could sue over the issue again – something that Cooper spokesperson Mary Scott Winstead could occur.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum rejected a plea Wednesday by North Dakota’s American Indian tribes to give them exclusive rights to host internet gambling and sports betting because it isn’t allowed under state law. “While we understand and appreciate the desire by some of the tribes to extend online gaming beyond their reservation boundaries, a clear legal path does not exist for the governor to grant such a broad expansion of gaming,” Burgum said in a statement. But Burgum did endorse the tribes’ appeal to lower the legal gambling age from 21 to 19 at the state’s five American Indian casinos, and let people use credit or debit cards to bet, spokesman Mike Nowatzki said.\n\nOhio\n\nEuclid: A white police officer who fatally shot a Black driver during a struggle inside a car in 2017 must pay his family $4.4 million. An Ohio jury made the award Tuesday, finding that Euclid officer Matthew Rhodes acted recklessly when he climbed into 23-year-old Luke Stewart’s car and shot him as Stewart drove away. The shooting had inflamed racial tensions in Euclid, a Cleveland suburb, and a grand jury declined to indict Rhodes after hearing evidence from prosecutors. The jury’s finding stemmed from a wrongful death lawsuit filed by Stewart’s mother. The panel said Rhodes must pay Stewart’s family $3.9 million for the loss of his support and companionship and $500,000 for the pain and suffering he went through. But Rhodes will not have to pay punitive damages to the family or attorney’s fees.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: The search for remains of victims of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre has turned up 21 additional coffins in unmarked graves in the city’s Oaklawn Cemetery, officials said. Seventeen adult-size graves were located Friday and Saturday, Oklahoma State Archaeologist Kary Stackelbeck said Monday. Additionally, the city announced Tuesday that four graves, two adult-size and two child-size, had been found. The coffins, then the remains, will be examined to see if they match reports from 1921 that the victims were males buried in plain caskets. “This is going to part of our process of discriminating which ones we’re going to proceed with in terms of exhuming those individuals and which ones we’re actually going to leave in place,” Stackelbeck said in a video statement. The work, by hand, was still under way. The types of coffins and gender of the victims have not been determined, according to the city’s statement.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A federal judge on Tuesday sentenced an eco-activist to community service but no extra time in custody, rejecting the government’s call for a yearslong prison term for the Seattle man related to arsons decades ago. Joseph Dibee, 54, was a fugitive for more than a decade. In April, Dibee pleaded guilty to the 1997 arson of a slaughterhouse in central Oregon that butchered wild horses and sold the meat in Europe. He also pleaded to the 2001 arson of a Bureau of Land Management wild horse corral in Litchfield, California. As part of his plea agreement, federal prosecutors dropped arson charges in Washington state. He told U.S. District Judge Ann Aiken Monday by video in federal court in Eugene that he was truly sorry, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Philadelphia police have announced the arrest of a fourth suspect in September’s ambush shooting outside a Philadelphia high school that killed a 14-year-old and wounded four other teenagers after a football scrimmage. Police said Monday the 16-year-old is the fifth person authorities have identified as believed to have been involved in the Sept. 27 shooting outside of Roxborough High School. One 16-year-old suspect identified in the case remains at large. Authorities said five people jumped from a parked SUV and opened fire on teens who were walking away from an athletic field at the high school. Nicholas Elizalde, 14, was killed and three other teens were wounded and rushed to a hospital. One was treated at the scene. Police have said they don’t believe Elizalde was one of the intended targets of the attack. They said one of the shooters chased a 17-year-old victim down the street, striking him with shots to the leg and arm, and tried to fire as he stood over the victim but the gun either jammed or was out of bullets. Police have said they were seeking a total of six suspects: five shooters and a driver. At the time they said four suspects had been identified, they said those suspects would face charges of murder, four counts of aggravated assault, firearms crimes and other counts.\n\nRhode Island\n\nCoventry: In what the the American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island calls “a victory for religious freedom,” the Town of Coventry has granted a zoning permit to a small Wiccan church in the rural village of Greene. “We were relieved. It was a long process that probably went on longer than it should have,” said Gail McHugh, founder and high priestess of Horn and Cauldron, Church of the Earth. McHugh says the permit is a win not just for her church, but also for religions like hers across the country. “Minor religions are being squelched and discriminated against,” she said Tuesday.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Gov. Henry McMaster has asked President Joe Biden to authorize a disaster declaration to help with Hurricane Ian recovery efforts in South Carolina, his office said Tuesday. The South Carolina Emergency Management Division and the Federal Emergency Management Agency found that 17 homes were destroyed, 232 homes had major damage and 82 had minor damage because of the storm which came ashore near Georgetown on Sept. 30 with much weaker winds than when it crossed Florida’s Gulf Coast earlier that week. Still, the storm left many areas of Charleston’s downtown peninsula under water. It also washed away parts of four piers along the coast, including two at Myrtle Beach. Ongoing assessments determined Ian cost state and local agencies more than $25 million. If the White House grants the request, the declaration would provide direct financial aid to residents who incurred uninsured damages to their property in Charleston, Georgetown and Horry counties through the FEMA Individual Assistance Program, according to the news release. State and local government agencies and eligible non-profits in Berkeley, Charleston, Clarendon, Georgetown, Horry, Jasper and Williamsburg counties also would qualify for reimbursement of some storm-related costs through the Public Assistance Program.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Republican Gov. Kristi Noem was looking to shore up support for her South Dakota reelection bid Wednesday through a series of campaign rallies with Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin and former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard. Noem has risen to national prominence within the GOP during her term as the state’s first female governor but has shown some signs of political vulnerability, even in reliably-red South Dakota. The Republican governor has outspent her Democratic opponent, state lawmaker Jamie Smith, in the race by nearly six-to-one. Noem crisscrossed between the state’s largest cities for three rallies Wednesday. Smith, meanwhile, embarked on an RV tour that will circle the state in the week leading up to election day.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: More than 200 votes have been cast in the wrong races in Nashville since early voting began in Tennessee, election officials confirmed Wednesday. Davidson County election administrator Jeff Roberts said his office reviewed voter data throughout the night after The Associated Press first alerted officials Tuesday that voters were receiving conflicting information on what race they could vote in. That review determined that 190 voters cast ballots in a wrong congressional race, 16 cast votes in a wrong state Senate race and six cast votes in a wrong state House race. “The fix has been put in place,” Roberts said, adding he had sent the correct updates to the secretary of state’s office earlier Wednesday morning. He remained confident voters would receive the correct ballots for the last remaining two days of early voting in Tennessee. Officials say the votes that have been already cast will be counted for those races. Voters do not have an option to retract their vote.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Families of some of the 19 children killed in the Uvalde school massacre commemorated the Day of Dead with a rally, procession and a decorated altar outside the Texas Capitol on Tuesday night. Relatives, who marched to the mansion of Republican Gov. Greg Abbott carrying the altar, chose the location to again demand tougher gun laws in Texas following the May shooting at Robb Elementary School. They have been most vocal about raising the age to purchase AR-15-style rifles from 18 to 21. Abbott, who is up for reelection, has pushed back on that, saying it would be “unconstitutional.” “We are here today celebrating our children’s lives,” said Kimberly Rubio, whose daughter Lexi Rubio died in the Uvalde shooting, “but also trying to reach out to parents on a personal, on a mom and dad level. Just if you care about your children, protect them, go out to vote for candidates who support sensible gun legislation.”\n\nUtah\n\nWendover: The Bonneville Salt Flats, a remnant of a prehistoric lakebed that is one of the American West’s many otherworldly landscapes, is growing thinner and thinner as the West suffers through its third decade of drought. Research has time and again shown that the briny water in the aquifer below the flats is depleting faster than nature can replenish it. As nearby groundwater replaces the mineral-rich brine, evaporation yields less salt than historic cycles of flooding and evaporation left on the landscape. It’s thinned by roughly one-third in the last 60 years. The overall footprint has shrunk to about half of its peak size in 1994. The crust keeps tires cool at high speeds and provides an ideal surface for racing – unless seasonal flooding fails to recede or leaves behind an unstable layer of salt. Racers struggle to find a track long enough to reach record speeds with only 8 miles of track compared 13 miles several decades ago. Scientists largely agree that years of aquifer overdraws by nearby potash mining have driven the problem, yet insist that there’s no hard evidence that simply paying the mining company to return water to the area will solve it amid detrimental human activity like extracting minerals or driving racecars.\n\nVermont\n\nJay: A Utah-based resort company has completed its purchase of Jay Peak Resort, the northern Vermont ski area that was at the center of a financial scandal involving its former owner and president. Pacific Group Resorts, which owns five other ski areas, announced Tuesday that the state of Vermont had approved the assignment of leases for ski terrain, allowing the sale to close. A federal judge in September approved the company’s $76 million bid to buy Jay Peak after it won an auction for the ski area. “The leadership and guests of Jay Peak are fortunate to have an experienced resort operator like PGRI take the helm from here,” said court-appointed receiver Michael Goldberg, who has been overseeing the resort for the last 61/ 2 years. Mark Fischer, PGRI’s executive vice-president and CFO, said in a statement that Jay Peak “is a highly respected resort property widely known for its prodigious snowfall and avid patrons” that fits into the company’s strategy of “geographic diversification.” He also said Jay Peak has dedicated staff that have created “a strong mountain culture.”\n\nVirginia\n\nManassas: A plan to redevelop a rural swath of northern Virginia into data centers has received approval after a marathon public hearing that stretched through the night. The Prince William County Board of Supervisors voted 5-2 Wednesday morning in support of the plan over the opposition of environmentalists and conservationists. Data centers that provide the backbone for the rapid increase in cloud computing have proliferated in northern Virginia, which has long been a technology hub. The data centers have proven to be a revenue boon to local governments, but neighbors have complained about noise and environmentalists have expressed concern about the massive amounts of electricity that data centers consume. In Prince William County, concern also centered around the viewshed for nearby Manassas National Battlefield Park. Supporters of the plan said it could generate hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue and that the plan is designed in a way to accommodate environmental concerns.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Two foreign nationals from the Democratic Republic of Congo who pleaded guilty in federal court in Seattle to participating in a smuggling ring that brought illegal ivory, rhinoceros horn and pangolin scales into the U.S. have been sentenced. Herdade Lokua was sentenced to 20 months and Jospin Mujangi was sentenced to 14 months in prison on Tuesday, the Justice Department said. They both in July pleaded guilty to two counts of an 11-count indictment alleging they worked with a middle man to facilitate shipments of poached items into Seattle. The court determined Lokua was the organizer of a trafficking operation involving more than five other co-conspirators whose goal was to ship a cargo container full of elephant ivory, white rhinoceros horn and pangolin scales to Seattle. Mujangi helped package the wildlife products and handled the financial details to process the payment.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: West Virginia Republican U.S. Rep. Alex Mooney is expected to breeze to victory in deep-red West Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District, and he’s all but completely ignored Democrat Barry Wendell, his opponent in next week’s election. Instead, he’s spending much of his energy on Sen. Joe Manchin, who endorsed Mooney’s opponent, outgoing Rep. David McKinley, during the state’s May primary. The two GOP congressmen were pitted against each other after population losses cost West Virginia a U.S. House seat, and Mooney won handily. Manchin has not yet officially announced whether he’ll run for reelection in 2024, and Mooney vows that his primary concern is seeing himself and other conservatives get elected and take back the majority in the U.S. House.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A Wisconsin appeals court and a circuit judge this week shot down attempts backed by liberals seeking orders that local election clerks must accept absentee ballots that contain partial addresses of witnesses. The rulings come within days of Tuesday’s election and as more than 503,000 absentee ballots have already either been returned or cast in person. Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson are both up for reelection in the battleground state. Numerous lawsuits have been filed leading up to the election focused on which absentee ballots can be counted or rejected. The status quo for determining whether an absentee ballot has enough of a witness address to count remains as it has been for the past 56 years, Dane County Circuit Judge Juan Colas said in an order Wednesday. Wisconsin elections have been conducted, and absentee ballots counted, the past 56 years without a legally binding definition of what constitutes a witness address on a ballot, Colas wrote in his order.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A southeastern Wyoming sheriff’s deputy was shot and a man was killed during an exchange of gunfire at a residence in East Cheyenne on Halloween night, marking the third fatal shooting involving law enforcement officers in Laramie County this year, officials said. Deputies responded to a residence to serve a warrant at about 8 p.m. Monday when shots were exchanged between deputies and a man at the residence, Sheriff Danny Glick said. The injured deputy was treated at the hospital and released Tuesday afternoon, KTWO-AM reported. The man died at the scene, Glick said. Officials have not released the names of either the man who was killed or the deputies involved. No one else was injured.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/06/25/grasshopper-invasion-curls-cancer-wildfire-tourism-news-around-states/117212516/", "title": "Grasshopper invasion, Curls for Cancer: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nHuntsville: Kieran Moise’s afro, at 19 inches long, was a huge part of his personality. But after six years of growth, the 17-year-old bound for the U.S. Air Force Academy knew he and his hair would soon be parted. So in memory of a friend who died from cancer, he cut it off and donated it to the nonprofit Children With Hair Loss, which provides human hair replacements to children and teenagers facing medically related hair loss due to cancer treatments, alopecia and burns. “I knew I wanted to send a message,” he said. He did – and many responded. Moise printed out flyers and spread the word on social media for an event held by the nonprofit at a brewery in Huntsville. There, family, friends, and even some of his elementary and middle school teachers took turns cutting his hair in braids. His story was widely shared online. “It’s good to see good news and see … that people are still doing good things because all it does is inspire others,” he said. “That’s really what I want to come out of this: I want other people to (say), ‘Hey, if he’s doing this, so can I.’ ” Moise also launched a fundraiser through St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, which had helped his late classmate, Josh Quist, who died when they were in middle school. Initially, Moise hoped he could raise $19,000, or $1,000 per inch of hair. “Kieran’s Curls for Cancer” has exceeded expectations and has already raised nearly $35,000 for St. Jude.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state is trying to dispose of a 58-year-old ferry and even has offered to give it to the government of the Philippines for free. Gov. Mike Dunleavy offered to give the Malaspina ferry away in a letter last month to the Philippines consul general in San Francisco, CoastAlaska reports. “This vessel is surplus to our fleet, is in need of some repairs, but does have some service life left,” according to Dunleavy’s letter dated May 20 and obtained by the Alaska Public Media in a routine public records request for the governor’s correspondence. “We would be willing to provide the vessel to the Philippine government or to a private ferry company in the Philippines free of charge,” the letter says. The Malaspina, built in 1963, last sailed in 2019. Instead of paying at least $16 million in needed steel work, the state put the ferry into cold storage. The state Department of Transportation has estimated it would cost up to $45 million to overhaul the ferry, including installing new engines. The state is paying about $450,000 a year to keep it in storage. Alaska Marine Highway System General Manager John Falvey said there was only tepid interest in buying the ferry, matching the struggles the state experienced in disposing of three other ferries recently. One went to a scrap yard in India, and two others were sold to a Spanish ferry company.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: The University of Arizona has been asked to investigate failures involving its animal research programs that led to the deaths of two sheep and caused it to temporarily halt surgical procedures on mice. In a letter to University President Robert Robbins, the animal rights organization Stop Animal Exploitation Now called for the university to look into five incidents involving animal research in 2020 that resulted in a response from the federal government. Michael Budkie, co-founder of Stop Animal Exploitation Now, urged that staff involved in the incidents be banned from future work with animals and that UA officials terminate the projects during which the incidents occurred. Last year the University of Arizona self-reported four incidents that had a negative effect on the health and well-being of animals involved in research to the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare, part of the National Institutes of Health. In one incident Nov. 1, 2020, the sheep area of the Campus Agricultural Center was broken into and vandalized. Two sheep were injured, and veterinarians at the center determined they needed to be euthanized. UA said it fixed the problem by implementing additional security measures at the site, according to its response to the federal government.\n\nArkansas\n\nCabot: A sheriff’s deputy shot and killed a 17-year-old boy during a traffic stop early Wednesday, but authorities didn’t say what led to the fatal shooting. The Lonoke County Sheriff’s Office said it has turned the investigation of the shooting that occurred about 3 a.m. over to Arkansas State Police. That agency said the circumstances of the traffic stop and what led the deputy to fire his gun at Hunter Brittain after stopping the truck he was driving “will be documented in the investigation.” The shooting occurred outside an auto repair shop along Arkansas Highway 89 south of Cabot, state police said. The city of about 26,000 people is about 30 miles northeast of Little Rock. State police said Brittain was from McRae, a small town about 15 miles northeast of Cabot. Later Wednesday, the sheriff’s office identified the deputy as Sgt. Michael Davis, who has been with the sheriff’s office since 2013. The office said Davis will be on administrative leave pending the outcome of the state police’s investigation.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Dozens of tule elk at Point Reyes National Seashore have died from starvation and dehydration in the past year because the animals couldn’t get past a fence that the National Park Service placed to stop them from competing for food and water with cattle, according to a lawsuit filed Tuesday against the federal government. Three California residents and the Animal Legal Defense Fund sued the park service in federal court in San Francisco, claiming it is being negligent, and more animals will die if the agency is not ordered to provide food and water during the drought. “The National Park Service has a responsibility to protect and preserve these beautiful animals. The idea that depriving them of food and water somehow fulfills that responsibility isn’t just absurd; it’s undeniably inhumane,” said Kate Barnekow, of Harvard Law School’s Animal Law & Policy Clinic, who is representing the plaintiffs. Point Reyes National Seashore spokeswoman Melanie Gunn said she couldn’t comment on pending litigation. Tule elk are a subspecies native to California. The 700-pound animals, hunted to near-extinction in the 1800s, were reintroduced to the park in 1978. According to the lawsuit, 152 elk – more than a third of the population – have died since last year, and necropsies show the emaciated elk died of starvation and/or dehydration.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: More than 4.5 million visitors journey to Rocky Mountain National Park annually for views of wildlife along the roads, snow-capped peaks and refreshing waterfalls. But this year they will have the opportunity to marvel at the power of the largest wildfire scars in the park’s 106-year history. Last year’s East Troublesome and Cameron Peak fires burned about 10% of the park’s 265,769 acres and 15% of its 350 miles of trails. While the devastation will cost the park nearly $4 million over the next three years in trail renovation, the burn scar should be a destination rather than a deviation for visitors. Much of the burn scar is located in backcountry wilderness areas closed to visitors due to the severity of the fire. But enough of it can be seen from roads and on trails to offer visitors a once-in-a-lifetime view of the fire’s delicate stroke and insensitive brush. “In some areas we are seeing aspen shoots and beautiful wildflowers in green meadows and waterfalls we have never seen before,” said Doug Parker, the park’s trails supervisor. “In other parts, mainly on the west side, it’s completely black.” Parker said park staff last fall began the arduous task of assessing the damage and rebuilding trails and bridges where they can. Still, he said, park visitors will be shocked at some of the devastation. “Visitors will have a moment to look like a wildland firefighter because when they hike into some of those areas, they will come out with black legs and clothes that are all black and dirty,” he said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nMystic: The Mystic Aquarium plans to auction off the chance to name three of its five recently arrived beluga whales to raise money for their care and to offset the cost of transporting them from Canada. President and CEO Stephen Coan said the Sea Research Foundation has teamed with New York-based auction house Guernsey’s to hold a fundraising auction Aug. 19 at the aquarium, which it operates. “The three whales will get what we refer to as stage names, and they would be referred to by those names going forward,” he said. The Mystic Aquarium hopes to raise $4 million at the auction, which will also include donated art, perhaps a boat or vintage car, and some unique experiences – such as educational dive trips with scientists to places such as the undersea Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument in the Atlantic Ocean, Coan said. It will cost the aquarium about $5 million a year to care for the belugas, he said. That includes about $250,000 a year to pay for food and veterinary care for each animal, as well as costs associated with running the habitat and research. The foundation also spent millions of dollars last month transporting the whales from their previous home at Marineland in Niagara Falls, Ontario, using custom-made stretchers and special tanks inside a C-130 cargo plane, Coan said.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: House lawmakers on Wednesday approved a spending plan for the fiscal year starting July 1 that adds hundreds of millions of dollars to the budget that Democratic Gov. John Carney proposed in January. House members voted 38-1, with two abstentions, for a $4.77 billion general fund operating budget for fiscal 2022. That is an increase of almost 5% over the current year’s budget and roughly $65 million more than what Carney had recommended. House members also voted unanimously for a “supplemental” budget bill of one-time expenditures that brings the increase over the current year’s $4.5 billion operating budget to more than 10%. With state revenue estimates having skyrocketed since January, lawmakers included more than $221 million in one-time funds for a variety of expenditures next year. The budget bill, which now goes to the Senate, includes $22.7 million for across-the-board pay raises of $500 or 1%, whichever is higher, for state employees. They also approved almost $15.3 million for $500 bonuses to government retirees. Other one-time expenditures include $20 million for state employee health insurance costs and $5 million for a loan program that helps volunteer fire companies upgrade equipment and improve facilities.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A pedestrian bridge collapsed over a highway in the nation’s capital Wednesday, sending five people to the hospital and snarling traffic. The collapse happened just before noon along Interstate 295 in Northeast Washington. The bridge was found to be in poor condition at an inspection just a few months earlier. Investigators believe a truck struck the bridge, causing it to come loose and collapse, said Chris Geldart, deputy mayor for public safety and justice. Several other vehicles were also involved in the collapse. He cautioned that the investigation was still in its preliminary stages. The five people taken to the hospital had non-life-threatening injuries, Geldart said. Chunks of concrete and other debris were strewn across the highway, and both directions of traffic were expected to be closed at least until late Friday. The bridge was lying atop the truck, which was leaking diesel fuel along the roadway, officials said. Mayor Muriel Bowser said Wednesday afternoon that there were no recent reports of structural concerns about the bridge. But Geldart said in a statement later Wednesday that the mayor was incorrect. He said the bridge was inspected in February, and a subsequent report May 25 rated it in poor condition. He said the rating – 4 on a scale of 9 to 0 – marked a threshold prompting a multiyear planning process to replace the bridge.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: Wildlife officials have removed 250 alligators from Disney properties in the five years since a 2-year-old boy was killed by an alligator at the Grand Floridian Resort and Spa, a newspaper reports. The company has worked with trappers contracted through the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission to remove the gators, according to the Orlando Sentinel. Most of the nuisance gators taken from Disney properties are euthanized and sold for their hide and meat, Tammy Sapp, spokeswoman for the wildlife agency, told the newspaper. Some are also transferred to alligator farms, animal exhibits and zoos, she said. Those less than 4 feet long are relocated, she said. Trappers receive $30 for every captured gator, plus the proceeds from any leather and meat sold, the newspaper reports. After Lane Thomas Graves was killed in June 2016, Disney installed a wall and put up reptile warning signs along waterways throughout its resorts. Disney guests said they’re glad the resort is proactively removing gators from its properties. A biology expert agreed, adding that the removals should have a minimal impact on the Florida alligator population.\n\nGeorgia\n\nTybee Island: More summer visitors are flocking to the state’s largest public beach, and that means local officials are writing more tickets for violations. Police on Tybee Island in recent months have been reporting high numbers of citations for beach rule violations such as littering, having glass containers on the beach and climbing on sandbars, WTOC-TV reports. City Manager Shawn Gillen said one particular violation has shown a huge increase: people bringing dogs onto the beach, which the city doesn’t allow. “We’ve written more dog tickets in the last year than we have in the last four years combined,” Gillen said. “It’s one of those things where we’re getting more and more signage to let people know about the rules, and we ask people to go to our website, look at the beach rules and understand them because the code enforcement will be writing a ticket if they see the violation.” Gillen said it’s not just more people coming to the beach that’s driving up citations after the coronavirus pandemic slowed tourism last year. He said the island also has a full staff of code enforcement officers patrolling the beach, which wasn’t the case during the height of the pandemic.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: As some on Maui become overwhelmed by an influx of visitors, the first in a series of sustainable tourism town halls this week focused on lessons learned at another Pacific tourist hot spot. Orion Cruz, a Maui attorney who worked with the government of Palau on tourism issues, participated in the virtual panel, The Maui News reports. Cruz, a former legal counsel to the Ministry of Natural Resources, Environment and Tourism of the Republic of Palau, said the Western Pacific island nation encourages environmentally friendly visitors and enacted measures to ensure sustainability funding. There is a $100 “Palau Pristine Paradise Environmental Fee” added to every international airline ticket, Cruz said. “This hundred dollars supports the country in a variety of ways, but a substantial portion goes to fund Palau’s protected areas network, which is kind of like their national park system,” Cruz said. Tourists also sign the “Palau Pledge” and agree to act responsibly both environmentally and culturally. The virtual panel was hosted by Kelly King, chairwoman of the Maui County Council’s Climate Action, Resilience and Environment Committee. “The community wants action to ensure a future for the visitor industry that protects the people, culture and environment,” King said in a statement.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state will continue playing a $4,551-per-month housing stipend to the governor for now, a special legislative committee has decided, but the panel will reconsider the matter later this year. The Governor’s Housing Committee voted unanimously to keep the stipend in place, the Idaho Press reports. “We really need to be talking about should we be doing this, should we be doing it at this rate, is it still needed, what are some of the other states doing,” said Sen. Abby Lee, R-Fruitland. The panel will meet again in November or December to consider possible changes. “Does it still make sense today? I don’t know,” said House Assistant Majority Leader Jason Monks, R-Meridian. “I certainly didn’t have enough information to make a decision other than let’s maintain where we’re at.” Idaho is one of just five states that does not provide an official residence for its governor. Some states have historic governor’s mansions, and some require their governors to live in those homes. Idaho hasn’t had an official residence for its governor since the hilltop Simplot mansion, donated to the state by potato magnate J.R. Simplot’s family in 2004, reverted back to the family in 2013. No Idaho governor ever lived in the mansion. Then-Gov. C.L. “Butch” Otter was J.R. Simplot’s ex-son-in-law and opted to stay at his ranch in Star rather than moving to the Boise residence. The Simplot family demolished the house in 2016.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The City Council on Wednesday confirmed the appointment of Chicago’s first Black female fire commissioner. Annette Nance-Holt was serving as acting fire commissioner after the retirement earlier this year of Richard Ford. When she appointed Nance-Holt acting fire commissioner, Mayor Lori Lightfoot noted she had more than three decades of proven leadership and a passion for public service. Nance-Holt, who joined the department four years after the first women joined the ranks, will take over an agency with a history of racism and sexism. Earlier this year, Chicago’s inspector general issued a report recommending the department put in place stronger policies to deal with the sexual harassment and racial discrimination. Last month, Nance-Holt welcomed 42 new members to the department, including 13 women and 15 from minority communities. It was during that ceremony that Lightfoot nominated her for the top post. “Graduates, look to Commissioner Nance-Holt’s exemplary example of sacrifice and service, even in the face of her own personal pain and tragedy,” Lightfoot said. “She is the real deal.” Nance-Holt first gained public notice when her 16-year-old son, Blair Holt, was shot to death in 2007 on a city bus shielding a classmate from gunfire. She went on to establish the nonprofit Purpose Over Pain, which helps parents who have lost children to gun violence.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: In just a week, teenage workers will no longer have to obtain work permits from schools, expediting hiring at a time when the service industry is desperate for workers. “Now we can interview, make the decision to hire, and they can technically start working that day,” said Matt Eckert, the president of Holiday World, a theme park in southern Indiana where many of the employees are teenagers. The requirement for teenagers to get a work permit from a school has been frustrating for the theme park, not only because it delayed hiring but also because students from Kentucky had to find a school in Indiana to provide that permit, he said. The change in state law will be a help to businesses that rely on younger workers but won’t do much to improve enforcement of labor laws for underage workers, some labor experts say. The elimination of such work permits was part of a wide-ranging bill targeting teenage employment that passed in 2020 with bipartisan support. The bill also increased the number of hours 16- and 17-year-olds could work from 30 to 40 during school weeks and up to 48 hours during non-school weeks. It also eliminated a requirement for breaks. While most of the changes took effect last year, the elimination of the work permit was delayed until this July.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A blaze that badly damaged a former City Hall building and destroyed a makeshift memorial to Black children was being investigated as “suspicious,” according to fire officials. The fire early Wednesday destroyed a memorial created last summer by the Des Moines Black Liberation Movement to honor Black Iowa youth who have died in recent years. Lt. Rick Thomas of the Des Moines Fire Department said the fire was still under investigation, and its cause had not yet been determined, but investigators believe the cause is “suspicious.” Investigators were reviewing video of the fire, reported about 5 a.m. Wednesday. The memorial was at the entrance to the 132-year-old former North Des Moines City Hall, which has been unoccupied for many years. North Des Moines was once its own city but now is part of Des Moines. The memorial, embellished with flowers, candles, signs and other items, has been a site for vigils and marches. About 100 people marched from a park to the memorial June 12 to honor Black and transgender women and children killed in the state and across the country. A statement from the Des Moines Black Liberation Movement said the organization is heartbroken and believes the fire may have been set intentionally.\n\nKansas\n\nGoddard: Health officials have identified the bacteria that caused a outbreak of illnesses at a splash park near Wichita. State and Sedgwick County health investigators said Wednesday that the Shigella bacteria caused a diarrheal illness in at least three infected people who visited Tanganyika Wildlife Park. Those people were the three original cases linked to the park, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment and Sedgwick County Health Department said in a news release. Several other visitors to the park have reported becoming ill. The Shigella bacteria is spread from person to person through exposure to contaminated feces, the public health agencies said. That can occur through swallowing contaminated water, touching contaminated items and then touching one’s mouth, or cleaning up after someone using the bathroom or changing diapers. An investigation began Friday when several people reported becoming ill after visiting the park. More than 200 people have responded to a survey designed to identify Tanganyika visitors with symptoms of fever, diarrhea or vomiting. It is not yet clear how many of the respondents may be connected to the outbreak at Tanganyika’s Splash Park, The Wichita Eagle reports.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Overhauling the state’s outdated technology for processing jobless claims could take up to three years, Kentucky’s labor secretary said Tuesday as lawmakers delved into problems with the pandemic-stressed unemployment insurance system. The state is in the “latter stages” of selecting a contractor to take on the task of “reworking and rebuilding” the claims-processing system, Labor Secretary Larry Roberts said. “If we can modernize our system, that’s going to make a big difference,” he told the legislative task force that began reviewing problems with the unemployment system. In the meantime, Kentucky labor officials are looking for ways to make more immediate improvements, he said, because of the longer timeline needed to replace the system’s antiquated computer system, which is expected to cost roughly $40 million. “It may take two to three years to make that an outcome,” Roberts said. Like other states, Kentucky was overwhelmed by record waves of claims for jobless assistance caused by the pandemic. Tens of thousands of Kentuckians found themselves in limbo for months as they waited for claims to be processed. Even with most coronavirus restrictions now lifted, lawmakers continue to forward complaints from constituents awaiting jobless aid. Some date back to last spring.\n\nLouisiana\n\nAlexandria: After being missing for 60 years, the gravesite of former Gov. Joseph Walker has been found in Rapides Parish. Walker was the 13th governor of Louisiana, serving from 1850 to 1853. Local historians found the gravesite off Bayou Rapides Road in the city of Alexandria, in central Louisiana, after searching for the landmark since the 1950s, KALB-TV reports. They are hoping a historical marker will be placed at the site. “The fact that the graveyard had been missing for so long is because the tombstone or the markers that we know from that time period are not where they used to be,” said Benjamin Fuselier, a metal detectorist. When Walker died in 1856, he was buried in a family graveyard located on his property in Rapides Parish. In 1864, his former home burned to the ground. A century later, nobody could find the grave. “Something happened around 1960 in which the graveyard was plowed under to use for cultivation of plants. It is a great loss to our state’s history,” said local historian Michael Wynne. Historians said aerial maps, artifacts and witness statements helped pinpoint the location of Walker’s burial site several weeks ago.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The number of people who died from drug overdoses in the state rose to an all-time high last year, surpassing 500 for the first time in the midst of the pandemic, officials said Wednesday. The 504 deaths in 2020 represented a 33% increase over the previous year and easily surpassed the state’s previous high of 418 overdose deaths in 2017, according to the annual report. Gov. Janet Mills said the jump in deaths represents “yet another example” of how the coronavirus pandemic hurt the state. “My heart breaks for every single life lost to a drug overdose. Those we lost are friends, loved ones and community members – people with meaningful lives,” Mills said in a statement. While officials blamed the pandemic for the spike in deaths, the exact correlation was unclear, wrote Marcella Sorg, the report’s author at the University of Maine’s Margaret Chase Smith Policy Center. An estimated 91% of the deaths were accidental overdoses, the number of suicides remained flat, and only one of the victims with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 actually tested positive for the virus, the report said. “We are doing more research to explore whether characteristics of the pandemic, such as isolation, access to medical services” or other factors, contributed to the spike in deaths, she wrote.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: Carryout alcohol service will come to an end in this beach resort town just as the Eastern Shore gets ready to celebrate Independence Day, according to officials in Worcester County. And one county over in Wicomico, officials are meeting next week to consider the continuation of carryout alcohol. Gov. Larry Hogan initially allowed establishments to sell carryout alcohol under specific rules to aid struggling restaurants and bars during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hogan used his state of emergency declaration to circumvent county liquor boards. The service became very popular. During the 2021 legislative session, the Maryland General Assembly approved the permanent sale of carryout alcohol, but the new law requires that individual counties opt in. In Worcester County, officials announced Tuesday that carryout alcohol service would be discontinued once Maryland’s state of emergency is lifted July 1. The Wicomico Board of License Commissioners is set to hold a public hearing on carryout cocktails at 1 p.m. Tuesday. The body will open the floor to discuss formally opting in to takeout and delivery, as well as outline drafted regulations for such permitting.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nAmherst: The town has approved creating a fund to pay reparations to Black residents. The Amherst Town Council on Monday voted 12-1 in favor of setting up the fund and requiring a two-thirds vote of the council to authorize any spending from it, The Daily Hampshire Gazette reports. Town Manager Paul Bockelman said establishing the fund means the town can now begin accepting contributions for the effort and decide on a plan to finance reparations work going forward. The council is weighing a proposal to designate more than $200,000 in surplus budget funds as an initial seed investment. The council on Monday also approved creating the African Heritage Reparations Assembly, to develop the town’s reparations plan by Oct. 31, the newspaper reports. It will be made up of six Black residents and one representative from Reparations for Amherst, a local advocacy group. Councilor Mandi Jo Hanneke voted against the fund because she said it was premature to establish it before forming the assembly. Michele Miller, the cofounder of Reparations for Amherst, said Thursday that her group hopes to establish a private fund to bolster the town’s efforts. “We look forward to supporting the African Heritage Community to implement a robust and sustainable reparative plan,” she said.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: A bipartisan group of lawmakers announced a package of bills Wednesday to curb opioid overdose deaths in the state, which experts say spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic. The announcement came during a media conference to mandate supportive practices in hospitals and increase access to life-saving medications. Before the pandemic, the state had seen some success in reducing the number of opioid-related deaths, even making it a goal to cut the number of deaths in half by 2024. In 2019, opioid-related overdose deaths decreased by 13.2% from 2018, according to the state. However, from January to June of 2020, opioid-related overdose deaths increased by 20% from the same months in 2019, jumping from 874 to 1,045 deaths. An average of five Michiganders a day died from an opioid overdose in 2019, said Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, Michigan’s chief medical officer. “Unfortunately the COVID-19 pandemic means we’ve had to fight two crises at the same time, and early data, unfortunately, suggests that we actually saw an increase in overdoses in 2020,” Khaldun said. “These deaths are absolutely tragic, but they are preventable as well.” One bill in the package expands access to Naloxone, a drug used to reverse an opioid overdose, for community organizations.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A new report shows a growing number of law enforcement agencies are using drones to help with search and rescue efforts, investigations and public safety. The legislative report says 93 agencies statewide either maintained or used a drone in 2020, with 1,171 flights recorded. The report is the result of new regulations lawmakers passed last year. The bipartisan law prevents an agency from deploying a drone with facial recognition technology unless authorized by a warrant or in exceptional circumstances including an emergency situation that involves the risk of death or bodily harm to a person, KSTP-TV reports. Each time a law enforcement agency uses a drone for one of those purposes, it must be documented and submitted to the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which compiles the annual report for the Legislature. The law also prohibits law enforcement agencies from equipping drones with weapons and limits how long drone video can be retained. The aerial equipment gives Cottage Grove police an advantage from above when every moment matters, said Sgt. Michael McCormick. “The whole initial idea of it was to save lives,” McCormick said. “We’ve got parks and water everywhere, so really the idea was to have an extra set of eyes above to assist with officers.”\n\nMississippi\n\nBiloxi: A new training facility for people who want to learn coding is coming to the Gulf Coast. The University of Southern Mississippi’s School of Computing Sciences and Computer Engineering and Mississippi Coding Academies are opening a Biloxi location, according to a press release. Applications are open for the new Biloxi Cyber Center, scheduled to launch in early August. Mississippi Coding Academies offer tuition-free 11-month courses. The program was founded in 2017 as a joint project between Innovate Mississippi and the Mississippi Development Authority, a state agency tasked with recruiting new businesses and promoting economic growth. The program’s goal is to offer a nontraditional path to getting into the software field and to offer economic mobility for residents, particularly those from disadvantaged and underserved communities. “Most participants come from under-served families and are either not college bound or found that college did not provide the desired economic independence,” the program’s website says. “Most only have a high school education and are typically earning part time minimum wages.” The program has three other training locations, in downtown Jackson, Starkville and south Jackson.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A judge ruled Wednesday that a ballot measure to expand Medicaid in the state is unconstitutional, meaning hundreds of thousands of newly eligible low-income adults won’t be able to access the health insurance program July 1 as promised. Cole County Circuit Court Judge Jon Beetem wrote that the voter-approved amendment unconstitutionally sought to force lawmakers to set aside money for the expansion. Under the Missouri Constitution, lawmakers can’t be forced to make appropriations unless the ballot measure includes a funding mechanism. Beetem wrote that the amendment “indirectly requires the appropriation of revenues not created by the initiative and is therefore unconstitutional.” Voters approved Medicaid expansion last August, passing a constitutional amendment by 53% of the vote. It was set to take effect July 1. But Republican Gov. Mike Parson declined to provide coverage for an estimated 275,000 newly eligible low-income adults after the GOP-led Legislature refused to provide any extra funding to do so in the state budget. Three low-income women, including two mothers, sued the state to try to force Parson’s administration to give them the health insurance coverage. The plaintiff’s lawyers said they will appeal Beetem’s decision.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A punishing drought in the West is drying up waterways, sparking wildfires and leaving farmers scrambling for water. Next up: a plague of voracious grasshoppers. Federal agriculture officials are launching what could become their largest grasshopper-killing campaign since the 1980s amid an outbreak of the drought-loving insects that cattle ranchers fear will strip bare public and private rangelands. In central Montana’s Phillips County, more than 50 miles from the nearest town, Frank Wiederrick said large numbers of grasshoppers started showing up on prairie surrounding his ranch in recent days. Already they’re beginning to denude trees around his house. “They’re everywhere,” Wiederrick said. “Drought and grasshoppers go together, and they are cleaning us out.” Grasshoppers thrive in warm, dry weather, and populations already were up last year, setting the stage for an even bigger outbreak in 2021. Such outbreaks could become more common as climate change shifts rainfall patterns, scientists said. To blunt the insects’ economic damage, the U.S. Department of Agriculture this week began aerial spraying of the pesticide diflubenzuron to kill grasshopper nymphs before they develop into adults. Approximately 3,000 square miles in Montana are expected to be sprayed, roughly twice the size of Rhode Island.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Federal regulators have ordered a rancher and Cherry County officials to clean up a remote stream after it was deluged with enough sand and sediment to change the shape of the waterway. The Environmental Protection Agency said the Snake River had been a deep and narrow creek until an estimated 1.6 million tons of sand washed into it, turning a 3-mile stretch into a wide, shallow and sandy waterway, according to the Omaha World-Herald. That’s enough sand to fill an area the size of a football field about 540 feet deep. The stream is a popular fishing and canoeing spot in the Sandhills, a desolate region of grass-covered sand dunes in north-central Nebraska. The sand and sediment flowed into the Snake River after a 2.5-mile ditch was excavated to the river to drain water from a flooded pasture and road. Federal officials said the sand was deposited into the stream without proper permits. Under the federal Clean Water Act, the sand and sediment are considered pollutants. On June 14, the EPA ordered rancher Dick Minor of Gordon, Nebraska, and Cherry County officials to stop the erosion and create a plan within 60 days to permanently stop the flow of sediment into the stream. Minor and the county were also ordered to restore the stream’s deep channel “to the extent technically feasible.”\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The state has agreed to pay $175,000 in legal fees to settle a lawsuit with a rural church over COVID-19 capacity caps on religious gatherings that a U.S. appeals court found illegal in December. But while no COVID-19 restrictions have been in place since June 1, a second church is continuing to press for a federal court order declaring Gov. Steve Sisolak’s earlier limits unconstitutional. Lawyers for Calvary Chapel Lone Mountain in Las Vegas filed a motion in U.S. District Court on June 11 seeking permission to amend its complaint against Sisolak, Attorney General Aaron Ford and Justin Luna, chief of the Nevada Division of Emergency Management. They said a formal ruling is necessary to prevent the state from enacting similar illegal orders in the future and to force compensation for the harm suffered by the church’s parishioners and other businesses deemed nonessential under the governor’s emergency directives. “Unless and until injunctive relief is granted, plaintiffs will continue to suffer irreparable harm for which they are left without an adequate remedy at law” and “be fearful of exercising their right to peacefully pray, assemble, engage in business and to be treated for COVID-19,” the motion says. Last year, indoor religious gatherings in Nevada were subject to a hard cap of 50 churchgoers, while attendance limits at many businesses, including casinos, were based on a percentage of the buildings’ fire-code capacities.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Dartmouth College has relaxed many of its COVID-19 rules, including no longer requiring people who are fully vaccinated to wear masks and lifting physical distancing and dining restrictions. Provost Joseph Helble said Wednesday that Dartmouth was easing protocols in light of the fact that 83% of the students who will be on campus this summer have already been vaccinated, the Valley News reports. The college announced in April that all students will be required to be vaccinated ahead of the fall term. Dartmouth also is requiring employees to be vaccinated by Sept. 1. Employees can request religious and medical exemptions, but those who remain unvaccinated will be subject to wearing personal protective equipment, maintaining physical distancing and being tested more frequently for the coronavirus.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTeaneck: With flag twirlers, a gospel choir and seemingly endless proclamations from local officials, Teaneck and Englewood named streets after the Isley Brothers in the towns where the musicians lived in their heyday. “It’s a ‘wow’ moment,” Ernie Isley said. “This is a spectacular culmination of a lot of dreams and a lot of prayers.” The suburbs a few miles across the Hudson River from New York City held dual ceremonies Thursday to honor the legendary group that scored hits with songs including “Shout,” “Twist and Shout,” “It’s Your Thing,” “That Lady” and “Fight the Power.” Ron Isley lived in Teaneck and Ernie in neighboring Englewood during the 1960s. Another brother, Rudolph, lived in Irvington, about 12 miles south of Teaneck. The brothers helped put Teaneck on the map when they launched the T-Neck record label, known to generations of music fans for the distinctive orange dust jacket on its 45 rpm records. A local music fan, Teaneck resident Ira Buckman, hit upon the idea of renaming part of Van Arsdale Street as Isley Brothers Way two years ago, inspired by watching a rerun of the movie “Animal House,” which iconically features “Shout.” The town’s council approved it and, after a delay due to the coronavirus pandemic, unveiled the new sign Thursday on Isley Brothers Day. Former bandmates and neighbors reminisced about befriending the brothers in the ’60s and ’70s. Neighbors recalled swimming in Ron Isley’s family’s backyard pool all summer long and never being turned away, or hearing the group’s new songs before they were released to the general public.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Many communities are behind the curve when it comes to investing in drinking water infrastructure as persistent drought threatens supplies, and the state’s fragmented funding process makes it hard to know what taxpayers are getting for their money, legislative analysts said Wednesday. New Mexico provided roughly $876 million for water projects over a five-year period. But the analysts told members of the powerful Legislative Finance Committee during a meeting that communities aren’t doing enough to leverage federal and local dollars. A review of the state’s numerous financing mechanisms for water projects found that New Mexico over the past decade made proportionally more grant and loan funding available for water projects than any other state in the U.S. But inconsistent vetting and piecemeal funding put projects at greater risk of being delayed or derailed, according to the review. About one-third of the state-funded local water projects that were examined did not meet their intended purpose – even several years after the initial funding was issued. In the village of Maxwell, for example, $1 million was spent to drill and equip a new drinking water well that could be used in times of drought. A $30,000 shortfall resulted in the well not being hooked up to electricity, leaving the project unfinished and unable to yield any public benefits. Similar issues were found with projects in Lovington and Pecos.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The New-York Historical Society is creating a new archive that will focus on “marginalized communities and inclusive voices” in the city over the past quarter-century. The Diamonstein-Spielvogel Institute for New York City History, Politics, and Community Activism will chronicle “important political, social, and cultural moments from the mid-1900s to the present,” the historical society announced Thursday. “We are so grateful for the initiative and support of the Diamonstein-Spielvogel Foundation for this new endeavor, which will help scholars and the general public to understand how political and social movements, focused on balancing individuals’ right to self-determination with their responsibility to one another, have shaped our city’s history,” Dr. Louise Mirrer, the society’s president and CEO, said in a statement. Initial contributions to the archive will include documents on the building of the High Line in Manhattan. The archive also will include materials already available at the society, including those on Occupy Wall Street. Dr. Barbaralee Diamonstein-Spielvogel, the foundation’s chair and a former commissioner of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission and former chair of the New York State Council on the Arts, is contributing her own papers to the archive.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state would end offering supplemental benefits from the federal government to the unemployed in roughly a month under legislation finalized Wednesday by Republicans in charge of the General Assembly. But House and Senate Democrats voted almost unanimously against the compromise hammered out by GOP leaders from both chambers, signaling a possible veto by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper. The legislation would do away with the $300-a-week Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation benefit for at least 200,000 displaced workers in the state. A $100-a-week additional payment for self-employed workers also would end. Both coronavirus aid programs already are set to expire nationwide in September, but Republicans have agreed with business owners’ concerns that the extra benefits are a disincentive for some to return to the workforce after being months at home. Twenty-six states, all but one with Republican governors, have already decided to withdraw early from the program, according to the National Employment Law Project. By ending the $300 weekly supplement benefit, the final legislation sides with what the House approved earlier this month.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A longtime animal doctor from Hettinger has been named the new state veterinarian and animal health division director, Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring announced Wednesday. Dr. Ethan Andress will take over for Dr. Susan Keller, who is retiring after serving the state for 23 years. Andress will start July 12. Andress is owner and partner of West River Veterinary Clinic in Hettinger, where he has worked as a mixed animal practitioner for 24 years. He graduated from South Dakota State University in 1994 with a bachelor’s degree in biology. He earned his doctor of veterinary medicine degree from Iowa State University in 1997. “Dr. Andress brings valuable experience in the field of veterinary medicine and extensive knowledge of bovine, equine and bison medicine,” Goehring said. “His business background will also be an asset to our animal health programs and the state.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state that launched the national movement to offer millions of dollars in incentives to boost COVID-19 immunization rates concluded its program Wednesday, still unable to crack the 50% vaccination threshold. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine’s May 12 announcement of the incentive program had the desired effect off the bat, leading to a 43% boost in state vaccination numbers over the previous week. But numbers of shots administered have dropped since then. “Clearly the impact went down after that second week,” DeWine acknowledged Wednesday. About 5.5 million residents had received at least one shot of a vaccine as of Wednesday, or about 47% of the population. About 5 million people, or 43% of the population, have completed the process. While the incentive’s success was short-lived, it got Ohioans who either were straddling the line or had no plans to get a shot to make a move, the governor said. As evidence, Jonathan Carlyle of Toledo, an Amazon delivery driver who won the second $1 million prize June 2, said the next day: “When y’all announced the Vax-a-Million, as soon as I heard that, I was like ‘Yes, I need to go do this now.’ ” DeWine continues to urge Ohioans to get vaccines, saying the end of state social distancing requirements, the return to in-person school classes in the fall, and the multiplying of coronavirus variants remain concerns.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Efforts to build a new food distribution warehouse on the property of Ebenezer Baptist Church experienced an unexpected obstacle related to a hot-button, widely misunderstood topic: critical race theory. The Rev. Derrick Scobey said a professional land surveyor entered into a contract with the church but refused to honor it because he disagreed with the preacher’s views on critical race theory. Scobey, who is African American, said Bob Manley, with The Manley Co., agreed to provide land surveying services for the warehouse project, with work to be completed no later than June 14. The minister said staff from Manley’s company came out to the church and did some work, and all the company had left to do was submit the necessary drawings to the church. However, Scobey said Manley, who is white, contacted him to say that he had no plans to finish his part of the project. Scobey said when he asked why, Manley said it was because Scobey was among a group of Black ministers who met with Gov. Kevin Stitt to urge him to veto a measure effectively banning critical race theory from Oklahoma classrooms, a few days before Stitt ultimately signed the measure into law last month. Attempts to reach Manley for comment were unsuccessful.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state’s aviation authority tried to circumnavigate Oregon’s land-use system in adopting a plan to extend the runway at Aurora State Airport, the state’s Court of Appeals determined. The Land Use Board of Appeals’ decision to uphold the aviation board’s plan was flawed because “there is no evidence in the record to support LUBA’s erroneous findings” in the case, the court said in reversing and remanding the body’s decision. The court said the Land Use Board of Appeals “misunderstood its task” and mistakenly relied on testimony from Department of Aviation staff and associated businesses around the airport when making its decision. The airport, located just outside the Aurora city limits, is the third-busiest in Oregon and one of 28 the state owns. For years, the state and associated businesses advocated to extend the runway to 6,004 feet from its current 5,004 feet, arguing it wouldn’t be used for allowing bigger aircraft but would allow the planes that currently use it to fly out with larger fuel loads.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Lawmakers made a final vote Thursday to approve a bill to let parents decide whether to have their children repeat a year of school, a measure designed to help children catch up after a year of schooling disrupted by the pandemic. The Senate voted 50-0 for the proposal, which also would permit students in special education to return for another year, even if they have reached the maximum age of 21. Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf has not taken a stand on the bill, though his office said Thursday that there are concerns about how it might affect schools’ finances, staffing and programming. “We will review the bill when it gets to the desk,” said Wolf press secretary Lyndsay Kensinger. Under the bill, parents would have to decide by July 15 whether their child should repeat a grade. Students could participate in extracurricular activities but would not get another year of eligibility to play sports if they have already maxed out. Students who have reached age 18 would be able to make their own decision about whether to repeat a year. “Some students have struggled, and it makes sense to give parents a stronger say in whether their child should advance to the next grade level or repeat a grade to make up for learning loss,” said the sponsor, Senate President Pro Tempore Jake Corman, R-Centre.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Years of “noes” have culminated in the Legislature saying “yes” to a proposal that would remove lawmakers’ authority over approving who has permission to officiate marriages. Lawmakers gave final approval Tuesday to a proposal that would end the General Assembly’s role in deciding who gets to officiate a wedding in Rhode Island. The bill awaits the signature of Gov. Dan McKee, who has said he supports it. Currently, people who are not either a member of clergy or a judge need special permission from the Legislature before they can perform a wedding in the state. But that can be a time-consuming and confusing process, said those who supported the change. “It is an inconvenience to the people of Rhode Island that they need to seek a formal act of law just because they want a friend or family member to officiate at their wedding,” Senate Majority Leader Michael McCaffrey, who introduced the bill in the Senate, said in a statement. There have been multiple attempts in recent years to amend the law. Supporters of the bill also argued that the current law allowed opponents of gay marriage to deny marriage bills for LGBTQ couples.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nWest Columbia: Gov. Henry McMaster again said the state is recovering better from the COVID-19 pandemic than just about any other as he held a ceremonial signing Thursday of a bill preventing people from suing companies over the coronavirus. The new law protects businesses and other groups as long as they follow guidelines to protect people from the virus. Dozens of other states have passed similar measures. McMaster headed less than 2 miles across the river from his Statehouse office to Cafe Strudel, whose owner praised him and the Legislature for taking steps to reduce his risk from reopening after the worst of the pandemic. The governor again said his decision to resist closing restaurants and other businesses and allow them to reopen more quickly meant South Carolina suffered fewer economic problems. “As a result a lot of other states are struggling to get out of the holes they were in. We’re ready to blast off,” McMaster said Thursday before signing the bill that he initially signed April 28. COVID-19 has killed more than 9,800 people in South Carolina since March 2020. Only about 37% of the population has been fully vaccinated against the disease. After the bill signing, McMaster said he wasn’t worried about the low vaccine rates or new coronavirus variants. “We’re always on alert,” the governor said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: Shipping delays from China and record-breaking sales from last year are having an impact on fireworks supplies this Fourth of July, according to industry experts. Douglas Bellinger, owner of Extreme Fireworks in Rapid City, said a shortage is limiting the amount of products he can sell this year. “It’s quite a shortage on the 24-shot artillery shells and a lot of our littler stuff that we sell,” he told the Rapid City Journal. According to Bellinger, fireworks supplies from China normally take 30 days for shipping, but this year it’s taking 60 days. “There’s also trouble when they hit the docks and yards in California; getting a truck here is taking longer, too,” he said. The fireworks industry was not immune to the coronavirus pandemic that caused closures and staffing problems in the supply chain. “For example, we ordered seven containers and only got two of them, so we are five short,” Bellinger said. “Each container holds 800 to 1,000 cases, so the supply issues are impacting how much we have to sell.” And Bellinger said fireworks have been in high demand since last year when more people celebrated Independence Day at home. “Last year was a great year. They were wanting to get out and were tired of being cooped up,” he said. “It ran the supplies short here and emptied a lot of the warehouses.”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Residents can now search the full records of many state Supreme Court cases through an online database thanks to the Tennessee State Library and Archives. The opinions have long been available electronically, but the associated case files were stored in more than 10,000 boxes in the attic of the Capitol building, according to a news release from the Administrative Office of the Courts. For more than a decade, Library and Archive staff has been cleaning and indexing these records. Today, about 85% of the collection is available online. Court of Appeals Judge Andy Bennett, through his leadership role in the Tennessee Supreme Court Historical Society, helped make the project happen. “You can open up a book and find the opinion, but you don’t have the briefs. You don’t see the arguments. You don’t have the depositions,” Bennett said. “If you really want to go behind the opinion, these documents are great.”\n\nTexas\n\nMcKinney: A grand jury has declined to indict eight jailers over the in-custody death of a Black man after struggling with detention officers. But the Collin County grand jury also issued a rare statement Tuesday calling for the creation of a work group to study the March death of Marvin Scott III to prevent something similar from happening again. “We sincerely hope that the loss of Marvin Scott III will not be in vain,” the statement said. “We are therefore recommending that a work group be convened as soon as practicable to study the events of March 14th for lessons learned in an effort to avoid any similar future tragedy.” The grand jury found no probable cause to charge the eight jailers with a crime in connection with Scott’s death, which was ruled a homicide in April. A medical examiner found that Scott died of “fatal acute stress response” while struggling with officers who were trying to detain him. The medical examiner said Scott was previously diagnosed with schizophrenia, and his family has said Scott was likely in a mental health crisis at the time. Scott was arrested March 14 at an outlet mall in Allen on a charge of possessing less than 2 ounces of marijuana, authorities have said. Allen officers took Scott to a hospital because he was reportedly acting erratically. He was released, and police took him to the county jail, where he was placed on a restraint bed, authorities have said. Deputies used pepper spray and covered Scott’s face with a spit mask, which authorities have said fit over his head. Scott became unresponsive at some point and later was pronounced dead at a hospital.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The city has issued a fireworks ban as drought conditions worsen throughout the state. Mayor Erin Mendenhall said Tuesday that the ban covers fireworks including smoke bombs and sparklers. Mendenhall also issued an open burning ban that prohibits people from starting any fires outside. Utah is experiencing its worst drought in decades. About 90% of the state is in extreme or exceptional drought, the two worst categories. “Our foothills, our open spaces, and even our yards and park strips are dry and could be ignited by a single spark,” Mendenhall, a Democrat, said in a statement. “These conditions present a very real, immediate threat of fire.” Fireworks are banned on all state and unincorporated business lands, but Republican Gov. Spencer Cox has said he does not have the legal authority to enact a statewide ban. It is unclear if state law allows cities to outright ban fireworks, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. Public safety code prevents local governments from prohibiting explosives around July’s Independence Day and Pioneer Day holidays, except “in certain areas with hazardous environmental conditions.” Republican legislative leaders have avoided taking action to ban fireworks statewide and instead have encouraged local governments to implement their own restrictions.\n\nVermont\n\nRutland: The Norman Rockwell Museum of Vermont is planning to close its doors at the end of the year, almost half a century after its opening. The museum recently reopened after being closed for months because of the pandemic. Business has been slow amid the decline in tourism and travel during the past year, the Rutland Herald reports. Co-owner Colleen Schreiber said the museum is trying to sell its retail stock, but there is no definitive closing date for now. Schreiber also cited personal health concerns as a reason for closing the museum. “We’re in our 80s,” Schreiber said. “We have our health issues and nobody to turn it over to.” Currently, the museum owners are trying to find a new home for the art collection in Vermont before the official closing, which Schreiber said will be before the fall. She said the museum had been open for more than 40 years and housed 2,000 of Rockwell’s commercial art works. “It would appear at this time there’s not a market for (the museum), which is a shame because the Norman Rockwell legacy is a Vermont signature,” said Lyle Jepson, executive director of the Chamber & Economic Development for the Rutland Region.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: Three entities have already expressed interest in acquiring two statues of Confederate generals from downtown parks, including one that was the focus of a violent white nationalist rally in 2017, according to city officials. Earlier this month, the City Council voted unanimously to remove the statues of Robert E. Lee and Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson. Virginia requires a 30-day window for the city to offer the statues to any museum, historical society, government or military battlefield. Officials say three entities have submitted statements of interest so far, according to The Daily Progress. City Manager Chip Boyles said at Monday’s council meeting that two of the interested entities are in state and one out of state. The offer expires July 7. Downtown business owner Cali Gaston urged the council to remove the statues as quickly as possible and place them in storage until arrangements can be made. “Please don’t give them to just any organization offering to pay. They need to be in the hands of an organization that is trusted to speak for the whole community,” Gaston said. “One that will help shift the narrative to one that is inclusive and anti-racist.” White supremacist and neo-Nazi organizers of the August 2017 “Unite the Right” rally said they went to the city to defend the statue of Lee. They clashed with counterprotesters before a white supremacist plowed his car into a crowd of people, killing a woman.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A local lawmaker wants to condemn a city-owned park with a large homeless encampment next to a courthouse and declare the area a public safety hazard or nuisance property. Under the proposal by King County Councilman Reagan Dunn, the county would acquire the park from the city of Seattle and request that Executive Dow Constantine relocate the park’s dozens of residents to transitional or permanent housing, provide additional security, and fix damage to the park, The Seattle Times reports. The proposal came after the fatal stabbing June 17 of a 31-year-old man in the park. Seattle police Sgt. Randy Huserik, a spokesperson for the department, said police responded to 100 calls of service at City Hall Park between April 13 and June 20, including assaults, robberies, warrant arrests and public disturbances. “The city of Seattle has no one to blame except for themselves for failing to abate the nuisance and keep that area safe,” Dunn said. “People have the right to a safe county courthouse, and we shouldn’t have to fight this hard for it.” The adjacent King County Courthouse belongs to the county, and taking over City Hall Park would allow it to be policed by the King County Sheriff’s Office instead of the Seattle Police Department, he said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The University of Charleston and Bethany College both say COVID-19 vaccinations will be required for the upcoming academic year at the private schools. University of Charleston President Marty Roth told news outlets that it is the school’s responsibility to provide a healthy environment for the 1,500 students expected at the Charleston campus and 200 at the Beckley campus. The way to do that is to require students to be inoculated, he said. Students at the university won’t have to wear masks, but 3 feet of social distancing will be required in classrooms and public spaces, Roth said. Bethany College’s vaccination requirement was decided by the college’s Pandemic Response Team in accordance with Centers for Disease Control guidance, the school said. “I applaud our community for its commitment to protecting one another, and I believe strongly that our decision to require the vaccine will maximize the Bethany experience even more,” Bethany President Tamara Nichols Rodenberg said in an email announcing the update.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state’s tourism and entertainment businesses, hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, are getting some financial help to recover. Gov. Tony Evers said Thursday that more than $140 million in federal grant money will be available for the lodging industry, movie theaters, live event venues, minor league sports, and other entertainment and tourism businesses. The grants from the federal economic stimulus bill passed by Congress earlier this year will be administered by the Wisconsin Department of Administration and Department of Revenue. “Last year, local venues kept their doors closed to help protect their communities,” DOA Secretary Joel Brennan said. “Now that nearly half of all Wisconsinites have received at least one dose of the vaccine, life is returning to normal. Minor league ball games are welcoming back families, theaters are reopening, and concert venues are booking new shows. These investments will ensure our communities bounce back stronger than before.” The lodging industry will receive $75 million in funding, with $12 million reserved for small businesses that host live events and about $11 million for movie theaters.\n\nWyoming\n\nMoose: The risk of wildfires is growing with more warm, dry weather in Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks. The fire danger in Yellowstone is rated as “high,” and in Grand Teton it’s “very high.” The scale tops out with “extreme” fire risk. The parks aren’t there yet, but more hot and dry weather is in store for the weeks ahead, Grand Teton officials warned Wednesday. Already this year, firefighters in the Grand Teton area have put out 52 unattended or abandoned campfires, up from 18 at this time in 2020, park officals said. They discouraged visitors from having campfires. Those who do should have plenty of water on hand to douse and stir their fires until the fire pit or ring is cool, they said. Fireworks are prohibited in the parks and surrounding areas. Meanwhile, the U.S. Forest Service has begun efforts to control an invasive grass in the area of a massive wildfire last fall in Medicine Bow National Forest, among Wyoming’s biggest wildfires in recent memory. A helicopter began spraying herbicide Monday to reduce cheatgrass in burned areas. Spraying will continue for about two months, forest officials said. Cheatgrass is a nonnative species that can proliferate in disturbed environments and burns readily, destroying sagebrush and other native plants.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/25"}]}

George S. Welch Elementary at Dover Air Force Base, teacher Stephanie Cummings organized the school campaign at the request of Lt. Gen. Bill Welser. Welser was researching the topic and asked if the school would collaborate with him in preparing the application.\n\n“We engaged students in coloring pictures and writing letters to President Biden, highlighting Welch’s achievements and the strong sense of community at our school,” Cummins said. “As Welch has no surviving family, we believed it was fitting for all the students at Maj. George Welch Elementary School to champion and preserve Welch’s legacy.”\n\nThe submission was sent to Sen. Tom Carper’s office in February.\n\nDuring the Welch birthday celebration at the school May 10, Cummings announced that Biden’s staff received the application, but an answer may be three to six months away.\n\n“It’s important that students know the history of who their school is named for,” said Cummings, “and we think he deserves the nation’s highest honor for his heroism during the war.”\n\nMore Dover Air Base events:Delaware's first Tuskegee Airmen Commemoration Day for students interested in military\n\nWhy wasn’t the Medal of Honor awarded?\n\nThe Caesar Rodney School District compiled a biography of Welch with information from the school dedication in 1962, Delaware Today magazine, and “The Army Air Force in World War II, Vol. 1.”\n\nWelch is from Wilmington, attended Friends School and graduated from St. Andrew's School near Middletown. He attended Purdue University, but with the war raging in Europe, he enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Corps and graduated from flying school on Oct. 4, 1940.\n\nDuring the Pearl Harbor attack on Dec. 7, 1941, Welch shot down four Japanese aircraft, and squadron mate Ken Taylor reported that Welch hit at least two more that crashed too far out at sea to be confirmed.\n\nStaff officers in Oahu, Hawaii, recommended Welch for the Congressional Medal of Honor, but it wasn't approved because the U.S. wasn't officially at war with Japan at the time of his actions, and he took off without official orders.\n\nWelch was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the second-highest military decoration for a member of the Army. At the time, the Air Force wasn’t a stand-alone branch of the military.\n\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt honored Welch in ceremonies at the White House in May 1942.\n\nMore than 70 years later in The News Journal on Dec. 8, 2014, Harry Themal wrote an editorial column, “Why a Delaware hero won’t ever win a Medal of Honor.”\n\nThemal recounted how Welch and Taylor raced to their planes when they realized Hawaii was being attacked.\n\n“Gen. Henry H. (Hap) Arnold, chief of the Army Air Corps, thought Welch and Taylor should receive the Medal of Honor. He was apparently rejected for the outrageous reason, that the men acted without direct orders,” Themal wrote.\n\nA group including Sen. Carper appealed to the Army in 2004 and again in 2007, asking for the Medal of Honor for Welch.\n\n“Supporting information was gathered from the Army, Air Force, Delaware Historical and Cultural Affairs and much published material. The key potential source, the National Personal Records Center in St. Louis, turned out to be a stumbling block because in July 1973, fire destroyed up to 18 million Army and Air Force early records of many discharged personnel. They included Welch’s files,” Themal wrote.\n\nThe nomination for the medal was denied. The official explanation was the Army needed \"a copy of the original recommendation to determine if the original board made an error in its decision. Once a decision was made to award the Distinguished Service Cross instead of the Medal of Honor, it was considered an ‘administrative finality,’” Themal wrote.\n\nMore military tributes:Observe Memorial Day in the Delaware city named a top US destination for the holiday\n\nBreaking the sound barrier — was Welch the first?\n\nWelch flew 348 combat missions during WWII and shot down 16 enemy aircraft before a case of malaria ended his tour in the Pacific.\n\nHe went to work with North American Aviation as a test pilot and is credited with being the second person to break the sound barrier on April 26, 1948.\n\nThe first to fly at “mach 1” was Chuck Yeager in Air Force testing of the X-1 jet Oct. 14, 1947.\n\nBut is that the whole story?\n\nOn Oct. 1, 1947, almost two weeks before Yeager’s historic flight, Welch was testing the new XP-86 Sabre jet.\n\nThe biography compiled by the Caesar Rodney School District details how Welch flew the plane to 35,000 feet and then went into a hard dive. He reported a slight wing roll and an odd jump in the airspeed indicator. Some witnesses on the ground reported “a noise like thunder from a clear blue sky.”\n\nIn the book “Aces Wild: The Race for Mach 1,” author Al Blackburn details accounts by some people at the tests who say Welch was the first to break the sound barrier.\n\nNorth American Aviation aerodynamicist Ed Horkey made a speech in 1994 to the F-86 Sabre Pilots Association and said Welch hit mach 1.02 on Oct. 19, 1947. That would still make Welch second to Yeager, but by only five days instead of six months.\n\nPart of the controversy is because many of the records were classified and have been difficult to find.\n\nA journalist at the Smithsonian magazine, Linda Shiner, researched information for a September 2014 story and concluded that all available records show that Yeager was first on Oct. 14, 1947.\n\n\"Between the top secrecy surrounding early supersonic flight and the Air Force’s…record-keeping, it’s still unclear if the J35-powered XP-86 [Welch's plane] got past Mach 1. There is no doubt that the X-1 [Yeager's plane] did,” Shiner wrote.\n\nShe said because of the controversy, U.S. Air Force historian Richard Hallion researched the topic and wrote a letter in 2009 to the president of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots.\n\nHallion said, “I have never seen any record or indication that George Welch … ever publicly claimed in any forum (or, so far as I know, to anyone at all) that he exceeded Mach 1 prior to Chuck Yeager.”\n\nTributes to the hero from Delaware\n\nWelch died while testing a plane for North American Aviation on Oct. 12, 1954. He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nDelaware honored him with a portrait by Peter Hurd that was hung in Legislative Hall.\n\nIn 1962, one of the schools at Dover Air Force Base was dedicated in Welch’s name and is now Maj. George S. Welch Elementary.\n\n“He still deserves the highest military honor our country can award,” Themal wrote.\n\nThe staff and students at the school agree, as they remember the WWII hero and continue to push for him to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor.\n\nThe school’s principal, Jason Payne, said the Medal of Honor is not only a tribute to the sacrifice of military heroes but it also serves as an example for future generations.\n\n“As our school’s namesake, we feel it is important to celebrate both Major George S. Welch’s accomplishments and inspire our students to strive for greatness, as we are housed on Dover Air Force Base,” Payne said.\n\nHe commended Cummings for “a fantastic job” coordinating the observance of Maj. Welch Day and helping to lead the effort to apply for Welch’s medal.\n\n“We are so thankful for all she has done to bring attention to our school’s namesake,” Payne said.\n\nIn addition to the birthday ceremony, the staff and students created a “Hallway of Honor” with information about Welch along with classroom lessons and artwork related to Welch and his accomplishments.\n\nState Sen. Eric Buckson and Rep. Lyndon Yearick attended the ceremony and Yearick read a proclamation from the Legislature, ending with, “May 10th is hereby recognized as Major George S. Welch Day to honor and celebrate his service and life as a Delaware-born American hero.”\n\nReach reporter Ben Mace at rmace@gannett.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/12/26/passages-2013-list/4210837/", "title": "Passages 2013: List of notable deaths", "text": "USATODAY\n\nThis year's Passages, USA TODAY's annual roundup of notable people we lost in 2013, is a rich and often unexpected series of encounters.\n\nBelow, we remember the accomplishments of those who left us this year.\n\nBUSINESS\n\nHerbert M.

The vote was unanimous after protesters packed a council meeting Tuesday night. Many wore stickers declaring that “poverty is not a crime.” One man held a sign saying, “Jesus was a panhandler.” The amendment would’ve criminalized passing money or objects through car windows to someone on a public road. It was tacked onto an ordinance that requires panhandlers be jailed for at least two days. That ordinance still stands. It was unanimously passed in July but has yet to be enforced or signed by Mayor Todd Strange, who’s in the final days of his term. Mayor-elect Steven Reed takes over the office next Tuesday.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Anyone with unpaid parking fines at the University of Alaska Anchorage campus has the option to reduce or cover the cost of their tickets with peanut butter and jelly.

University officials say each person may use PB&J payments for two citations issued within the past 45 days. Officials say two 16-ounce jars offer a $10 credit, three jars offer a $35 credit, and five jars offer a $60 credit. Officials say any unopened commercially produced nut butter – almond, cashew, peanut – or any flavor jam, jelly, marmalade or preserves will be accepted.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: Voters in one of the state’s most liberal cities rejected an initiative Tuesday that would have created the state’s only sanctuary city amid concerns that it went too far in restricting police officers. The measure drew fierce opposition from the mayor and city council, all of them Democrats, who said the initiative risked public safety and millions of dollars the city gets from the state and federal governments. The measure was pushed by activists who wanted to give a voice to Tucson’s Latino community. They said it would have sent the message that immigrants are safe and protected in Tucson at a time when many are fearful of President Donald Trump’s immigration policies. Officials said Tucson police have already adopted rules that go as far as legally possible to restrict officers from enforcing federal immigration laws.\n\nArkansas\n\nHelena-West Helena: The city is shelving a plan to establish a 24-hour curfew in high-crime neighborhoods. Helena-West Helena officials have discussed instituting the measure after three homicides in two days last month. Police Chief James Smith said at the time that he planned to put the issue on the City Council agenda at a meeting Tuesday. But the city is now delaying a decision. Mayor Kevin Smith told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette on Tuesday that one problem with implementing such a plan is the shortage of facilities for holding people who get arrested as a result of increased police activity. Smith said Helena-West Helena will focus on high-crime areas using current laws and will increase officer training. The city already has a curfew for minors.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Police say they recovered $800,000 worth of prints by Scottish abstract expressionist Benjamin Creme after a caller told them they were in their San Fernando home.

Detectives said Tuesday that the caller, who was not identified, told them they were found in a late relative’s storage locker.

During a hearing Tuesday in Grand Junction, U.S. District Judge Marcia Krieger also ordered Thad Bingham never to use or possess a firearm again, including weapons he transferred to his wife. He had faced up to 18 months in prison. The Daily Sentinel reports his lawyer, Ashley Petrey, asked for leniency since he lost his job and won’t be able to hunt again. Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Matt Evans said Bingham has two previous poaching convictions and hasn’t learned his lesson. He said Bingham has more than $1 million in assets, enabling him to pay a high fine.\n\nConnecticut\n\nEnfield: A group of prisoners is learning to cope with issues such as post-traumatic stress by interacting with horses.

Elliot is one of six inmates participating in the pilot program, which Correction Commissioner Rollin Cook says he hopes to expand to other prisons.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A controversial “blight bill” has suffered another setback in the City Council despite a twist designed to appease critics. With the measure beset for three years by opposition from homeowner, landlord and tenant advocates, council members on Thursday again planned to compromise on the legislation intended to crack down on the owners of vacant and blighted properties. Again, the attempt appeared to fail. The bill passed a committee this week but was pulled from the City Council agenda Wednesday morning. Bill sponsor Bud Freel did not immediately respond to a request for comment. After making concessions to homeowners but still facing pushback from other property owners, Freel had planned to push for a vote Thursday – this time with a provision that the changes would be temporary.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Most of the D.C. Council is asking Councilman Jack Evans to resign after a third party released its investigation into allegations of ethics violations. News outlets report the council-hired law firm O’Melveny & Myers publicly released its investigation into Evans this week, saying he violated the council’s ethics rules 11 times since 2014. It says he repeatedly used his office to benefit private clients who paid him hundreds of thousands of dollars, payments that he failed to disclose or recognize as conflicts of interest. Such allegations also are under investigation by federal authorities and have already cost Evans his role as chair of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority board. Evans’ attorneys released a 67-page rebuttal Tuesday saying the law firm’s report is flawed and misunderstands council ethics rules.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Tourist haven Key West wants to protect coral reefs that attract divers, so it’s banning sunscreens that contain chemicals that could harm them. But state lawmakers who think it’s more important to protect humans are moving toward outlawing the island’s sunscreen ban and making sure no other local governments impose similar ordinances. The battle pits local governments against state government and environmentalists against dermatologists in an argument about coral bleaching and skin cancer. A bill sponsored by Sen. Rob Bradley has been approved in two committees and has one more stop before reaching the full state Senate. An identical House bill was set to make the first of three committee stops Wednesday. The sale of sunscreens containing oxybenzone or octinoxate in Key West will be illegal starting in 2021.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Gov. Brian Kemp released a plan Monday to expand Medicaid to the state’s poorest able-bodied adults, on the condition that they work, volunteer, receive job training or attend school. Under Kemp’s proposal, which is more limited than efforts in other states, uninsured adults in Georgia who make no more than the federal poverty level would qualify for Medicaid assistance if they spent at least 80 hours a month working, volunteering, training or studying. They would also have to pay monthly premiums. The federal poverty level is just under $12,500 for an individual. The governor’s office called the approach a “conservative reform” that reflects the state’s values as a place that “honors work” and “champions individual responsibility.” It would require approval from the Trump administration.\n\nHawaii\n\nLihue: The U.S. Air Force has approved a naval facility and airport as the preferred alternative site for a technical squadron tasked with monitoring satellites in support of the national security space mission. The Garden Island reports the Space Control Squadron would operate out of the Barking Sands Pacific Missile Range Facility in western Kauai. Officials say the squadron would ensure that military and other national security agencies have access to satellite communication, intelligence and key information. Officials say the unit is also expected to bring more federal funds and jobs to the state supporting 88 new Hawaii Air National Guard positions. Federal officials say the basing process is expected to be completed by 2020, with the unit becoming partially operational by 2021 and fully operational by 2022.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A giant forest project in the state that was rejected by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is on again, and an environmental group says it violates the court’s orders and vows it will stop it with another lawsuit. The U.S. Forest Service on Friday approved the 125-square-mile project on the Payette National Forest, with work expected to start this week. The Forest Service and the Alliance for the Wild Rockies agree the project is precisely the same as the one halted by the 9th Circuit Court’s ruling against the Forest Service in August 2018. But the Forest Service says changes in wording in an environmental review remove problems that caused the court to stop the project, and the Forest Service’s new approval decision Friday allows work to begin immediately.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The state is receiving federal money to help build infrastructure for alternative-fuel vehicles along Interstate 80. The Illinois Department of Transportation says the grant is part of an effort to create an alternative-fuel corridor that supports electric vehicles and vehicles that run on natural gas. It will span six states, from New Jersey to the Iowa-Nebraska border. The $70,000 in federal funds will be combined with $10,000 each from Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The money will be used to identify gaps along Interstate 80 where fueling and charging facilities aren’t available and to provide those options. Omer Osman, acting secretary of IDOT, says that “these improvements will help make interstate travel on alternative fuel a reality” and make travel more environmentally friendly.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state will be home to the nation’s newest National Guard cyber battalion. State officials say the 127th Cyber Battalion will be composed of about 100 soldiers who will be trained in cybersecurity and cyber warfare at the Muscatatuck Urban Training Center, about 75 miles southeast of Indianapolis. Army National Guard officials say they chose Indiana’s force for its existing cyber capabilities, partnerships with industry and academia, and the ability to recruit and retain soldiers. Gov. Eric Holcomb says the state is a “natural fit” for the first cyber battalion in the Midwest. The battalion is expected to be fully operational by 2022. There are four other cyber battalions in the country: two in Virginia, one in South Carolina and another in Massachusetts.\n\nIowa\n\nNewton: Joy, the American Mini Spokes-Pig for the Capitol II Theatre, has been recognized for her talents by Guinness World Records. In the 2020 edition of the famous record book, Joy was officially named the fastest trick porker in the universe. Her feat, overseen by two judges – Newton’s mayor and the city’s chief of police – was successfully completing 13 tricks, each initiated by a different command, in under a minute. A ham in more ways than one, Joy is a local celebrity and performer with her own dressing room at the theater – a peek-a-boo window lets visitors steal a gander of her from the street. And Joy is always red-carpet ready, of course, complete with painted toenails and her favorite dress, a resplendent taffeta number emblazoned with cartoon popcorn buckets (her favorite food).\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The acting secretary of the state Department of Corrections said during his confirmation hearing that a mass commutation of offenders was worth considering. The Wichita Eagle reports Jeff Zmuda was asked to comment Tuesday on what happened one day earlier, when more than 450 inmates walked out the doors of prisons across Oklahoma as part of a massive commutation. Zmuda said Kansas officials are looking at several ways to make reforms and ease overcrowding, and “that’s certainly one that could be considered.” Senate Majority Leader Jim Denning said releasing nonviolent inmates “sounds like a fantastic idea” but cautioned that if someone who has been released early commits a violent act, “there’s hell to pay.” The hearing ended with a Senate committee recommending that Zmuda be confirmed. The full Senate will vote early next year.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: State Senate President Robert Stivers threw another wrench into a razor-thin gubernatorial outcome late Tuesday night, saying the Legislature could decide the race. Stivers’ comments came shortly after Gov. Matt Bevin refused to concede to Attorney General Andy Beshear, who led by roughly 5,100 votes when all the precincts were counted. Stivers, R-Manchester, said based on his staff’s research, the decision could come before the GOP-controlled Legislature. Under state law, Bevin has 30 days to formally contest the outcome once it is certified by the State Board of Elections. Candidates typically ask for a recanvass of voting machines and a recount first. The last contested governor’s race was the 1899 election of Democrat William Goebel. Stivers said he believes most of the votes that went to Libertarian John Hicks, who received about 2% of the total vote, would have gone to Bevin and made him the clear winner.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Three months after medical marijuana became available in the state, doctors and clinics say some patients are finding the cost for therapeutic cannabis too high for treatment, pricing them out of a medication they waited years to obtain. Nine pharmacies dispense medicinal-grade pot and set their individual prices. Dispensary owners say their charges reflect an industry with startup charges, small patient numbers and lengthy regulatory hurdles to meet. In August, Louisiana became the first Deep South state to dispense medical marijuana, four years after state lawmakers agreed to give patients access. Kathryn Thomas, CEO of The Healing Clinics, says a third of the medical marijuana patients across its five clinics in Shreveport, Monroe, Baton Rouge, Houma and Lafayette can’t foot the bill for the product.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: It’s almost safe to be a turkey in Maine again. The Pine Tree State’s fall wild turkey season ends for the year Thursday. The fall turkey hunt is the longer of the state’s two turkey hunts, with a more restricted season taking place every spring. Wild turkeys are popular game birds, and the state uses the hunt to control their population. The animals were once rare in Maine but are now so common that they sometimes cause traffic accidents and other hazards. Hunters are allowed to take up to five wild turkeys of either sex in some parts of the state. However, parts of far northern Maine are closed to turkey hunting.\n\nMaryland\n\nRockville: Departments and agencies in Montgomery County are embarking on a campaign to make residents aware of the added challenges of the switch to standard time. The approximately 20 planned “Be Safe, Be Seen” events, the first of which was held Wednesday at the Shady Grove Metro Station, are aimed at both adults and children. The campaign will distribute safety literature, reflective stickers, and items that will remind people to avoid distractions and maximize safe behaviors and visibility, especially in darkness. A 2016 study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration showed that 26% of all pedestrian deaths occurred between 6 p.m. and 8:59 p.m. Because peak evening commuting times in fall and winter occur during periods of increased darkness, danger is increased.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: First lady Melania Trump on Wednesday visited a hospital that uses cuddling to help infants born dependent on drugs or alcohol. She met with caregivers and administrators at Boston Medical Center and told them she’s “very focused” on their pioneering work with babies born with neonatal abstinence syndrome. “I hope today’s visit helps shine a light on programs like yours,” she said, joined by Alex Azar, secretary of health and human services. Outside, as many as 200 workers at the hospital gathered to protest the visit, condemning the tough immigration policies of President Donald Trump’s administration that they say discourage immigrants from getting health care. Some wore white hospital jackets with the slogan “We really do care, do you?” on the backs. Others carried signs that read, “BMC cares for all patients.”\n\nMichigan\n\nTraverse City: A new forecast says Great Lakes levels are likely to remain unusually high and may set additional records. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers office in Detroit on Monday released its outlook for the next six months. Hydrologist Keith Kompoltowicz says a wet October interrupted the usual fall drop-off of water levels. Storms over Lakes Michigan, Huron and Superior caused beach erosion, flooding, and damage to seawalls and roads. Kompoltowicz says all five Great Lakes are expected to resume their seasonal decline. But they’ll remain well above normal and will be higher in January than they were at the beginning of this record-setting year. He says Huron and Michigan are likely to set monthly records in February, while Superior will come close. Kompoltowicz says a lengthy dry spell would be required to reverse the trend.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Winter anglers on Mille Lacs Lake will be allowed to keep one walleye this winter for the fourth season in a row. The Department of Natural Resources announced winter regulations for Mille Lacs on Monday. Similar to last winter, anglers can keep one walleye starting Dec. 1 if it’s between 21 and 23 inches, or over 28. DNR Commissioner Sarah Strommen says there’s evidence the state’s conservative approach to managing the popular lake is paying off. A fall assessment found the Mille Lacs walleye population has remained relatively stable over the past three years, having rebounded from lows seen from 2012 through 2016. Fisheries chief Brad Parsons says they expect the walleye bite on Mille Lacs to be quite good this winter, which will likely result in a high harvest.\n\nMississippi\n\nPascagoula: A new historical marker is honoring the oldest continuously operating African American church in the state. Members of St. Peter Baptist Church in Pascagoula gathered Saturday to celebrate the unveiling of a marker that was placed by the Mississippi Department of Archives and History. The coastal church was founded in 1819 by a freed slave named Dudley Brooks. It originally was called First Free Mission Baptist Church. Pastor William H. Marshall tells WLOX-TV that he’s pleased the congregation is being recognized by the state. Congregants buried a time capsule with church programs and other items. The plan is to dig it up in 20 years.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Voters on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved removing Dr. Martin Luther King’s name from one of the city’s most historic boulevards, less than a year after the City Council decided to rename the Paseo for the civil rights icon. Unofficial results showed the proposal to remove King’s name received nearly 70% of the vote, with just over 30% voting to retain King’s name. The city had been one of the largest in the country without a street named for him. But a group of residents intent on keeping the Paseo name began collecting petitions to put the name change on the ballot and achieved that goal in April. The campaign has been divisive. Emotions reached a peak Sunday, when members of the “Save the Paseo” group staged a silent protest at a get-out-the-vote rally at a black church.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: The speed limit on a deadly stretch of U.S. 212 in southeast Montana has been reduced to 65 mph. The Billings Gazette reports the Montana Department of Transportation lowered the speed limit Oct. 1 on the highway’s corridor that passes through both the Crow and Northern Cheyenne Reservations and four counties: Big Horn, Rosebud, Powder River and Carter. The stretch merges with Interstate 90 at the Bighorn Battlefield interchange and travels 167 miles east to the Montana-Wyoming state line. MDOT Traffic and Safety Bureau chief Gabe Priebe says statistics show the stretch is the deadliest highway in Montana.\n\nNebraska\n\nBellevue: Speakers at a public hearing have criticized a proposal that could lead to the firing of elected officials in this Omaha suburb for leaking information from closed meetings. The first proposal says dissemination of information from closed sessions by an elected official could result in an “allegation of misconduct.” The second proposal says a finding of misconduct could result in that official’s removal from office. Former Bellevue Councilman Jim Moudry said at Tuesday night’s hearing that he was troubled by the notion the city would be able to decide what behaviors constitute misconduct. Councilman Chuck Fredrick and other said such decisions belong to voters. Councilwoman Kathy Welch backed the proposals, saying the city holds employees to high standards when conducting city business, so it should be no different for elected officials.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Despite protests about a “war on the poor,” city officials passed a law Wednesday making it illegal for the homeless to sleep on streets when beds are available at established shelters. The issue spurred emotion and drama, including the ejection by city marshals of several audience members whom Mayor Carolyn Goodman deemed disruptive during a daylong City Council meeting that drew dozens of time-limited comments. Most people spoke against the law before the 5-2 council vote. The measure will apply to the city’s downtown urban core, not the tourist-heavy Las Vegas Strip, which is overseen by a different jurisdiction. Goodman, the sponsor of the measure, called it imperfect but necessary to deal with what officials and downtown business owners characterize as a homeless crisis.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The Division of Historical Resources has added eight properties to its historic register, including five from Litchfield’s town center. The buildings along Route 3A include the Gothic Revival Litchfield Presbyterian Church; the Greek Revival Town Hall; the Tudor Revival Aaron Cutler Memorial Library; the Colonial Revival Griffin Memorial School; and the Litchfield Fire Station. The church and town hall go back to the mid-1800s. Other properties include the George Burrell residence in Keene, an 1853 predominantly brick Italianate-style house; the Willing Workers Hall in Warren, a social hall built in 1815; and Westmoreland’s Federal-style Brick Church, built in 1838.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJersey City: The mayor is denying he engaged in prohibited campaigning during voting on hotly contested measures restricting Airbnb and other short-term rental companies. A short video posted online Tuesday shows Mayor Steven Fulop speaking to someone inside a polling place near a voting booth. The conversation isn’t entirely intelligible, but Fulop can be heard saying, ‘So vote ‘yes.’ ” At a news conference Wednesday, Fulop said he was thanking poll workers and didn’t approach anyone or hand out literature. State law bans soliciting support or distributing literature within 100 feet of a polling place. A spokesman for Keep Our Homes, an organization opposed to the measures, said in an email that Fulop’s actions showed “a shocking disregard for the law.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Presbyterian Healthcare Services and the University of New Mexico are teaming to lure nurses into some of the state’s most rural areas. The Albuquerque Journal reports the two health care organizations recently collaborated to land a $3.2 million grant to develop a residency program for nurse practitioners in 10 New Mexico cities and towns. The four-year grant from the national Health Resources and Services Administration will help nurses and midwives relocate and stay in remote areas. Officials say the program also will focus on mental health. Presbyterian Director of Clinical Education and Professional Development Johanna Stiesmeyer says New Mexico’s rural counties have a wide nurse-to-resident ratio. The first group of nurses and midwives will be selected in the first half of 2020.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: President Donald Trump isn’t a fan of the state’s new bail reform law, which will curtail the number of people jailed while awaiting trial. The president tweeted Tuesday that New York’s Democratic governor and mayor “are letting out 900 Criminals, some hardened & bad onto the sidewalks of our rapidly declining” city. That was a reference to estimates from New York City’s corrections officials on the number of prisoners who might be eligible for release under the new law. Gov. Andrew Cuomo punched back, saying Trump gave up his right to call New York home when he recently claimed Florida residency. The state’s law was passed to address complaints that poor people accused of minor crimes were often jailed for long periods because they couldn’t afford to post bail.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nKnightdale: An assistant high school football coach has resigned after making racist comments on Instagram. News outlets report John Hoskins resigned over the weekend from his post at Knightdale High School. WTVD-TV reports Hoskins, who is white, posted a now-deleted video to Instagram in which he said “white power” and the n-word. Hoskins told the station Tuesday that “just to set the record, I’m not a racist.” He says his black friends have given him the OK to use the word, as have players on the majority-black team that he coached. He says he posted the video and used the slur while caught up in celebrating the team’s win against Corinth Holders High last week. The video was shared with administrators before Hoskins deleted it.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum is urging U.S. Customs and Border Protection not to cut hours of operation at three entry ports on the North Dakota-Canadian border. Border Protection has proposed moving back the closing time at the Maida and Carbury crossings from 10 p.m. to 7 p.m. and the Antler crossing from 10 p.m. to 5 p.m. In a letter to the CBP, Burgum noted all three ports experienced an increase in automobile and truck crossings in fiscal year 2018. Burgum says he’s concerned reducing the hours of operation will have a negative impact on tourism, movement of goods and local economies. The agency says that it wants to use its resources at the busiest locations and that there are low numbers of crossings during the times it plans to cut.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Voters have approved nearly three-quarters of the public school district tax issues that were on ballots across the state for Tuesday’s election. The Ohio School Boards Association says unofficial results show voters passed 113 of the 154 school tax issues on the ballot, or 73%. The association says just over half of the proposals were renewals, and all but a few of those 82 renewal measures were approved. There was less support for new school tax issues, as only 35 of those 72 issues were passed. The votes come as state lawmakers are considering a possible overhaul of how Ohio schools are funded with a mix of state and local dollars. Ohio’s school-funding system has become a complicated patchwork since the system was found unconstitutional in 1997.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state Supreme Court has temporarily blocked a ban on a second-trimester abortion procedure. The high court acted Monday after an abortion clinic appealed a lower court judge’s decision to uphold a ban on a second-trimester abortion procedure. The Tulsa Women’s Reproductive Clinic requested the temporary injunction to put the law on hold, telling justices the law would be detrimental for women. The 2015 law would restrict the use of instruments in dilation and evacuation abortions after 14 weeks of pregnancy, except when needed to save the woman’s life or prevent a serious risk to her health. It had been on hold while the legal challenge was pending. State numbers show nearly 7% of about 5,000 abortions performed in Oklahoma in 2018 were performed using this method.\n\nOregon\n\nEugene: A year ago a California group rejected more than 2,000 tons of wine grapes grown in Southern Oregon for supposed smoke taint from wildfire impact in the region, representing a $4 million dollar collective loss for more than 15 grape growers in the Rogue Valley. This year, a collective of Willamette Valley winemakers is being recognized with a national award for what they did next. The wineries quickly made arrangements to bring some of the fruit north. Based on lab results from each lot, they believed the grapes had been rejected without cause. They labeled their collaborative wines Oregon Solidarity Wines and pledged proceeds from their sale back to the grape growers. Wine Enthusiast Magazine has awarded Oregon Solidarity with a 2019 Wine Star Award for Innovator of the Year.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Democrats completed an electoral sweep of the metro area’s four suburban counties, long a bastion of Republican control and a crucial bellwether for statewide candidates. Democrats won control in Delaware and Chester counties in Tuesday’s election for the first time going back to the Civil War and won control in Bucks County for the first time since the 1980s. Democrats took control of Montgomery County several years ago. The fast-growing counties now account for more than 1 in 5 of all registered voters, and they tend to vote in higher proportions than the rest of the state. The Democratic victories in Delaware and Chester counties were particularly strong, winning every countywide race. For three decades, the counties had been growing increasingly liberal, but the trend seems to have accelerated since Donald Trump’s election as president.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: An analysis of the city’s electronic bike and scooter share shows users took nearly 170,000 scooter rides and more than 280,000 bike rides in the first year of the programs. The city report also contains information on average trips and areas where the devices were most popular. City councilmember Jo-Ann Ryan requested the analysis about three months ago and tells the Providence Journal the six-page report downplays public safety concerns and is missing information on routes, accident data and public input. Ryan says a comprehensive report is needed to inform future policies and prevent some of the issues that have cropped up. Providence announced in August that it was temporarily pulling the electronic bikes operated by the company JUMP over concerns of their misuse.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: After two decades of decline, the state’s infant mortality rate has inched up, largely due to an increase in birth defects and premature births, state health officials said Wednesday. The state’s infant mortality rate declined 30% since 1999 but increased from 6.5 deaths to 7.2 per 1,000 births between 2017 to 2018, a 10.8% increase, said Kimberly Seals, director of the Department of Health and Environmental Control’s Bureau of Maternal and Child Health. During that time, infant deaths related to birth defects increased from 64 to 82, or 28%, she said. And the number of deaths related to prematurity or low birthweight increased from 52 to 58, or 11%, she said. In addition, Seals said, the infant mortality rate was 2.2 times higher among minorities.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem has reiterated her opposition to legalizing industrial hemp production, even in the face of new federal rules allowing the cash crop. Hemp is seen as a possible boon by many farmers, but Noem said in a statement Tuesday that legalizing it would hamper enforcement of marijuana laws. But the governor also says South Dakota will allow the crop to be transported across the state. Last month, police arrested a Colorado man for carrying large bags of what he claims was hemp in his SUV. The U.S. Department of Agriculture released a new regulatory framework for hemp production last week, saying it will provide new economic opportunities for farmers and pave the way for new products and markets.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: To help alleviate issues with driver’s license facilities, the state Department of Safety and Homeland Security is looking to hire 80 employees, expand hours of operation, consider outsourcing some operations and implement recommendations from a more than decade-old study. That’s what the agency’s top official, Commissioner Jeff Long, told Gov. Bill Lee and his administration Wednesday while outlining the department’s budgetary needs for the upcoming fiscal year. Although it oversees the Tennessee Highway Patrol, homeland security and the safety of residents in the Volunteer State, the agency has received a considerable amount of attention for continued issues regarding the issuance of driver’s licenses. With 44 official driver’s license facilities throughout the state, the agency has faced frustration over long wait times and technology crashes.\n\nTexas\n\nKilleen: Family members of the 13 people killed in a mass shooting at the Fort Hood military base have marked the 10th anniversary of the attack. A ceremony was held Tuesday at Fort Hood in Killeen to remember the victims of the Nov. 5, 2009, attack. Thirteen people were killed and more than 30 others injured when then-U.S. Army Maj. Nidal Hasan opened fire at the base. Hasan was sentenced to death for the killings. But the Killeen Daily Herald reports many of the victims’ families expressed frustration that no execution date has been set for Hasan, who is among four soldiers on military death row.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The University of Utah says a new mental health institute funded by a $150 million donation from the influential Huntsman family will focus on researching the genetic causes of mental illnesses and provide more treatment to college students and rural residents. The university said in a news release Monday that the Huntsman Mental Health Institute will aim to provided research-based treatment. The donation will also help fund the University of Utah Health’s psychiatry department. The Huntsmans already have a major cancer research center in Utah that bears the family name. The late Jon Huntsman Sr. was the founder of a company that refines raw materials that go into thousands of products. One of his sons, Peter Huntsman, says he hopes the institute help change the stigma and misperceptions about mental health.\n\nVermont\n\nSt. Johnsbury: A church will begin hosting a morning “warming center” for the winter season. The United Community Church in St. Johnsbury announced its “warming center” will be open seven days a week beginning Nov. 15, the same day the overnight warming shelter opens. The church’s effort to house an overnight shelter was met with opposition from St. Johnsbury Select Board members in 2015. The board had added language to the town’s bylaws forbidding shelters outside the health services zone. The Caledonian Record reports the decision to host the warming program follows a five-month pilot program last year. The community organizers say the morning center is open to anyone in the community. The center will operate from 7:30 a.m. to noon Monday through Sunday.\n\nVirginia\n\nNewport News: A Democratic candidate who lost a random drawing that determined control of the state House of Delegates nearly two years ago easily won a rematch against her Republican opponent. Shelly Simonds defeated four-term Del. David Yancey handily Tuesday in a race for the 94th District in Newport News. The close 2017 race between the two went to a recount, then to court. Eventually, officials used the luck of the draw, placing the name of each candidate on a piece of paper and each piece of paper in a separate film canister. The canisters were put into a cobalt blue-and-white ceramic bowl made by a local artist and stirred around. The canister containing Yancey’s name was drawn, giving him the win. On Tuesday, Simonds won nearly 58% of the vote. Yancey won about 40%.\n\nWashington\n\nKennewick: The City Council has repealed its decade-old rules governing dangerous dogs after a new state law weakened breed-specific regulations. The Tri-City Herald reports the Legislature passed a state law requiring cities with breed-specific legislation to exempt dogs that can be certified as good canine citizens by the American Kennel Club or other organizations. Kennewick City Council voted Tuesday to get rid of its former regulations instead of adopting rules exempting well-mannered dogs. Officials say Kennewick first adopted breed-specific regulations after increased reports about injuries inflicted by dangerous dogs like pit bulls. Advocates and pit bull owners say regulations included having special licenses and muzzling dogs in public. Officials say the rules do not exempt owners from liability if their pets attack.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: West Virginia American Water has awarded grants to provide bottle-filling stations to 10 groups throughout the utility’s service area. The company says in a statement that the program is aimed at reducing plastic waste from single-use bottles and providing filling stations to nonprofit groups, schools and local government facilities. Among the groups that were selected from more than 90 applications are the AD Lewis Community Center in Huntington and Salt Rock Elementary School in Cabell County; the Fayette County Public Library in Oak Hill; the Putnam County Public Library in Hurricane; and Lewis County High School and the Lewis County Park in Weston. Other groups involved include Mercer Elementary School in Princeton and CAMC Women and Children’s Hospital, the West Virginia Capitol Complex and Flinn Elementary School, all in Charleston.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: State legislators struggled Wednesday with a bill that would force schools to teach cursive writing, questioning whether they should make teachers spend time and money preserving the centuries-old style in today’s computerized world. Republican Rep. Jeremy Thiesfeldt, a former teacher, introduced the bill in September that would require schools receiving state dollars to include cursive in their elementary curriculum, with the goal of having students write legibly in cursive by the end of fifth grade. Thiesfeldt’s bill wouldn’t come cheap, at least according to state education officials, but he tried to make a case for the measure during a public hearing in front of the Assembly’s state affairs committee Wednesday afternoon. He said studies have shown writing in cursive fosters neurological connections in students’ brains, improves retention and can help dyslexic children read because cursive letters are more distinctive than printed letters.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The Wyoming Association of Broadcasters says it will push state lawmakers to pass a media shield law. Wyoming is the only state in the nation without legal protections for journalists who refuse to provide the names of confidential sources to law enforcement officers. Such laws can encourage whistleblowers to report wrongdoing without fear of retaliation. Wyoming Association of Broadcasters lobbyist Laura Grott says the state lacks a shield law not because of opposition but because of a lack of effort by Wyoming media. The broadcast journalist group unveiled the proposal at a recent meeting of the Legislature’s Joint Judiciary Committee. The Casper Star-Tribune reports the Wyoming Press Association has largely resisted a media shield law. The newspaper organization argues existing First Amendment protections are enough for the press and their sources.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/07"}]}

The median home price is projected to increase for a third month in a row in April to $393,300, which is 2% lower than the previous April’s median price of $401,700, according to data released in May by the National Association of Realtors (NAR).\n\nOne big factor behind the strengthening home prices and the decrease in sales volume -- down 23% in April from a year ago -- is the lack of housing inventory.\n\n“Home sales are bouncing back and forth but remain above recent cyclical lows,” says NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “The combination of job gains, limited inventory and fluctuating mortgage rates over the last several months have created an environment of push-pull housing demand.”\n\nLearn more: Best personal loans\n\nHousing:Is the housing market going to crash? What experts say about the possibility in 2023.\n\nNew construction:The great housing inventory divide: New construction vs existing-homes\n\nWhere are home prices headed?\n\nGenerally speaking, high mortgage rates should prompt house prices to trend downward.\n\n“Yet, housing supply remains so restricted, that any uptick in demand will put upward pressure on prices,” wrote First American Chief economist Mark Fleming in a blogpost. “This is the dynamic that played out in March, as the spring home-buying season ushered in more demand for homes, while insufficient supply prompted buyers to compete and bid up prices.”\n\nAffordability trends in the coming months will depend on mortgage rates and the supply and demand dynamics fueling nominal house price appreciation – dynamics that will play out differently in each market.\n\n“Real estate affordability is local, too,” says Fleming.With median home prices for both existing and new homes above $380,000, and elevated mortgage rates, home buyers are in a tough spot, says Jeff Taylor, founder, Mphasis Digital Risk.\n\n\"With 5% down and 7% rates and $600 in non-housing debt, borrowers qualify for these purchase prices if they make above $100,000,\" Taylor told USA TODAY. \"We've seen that buyers are more likely to act when income required to qualify drops below $100k. We need rates in the lower-6% range for this to happen.\"Taylor expects rates to drop and for inflation to wane this fall.\n\n\"So homebuyers shouldn't be discouraged,\" he says. \"Instead, they should get pre-approved by lenders now, and those pre-approvals will only look more attractive as rates drop.\"\n\nNo return to typical seasonality in the market\n\nThere will be a lot of uncertainty in the economy over the next few months and prospective home buyers are going to be more opportunistic, as opposed to following traditional seasonal market trends, says Bright MLS Chief Economist, Lisa Sturtevant.\n\n“There will continue to be volatility in mortgage rates as we wait to see what the Fed will do at its upcoming meetings and as we watch economic data roll in over the summer,” says Sturtevant. “Prospective buyers are going to be watching rates closely, and many will try to make an offer on a home when they see rates dip. As a result, we should expect less seasonality this year than we had prior to the pandemic.”\n\nMore sellers returning to the market\n\nWhile inventory will remain low this year, we should expect to see more sellers who had been on the sidelines list their home for sale this summer and into the fall, says Sturtevant.\n\nMany existing homeowners have been “locked in” with super low mortgage rates, which has discouraged discretionary moves.\n\n“However, some people have to move, and others will decide to move for a bigger or smaller home, or to change jobs or neighborhoods, despite rates remaining elevated,” says Sturtevant.\n\nThe uptick in new home construction has provided more opportunities for move-up buyers who may have been staying in place because they did not have anywhere to move to.\n\n“One thing that could shut down new listings is if we see a sharp spike in mortgage rates to 8 or 9%, a situation that is still unlikely but not out of the realm of possibilities,” she says.\n\nNew home construction\n\nInstability of regional banks is a concern for builder and land developer financing going forward, says Robert Dietz, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders.\n\nLending conditions for builders have tightened, and the interest rate for development and construction loans is now well above 10%, which threatens housing supply.\n\nSingle-family spec home building loans had an effective rate of 13% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 9% in the first quarter of 2018.\n\n“Our expectation is that the rate of these loans will move lower as the Fed cuts the federal funds rate, but our forecast is that will not happen until later in 2024,” Dietz told USA TODAY. “As a result, land development would be suppressed, and we risk loaning low on lots during a home building rebound in 2024. Lot development can take three years in a typical market.”\n\nSwapna Venugopal Ramaswamy is a housing and economy correspondent for USA TODAY.

A year later, that number dropped nearly 34% to under 5,500 homes. Only two of the state’s 24 jurisdictions recorded year-over-year growth in home sales: Dorchester and Queen Anne’s counties both on the Eastern Shore.\n\nAdditionally, the average of price of a home has also increased from April of last year. The 2022 price of $464,078 rose 1.7% to $467,986 this year. The median home price increased about twice that difference during the same period, from $390,000 in April 2022 to $396,500 in 2023.\n\n“With this persistent pattern of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates, there’s a lot of reluctance right now to move,” said Suzanne McCoskey, an associate professor of economics at Frostburg State University.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has raised interest rates seven times in recent years in an attempt to cool inflation. McCoskey said the rate increases keep people in their homes as opposed to moving, and risking having to pay a higher mortgage rate.\n\nMore:There's a housing crisis in Maryland. Here's how lawmakers might fix it\n\nSalisbury market and the state: a comparison\n\nMichael Weisner, president of Weisner Real Estate based in Salisbury, provided another potential reason for the increase in housing prices — a rise in construction costs.\n\n“The cost of construction and renovation has gone up significantly in the last three years,” said Weisner, whose grandfather started the company in 1938. “Labor and materials have skyrocketed, and that forces up the price of housing across the board.”\n\nIn Wicomico County, where Salisbury is the county seat, the average price of a home was $282,299 in April of this year, compared to $277,377 in April of last year. There were under 100 listings in the county compared to 123 a year ago. The Lower Shore counties of Somerset and Worcester also saw prices rise and listings dip, too.\n\n“Salisbury’s very similar with the rest of the state,” Weisner said. “The units sold is down, and the number of listings is down as well.”\n\nStatewide, there were over 10,000 listings in April of last year. This year, only a little more than 6,500 listings were made.\n\nWeisner said rental properties continue to come on the market in Salisbury. The city, which is home to Salisbury University, has one of the highest rates of renters in the state. Hagerstown and Laurel also have rates of renters, above 50%, according to U.S. Census data.\n\nMore:Salisbury completes homeless housing village to 'change and save lives'\n\n'Demand for housing remains high in Washington County,' Realtor says\n\nIn Western Maryland’s Washington County, the squeeze for a home still stays post-pandemic, according to Molly King, president of the Hagerstown-headquartered Pen-Mar Realtors.\n\n“Demand for housing remains high in Washington County,” King said. “Overall, we’ve seen sales drop this past month, when compared year-over-year.”\n\nIn April 2022, nearly 200 homes were sold in the state’s third-most western jurisdiction. This year, only 103. There are about 50 fewer listed homes in Washington County in April of this year as compared to last.\n\n“About 30% of all (Washington County) properties listed are new construction,” said King, a realtor with Coldwell Banker Innovations. “Demand for both used and new build housing inventory remain high.”\n\nThe price of a home remains high too, with Washington County being only one of three counties with a double-digit rate of increase in median sales price, year-over-year. The median price of $279,900 rose to $315,000 in April, a 12.5% change. Kent and Queen Anne’s counties, on the Eastern Shore, were the only other jurisdictions with a greater rate jump in median sales.\n\nMore:Ready to buy or sell? Monthly home sales rise 28% in Delaware\n\nA racial gap in the rates of home ownership\n\nWhile home prices remain steady, so too does a racial gap in homeownership and home values. A December report prepared for the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development showed nearly 79% of white households as homeowners, while only 55% of Hispanic households and about 53% of Black households owned a home.\n\nMcCoskey, the Frostburg professor of economics, also sees a “generational gap” between older individuals and younger ones like her students when it comes to homeownership. The younger generation, she said, feels priced out of and struggles to gain access to the market that has been one of the most important sources of wealth for American families over the years.\n\nPerhaps even more concerning, a Brookings Institution report showed that homes of similar quality in neighborhoods with similar amenities are worth 23% less ($48,000 per home, on average, nationwide) in majority Black neighborhoods, compared to a neighborhood with very few or no Black residents.\n\nIn the Salisbury-area, that difference was calculated by Brookings to be an 11% difference between homes in majority Black neighborhoods and those that are not, equating to a $17,236 difference in value.\n\nThe issue of sustainability, McCoskey said, might be one that helps correct the demand, creating a housing market in the future where homeownership is available for more people.\n\n“When markets struggle, this is the time that economists think innovation will happen,” she said.\n\nDwight A.

Or keep things status quo?\n\nResults were mixed. California's Proposition 1, which would provide more mental health services for people experiencing homelessness passed by razor-thin margins after weeks of ballot counting. In Chicago, ballot question 1, dubbed Bring Chicago Home, which would have raised taxes on the sales of million-dollar real estate, failed with 52% voting against it.\n\nState lawmakers in Iowa and New Hampshire also are debating legislation that would allow more real estate transfer tax revenues to fund affordable housing. Last year, Delaware passed a law to put more transfer taxes toward affordable housing funds in three counties, and New York did the same for part of Long Island in 2021. Similar efforts in recent years failed in Colorado, Illinois and Maine, according to data compiled by the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nMore elected officials throughout the country are running on promises to reduce homelessness. But the problem is growing even as leaders try to solve it. Last year, the U.S. homeless population reached a high of more than 650,000, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development Annual Homelessness Assessment Report, and housing experts warn rent increases and evictions will push more people into homelessness until cities build cheaper housing. When funding for affordable housing fails to get approved, the time frame for reducing homelessness gets pushed further, advocates warn.\n\nBut cities face an uphill battle passing new funding measures to support brand-new housing initiatives, especially when voters are invested in keeping real estate taxes flat.\n\nIn Chicago, one of the main groups opposing the Bring Chicago Home campaign said raising taxes could also raise housing costs, hurting homeowners and renters alike.\n\n\"Tax increases hurt affordability, they are actually drivers of housing instability,\" said Jeff Baker, CEO of Illinois Realtors.\n\nBring Chicago Home fails to pass after years of organizing\n\nAfter first launching in 2018, the Bring Chicago Home measure failed to pass last week, leaving longtime grassroots homeless advocates disappointed and frustrated with the results.\n\n\"The number of people experiencing homelessness grows every year, it is a matter of life and death,\" said Hannah Gelder, the organizing director for ONE Northside in Chicago, a social justice group on the referendum's steering committee.\n\nGelder said advocates for the homeless in years past fought at the state level to increase taxes to fund affordable housing, but state lawmakers said they didn't want to consider legislation on the issue. That meant Chicago, where homeless people number more than 60,000, had to go directly to voters in this year's election.\n\nBring Chicago Home would have increased the real estate transfer tax to 2% for properties sold for $1 million or more, while lowering them for more than 92% of buyers purchasing property worth less than $1 million, according to the proposed policy. The plan would have raised about $900 million for new construction over 10 years, the campaign said. Proponents first started organizing around the cause back when Rahm Emanuel was mayor.\n\n\"It was an uphill battle to persuade voters to vote on a tax referendum,\" Gelder said.\n\nIllinois Realtors, a real estate lobbying group, said it had $1 million to spend on its opposition campaign, which argued the new sales tax would hurt Chicago's residential, commercial and rental real estate markets.\n\n\"This proposal was actually going to hurt the ability of the city to address homelessness,\" Baker said.\n\nBut, the Bring Chicago Home campaign said their proposed tax would not hurt renters, citing recent studies from Northwestern University and the University of Chicago that found landlords wanting to maintain their return on investment for multifamily buildings worth more than $1 million could do so by raising monthly rents by less than $5.\n\nWhile grassroots homeless advocates were on the ground talking to their neighbors about Bring Chicago Home and trying to \"win hearts and minds,\" Gelder said, ads led some voters to believe the new tax would be like writing the city government a \"blank check.\"\n\n\"It played to voters' distrust of government,\" Gelder said.\n\nBaker told USA TODAY he agreed cities across the U.S. need to increase their supply of below market rental units. But, he said zoning restrictions and costly development requirements make \"building these homes way too expensive\" for real estate owners.\n\nTo make the case for the funding, some experts point to growing evidence showing paying for affordable housing saves money long-term because having a large homeless population is costly for cities, said Sarah Gillespie, a housing researcher at the Urban Institute focusing on city budgets.\n\n\"It is a choice. You may choose to pay for housing, and if you don't, then you're choosing to pay for arrests, jail stays and emergency department visits,\" she said.\n\nFLORIDA:State bans homeless people from camping in public spaces\n\nCalifornia Prop 1 barely passes\n\nCalifornia is home to nearly a third of the country's unhoused population, and data released last year shows the vast majority of unhoused people there said they had a period in their lifetime when they experienced a serious mental health condition. About 27% of California's more than 170,000 homeless residents have been hospitalized for a mental health condition before, according to the report from Benioff Homelessness and Housing Initiative at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nCalifornia's Proposition 1 scraped by with barely more than 50% of the vote in a heavily Democratic state.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom pushed hard for the measure, which will fund thousands more mental health and substance use treatment slots and housing units.\n\n\"Now it's time to get to work − repairing the damage caused by decades of broken promises and neglect to those suffering from severe mental illness,\" Newsom wrote on X, formerly Twitter, celebrating the election results.\n\nProposition 1 authorizes the state to shift $6.38 million in bonds against county mental health budgets, redirecting most of the money toward new affordable housing.\n\nThe money would be borrowed against income taxes already imposed on people who earn over $1 million annually.\n\nIndividual cities in California, and elsewhere in the West, have voted by wider margins to raise taxes to fund homeless services, like last year, when Seattle renewed its housing levy for another seven years.\n\nSeattle voters support property taxes for affordable housing\n\nIn the Seattle region, another area on the West Coast struggling with a large homeless population, a majority of voters have for years approved a levy on property taxes to fund affordable housing.\n\nIn an off-year election, 69% of Seattle voters in 2023 approved a housing tax that will fund the creation of more than 3,100 affordable rentals and homes for purchase, and rental assistance to prevent evictions for an estimated 9,000 low-income families, according to the city.\n\nHomeless advocates in Seattle see more support from voters because the housing tax has been in place for decades, and residents have seen positive results, said Sharon Lee, executive director of the Low Income Housing Institute in Seattle. Affordable housing complexes are spread evenly throughout the city, and \"you can't tell that it's low-income,\" she said.\n\n\"They look market rate, they're well maintained and there isn't a stigma,\" Lee said.\n\nIt could be harder to rally voters to approve increased funding for similar projects in America's older cities, where the phrase \"affordable housing\" calls to mind \"buildings that are falling apart or vacant,\" she said.\n\nAtlanta mayor, City Council approve millions of dollars for affordable housing\n\nInstead of turning to voters, last year the Atlanta City Council was able to approve hundreds of millions of dollars for affordable housing, through a bond spread out over the better part of a decade.\n\nThe city, which grew by 66,000 residents from April 2022 to April 2023, also is benefitting from more property tax revenue without having to raise or pass new measures, the mayor's office said.\n\nPhilanthropic groups also worked with the city to allocate millions as part of the plan.\n\nThere's still broad public support for it less than a year later, said Joshua Humphries, policy advisor to Atlanta's mayor. Atlanta residents saw firsthand that the bond was working in a matter of months, he said. In 2023, 14 stalled affordable housing projects − representing 1,238 affordable units − got off the ground because of the money.\n\nIn 2023, Atlanta had an unhoused population of 2,679, according to that year's annual count.\n\nThe funds will continue to be used for more new construction, as well as preserving existing housing and developing underutilized public land, Humphries said.\n\n\"Affordable housing is the most pressing public policy issue in the country right now, and every city is going to have to grapple with the question of how do they want to be part of making sure that their city has adequate housing stock,\" he said. \"You need to have the political will and financial investment.\"\n\nContributing: Terry Collins, USA TODAY; Kathryn Palmer, Desert Sun", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2023/04/03/addiction-recovery-in-delaware-how-seaford-farm-aims-to-help-mothers/70028768007/", "title": "Addiction recovery in Delaware: How Seaford farm aims to help ...", "text": "The farm aims to provide critical resources to two groups of people that are historically underserved when it comes to addiction treatment: pregnant and parenting women and those in rural areas.\n\nLife on the farm will be structured, including agricultural work, peer-led groups, morning meditation walks in the woods and daily therapy sessions.\n\nState Rep.

That number will only go up in coming years, according to the New York Times' analysis.\n\nThe changes to the program revolve around how insurance premiums are calculated, moving away from reliance on 100-year flood zone maps to a calculation that will for the first time take into account the size of a home and the distance from potential flood sources.\n\nFederal officials say the goal is fairness — and also getting homeowners to understand the extent of the risk they face, and perhaps move to safer ground, reducing the human and financial toll of disasters, the Times reports.\n\nBy the way:Home insurance can protect against extreme weather, but about half of Americans don't understand it\n\nSubscribers:Millions of US homes at risk of climate-related disasters, but few Americans know it\n\nLocal real estate experts told the Herald-Tribune that impacts to Anna Maria Island and other affluent locations is not likely to be immediate nor large since many of the homeowners on these barrier islands have the means to absorb the financial hit.\n\nBut the impact may be felt much more so in less affluent areas along places such as Phillippi Creek, the Myakka River and other locations that could see spikes in federal flood insurance premiums begin to price out potential buyers.\n\nThe changes to the way federal insurance premiums are determined will take affect on Oct. 1 for any new policies, with existing policies being impacted at the beginning of April.\n\nJeff Nungesser, owner and agent at Iron City Insurance in Sarasota, said before the changes to the federal program, the two most important factors in regard to a flood insurance premiums were the flood zone maps and the a residence's height above or below the base flood elevation.\n\nIn other news:Plan to inject Piney Point wastewater underground has critics\n\nMore:Sarasota City Commission may pause plan for advancing ranked-choice voting\n\nNew factors\n\nThe new premiums will be calculated by taking 10 factors into consideration, with the most important being the distance from a flood source and the types of floods a property could experience, he said.\n\nHe said the cost to rebuild a property and its square footage are now also being considered when determining premiums, something that had not previously been part of the calculation.\n\nAn insurance policy Nungesser recently sold involved a Siesta Key home that would have paid about $1,000 per year in flood insurance. If the homeowner had used the federal insurance program, that person would have been required to pay $5,000 a year in flood insurance using the new method.\n\n\"I was able to find him a policy on the private market for $2,000 per year,\" Nungesser said.\n\nThe most immediate impact will be to new flood insurance policies, he said, as the federal program is capped at rate hikes of 18% per year for existing policies.\n\nThe New York Times report notes that with annual 18% increases, the new method of calculating flood insurance premiums could take as long as 20 years before it reaches the true cost of the flood insurance premium.\n\nU.S. Rep.

She said many of her buyers are more concerned about potential impacts of tax increases than in flood insurance premium increases.\n\nFor other areas, she did say that the flood premium increase could begin to price out potential buyers.\n\nAlex Krumm, president of the Realtor's Association of Sarasota and Manatee and owner broker at NextHome Excellence, agreed that it could become an issue for less wealthy buyers and even could affect property values in the area.\n\nHe said anytime costs are increased, there will be an impact of value.

The joint income is subject to different tax brackets than single filers.\n\nImportantly, filing jointly means you're both on the hook for the money you and your spouse owe to the IRS prior to your marriage.\n\n\"When you file jointly, that is typically how you get the largest legitimate refund,\" says Scott Curley, co-CEO of FinishLine Tax Solutions, a tax consulting firm based in Houston.\n\nThat's because there are more tax deductions and credits married couples filing jointly are eligible for.\n\nThere are instances where filing separately makes more sense.\n\nThe tax code allows you to deduct out-of-pocket medical expenses that exceed 7.5% of your adjusted gross income, meaning if one half of the relationship has experienced significant health issues it may make sense to prepare separate returns.\n\nAnother situation where it may not make sense to file a joint return is if one spouse has a significantly lower income, Speiss says.

Connecticut and Massachusetts are third and fourth, at $855,307 and $816,700.\n\nThe lowest-tax state is West Virginia, with a lifetime cost of $358,407.\n\nThe lifetime tax figure, $524,625, works out to about one-third of the average American's lifetime earnings, which add up to roughly $1.5 million.\n\nDaniel de Visé\n\nUSA TODAY Fact-Check: Three false tax claims to avoid\n\nThe complexity of the filing process and various government financial initiatives has made the topic a popular source of misinformation.\n\nThe USA TODAY Fact-Check Team has debunked an array of such claims, here are three of them.\n\nThe claim: There are no laws requiring American citizens to pay income taxes\n\nOur rating: False\n\nThe 16th Amendment gives Congress the power to collect federal income taxes. The power to enforce these tax laws has been delegated to the IRS, which imposes financial penalties on those who don't properly file their taxes.

Frank\n\nWhat happens if my taxes are late?\n\nIf you forgot or missed the deadline for another reason, the standard penalty is 5% of any tax due for every month the return is late, up to 25% of the unpaid balance.\n\nIf you file a return but fail to pay any taxes you owe, or if you get an extension and don't pay (an extension to file is not an extension to pay, the IRS reminds you), you typically face a much smaller monthly penalty of 0.5% of any unpaid amount.\n\nEmily DeLetter\n\nPresident Biden releases taxes\n\nPresident Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden paid $146,629 in federal income taxes in 2023 after reporting income of $619,976, according to their joint tax return released Monday to mark the federal tax-filing deadline.\n\nThe first couple paid an effective federal tax rate of 23.7%.\n\nIt marks the 26th year that Biden has released federal tax returns during his public life.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the Republican presumptive nominee, is again declining to release his latest federal tax returns after he broke from the bipartisan tradition of presidents disclosing the documents.\n\nJoey Garrison\n\nIs the post office open late on Tax Day?\n\nIn years past, tax filers who were filing at the last minute could often go to area post offices up until midnight on tax day and get a hand-stamped postmark, which showed they had beaten the deadline.\n\nBut that’s generally not the case these days.\n\nOne of the major reasons that post offices no longer stay open late on April 15 is that the majority of taxpayers file their returns electronically.\n\nAccording to the IRS, in 2022 nearly 213.4 million returns and other forms were filed electronically, representing close to 81.2% of all filings. For individual tax returns, 93.8% were filed electronically.\n\nOf course, you can always double-check with your local post office to see if by chance they are staying open late. Some post offices may extend their hours.\n\nIf you file by mail, your return must be postmarked by April 15, so get it in before the last collection time.\n\nCeleste E.

Connecticut, New York, New Hampshire and Massachusetts rounded out the top five states with the most expensive median property tax bill. Homeowners in West Virginia paid the smallest amount in property taxes on average, about $694 per year.\n\nA separate analysis from CoreLogic found that the average homeowner in Westchester County, New York paid the most in property taxes last year, with a median value of $15,373.\n\nIn 2023, 13 of the 15 top counties with the most expensive property tax bills were in the greater New York City area, including surrounding cities and suburbs.\n\nSara Chernikoff\n\nHow are lottery winners taxed?\n\nIf you were one of the lucky people to win either a Powerball or Mega Millions prizes in 2023, you are certainly not out of the taxman’s reach.\n\nFederal lottery taxes are determined by the income bracket the winnings fall into.\n\nCurrently the two highest income brackets are taxed at 37% for incomes over $578,125 and 35% for incomes over $231,250.\n\nNew York levies the highest state tax on wins at 10.9%, followed by Maryland (8.9%) and the District of Columbia (8.5%), according to Lottery USA.\n\nThere are ten states and territories that do not tax lottery winners. They are:\n\nCalifornia\n\nDelaware\n\nFlorida\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPuerto Rico\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nTennessee\n\nTexas\n\nWashington\n\nWyoming\n\nJames Powel\n\nDon't forget state taxes\n\nIf your state has income tax, you may not be done yet.

The extension gives taxpayers until October 15 to file their taxes.\n\nThe IRS reminds people an extension to file is not an extension to pay. If you think you’ll owe money, then you must submit a payment to ensure you don’t incur an underpayment penalty or late fee.\n\nTaxpayers in Maine and Massachusetts have until April 17 to file and pay taxes due this year. This is because these states observe the Patriots’ Day holiday on April 15 this year, and April 16 is the Emancipation Day holiday in the District of Columbia, the IRS says.\n\nThere are also automatic extensions for some taxpayers impacted by natural disasters.\n\nMedora Lee\n\nIRS tax brackets for 2024\n\nAfter preparing your return for 2023, you may be wondering whether to change your withholding for 2024. One factor to consider is the new tax brackets.\n\nFor the top individual tax bracket, the 2024 income threshold was raised from $578,126 to $609,351. This means that more than $30,000 in individual income will be taxed at 35%, instead of 37%.\n\nHere are the other 2024 tax brackets for individual filers:\n\n35% for incomes over $243,725.\n\n32% for incomes over $191,950.\n\n24% for incomes over $100,525.\n\n22% for incomes over $47,150.\n\n12% for incomes over $11,600.\n\n10% for income below $11,600.\n\nAnd here are the 2024 tax brackets for married couples filing joint returns:\n\n37% for income greater than $731,200.\n\n35% for incomes over $487,450.\n\n32% for incomes over $383,900.\n\n24% for incomes over $201,050.\n\n22% for incomes over $94,300.\n\n12% for incomes over $23,200.\n\n10% for income below $23,200.\n\nElisabeth Buchwald\n\nHow will the Child Tax Credit change in 2024?\n\nA much-heralded bill in Congress aims to boost the child tax credit, delivering more aid to families. Long story short: It may not happen.\n\nThe bipartisan proposal would phase in an increase to the amount of the child tax credit that is refundable, meaning that you can get the money even if you owe no tax.\n\nThe maximum credit is $2,000 per child, and the refundable portion is currently $1,600. The legislation would increase the refundable portion to $1,800 for 2023, $1,900 for 2024 and $2,000 in 2025.But the bill has yet to pass the Senate, if indeed it ever will. “It’s on life support,” Sen. Josh Hawley, the Missouri Republican, told NBC News.\n\nDaniel de Visé\n\nWhat is the tax underpayment penalty?\n\nThe IRS expects you to pay taxes on your income at regular intervals, either through withholding from your paycheck or estimated payments.\n\nIf you don’t, you may be charged an underpayment penalty.\n\nThe penalty could be triggered if you don’t pay enough tax or don’t pay it on time, either through withholding or estimated tax payments. In other words, don’t wait until December to send in a $10,000 check for estimated taxes.\n\nTo avoid the penalty, try to pay your estimated taxes on time. You may be able to skirt the penalty if you paid at least 90% of the tax you owe for the current year, or 100% of the tax you owed last year, whichever is less, or if you owe less than $1,000.\n\nThe underpayment penalty is calculated based on the underpaid amount, the period in which you underpaid, and interest rates set by the IRS.\n\nDaniel de Visé\n\nMore than $1 billion in tax refunds remain unclaimed\n\nMore than $1 billion in tax refunds have yet to be claimed, and the clock is ticking.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service recently announced that around 940,000 people still haven’t submitted tax returns for the 2020 tax year, with many awaiting refunds. They have until May 17.\n\n\"There’s money remaining on the table for hundreds of thousands of people who haven’t filed 2020 tax returns,\" IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said in a release.\n\nThe federal tax collector urges taxpayers to act ahead of the deadline.\n\nAnthony Robledo\n\nWhy is my refund taking so long?\n\nAre you wondering why your refund check hasn’t arrived? Here’s what to do.\n\nFirst, check the calendar. Most refunds are issued within 21 days of being received, the IRS says.\n\nNext, check with the IRS. Its \"Where's my Refund\" tool can help you track your refund.\n\nThe agency is processing returns at a slightly slower pace this year than last: 88.8 million vs. 89.7 million, as of late March.\n\nIf your refund is delayed, the IRS lists several possible reasons:\n\n- It was sent by mail\n\n- It contains errors or is incomplete\n\n- It needs further review\n\n- It is affected by identity theft or fraud\n\n- It was referred to the IRS by the bank due to suspicious activity\n\n- It includes an Injured Spouse Allocation form, which could take up to 14 weeks to process\n\nJames Powel\n\nWhat is a W-4 form?\n\nAccording to the Internal Revenue Service, you should complete a Form W-4 so that your employer can withhold the correct federal income tax from your pay.\n\nAccurately filling out this form can help you avoid a tax payment when you file your return.\n\nThe IRS says you should \"consider completing a new Form W-4 each year and when your personal or financial situation changes.\"\n\nThe IRS' latest version of the W-4 form is available on its website.\n\nGabe Hauari\n\nToday is your last chance to contribute to an IRA for 2023\n\nBelieve it or not, there’s still time – one more day, to be precise – to contribute to your Individual Retirement Account and take the tax break for 2023.\n\nYou can contribute to an IRA up to April 15 and have the money count toward your 2023 savings. The contribution limit for 2023 is $6,500 if you’re under 50, $7,500 if you’re older.\n\n\"There is a 15-month window to make IRA contributions for any given year,\" said Mary Ryan, a certified financial planner at Vanguard.\n\nIf you haven’t maxed out your contributions, you have until the end of the day.\n\nYou'll get an answer faster if you call the IRS\n\nThe IRS answered 1 million additional calls, up roughly 17% from 2023, through April 6. And in what could be a surprising development to many, the IRS has reduced wait times on its phone lines to 3 minutes, according to the U.S. Department of Treasury's release Monday. Just two years ago, taxpayers were stuck waiting on hold an average of 28 minutes, according to Treasury.\n\nPhone service improved as call volume rose roughly 13%. What's helped pare the wait time? The IRS has a call back option now that's available to 97% of eligible taxpayers at the start of the call, according to Treasury, if the expected wait time is longer than 15 minutes.\n\nThe IRS phone number is 800-829-1040.\n\nSusan Tompor\n\nWhat is net pay? How is it different from gross pay?\n\nHere's what you should know about net pay: what it is, how to calculate it, and the difference between gross pay vs. net pay.\n\nIn simple terms, gross pay is an employee's total earned wages before payroll deductions. Net pay is the money you take home from your paycheck after the deductions. The deductions include taxes and benefits.\n\nFor example, if someone gets paid $1,200 per week but $160 is taken away in deductions, the person's net pay will be $1,040 per week.\n\nOlivia Munson\n\nAre IRS tax refunds bigger or smaller in 2024?\n\nAs of April 5, the average refund this year totals $3,011. That's up 4.6% compared to the same time last year, when refunds averaged $2,878, the IRS reports.\n\nA few more statistics of note:\n\nThe average amount refunded by direct deposit is $3,088 through April 5, compared to $2,942 last year, a 4.9% increase.\n\nThe total number of returns received by IRS so far is 101.8 million, up from 101.3 million at this time in 2023.\n\nThe IRS has processed 100.1 million returns as of April 5, compared to 100.4 million at this time last year.\n\nVisits to the IRS website are up a whopping 18.2%, from about 421 million last year to 497 million this year. The agency has been working to improve customer service.\n\nDaniel de Visé\n\nWhat triggers an IRS audit?\n\nWhen you're audited, it means your return was singled out for closer inspection. This happens because your tax filing was among those that showed the \"highest potential noncompliance,\" the IRS says. The agency uses data-driven algorithms, third-party information, whistleblowers and information on the forms you submit to determine if income, expenses and credits are reported accurately.\n\nWhat triggers an audit? Mismatches. Make sure you enter your information from official tax forms correctly, so the numbers are consistent, said Erin Collins, National Taxpayer Advocate at the Taxpayer Advocate Service division of the IRS. The agency also looks for outliers, like a filer who writes off travel costs way above what the typical taxpayer would deduct.\n\nThe easiest way to avoid an audit is to be \"accurate, honest, and modest,\" said Eric Scaringe, principal at certified public accounting firm UHY.\n\nMedora Lee\n\nFiling an extension on Tax Day? You may need form 4868\n\nTax filers who aren't prepared to submit their returns on Tax Day can use IRS Free File to request an extension electronically. But if you prefer to mail a paper version of the extension, you'll need form 4868.\n\nIf you send the form by mail, make sure it's postmarked no later than April 15: today is the deadline for filing an extension. If you get an extension, you'll have until Tuesday, Oct. 15, 2024, to file your return.\n\nWhere to send the form depends on where you live. Here is a list of addresses.\n\nGabe Hauari\n\nWhat is net pay?How it works, how to calculate it and its difference from gross pay\n\nMore:You may need Form 4868 to file a tax extension. Here's what to know as deadline looms.\n\nWhat other tax deadlines fall on April 15?\n\nTax Day is not just the deadline to file your federal taxes for the prior year.\n\nIf you earn income that isn't subject to withholding taxes, you're typically required to make estimated tax payments to the IRS. The agency divides the year into four quarterly payment periods, and the first quarterly payment for 2024 is due today.\n\nMost state taxes are also due on April 15. Residents of Massachusetts and Maine have until April 17 to file federal taxes because of state holidays. There are other exceptions.\n\nDaniel de Visé\n\nWhere’s my refund?\n\nYou've already filed your tax return for 2023. You have a refund coming. You want to know where it is.\n\nThere are multiple ways to receive a tax refund, but the fastest by far is electronically, the IRS says. If you filed electronically and chose to receive your refund by direct deposit, your refund will probably be issued within 21 days. If you mailed a paper return and expect a refund, it could take four weeks or more to process your return.\n\nThrough the IRS \"Where's My Refund\" tool, you can track when the IRS received your tax return, when it approved a refund, and when it issued the refund. If you chose direct deposit, the money should land in your account within five days from the date the IRS approves your refund. You can also call 800-829-1954.\n\nMedora Lee\n\nShould I file my taxes online or at the post office?\n\nYou’ve waited till the last day to file your 2023 tax return. The minutes are ticking by. Now, you face a choice: Should you file online, and try your luck with an overtaxed IRS website? Or should you print it out and head to the post office, risking long lines?\n\nNeither choice is entirely safe. The IRS website famously crashed on Tax Day in 2018, prompting the agency to give frustrated taxpayers a rare one-day extension.\n\nLong lines used to be the norm at post offices on tax day. You may still face a wait if you mail your form today. The Postal Service says some locations will offer extended hours, and suggests you call your local post office to check.\n\nThe IRS recommends electronic filing. Many tax experts agree.\n\n“Filing tax returns electronically is typically the preferred option,” said Eric Bronnenkant, director of tax at Betterment, a financial advisory company. “Even at the last minute, it is likely better than using mail.”\n\nDaniel de Visé\n\nCan I file my taxes for free on Tax Day?\n\nYes! More people are filing their taxes using Free File this year, the IRS says.\n\nFree File allows any taxpayer with an adjusted gross income of $79,000 or less in 2023 to file taxes for free through one of eight IRS partners. To access the service, go online at IRS Free File and use the guided software.\n\nIf you're eligible, a free filing can save you a pretty penny. An individual taxpayer is estimated to spend 13 hours and $240 in out-of-pocket costs to prepare and file an annual tax return, according to the Taxpayer Advocate.\n\nMedora Lee\n\nWhy is April 15 Tax Day?\n\nApril 15 might seem an arbitrary date for the entire nation to file taxes. Here's some background:\n\nHistorical sources tell us President Lincoln first levied internal taxes in 1862, during the Civil War. The federal government adopted the modern income tax system in 1913, with the 16th Amendment. The original Tax Day fell on March 1. Congress moved the date to March 15 a few years later. In the 1950s, Tax Day was moved to April 15. The date shifts gave Americans more time to prepare their returns.\n\nSome years, Tax Day falls later than April 15, typically because the date falls on a weekend.\n\nDaniel de Visé\n\nTax Day freebies and food deals\n\nTax Day has its perks. Fast food and sit-down restaurants across the U.S. are offering customers freebies and discounts to celebrate the occasion.\n\nWhether you've already filed your taxes and are waiting on your tax refund, or you need to file a tax extension, you can take a break and seek out free or discounted treats. A few examples:\n\nKrispy Kreme customers can purchase an Original Glazed or assorted dozen in shop and receive a second Original Glazed dozen for the price of sales tax in their state.\n\nGrubHub is offering a $15 discount on delivery orders worth $25 or more.\n\nPotbelly shops nationwide are offering customers a free Original sandwich with the purchase of any Original or Big sized sandwich.\n\nGabe Hauari\n\nWhat happens if you don't file your taxes on time?\n\nNot filing a tax return can trigger two potential penalties: one for failure to file, the other for failure to pay. Together, they can max out at 50% of the tax you owe.\n\nFailure to file: If you miss the April 15 deadline, the standard penalty is 5% of any tax due for every month your return is late, up to 25% of the unpaid balance.\n\nFailure to pay: If you file a return by the deadline but fail to pay taxes you owe, or if you get an extension and leave a balance unpaid, you typically face a much smaller monthly penalty of 0.5% of any unpaid amount, up to 25% of the unpaid tax.\n\nJames Powel and Emily DeLetter\n\nHow do I file an extension with the IRS?\n\nSometimes, you just need more time.\n\nIf you can’t make the April 15 deadline, experts say, the next best thing is to seek an extension. If approved, it provides filers a six-month grace period to file, though it does not provide an extension to pay.\n\nThe deadline for filing an extension is today, April 15. If you get one, you'll have until Tuesday, Oct. 15, 2024 to file your return.\n\nTax Day deals 2024:Score discounts, freebies at Krispy Kreme, Hooters, Potbelly, more\n\nYou can request a free extension through the IRS. You'll need basic information, like your name, address, Social Security number, and estimated tax liability. Be prepared to make a payment, if you owe anything and have the funds.\n\nTax filers can use IRS Free File to request an extension electronically. If you prefer to mail a paper version of the extension, called form 4868, make sure it's postmarked no later than April 15.\n\nJames Powel and Emily DeLetter", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/delaware/2017/06/26/millsboro-delaware-business-growth/401328001/", "title": "Millsboro says plan to draw business, residents is working", "text": "On the Millsboro municipal website, a message is displayed front and center about the town's new vision: \"Explosive Growth. Retailers Wanted. Families & Employers Welcome.\"\n\nIt's part of a plan that focuses on attracting businesses to boost the quiet little town's economy.\n\nThe town has tried to ensure it is as welcoming as possible for families and businesses, and efforts paid off recently with the arrival of Lewes Dairy, according to Town Manager Sheldon Hudson.\n\nThat move was all but approved by the Millsboro Town Council on June 12 when they voted to approve Lewes Dairy's newest facility construction plans.\n\n\"The council is trying to focus not just on residential growth but retail growth,\" Hudson said. \"They want the town to be diverse with the population with attracting seniors, middle-aged people and young people.\n\n\"That's why Lewes Dairy coming to town is such a big deal. They're bringing their warehouse and their office.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Long Neck Strong group says crime problem not a quick fix after multiple meetings\n\nREAD MORE: These Delaware bills could impact Sussex County\n\nThe town council also voted during the winter to reduce impact fees by 25 percent, a move, Hudson said, that would save businesses $20,000 to $30,000. The reduction of impact fees was one of the driving factors that got Lewes Dairy to move to Millsboro, said Lewes Dairy owner Jay Meany.\n\n\"We have a good relationship with the Millsboro town council,\" he said. \"With the fees that they have altered, it made for an easy decision to move.\"\n\nThe dairy is moving, Meany said, because they did not own the land their distribution center was on, and the current owners are selling it for a price it could not afford.\n\nBut moving to Millsboro had advantages other than saving money. Lewes Dairy will be building a \"much more updated\" facility, Meany said, among other factors.\n\n\"We decided to go more centrally located for distribution purposes,\" he said. \"Hopefully, we can be in by the end of the year.\"\n\nHudson said the town did what it could do to get Lewes Dairy to move to Millsboro.\n\nHe added that, since Lewes Dairy supplies milk for schools in both Delaware and the Eastern Shore of Maryland, the more centralized location made sense for the business.\n\n\"Millsboro is, geographically, a hub for Delmarva,\" he said.\n\nREAD MORE: Sussex votes 4-0 to approve budget with no tax increases\n\nThe growth of Millsboro isn't confined to businesses. Hudson said the town expects its population to double in size in 10 years after more than doubling in size between 2000 and 2010, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nThe latest estimate in 2016 has Millsboro's population at 4,293, but it also sits just off Route 113, a road that sees hundreds of thousands of drivers making their summer drive to the beaches in Fenwick Island, Bethany and Ocean City, Maryland.\n\nAnd businesses have noticed a change.\n\nMillsboro has a mixture of both chain and independent retail outlets, with chain stores focused more along Route 113 and independent retailers focused on the Main Street of the town.\n\nEd Carey is the part owner of Carey's Frame Shop, a store his mother and father began in 1965. The building his store is in was built 177 years ago, he said, and he said he doesn't expect Millsboro's expansion to stop any time soon.\n\n\"I see it growing,\" he said. \"I think there's a lot of potential here. ... I think this community is poised to grow more with the proper people in place.

As of this point in his presidency, Biden has spent more than a quarter of his time working from his home state of Delaware, either at his house in Wilmington or his Rehoboth Beach property.\n\nSome 21 months into his term, Biden has made 55 visits to Delaware, totaling some or all of 174 days as of Sunday, according to a CNN analysis of presidential schedules and a tally kept by Mark Knoller, the longtime unofficial statistician of the White House press corps. In addition, Biden has made 19 visits, or all or part of 64 days, to the Camp David presidential retreat in rural Maryland.\n\nHe has now surpassed even the getaway time of former President Donald Trump, so often criticized by Democrats for his regular departures from the White House to stay at one of his personal homes. At this point in his tenure, Trump had spent about 135 days at either his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, or his home at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Trump also had spent 23 days at Camp David.\n\n“President Biden is deeply proud of his roots and his family and it has been a staple of his time in public life to never lose touch with either,” White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates said to CNN. “Presidents of the United States are constantly on the job, regardless of their location – whether they’re on a state visit overseas or just 100 miles from the White House for a short trip to Wilmington, DE. And as all Americans can agree, it’s important for leaders to avoid becoming ensconced in Washington, DC.”\n\nThe comforts of home can be a salve for the commander in chief while carrying out one of the world’s most demanding jobs. The American president is never truly “off,” and – in fact – Biden, like all presidents, has a whole remote White House apparatus that travels with him to facilitate that round-the-clock enterprise, with the most state-of-the-art capabilities, resources and technology traveling with him wherever he goes.\n\nSome argue that Biden can now lean into the normalcy of working from home, which millions of Americans had to rely on when Covid-19 forced isolation from offices and public spaces. “WFH” is not just a shorthand for being productive at the home office, it’s become a professional way of life for many.\n\n“It is 2022, not 1922. If the rest of the country can work from home, so can the president of the United States,” said Michael LaRosa, a director at a DC-based public affairs firm and former press secretary to first lady Dr. Jill Biden.\n\n“He spent (practically) every weekend in Delaware during his 36 years in the Senate, and his eight years as vice president,” LaRosa said. “This is nothing new. The Bidens have never lived in Washington, DC.” When he was a senator, Biden commuted back to Delaware almost every night by train – earning the nickname “Amtrak Joe” – and the train station in Wilmington is named for him.\n\nThe physical presence of a president is, however, meaningful for some, at least in ritual.\n\nThe statistics – 236 days away from the White House in Delaware and Maryland in less than two years on the job – are significant for the modern presidency. The job has been set in the nation’s capital near the Congress and the Supreme Court, in part for its symbolic power, for more than 220 years. Being in that power center brings a higher level of transparency thanks to the proximity to the national media, along with White House rules about press access and public records about who comes and goes.\n\nWhenever the president is actually in the Oval Office, for example, that presence is honored by the solemn watch of a stone-faced US Marine posted outside the West Wing.\n\n“A special challenge that Biden faces, because of his age, is that people will assume the worst if he’s not always visible. That is something that comes with being the oldest president in office,” said Tim Naftali, a CNN presidential historian, who notes presidents have had a “moveable Oval Office” for decades. “Perception is important in American politics.”\n\nThe optics of WFH or WFWH\n\nA president of the United States who doesn’t consider the White House his primary home does not go unnoticed by the media, or critics. But the executive mansion’s primary residents have generally found it stifling.\n\n“I always say I don’t know whether it’s the finest public housing in America or the crown jewel of the prison system,” former President Bill Clinton famously mused during a 1993 interview.\n\nKnoller, who during his 32-year career with CBS News covered the personal habits of six presidents, concurs.\n\n“It may look luxurious, but it can be suffocating to live and work there day in and out,” Knoller said.\n\nTrump’s trips to Mar-a-Lago and Bedminster were fodder for op-eds and lent themselves to critics painting a portrait of a president unwilling to give up the trappings of a luxe off-duty lifestyle. And though many days were spent on the golf course – 125 or so at this point in Trump’s presidency, compared to Biden’s 19 on the links – Trump was still the leader of the free world. Biden’s former boss, Barack Obama, traveled home much less frequently while in office but was frequently dinged – by Trump, among others – for the amount of golf he played.\n\n“(Ronald) Reagan and (George W.) Bush both spent lots of time at their private ranch homes,” said Knoller of two other former presidents who escaped the White House with regularity.\n\nKnoller tabulated time away for presidents, he says, because the numbers “added color to my reporting and gave insight to the president’s needs and activities.”\n\nAccording to Knoller’s count, George W. Bush spent all or part of 490 days – more than a year – at his Texas ranch during his eight years in office. Reagan spent nearly a year, all or part of 349 days, at his California ranch during his two terms. If Biden were reelected and kept up his current pace of trips to Delaware until the end of a second term in office, he would far surpass both Reagan and Bush in time away from the White House.\n\nHowever, post-pandemic culture has blurred the boundaries of what defines a workplace.\n\n“Our concept of being ‘on the job’ has shifted, and that may actually change the way we think about where our president needs to be,” Naftali said.\n\nSome of Biden’s biggest political wins came this summer, after all, when he was isolating in the residence of the White House after testing positive for Covid-19. Photos showed him tie-less, often working in the second-floor Treaty Room or reading papers with his feet up on the Truman balcony, Commander by his side.\n\nIt was a view into what Biden’s work from home life may be like when he’s in Wilmington or Rehoboth.\n\n“It’s a bit antiquated to think that because he is not physically in the White House on the weekends, that he is not working,” LaRosa said. “He never stops being President and he never stops working. Just ask the first lady.”\n\nA weekly ritual\n\nBiden has the advantage of a more normalized routine in his trips away from Washington.\n\nThe White House residence staff has by now perfected the choreography of managing, packing and planning the departure of the President and first lady most Fridays, the day, statistically, the Bidens normally split town.\n\nThe ushers know which bags are to be brought downstairs – it’s a light-pack, most of the couples’ needed belongings are already in their Delaware homes, a person familiar tells CNN. While Biden occasionally plays golf at a local course when in Wilmington, his other activities – seeing his grandchildren, taking casual social visits, going to church – don’t require multiple outfit changes.\n\nIn Rehoboth, he rides his bike and he and the first lady like to set up a big, blue umbrella on the sandy beach in front of their house and sunbathe or read in reclining chairs. Outside of swimsuits, joggers and polo shirts, it’s not a multiple-suitcase situation.\n\n“The biggest issue is usually the pets,” said the person familiar with the weekend planning for a presidential getaway to Delaware.\n\nCommander, now one year old and no longer a small puppy, and Willow, the barn cat adopted by Jill Biden, are “almost always” on the Delaware visits. While many American families leave their pets at home with caretakers for the weekend, or book them at pet-sitting facilities, the Bidens take theirs with them.\n\nThey like to be around their pets at all times – when Joe Biden was isolating at the White House with Covid-19 this summer, he was kept company by Commander; likewise, when Jill Biden had her bout with Covid, she spent the her rebound case isolation period in Rehoboth, with Willow.\n\nThe animals frequently travel to Delaware via van, with support staff, but occasionally they are in vehicles solely dedicated to their transportation, says the person. Willow, in particular, is not a fan of noisy, whirring helicopter blades, said another person familiar with the feline’s habits. In June, there was a rare sighting by White House press members of Willow in her crate, being carried by a residence staffer to Marine One for a weekend at Rehoboth Beach.\n\nThe Biden’s Delaware visits, of course, no matter how quick, have a significant footprint beyond those of the paws of their pets.\n\nSecret Service coordinates with law enforcement on all movements – several highway exits must close for the presidential motorcade, locals in both Wilmington and Rehoboth must at times wait on traffic patterns or be swept by agents with handheld magnetometers just to walk down the beach if one of the Bidens is there, as one neighbor of the Bidens in Rehoboth Beach told CNN.\n\nThe large presidential apparatus helps ensure that the President is able to perform his duties with the full input of his advisers, even if they’re not with him in person.\n\n“Unless we discover his being away from Washington results in him bobbling the ball as JFK did on the eve of the Bay of Pigs operation, there shouldn’t be an issue,” says Naftali, referring to Kennedy’s canceling of an air strike on a Sunday, without full consultation and full consideration, a move the former President later regretted.\n\n“But if Biden is in touch virtually and telephonically, in this era, leadership doesn’t have to involve always being physically present in Washington, D.C.”", "authors": ["Kate Bennett"], "publish_date": "2022/10/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2021/09/21/farmers-fence-preserving-land-incentive-delaware/8363410002/", "title": "How a new incentive may help Delaware farmers on the fence about ...", "text": "The power to preserve farmland in Delaware often rests in the hands of farmers.\n\nLike many other states and counties, Delaware’s Department of Agriculture runs a voluntary farmland preservation program, which offers financial incentives and protections to farmers who wish to preserve their land and continue using it for agricultural purposes.\n\nWhile this may sound instinctual to people who want to see open spaces preserved in Delaware, this is not an easy decision for farmers.\n\nIf they choose to permanently sell their development rights to the state – what’s known as an agricultural conservation easement – they submit a confidential bid to sell the rights for a percentage, or discount, of the appraised value of their land.\n\nThat means landowners may be selling the development rights for less than half of what they would get from another buyer. And with a growing population and a hot housing market, farmers may often feel pressured to sell rather than preserve.\n\nBut the Delaware Department of Agriculture has a message for those farmers who are on the fence about preserving their land: The time to preserve is now.\n\nTAKE A DEEP DIVE:As developers carve up rural Sussex County, can farmers hang on?\n\nThe department announced in a news release last week that the average discount on the appraised value of the farmland has been decreasing for the last five years.\n\nThis ultimately means farmers are getting paid more for preserving their land.\n\nWhile the average discount was 74% in 2018, it has plummeted to 54% in 2021, according to Aglands Program Administrator Jimmy Kroon.\n\nHe said this is likely due to increased funding for the program in recent years, which has reduced the competition during the selection process for permanent preservation.\n\nLess competition also means more bids are being accepted, Kroon said, with 90% percent accepted over the last three years.\n\nThe preservation program has already received $10 million for the fiscal year, said Secretary of Agriculture Michael T. Scuse, and the state expects to receive “significant federal funding” from the United States Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service.\n\n“For anyone who hesitated to enroll their farm or submit a bid because of high discounts, this is a great time to participate in our program,” Scuse said.\n\nFarmers choose to preserve land for a variety of reasons, whether that’s to invest money back in their farms, to continue family farming traditions, or to protect the rural character of their hometowns.\n\nA farm's last crop:How Delaware is trying to save rural land as developers offer a premium\n\nBefore permanently selling their development rights, landowners must first enroll in a temporary agricultural district. After 10 years, they can continue renewing that district status every five years or leave the program.\n\nThey can also decide to permanently preserve their land at any point after enrolling as an agricultural district.\n\nThe Delaware Department of Agriculture announced in July that it permanently preserved 3,695 acres this year, raising the total to more than 143,000 acres.\n\nThat’s more than 27% of all farmland in the First State, including 1,100 farms, that will never be developed.\n\nIn this year’s round of easement selections, there were 23 farms in Kent County and 22 farms in Sussex County preserved.\n\nFarmers can now apply to enroll land in an agricultural district through Oct. 31. After enrolling, they are eligible to submit a bid for the next round of preservation easements announced in 2022.\n\nDelaware farmers interested in preserving their farms must meet certain requirements:\n\nThe property must be zoned for agriculture and not subject to any major subdivision plan.\n\nThe property must meet the minimum Land Evaluation and Site Assessment (LESA) score of 170 out of 300. LESA is a process that attempts to estimate the farm’s long-term viability based on the farm’s soil productivity and the land use and agriculture infrastructure on and around the farm. Program staff calculate the LESA score when applications are received.\n\nThe property must meet the state’s Farmland Assessment Act (10 acres or more which generate at least $1,000 in agricultural sales annually; farms under 10 acres which create at least $10,000 annually in agricultural sales).\n\nFarms must be 200 acres or more to constitute an agricultural district.\n\nFarms under 200 acres can enter the program if they are within three miles of an existing agricultural district. It is rare that a farm under 200 acres does not meet these criteria.\n\nEntirely forested properties in managed timber production can also enroll in the Forestland Preservation Program, which purchases forestland preservation easements through a similar process.\n\nThe Delaware Agricultural Preservation Foundation may spend up to $1 million of the $10 million appropriation on forestland easements.\n\nLandowners interested in preserving their farm can find information and application forms online or contact the Aglands Preservation Program at 302-698-4530.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/21"}]}
