But on a Saturday morning in March of last year I walk into room 6104 of the University of Cincinnati Medical Center. The space is too small, the table too big and the air never seems to move.\n\nThis is an organ transplant support group, and everybody here knows sickness intimately and speaks of it openly. They talk about constipation and catheters like most people talk about the weather. I look around to see if anyone else is about to hyperventilate.\n\nTwo of us are waiting for transplants, and we say almost nothing. Everyone else has already received one, and they don't stop.\n\nI don't want to know about hard times and doubt. I have no interest in drug protocols and risk factors. I want to stop being a diabetic. I want to take control of my health. I want to grow old and read books and take walks with my wife. I want to see our little girl, Lucy, now 7, walk down the aisle. I want to be well. I have no interest in the truth.\n\nBut the truth is sitting right in front of me. She has long brown hair and her coat is zipped up to her chin. Her skin is gray and she looks so tired. She does not say a word until she is asked to introduce herself and tell everybody why she is here. Her voice is raspy.\n\nShe says she has been on the wait list for a pancreas for more than a year. Nobody wants to be listed for a year. After 365 days, you have to go through the listing process again, meaning more medical tests and more blood work and more judging. You can be delisted. This woman had just been put on a \"hold\" meaning she was temporarily off the list.\n\nHer doctors said her heart had grown too weak. They gave her medicine and said it might make her healthy enough to get back on the list, but you could tell she does not really believe them. She says she might go visit her sister in Florida and the room goes quiet. Finally she exhales and says: \"Anyway.\"\n\nAll I can think is that she is one fewer person waiting for a pancreas in front of me. I never learn her name.\n\nThe decision to try to get a transplant started with the complicated math sick people do when they dare. These are word problems really: If John is a 48-year-old man with four children, one wife and two dogs, and he has been living with type-1 diabetes for three decades, how many good years does he have left?\n\nI started asking myself this question in my 20s. I asked it more intently at 30 when I married Laura and we started having children. I thought I would ask it less as the children grew older, but I am wrong. As they started to become teenagers, instead of feeling like I had done my job and sent them on their path, I only wanted more time with them. They still need me. I still need them.\n\nAs I, and they, grow older, my questions become more specific and more complicated. Will I be able to make vaguely inappropriate toasts at their weddings? Will I be able to babysit their children? When will I become a burden to my family?\n\nI began to not like the answers. The math no longer worked.\n\nInstead of watching them graduate from college, I was going to become their admissions essay as they detail the pain and embarrassment of taking care of their sick dad.\n\nI was becoming consumed with the fear of getting sick. I was terrified of being a middle-aged man who sticks around a little too long, drains the life force from his family and then finally has the decency to die.\n\nSo I made a choice. I wanted a pancreas transplant.\n\nI was a freshman in high school when I suddenly felt tired and thirsty and had to pee all the time. After about a week, I heard my mother speaking quietly on the phone to her friend Jan, saying she thought it was diabetes. She made a doctor's appointment for me.\n\nThe doctor, an older guy, told me I had juvenile diabetes because my body stopped making insulin. He seemed to know little about the disease beyond that. He said I could expect to have a \"normal life\" until I was about 30 years old. I can still hear him saying it.\n\nI did my best to control the disease. I gave myself insulin shots for 22 years and then used an insulin pump for 12 years after that. At the turn of each decade of my life, when I turned 20, 30, 40, I asked myself and God for 10 more good years. To hell with that doctor.\n\nI knew complications would come. I could cite the statistics like I used to rattle off the batting averages of my beloved Red Sox.\n\nDiabetics die from heart disease and stroke at twice the rate of other people. More than 60 percent of leg and foot amputations not related to an injury are due to diabetes. Diabetes is the leading cause of new blindness. Nerve damage happens in 60 percent to 70 percent of people with diabetes. People with diabetes are at high risk for gum disease.\n\nIn my future, I saw a footless, blind and impotent man having a stroke. And my gums would hurt.\n\nAfter we got married, Laura and I lived in Phoenix for 14 years. My doctor there was tough and smart and forced me to be disciplined. I saw her four times a year for 14 years. At each appointment I asked her about a transplant. Each of those 56 times, she would shake her head, smile and say: \"Maybe later.\"\n\nMy control, she said, was too good to justify the risk of a transplant. But I felt that control begin to wane no matter how hard I worked.\n\nIn my mid-40s, I was sticking my finger 10 times a day, drawing blood and testing my glucose levels. I ate right, exercised and was disciplined. Managing this disease was consuming my life, but my lows were getting lower and my highs were getting higher.\n\nWhen low, I could not think clearly, could be irrational and \"difficult\" – the nice way of putting it. Laura bore much of this and I could see the way my kids looked at me. Our son Theo, in particular, was wired in to how I was feeling. I could see him giving his mother a look and hear him whispering in her ear. \"Is Dad all right?\" \"Is Dad getting low?\"\n\nMore dangerous, when very low, I could lose awareness and then consciousness. I had been to emergency rooms.\n\nIn a healthy person, blood sugar levels, a measurement of the amount of glucose in the blood, should be in the fairly tight range of 60 to 90 milligrams per deciliter. My blood sugars began dropping down to the 30s and 40s. They were spiking into the 250s.\n\nI was damaging my body.\n\nI read everything I could to find ways to control my blood sugar better and stay healthy. Alpha-lipoic acids might protect my body from cell damage, so I should eat spinach. Polyphenols would promote glucose control and vascular health, so I should try green tea and dark chocolate.\n\nDr. Oz told me to eat cinnamon.\n\nBut nothing worked, and I didn't like green tea. I no longer wanted to stay the course and evaluate my options. That was a path of diminishing returns. The only way to stop being a diabetic is to get a pancreas transplant.\n\nPancreas transplants are not experimental, but they are not common. In 2013, there were 16,894 kidney transplants performed in this country and only 256 pancreas transplants.\n\nThe failure rate in the first year for a transplanted pancreas is about 10 percent. I did not care. Life after transplant would require a handful of drugs every day for the rest of my life to suppress my immune system. I did not care.\n\n******\n\nIn early 2012, Laura was hired as managing editor of The Enquirer, and I was hired as a reporter. So we moved to Cincinnati, put the kids in school, bought a home and I found a doctor.\n\nDr. Marzieh Salehi at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center worked with me to gain control. She tried to eliminate my low blood sugars and the highs but nothing was working.\n\nAt my second appointment, I told her I wanted a transplant, and I waited for her to shake her head, smile and say: \"Maybe later.\" She didn't say that.\n\nIn December 2012 I have my first meeting with the UC transplant team. This is my first time in Room 6104. I arrive early, taking a seat at the front. I will know the most, I will ask the smartest questions, I will \"win\" a transplant. At the orientation, one of the patients, a woman in a black beret and a purple track suit, falls asleep during the meeting. I figure I have her beat.\n\nI meet Dr. Tayyab Diwan. He is 38, handsome and confident. His suit is tailored, his eyebrows are perfect and he is the smartest guy in the room. It would be easy not to like him. I like him right away.\n\nDr. Diwan tells me about the surgery, that I will keep my original pancreas because it still performs some vital functions. He says all surgeries come with risk and that this is a long and fairly complicated procedure. He asks if I have any questions. I have three.\n\n\"If you had a family member in my spot, would you recommend this surgery?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Would you recommend he do it here?\"\n\n\"There are a couple of places I would recommend. This is one of them.\"\n\n\"Can you do this surgery?\"\n\nThe question amuses him. \"A pancreas transplant? Yes, of course I can do this surgery.\"\n\nI know enough. I want a transplant, and I want this guy to do it.\n\n******\n\nBefore I will be considered for a transplant, I need a series of tests to measure my health. My heart is checked, my circulation, my lungs, and even my teeth. A transplant recipient must be sick enough to need one and well enough to withstand one. It is not a fine line, but it is not too wide either. All my results and my medical records will be evaluated by the transplant team at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center. Christmas passes and then New Year's Day. This wait is excruciating and Laura and I tell nobody. On January 10, 2013, my phone rings while I am at work. I am listed.\n\nNow that I am on this list, I start doing a different kind of math, looking for a pattern, an \"x\" and a \"y,\" so I can calculate a probable timeline. Trouble is, the list is not linear — it is not like taking a number at the deli.\n\nTo receive a pancreas, somebody must first die. And that person has to die suddenly, and he or she has to die while still healthy. In all likelihood, that means a victim of a car crash.\n\nWhen nobody is looking, I look up numbers on traffic fatalities.\n\nTraffic safety improvements including air bags, car designs and seat belt usage have dropped the fatality rate – reducing the number of potential donors. In 2013, 923 people died in traffic fatalities in Ohio, the lowest number since the state started keeping statistics in 1936. I feel like I should not know these statistics, not like this. And that I should be happier about it now that I do.\n\nOther factors include tissue matches and blood types. The person who dies has to be a donor and close.\n\nThe process includes so many variables, each completely independent of the other, it feels more like randomness. Actually it feels more like Chaos Theory, which says seemingly random events have an underlying order. But there is no order I can see.\n\n******\n\nOn the morning of May 13, the day after Mother's Day, my phone rings.\n\nThe voice on the line is calm. \"We have a pancreas for you.\"\n\nI am at my desk in the newsroom. This transplant will change my life, save my life, change our kids' lives. But all I can think about is her tone. This is not an imperative sentence. It is not exclamatory, either. It's a simple declaration: \"We have a pancreas for you.\"\n\nI go to tell Laura; she knows when she sees my face. We race home, pack a bag and write a note to the kids. They will see it when they get home from school.\n\nAt the hospital, I learn the pancreas is being flown in, but nobody will say from where. After 4 hours, I am wheeled into an elevator and down for surgery. This is happening.\n\nI meet the anesthesiologist. I meet with Dr. Diwan, who tells me he will check the pancreas as soon as it arrives. I ask him how he will know if the pancreas is not good. Will it look funny? Will it smell funny? Will it be like chicken that has gone bad in the refrigerator? He puts his hand at the foot of my bed and tells me to try to relax.\n\nJust as I am about to be wheeled in for surgery, Dr. Diwan walks through the curtain and says he doesn't like this pancreas. An artery to the organ does not look right. \"Let's not do this,\" Diwan says. \"Wait for the right one.\" I am listening to hear if this is the start of a debate we get to have. It is not.\n\nI look around the room, at the machines, my wife, the nurses. I ask Diwan if I should just put my pants on and go home. \"Yes.\"\n\nFrom that day forward I am anxious. Every morning I am sure is the day. Every time the phone rings I map out routes to the hospital in my head. I also feel tethered; I have to be able to arrive at the hospital within one hour of receiving a phone call telling me there is a pancreas for me.\n\nI miss my father's 80th birthday party in Massachusetts. We cannot take the kids on vacation. We miss our annual trip to Fenway Park. My sister's husband is sick in Chicago; we cannot drive up to help her out. I get to know every corner of Cincinnati, and I grow to love the city, but the leash feels tight.\n\nWorse, I am just absent. I have always thought being a good dad is easy. It means being present and paying attention. It means sitting down in the kitchen while Theo has a bowl of cereal with chocolate milk and chatting about school. It means watching a football game with Henry and talking if he wants to talk, being quiet if he want to be quiet. It means kicking the soccer ball in the front yard with Luke or walking with Lucy to Graeter's so she could get a scoop of cookies-and-cream.\n\nI am not doing enough of that anymore. I am always preoccupied. I am waiting for the phone to ring.\n\nThe longer I wait, the more desperately I want the phone to ring, and it makes me feel guilty.\n\nI know somebody has to die for me to get a pancreas. The donor already seems like a ghost to me.\n\nBut I can imagine the donor's family. They are waiting for a call they do not want. Worse, they don't even know they are waiting. But that phone is going to ring, and a stranger on the line is going to tell them about an accident or a stroke or a suicide attempt.\n\nI know what those calls are like. I received one once.\n\nMy sister Maura died in a car accident when she was a junior in college and I was a freshman. We were the youngest of five children and close. She was spending a year in Europe and had left me as her emergency contact – a silly thing we did because we both thought it more likely to be arrested than get in an accident.\n\nSo I got the call from the State Department telling me my sister was dead. And then I had to call my dad. He said nothing at first. That call was the hardest and worst thing I ever had to do. Now, every day I am hoping somebody will get the same call. I am losing my humanity while I am hoping to be made whole.\n\nOn the Fourth of July, thunderstorms make driving awful. I hear an ambulance and I wonder about the condition of the person inside. I am becoming a ghoul.\n\n******\n\nThe summer passes, the kids go back to school, the Red Sox win the World Series. The weather begins to cool and the rain starts to fall. My listing anniversary is beginning to loom, and I am afraid of what this waiting is doing to me and to Laura and the kids.\n\nI tell Laura that I regret being listed and that, when we get to one year, when it is time for more tests and to be reassessed, that I won't do it. It is all too much, too selfish.\n\nOn the night of Friday, Nov. 1, All Saints Day, my phone rings at 10. Laura is upstairs putting Lucy to bed. I am in the kitchen with Theo and Luke. Henry is out with friends. It has to be Henry.\n\nThe woman on the phone has a calm voice and a southern accent. \"We have a pancreas for you.\"\n\nShe asks how I am feeling. I tell her I am fine. She asks if I have a fever, I do not.\n\nTheo and Luke, apparently, have listened intently to every call I received for the past 11 months. They stand right next to each other. They look at each other and then at me. They know right away.\n\n\"Is this it? It that the hospital?\" I nod my head and try to concentrate.\n\nThey stand on the stairs, each holding the other's arm, looking like they are boxing each other out for a rebound.\n\n\"Can we tell Mom?\"\n\n\"No,\" I say to them, \"not yet.\"\n\nThe woman on the phone asks if there is a problem.\n\nShe tells me to come in. She wants to know if I could be there in an hour. I tell her I can be there in 15 minutes. She tells me to drive safely and to report to the emergency room and then the sixth floor.\n\n\"Go tell your mother,\" I say to the boys.\n\n******\n\nLaura and I rush to the hospital, and then we wait. I cannot eat or drink, it feels impossible to sleep and it turns out I have very difficult veins to insert an IV into. I am grumpy and anxious and my arms hurt. A nurse tells us the donor \"is downstairs.\" I am no longer grumpy I just feel like a jerk.\n\nThe next morning, Kathy Daley, the transplant social worker, comes to my room. I think maybe she has come just to see me because she is that terrific. Turns out this is the first Saturday of the month and there is another transplant meeting. This is a special one: The family of a previous donor will be there.\n\nI walk down the hall with my IV stand and return to Room 6104.\n\nA couple sits at the end of the table. They are about my age. They sit quietly and then begin slowly, sharing the story of their daughter who died in an RV accident five years earlier. The mom has notes.\n\nHer daughter's name was Ellie and she was 10. They donated her organs because it felt right. \"That's what Ellie would want,\" the mother said. \"Her love language was gift-giving.\"\n\nOne by one we go around the room to thank them. It is the same group from last time, minus the woman who had been put on hold. I wonder what happened to her.\n\nWhen my turn comes, I want this family to know what it means to me. I want them to know that I have four children and a wife. I want to tell them what their gift probably meant to a person just like me.\n\nBut I can't do it. I can't say any of that. I say \"thank you\" and stop. I do not want to cry in front of them. I want them to be happy. And they have brought their daughter, Ellie's little sister. I wonder if she looked like Ellie. I wonder if she could remember her.\n\nI won't cry in front of this little girl. I stand up in my hospital gown and try to leave, but my IV stand gets stuck on the chair, and I have to yank it free. I get to the door, say thank you again and leave.\n\nAt 10 o'clock that night, they wheel me in for surgery.\n\n******\n\nTwo days earlier, on Oct. 31, at 4:40 a.m., a 27-year-old woman got into her car in North Bend. She took a right on Stephens Avenue. Then a left onto Lawrenceburg Road. She was driving alone and headed to the early shift at the post office. There were cornfields on both sides of the road.\n\nShe passed four silos, and the road began to bend left. Then back to the right again. She was just half a mile from her home when the back end of her 14-year-old Nissan began to slide out. The road was wet and her tires were old. It was 58 degrees.\n\nShe began to spin counterclockwise. She crossed the center of the road, now sideways, in the dark, at the mercy of chance and physics.\n\nShe was wearing a seat belt, but the utility pole was sitting just off the road.\n\nDoctors would declare her brain-dead 12 hours later. She was a healthy woman with a strong body and a devastating head injury. A perfect organ donor. She was a wife and the mother of four children. Her heart kept beating.\n\nI see a light and hear sounds. I do not know where I am. I fall back to sleep and wake again. Now I can distinguish voices and beeps. I am in a hospital.\n\nI reach out for Laura, I know she will be there. In all the world I want to know only one thing. Did it work?\n\n\"Yes,\" Laura says, \"it worked.\"\n\nFor the first time in 35 years, I am not a diabetic. I fall back to sleep, a new pancreas working inside of me.\n\nThe following morning I am in the surgical intensive care unit. I have a central line in my neck, an IV in my arm, a catheter in my penis, a tube down my nose, a drainage tube coming from my stomach. My incision is held together by 20 metal staples, and I am wearing \"medical mittens\" so I cannot pull any of it out.\n\nThe nurse tells me to get up. \"Like, stand up?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she says, \"you must walk.\"\n\nLess than 12 hours after surgery, I walk through the SICU, singing a song from the \"The Brady Bunch\" which falls into my head: \"I think I'll go for a walk outside, yeah, the summer sun's calling my name.\" The drugs apparently agree with me.\n\nI say hello to each person I come across in the hallway like this is the greatest day in the world. I am standing up and I am walking. I am not taking insulin. This is easy.\n\nOver the next few days I learn that having a catheter is bad, and that getting it out is worse. I also learn the benefits of morphine. I am not permitted to eat or drink anything in the first six days after surgery. I have an IV to hydrate me and give me medicine. I feel tired but good.\n\nDr. Diwan visits every day and each time asks me how I am feeling. One the third day I tell him I feel great; that I am not a diabetic anymore. I begin to cry and am immediately embarrassed. He nods his head, his face unreadable. He has seen success and he has seen failure. He puts his hand again at the foot of my bed, I realize this is a thing he does. He looks at Laura and then me and says, slowly, \"This is going to be a hard road.\"\n\n******\n\nI wrote a story once about a little girl named Amber who had cancer. Her mother noticed that Amber's vital signs got better when her sisters were in the room. When my kids come to visit for the first time, I understand. Lying in my hospital bed, I can close my eyes and hear them and pretend I am at home.\n\nLaura has warned the kids that I was sick, that I have tubes coming out of my neck and nose and arm and stomach, that I am not regular old dad.\n\nHenry, 15 at the time, doesn't visit the first day. I think he does not want to see me sick. I think he figures I would not want him to see me sick. I had told him I would be fine and that is good enough for him.\n\nTheo, 12, does not want to look at me, but he wants to be near me. He stands next to the bed, places his hand on my head and looks away. He wants me to know he is close.\n\nLuke, 11, walks in and gives me a hug. I do my best not to cry.\n\nLucy, 7, looks at me, assesses the room and starts asking the nurse questions. What's that blue thing? What is in that tube? Where is his old pancreas?\n\nEvery couple of hours my blood sugar gets checked – the easiest way to make sure my new pancreas is still working. Two days after surgery, I start the day at 79, but then start creeping up: 79, 85, 112, 146. This feels like diabetes to me. I know this feeling. I hate this feeling.\n\nThis increase can mean only one of two things: my blood sugar is rising because of the trauma my body is experiencing or my pancreas is starting to fail.\n\nDoctors and nurses are confident it is the first scenario. And, yes, they have actual training and experience, but I'm sure they are wrong. I begin to worry.\n\nTwo hours later, another blood sugar test. This time, I am 112. I fall asleep while Laura sits next to the bed.\n\nDoctors are pounding me with anti-rejection medicine. My immune system is being suppressed so that my body will not reject the new organ. Three or four days in, and I begin to feel lousy from no food, bad sleep and heavy drugs. I tell Laura I feel like I made a mistake. I start to cry, again. I am 48 years old, and I have cried five times since I was a kid. I cried at the birth of each of our children. I cried when my sister died. I cry this day and tell Laura I fear I have made a mistake. For the first time I question why I did this. Dr. Diwan tells me the drugs will make me emotional.\n\nLaura opens her computer and reads emails and entries from friends on Facebook. People are thinking of me. People are sending their thoughts. And people are praying. I mean, really praying.\n\nJennifer Wheeler tells me a group of Mormons in Mesa, Ariz., are praying for me. Rachel Greene has a friend of hers write my name on a piece of paper and put the piece of paper in the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem. Father Tom O'Hara, a longtime friend, says a prayer for me while saying Mass at St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City. The children of the Goodykoontz family and the Pichler family and the Fleury family all add me to their bedtime prayers. A group at a Methodist Church makes a prayer blanket for me. A Jewish temple in Phoenix prays.\n\nI have never been a person who prays, but these prayers make me feel cared for, lighter. I don't know yet how much I will need them.\n\n******\n\nI spend one week in the hospital. A week of optimism followed by certainty that I was failing, that my new pancreas was not going to work and I would let everybody down.\n\nMy parents come to visit and they look so worried. On their last visit, my father kisses my head and my mother stands next to the bed just looking at me. They are worried. I decide right then I need to get a mirror so I can see what I look like. It must be awful.\n\nThe kids come every night. Henry starts coming too. He is quiet and sweet and a little bit nervous. I am sicker than he expected: I am pale, I have already lost a lot of weight. Each night Laura takes the kids home and then returns. She is always here, sitting at my bed, trying hard to look not worried. She watches everything. I need her.\n\nThe doctors and nurses had told me I would feel awful after the surgery, but I thought the rules would not apply to me. I am exhausted and hungry and my cheeks are hollowing out, but I begin to make progress. Thursday the tube in my nose comes out and I get to have something to drink. Friday I get chicken broth. Saturday I am allowed real food. I order a ham and cheese omelet, and it tastes so good. It feels like I am in Paris.\n\nLater this morning, one week after surgery, Dr. Diwan tells me I will go home the next day. That seems preposterous but he says the pancreas is working and that my body is handling the drugs well. I tell him how awful I feel, and he says that is normal for a person who had major surgery and is on a new drug protocol. Our positions are changing. I am beginning to think this will not last, he is beginning to think it will.\n\nAt 3:30 I take my first shower since my surgery a week earlier. I want to make myself look better before I go home.\n\nI still have a central line in my neck and a drainage tube in my stomach. Laura helps me cover them with an adhesive plastic. I take the shower and return to the room feeling weak and tired. I cannot get the plastic off my neck without pulling at the central line and need Laura to help untangle me.\n\nNow I am standing naked in the middle of the room. I am dripping wet. I have lost so much weight. I feel awful and pale and dizzy. I am tired and I am wearing flip-flops.\n\n\"Get out!\" I tell my wife.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Get out, close the door!\"\n\n\"John, no, you need help.\"\n\n\"Get out. I've lost so much. I have no dignity left.\"\n\nThen I cry again.\n\nI feel awful about everything. That she has to see me this way. That I have become so pathetic. That I have done this to us. That I am sick and she has to take care of me.\n\nLaura smiles and leaves the room. I put on clothes, real clothes and sit for a while. When she comes back I tell her I am sorry.\n\nLaura, kindly, says this is me becoming human again, a little spark of the actual me. That night I feel better. My sister Sally comes to visit from Toronto. Laura, Sally and I, plus all the kids, sit around the room while Theo, Luke and Lucy ask us riddles from a book.\n\nLater, Sally takes the kids home. Laura climbs into my hospital bed and we watch TV. She puts her head on my chest and falls immediately asleep. I turn off the television so I can hear her breathing.\n\n******\n\nThe next morning I walk out of the hospital. The air is crisp, the sun is shining and I cannot quite stand up straight because of the six inches of metal stitches running up my belly. I was nervous about going home, but now I am excited. Lucy comes down the stairs to the front door. Doctors have told me I cannot lift anything heavier than a gallon of milk for at least six weeks. I cannot pick her up, but she stands on the stairs while I kneel down and hug her. I try to cry silently, but she notices. She says: \"Dad?\" She has never seen me cry. A moment later, louder and more worried: \"Mom?\" Laura tells her these are tears of joy.\n\nThe boys and I watch football and I eat some macaroni and cheese, and then take Henry to his high school football banquet. It is a great day. I am better than I expect. I am better than the kids expect. The next day, Monday, I feel even better. I get a haircut, I go grocery shopping, which means I actually do something useful for the family.\n\nI will go to the post-transplant clinic three times a week for the first few months. I'll get my blood drawn and wait for my results to come back. I will be weighed and talk to the nurses and doctors and social workers and the pharmacist. I get the sense that doctors and nurses just want to get a look at me. The first day, my numbers look good.\n\nTwo days later, Wednesday, Nov. 13, my pancreas is still working, but I no longer feel good. There will be no grocery shopping or getting a haircut today. I just feel weak and tired. I figure it is my weight. I have lost 16 pounds in the 11 days since the surgery and am down to 161 pounds. I have been feeling nauseated and cannot eat. Maybe the drugs are getting to me, too.\n\nAfter my blood draw, they let me go home. They say they can call me with the results. It almost feels like the flu. Great.\n\nThe kids are back in school, and I have insisted that Laura return to work. The house is quiet. I try to read and then I try to watch TV. I can't do either.\n\nLate that afternoon, as the sun is beginning to set, Dr. Gautham Mogilishetty calls me. He is smart and funny and likeable. He combines what he knows from test results with what he can see with his eyes.\n\nI am struck right away by how serious he sounds. He gets right to it: \"Your bone marrow is beginning to wake up. It is beginning to make cells that we believe will be used to create antibodies to look for your pancreas.\"\n\nHe is explaining something to me but I feel so tired. I am looking for a word that makes sense, something I can grab on to. Then he says it, the only word I don't want to hear: \"This is the start of rejection.\"\n\nMogilishetty says I need to get back to the hospital immediately. \"We should not wait,\" he says. \"We would like to cut off the head of the snake.\"\n\nThis is the news I have been both dreading and expecting. My body is turning against itself.\n\nAt the hospital I learn the medical field's double-word trick. Mogilishetty tells me that I am experiencing \"rejection,\" but that this is not \"rejection-rejection.\"\n\nEven though this is just one \"rejection,\" I will be treated with an aggressive drug therapy. It starts with plasmapheresis, which will remove the plasma portion of my blood where the antibodies are located. After the plasmapheresis, I will receive a drug cocktail of Rituximab and Bortezomib which will combat things on a cellular level. I am told this is a form of chemotherapy, but it is not \"chemotherapy-chemotherapy.\"\n\nI will later realize that it does not matter how many times they say the word, those drugs will make me feel awful. Even awful-awful.\n\n******\n\nIt is unusual to start plasmapheresis at this time of night, so a man needs to be called in. Lying in the bed, waiting, I begin to understand the scope of what is happening. My own body is trying to betray me. Nurses are hovering and Dr. Mogilishetty stays late. I get sent downstairs to get a port inserted into my chest because I need a series of treatments.\n\nJoseph shows up with a machine that looks like it could be used in dialysis and in fact is. He is an older guy, bald-headed and reminds me immediately of Scatman Crothers. He tells me I am in his prayers and the prayers of his entire family. He puts his hand on my foot and says: \"They know about you, and they are praying for you, too.\" I believe him.\n\nThe machine makes a rhythmic noise. I see the blood leave me and then come back. Joseph sits and watches the machine. Laura is there, watching him watch the machine. I am afraid, but I am tired. I fall asleep.\n\nThe next day I am released again. The beginning of a revolving door for me. This anti-rejection treatment calls for four treatments over nine days, and doctors warn that the side effects will accumulate. By Friday I can't eat, read or sleep and Lucy has a violin recital. This is my chance to let her know I can still do dad things. If something is important to her it is still important to me. I got this pancreas transplant so I could be there for her, so I will take her to this recital.\n\nIt's somewhere on the University of Cincinnati campus and I don't know where. Now Lucy is getting nervous about the time, and I park on the wrong side of campus. We run to the building and I am sweating through my coat. We make it, but barely. Her instructor gets her on stage, and I collapse on the chair. I am terrified at how much it takes out of me.\n\n******\n\nAfter my second treatment, I begin to lose faith. The anti-rejection treatment is more powerful than I knew. I am exhausted and cannot sleep, I have diarrhea and cannot eat. I begin to feel less than human. I am surviving, but that's it. I am back home but I can see the way the kids are looking at me. It feels like I am watching the world through a tube, and the tube is getting longer. I never expected to be this sick. It does not make sense to me.\n\nIt is mid-November and I know that if I am going to lose this pancreas, it is probably going to be now. Then, my blood sugar starts to feel high. I am certain the efforts to stop the rejection have failed. At 7:30 that night, my blood sugar is 252. It should not be above 150. Thirty minutes later, I am at 269.\n\nLaura is crying, the kids hear us whispering and I feel like I have failed, that I have let everyone down. All the people who prayed for me wasted their time.\n\n\"I won't do this again,\" I say to Laura.\n\nI need to talk to Dr. Amit Govil. He is in charge of my post-transplant care and he is smart and compassionate. He is a man of faith and science. \"When I am here, I believe in medicine,\" Govil will tell me. \"But I do believe in karma.\"\n\nGovil agrees that a blood sugar level of 269 is far too high, but he tells me I am looking at just one indicator of a pancreas' health, and he is looking at many. These feel like empty words to me. I go to bed, exhausted and defeated.\n\nI wake at 3:42 in the morning. The house is silent and asleep. I slip out of bed, walk downstairs and sit at the dining room table. I have a blood-test strip in my hand. One drop of my blood will tell me everything. But I do not want to use it. I already know the pancreas has failed.\n\nI sit at the table thinking what words I can say to Laura to express my gratitude and how sorry I am. What will we tell the kids? They have been through so much. How do I explain this to all of our friends, all the people who prayed for me?\n\nThen I start composing a letter in my head to the unknown family of the person who had donated the pancreas. I have taken this gift and ruined it. I have failed them. I do not know the words to tell them that I appreciate their gift and that I have screwed it up. How do I write a letter to this family to say thank you and I'm sorry at once? Will it be like another death for them?\n\nIf my blood sugar is high, the pancreas has failed and I am diabetic again. I feel like I am the only person awake in the world.\n\nWhy have I done this? I had been healthy, or healthy enough, and now I am up in the middle of the night composing a letter in my head.\n\nI take the test.\n\nMy blood sugar is 103. The pancreas is working. I sit at the table and cry. I am embarrassed. And relieved. I climb back into bed and tell Laura I am fine.\n\n******\n\nI still can't eat. Laura keeps asking me what I want, she says she can make anything in the world. But I cannot get myself to eat. A friend who knows I am sick and not eating brings me brownies laced with marijuana. I hope the pot will stop my nausea and spur my appetite.\n\nAn hour later I learn that pot is much stronger than it was 20 plus years ago. I do not get high, I get very high. I do want to eat, but I am not capable of making food. I go to the kitchen and become a sitcom. I am hungry and giggling and cannot figure out how to make food. I eat chips because I can open a bag. I text Laura and ask her to come home. I tell her I ate too much brownie.\n\nI decide pot is not for me. I am always tired and always cold. Each day I get up, put on a hat and scarf, a T-shirt, long-sleeved shirt, and a sweater, long underwear and pants, and go downstairs and sit on the big orange chair in the family room. I will stay there until I go back upstairs for a nap. I have lost 20 pounds in 20 days. I am coughing worse than ever. It is a hacking cough that begins to hurt my back. The next day I break.\n\nOn Friday, Nov. 22, after my blood draw, I put my coat over my head under the fluorescent light and fall asleep in the exam room. Jane Revollo, the transplant pharmacist, wakes me, and I start coughing and cannot stop. Then I cannot catch my breath. Finally the room is quiet, I hear the white paper crinkling underneath me. I am not in control of anything. I start to cry. I do not feel like much of a man. I say: \"You have got to help me.\"\n\nRevollo knows me by this point. She looks at me, writes something down and says she will help me. A string of doctors and nurses comes in and asks me questions. They order an X-ray for my lungs. I have pneumonia.\n\nFor the first time I begin to think I might actually die. Not suddenly and dramatically, but just kind of become a sick guy who eventually catches something and fades away. It doesn't feel scary to me, just kind of pathetic.\n\n******\n\nThat weekend, the kids start very getting nervous around me which makes me feel awful. They don't want to make noise in the house. They are checking to see how much I am eating and drinking. I mix my food up on the plate like I'm avoiding eating my vegetables; I fool nobody. Each time I cough, the kids look at me anxiously. Laura is becoming a caretaker. I had this transplant so they would never have to see this. I am a fool.\n\nOur friend Megan comes to visit. She takes me to a doctor's appointment, sits with me, holding my hand while I close my eyes and fall asleep. She is quiet for perhaps the first time in her life. I am sicker than she expected.\n\nOn Monday Nov. 25, three days before Thanksgiving, I wait again for my blood tests. Mogilishetty walks into the room and pauses. He gives me a hard look and says: \"We need to readmit you. You look awful.\"\n\nI am back in the hospital, and I am not sure what I will be thankful for. The new pancreas, certainly, but it feels like I am getting sicker, not better. Turns out I have pneumonia and it is in both lungs, and it is bad. The doctors bombard me with antibiotics for two days and on Wednesday allow me to go home.\n\nMy family was coming in for Thanksgiving because we were going to have so much to be thankful for. I ask them not to come, which feels like a defeat. Every year I cook the turkey at our house and make a big production out of it. I look for the latest methods, I consider brining and dry-salting, going with super-high temperatures or going low and slow. This year I just kind of stick it in the oven. When it is done, I ask Henry to carve. He is gracious and grabs the knife, but this feels sad to me. I should be able to cut a turkey, but my hands shake from the drugs and I am just so tired. I cannot do it.\n\nDuring grace, we say a prayer for the person who gave me her pancreas. That night I start getting an odd pain in my lower abdomen.\n\nThe next 10 days are more of the same. My weight is now into the low 150s and I remain cold from morning till night. Laura buys me a heating pad to sleep with, which means I am now officially elderly. On Dec. 6, a Friday, I have another appointment. When I am finished I walk through the basement at the UC Medical Center.\n\nBy now I know each of the 226 steps to the lobby. But this day I cannot make it. I see a bench across from a vending machine. It is only 72 steps to that bench, and I have to concentrate to get there. Now I am sitting, and I am despondent. I am more than a month out of surgery, and I feel worse than I ever have.\n\nDr. Govil happens past the bench and stops. \"Can you not walk from here to there?\" Govil says, pointing to the lobby. \"Today I cannot,\" I tell him. He says he will arrange a meeting with all the doctors on Monday. It is time, he says, for me to get better. He says not to worry, but he looks back when he walks away. He looks worried.\n\n******\n\nTwo days later, at 3 a.m. Sunday, I wake to a stabbing pain. I have not ever felt a pain like it. I am doubled over in bed, and Laura begins to panic. She has never seen me like this. She wants to take me to the emergency room.\n\nI say, let's wait. I have an appointment with all doctors on Monday. This night in bed, when the pain stops, I tell her that sometimes I think about going off my anti-rejection medicine. My body would turn on the new pancreas, the organ would fail and I would go back to being a diabetic. This now feels like control. Laura reminds me that I am not thinking clearly. I remember the person who died and gave me this gift and realize I could never do that.\n\nAt 5, the pain returns. Laura says we are going to the ER. I am admitted and assessed. I am asked to rate my pain level on a scale of one-to-10. Out of pride I have never said anything above a four. This morning I say \"10.\" Doctors put me on Dilaudid which is described as \"hospital heroin.\" After the drugs I relax, and get scans of my abdomen.\n\nA couple of hours later, the ER doctor comes to my bed and says: \"Your pancreas does not look right.\" It is swollen and surrounded by a \"fluid.\" This is called pancreatitis and stranding. That's all he knows. They are going to send me upstairs when a room is available. The words echo in my head: \"Your pancreas does not look right.\"\n\nThis is my fifth stay on the sixth floor. My children are seeing me as weak and old. I tell Laura I am sorry for sitting in a chair all day. I tell her I hate that orange chair. Some person gave me a pancreas and I am blowing it. The kids try to stay quiet in the house and they never squabble anymore because they don't want to bother me. What kind of dad is that?\n\nThe same night, in our home, Lucy has had enough as well. She tells Laura she is afraid and confused. She thinks they are going to take my pancreas back. Laura picks her up and they both cry.\n\nI know my pancreas has failed inside of me. But three days later, the pain goes away and the hospital releases me. Govil says my pancreatitis was likely because of an imbalance caused by a fast arterial flow to the organ and a slow venal flow from it. Perhaps my body finally achieved balance. He smiles.\n\nBut I still cannot eat. For my weigh-ins, I start keeping my coat on, and I wear boots to my appointments because I do not want to see the scale drop below 150. But I know the truth. I am 6 feet 1 inch tall, and my weight is now in the 140s. All I am is sickness. Until the day I wasn't.\n\n******\n\nWhen the change finally happened, I did not even notice it. For a few days in a row, I didn't get better, I just didn't get worse. And then I stayed there until the morning of Dec. 20.\n\nI wake that morning with a feeling I cannot recognize: I sit at the edge of the bed and realize I am hungry. By the middle of the day I don't just want to eat, I want to eat a cheeseburger from Terry's Turf Club. We go that night, and Laura smiles through the whole meal. Terry's makes a delicious burger, and a big one. And I eat the whole thing. With bacon. I feel like an actual human being, and I am eating a cheeseburger.\n\nThe next day is the first of winter and the shortest day of the year, but at 11 in the morning the sun comes out and the temperature begins to rise. I decide when I see the sun that I am going to ride my bike. I love to ride. I am not a serious rider. I don't wear a racing shirt or obscene shorts. I just love the feeling of a hard, 45-minute ride.\n\nI promise Laura that I will just go a mile or two and turn around the moment I feel tired. Theo needs convincing, too. I tell them I need to start doing things to actually get stronger, that waiting around will not do it. Theo gives me the green light and Laura relents.\n\nI bring out my bike and go into the house for my helmet. When I return, our neighbor, Horst, has his bike parked next to mine. He walks out the door, his pants legs already rolled up. I see that his jeans are lined. \"I will come with you,\" he says.\n\nI make an effort to say no. Horst puts on his helmet. We turn out of the driveway. Horst stays behind me. The sun is strong, the wind is brisk and I am propelling myself, dependent on nobody. I go faster than I should.\n\nI make it to Delta Avenue, all of 1.2 miles and my legs are burning, my lungs gasping. Horst says maybe we turn around now.\n\nI turn around and Horst stays behind me, saying nothing. I am not sure if he is protecting me from traffic or just letting me be alone.\n\nI understand now the network of people who have helped me. Not just my family, but my neighbors, and my co-workers, my friends close and far. They have brought food and prayed and dropped by. They have called and emailed and driven our children to school.\n\nAfter the ride, I walk into the kitchen, out of breath and already limping. Theo is glad to see me. Henry smiles at me, and Luke asks if I need Mom. Yes, I say, tell her I am back.\n\n******\n\nOn the morning of Christmas Eve, Laura reminds me that we have a large dollhouse that needs to be built for Lucy. I go up to our room, lock the door and open the box for the Barbie beach house. This dollhouse has four stories and an elevator and a three-car garage and outdoor staircases and a working toilet.\n\nMore than 60 pieces are held together by 119 screws. Teeny tiny little screws.\n\nMy hands still shake from the medicine, and they always will. I need to focus when I pick up a glass to drink, but I am going to do this. Placing the screws on the head of the screwdriver is difficult. Getting them in the holes feels impossible.\n\nI call Henry up to help and he says he is glad to help. He sticks out his hand for the screwdriver and I change my mind. This is something I need to do. I am the dad, I make the presents for Lucy. It takes me half a day and it nearly breaks me, but I do it. I am so proud of myself.\n\n******\n\nChristmas morning feels normal. We wake up early, go through stockings and then down for presents. Lucy loves her dollhouse. We eat a big breakfast and then, late in the morning, the house gets quiet.\n\nI begin to see what I have gained. I had spent so much energy the past 35 years trying to manage my diabetes, and I am not doing that any more. I had a series of bad breaks after surgery, but I have remarkable care. I have a family that loves me. I have made it through, and so has this pancreas. It is working. I felt my body coming back to life.\n\nOn December 30, I get my blood drawn again. Now I am well enough to appreciate all the people who have taken care of me. Three days a week Brian Lewis has been sticking a needle in my arm. When you are sick, when you are getting poked and prodded and going from appointment to appointment, you begin to appreciate people who do their job well. The ones who make you feel human. He is one of them.\n\nLewis is known in the hospital as a good \"stick\" man. He glides that needle in and it doesn't even hurt and he treats me like a human being. Today I can finally appreciate it. I thank him, Lewis smiles and says: \"Nothing to it but to do it.\"\n\nDr. Mogilishetty walks into the exam room for another routine appointment. He stops again at the door and looks at me. Looks at my eyes. He asks me how I feel. I tell him I feel strong. I tell him about the burger and the bike. He says my blood work looks good. He looks at me again and tells me, \"It is time for a change.\"\n\nHe tells me this is no longer about survival, he says now I am in recovery. I can eat what I want, do whatever I feel capable of doing. He tells me to stay away from sick people, to gain weight and to get stronger. I ask if I am still restricted about what I could pick up. \"Pick up what you want,\" Mogilishetty says.\n\nThat day, for the first time since I left for the hospital I pick up Lucy. It feels like I had never done it before. It feels like I did it yesterday. Later I find Theo. He still lets me pick him up sometimes. Just before, he says: \"Are you sure?\" I am sure.\n\n******\n\nOne month later, The Enquirer arranges a photograph of me and all the people who helped to take care of me at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center. Dr. Diwan and Dr. Mogilishetty are here. Dr. Govil and Dr. Cuffey. Crazy Kathy, Sweet Jane, Brian Lewis, the woman who called me to tell me I got a pancreas. People whose names I never even knew. People who took care of me when I was so sick I could not remember how well they treated me, but I know they did. I take Lucy with me because I want her to know them. All of them.\n\nI am going to stand in front of them and show them that I am healthy. They are going to see what they have done with their medicine and their compassion. I am going to tell them how they changed me and made me better. That I believe in my future and that I am not afraid anymore.\n\nI am going to thank them and I am not going to cry, because I am strong. I want them to be proud of me. And then, before I can say a word, I start to cry.\n\nI tried again and I stopped. They all looked at me. Dr. Diwan says I cannot blame this on the medicine any more. I try again. I want them to know that they have changed everything for me. But I cannot do it.\n\nI turn, instead, and introduce them to Lucy.\n\nHow to donate\n\nIf you would like to become a donor, or to learn more about organ donations, people in Ohio or Kentucky can go to the following websites:\n\nwww.donatelifeky.org | www.donatelifeohio.org\n\nFor Arizona residents:\n\nSign up online at www.DonateLifeAZ.org, call 1-800-94-DONOR, or check the box to become a donor when applying for a driver's license or state ID at the Motor Vehicle Division.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/06/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/01/07/drive-lawmaking-masked-mardi-gras-virtual-farm-show-news-around-states/115265388/", "title": "Drive-in lawmaking, masked Mardi Gras: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuscaloosa: The University of Alabama is requiring that students who will live on campus for the spring 2021 semester must be tested for coronavirus, officials said. The tests must happen within seven days of their arrival, no later than Jan. 19. The spring semester will begin Jan. 13. The university will offer free testing, or students can choose to get tested before returning to Tuscaloosa. Test results are expected to be provided within 24 hours to three days. The spring reentry testing is only required for those living on campus, including in residence halls and fraternity and sorority houses. In addition to reentry testing, the university is continuing to conduct a variety of testing for all students, including sentinel, for-cause, exposure and symptomatic testing. More details about the testing can be found on the university’s website.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Residents 65 and over will be able to start receiving COVID-19 vaccinations next week, state health officials said. The Department of Health and Social Services announced that people in that age group can start scheduling appointments Wednesday on the state’s vaccine website, the Anchorage Daily News reports. People were asked to choose appointments for Monday or later, officials said. Alaska last month received more than 60,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccine produced by Pfizer and Moderna and expects almost 53,000 additional doses this month. Health care workers were the first eligible to get the vaccine. A state allocation committee determined last week that people 65 and older would make up the next phase of recipients. But state officials had said the vaccine would not be available to the more than 90,000 Alaskans in that group until late this month. Gov. Mike Dunleavy announced the new timeline for seniors’ vaccinations at a presentation Monday to the Anchorage Chamber of Commerce, saying people over 65 are among the groups hardest hit by the coronavirus.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state on Wednesday reported a triple-digit number of additional COVID-19 deaths for the second day in a row along with more than 7,200 additional known cases and another record high of virus-related hospitalizations. Arizona has the worst coronavirus diagnosis rate in the country, with 1 of every 119 people in the state being diagnosed in the past week. According to the state coronavirus dashboard, Arizona had a record 4,877 COVID-19 patients occupying hospital beds as of Tuesday. The Department of Health Services reported 127 additional deaths and 7,206 cases, increasing the state’s totals since the pandemic began to 574,680 cases and 9,444 deaths. Meanwhile, a group of Tucson bars on Tuesday filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn Pima County’s mandatory 10 p.m. curfew as unconstitutional, discriminatory and ineffective at combating the spread of COVID-19, the Arizona Daily Star reports. And the Arizona National Guard has begun training retired medical professionals and current medical students who have volunteered to support COVID-19 vaccination sites statewide.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state on Tuesday adjusted its rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine as the number of coronavirus patients in Arkansas hospitals continued hitting record levels. Gov. Asa Hutchinson said the state will move police, firefighters and other first responders to the first phase of vaccines being administered. Hutchinson said the state is also adjusting the second phase to include people 70 and older, rather than the original plan that called for people 75 and older. Hutchinson said the plan is to administer the vaccine to those in the first phase, which also includes health care workers and nursing home residents and staff, by the end of January before moving on to the next phase. The state’s virus cases rose by 4,107, its second-highest single-day jump. The number of people hospitalized because of COVID-19 rose by 27 to a new high of 1,323. Thirty-six more people died from COVID-19, bringing the state’s total fatalities to 3,836. “What we are seeing now is what I and all of us have warned about, and that is a surge on top of a surge,” Dr. Jose Romero, the state’s health secretary, said at a news conference. “How much of the second surge we have on top of that first surge is unknown.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The state is so swamped by the coronavirus pandemic that it has ordered hospitals with room to accept patients from others that have maxed out on intensive care beds. The public health order issued late Tuesday is the latest attempt by California authorities to confront a surge in coronavirus infections and hospitalizations, a deteriorating situation that could worsen before it gets better, as gatherings during the recent holidays could accelerate cases. The order, which will last three weeks, could result in patients being shipped to Northern California from Southern California and the agricultural San Joaquin Valley, where 14 counties were immediately ordered to delay nonessential “and non-life-threatening” surgeries in order to provide beds. The directive also applies to any county where ICU capacity to treat COVID-19 patients is bottoming out. “If we continue to see an alarming increase of COVID-19 patient admissions at hospitals statewide, some facilities may not be able to provide the critical and necessary care Californians need, whether those patients have COVID-19 or another medical condition,” said Dr. Tomás J. Aragón, the state’s public health officer.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The Colorado Department of Transportation estimates it will receive $150 million from the coronavirus pandemic relief bill Congress passed late last year. The state Transportation Commission on Monday approved a proposal to spend the stimulus money on more than a dozen projects, Colorado Public Radio reports. The funding includes $9.7 million for new noise walls along Interstate 25 in the Denver area and $25.5 million for a grade-separated interchange in Colorado Springs. The projects are meant to take a “meaningful bite” out of the transportation department’s 10-year plan, Executive Director Shoshana Lew said. “We’re not trying to do everything because we just can’t,” Lew said Monday. Planned improvements also include repairs to U.S. 50 between Grand Junction and Delta, a new transit hub at I-25 near Berthoud and repaving projects on rural roads statewide. There is also expected to be $2 million set aside for the department’s Revitalizing Main Streets program, which has helped cities create pandemic-era public spaces such as car-free streets.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Greeted by hundreds of protesters, lawmakers on Wednesday officially convened what will be a highly unusual and possibly contentious legislative session that’s expected to mostly take place in the virtual world because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the extraordinary circumstances, Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont urged the General Assembly during a pretaped address not to allow COVID-19 to place limitations on this session. While Democrats, who control the House of Representatives and Senate, appeared to agree with Lamont’s optimism, the two top Republican leaders were less enthusiastic about taking on major issues outside of the budget and the pandemic, especially since members of the public will have limited ability to express their views to lawmakers. Beginning Thursday, legislative committees will meet on Zoom and YouTube. The Capitol has been closed to the general public since March. Many of the protesters Wednesday voiced concern about a legislative effort to eliminate the religious exemption from required vaccinations for schoolchildren. Some held signs that read, “God is my scientist,” “Let me call the shots,” and “My body, my choice.”\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Democratic Gov. John Carney is urging public school officials to resume hybrid instruction mixing both remote and in-person learning next week after recommending last month that classroom instruction be put on hold because of the coronavirus. Carney, joined by Director of Public Health Dr. Karyl Rattay and Education Secretary Susan Bunting, sent an open letter to school leaders, teachers and parents urging the resumption of hybrid instruction starting next Monday. That decision came just days after Carney continued to maintain schools were “safe places” and should continue using a hybrid approach of in-person and virtual classroom instruction. “As we have said many times, we do not believe there is a public health reason to close schools,” Tuesday’s letter said. “We have spent the past four weeks helping schools try to address the operational challenges they are experiencing. And we can all agree that students learn best when they’re in school. In addition to the more robust and engaging instruction that in-person learning allows, many students rely on schools for meals, counseling, and social and emotional support.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: D.C. reported 316 new cases of the coronavirus and five new deaths Wednesday, WUSA-TV reports. It was the first time in two weeks the city had reported more than 300 cases in a single day, with the average having hovered around 250 new cases and four deaths per day.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: About 1,700 South Florida teachers who have been working remotely during the coronavirus pandemic have been ordered to return to their campuses when the spring semester begins next Monday. Some teachers say they are living in fear as principals and Broward County school administrators each say it is the other’s responsibility to approve future remote work, the South Florida Sun Sentinel reports. “Some of us have conditions that specifically state if we catch this virus, we’re dead,” said Anne Skurnick, a computer science teacher in Pembroke Pines, who has been teaching remotely due to the effects of medicine she takes for rheumatoid arthritis. “No one is taking responsibility for extending accommodations.” The district wants to eliminate “overflow rooms,” where students sit in large areas with students from other classes and take online classes from a remotely working teacher. “They’d rather us take a leave and have no certified teacher to teach,” Skurnick told the newspaper. “So it’s better to have a sub than a teacher from home?” South Florida has been especially hard-hit by COVID-19.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: For the second straight year, the city is canceling its traditional and nationally renowned St. Patrick’s Day events because of the coronavirus pandemic. Mayor Van Johnson announced Tuesday during his first weekly update of 2021 that he spoke with health officials and city leaders before making the decision to cancel this year’s celebrations, WTOC-TV reports. “I hoped and prayed that our situation might improve,” Johnson said. “But I think that with what we witnessed this holiday season, we put the health of our city and our citizens at risk.” The mayor cited behavior by residents and visitors over the holidays as an example of why they do not feel confident in allowing the parade to happen. “If we could not manage this during a holiday weekend, how could we manage St. Patrick’s Day?” Johnson asked. Chatham County has reported 13,308 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 230 deaths and nearly 1,070 people hospitalized as a result of the virus, the state Department of Health reported Tuesday. The mayor said he believes things may have been different regarding the parade if there had been a statewide mask mandate.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state has announced it’s suspending all surfing competitions because of concerns about the coronavirus pandemic. The decision Tuesday means at least two World Surf League events will be canceled – the Jaws Championships that was planned for January to March in Pe’ahi, Maui, and the Sunset Open that was scheduled for Jan. 19-28 on the North Shore of Oahu, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism said protecting health and safety drove the decision because it would be difficult to enforce crowd sizes on public property. “Following many discussions with health and natural resource leaders of the state to find a way forward for future surf contests in Hawaii, we have determined that the state will be suspending surf competitions at this time,” the department said in a statement. The Billabong Pipe Masters had been held on the North Shore of Oahu in December under a film permit approved by the city and state. That competition did not allow fans in person.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: COVID-19 vaccinations for 130,000 front-line health care workers and long-term care residents should be finished by the end of January, Gov. Brad Little said Tuesday. The Republican governor said the timeline for the first round of vaccinations in the state depends on Idaho continuing to receive the vaccine from the federal government. He also said it’s not clear what percentage of people in the first group will opt to get vaccinated. Through Monday, more than 20,000 doses had been administered of the two-shot vaccine. Little’s objective is to distribute the vaccine’s limited supply to preserve health care capacity and protect the most vulnerable. “Believe me, we want to get vaccines in arms and get through this pandemic as fast as possible,” Little said during an AARP call-in program Tuesday. Idaho can expect to receive 20,000 vaccinations per week going forward, health officials said at a news conference. That adds up to about a million people being vaccinated for 2021. Idaho has about 1.8 million residents, though the currently available vaccines aren’t certified for children under 16.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The state will make COVID-19 vaccinations available to residents 65 and older in the next inoculation phase, Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced Wednesday, as Illinois neared 1 million infections since the pandemic began. The age threshold is lower than a government advisory panel’s recommendation of 75 and older. Pritzker said it was lowered in Illinois to make distribution more equitable, citing data showing elderly Black and Latino residents die at younger average ages from COVID-19. “For people of color, multigenerational institutional racism in the provision of health care has reduced access to care, caused higher rates of environmental and social risk, and increased comorbidities,” Pritzker told reporters. “I believe our exit plan for this pandemic must overcome structural inequalities that have allowed COVID-19 to rage through our most vulnerable communities.” Illinois logged 7,569 new confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19 on Wednesday and 139 related deaths. Overall, Illinois has reported 999,288 cases and 17,096 deaths.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state reported 6,214 new coronavirus cases Wednesday and an additional 80 deaths, as the weekly update of Indiana’s county metrics map depicted an even redder state than the one shown last week. The newly reported cases and deaths bring the state’s totals to 539,229 cases and 8,371 deaths. Out of the state’s 92 counties, 35 were orange for the second-highest level of viral spread, and the remainder fell in the red category. Last week 46 were coded orange, one yellow and the rest red. The number of counties facing the highest level of restrictions also rose. Last week, 41 counties shaded orange on restrictions, and the rest were red. This week all but 27 counties are shaded red. A county must be shaded orange for two weeks on the overall metric before it can move out to a lower advisory level. All of the state’s counties remain in the red for having 200 or more coronavirus cases per 100,000 residents. State Health Commissioner Dr. Kristina Box has said she would like to see every county in the blue category of fewer than 10 cases per 100,000 residents.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The number of Iowans with COVID-19 who have died has surpassed 4,000, with the state reporting an additional 61 deaths Wednesday. Deaths caused by COVID-19 appear to have resulted in record numbers of deaths overall in Iowa, the Associated Press reports. Iowa’s death total last year is the highest single-year total at least since 1915, public health data in available vital statistics records show. The state also reported 2,785 new coronavirus cases Wednesday. On Tuesday, 604 people were hospitalized in Iowa, up from 582 on Monday, according to the latest information available from the state. Hospitals admitted 125 patients, up from 69. Also, there were 116 COVID-19 patients in intensive care units Tuesday, up from 115 on Monday. There were 54 patients on ventilators, up from 53. Additionally, 91 nursing homes in Iowa were reporting coronavirus outbreaks Wednesday, down from 100 on Tuesday.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Republican legislators and the state’s GOP attorney general said Tuesday that privacy is key, as lawmakers prepared to decide whether to rewrite a law that allows people exposed to COVID-19 to refuse to disclose their close contacts to health officials. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly wants legislators to rewrite the law enacted last year, arguing in a recent interview that provisions allowing people to opt out of contact tracing “served no purpose.” Some health officials say the law hinders efforts to trace new coronavirus cases to their source and warn others who might have been infected. Attorney General Derek Schmidt and Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature aren’t ruling out changes, but some said they want to make sure people’s privacy remains protected. The law was enacted for the COVID-19 pandemic and is set to expire May 1, forcing legislators to review it during the annual 90-day session opening Monday. Legislators included the contact-tracing law in a package of measures governing the state’s coronavirus response. Kelly said she was forced to accept the whole package to preserve a state of emergency for the pandemic and called the provision “not helpful.”\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Jefferson County Public Schools Superintendent Marty Pollio said Tuesday that the pace of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout in the state and how many doses the district receives will affect how soon in-person classes resume this year. Pollio said last month that a best-case scenario would see the state’s largest district resume in-person classes for preschool through third grade students at some point in February. However, that plan could be too ambitious, as it is dependent on when JCPS receives its first COVID-19 vaccine shipment and how many doses are included. Nearly 75% of JCPS employees – or more than 13,000 people – told the district in a survey that they would like to get vaccinated when possible. JCPS had 5,400 staff members decline the vaccine or not complete the survey. K-12 school personnel are next in line for vaccinations as part of “Phase 1B” of Kentucky’s vaccine rollout, with first responders and persons 70 and older joining them in the second group. Gov. Andy Beshear has said that, depending on how efficiently things progress with vaccine distribution, the second group could begin receiving the vaccine as early as Feb. 1, “plus or minus a week.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A subdued Carnival season began Wednesday after the coronavirus pandemic put an end to the crowd-heavy balls and street parades that draw thousands of people to the city every year. The Mardi Gras season always starts Jan. 6 and ends on Fat Tuesday, which this year falls Feb. 16. The season is usually marked by extravagant balls and parades in which costumed riders throw trinkets to the mobs of people packed along the parade routes. The coronavirus has put an end to those large events. But that has not stopped notoriously creative New Orleanians from coming up with socially distant ways to celebrate. The Krewe de Jeanne d’Arc – a club that annually pays homage to the fallen French hero with a parade through the French Quarter on the official start of the Carnival season – is hosting a “Tableaux de Jeanne d’Arc,” where onlookers will drive by various “tableaux,” a French term for “living pictures,” that will include stations of costumed revelers sparring as knights, sharpening their swords and feasting at a grand fireplace with a pig roasting in the background. “Life as usual is gone, so we had to look for different ways of doing things this year,” said Antoinette de Alteriis, one of the club’s captains.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state plans an online registry for COVID-19 vaccinations as it prepares for the next phase of the rollout. The online tool will aim to reduce lines and cut the risk of exposure by people getting the vaccine, said Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The system would also speed the process by allowing people to fill out paperwork in advance, he said. As of Tuesday, 35,536 people in Maine had received at least the first dose of vaccine. Meanwhile, state lawmakers will be considering more than 1,600 bills this session, but COVID-19 will take up much of their time. A slew of bills would curtail the governor’s executive powers, protect the rights of patients and help hard-hit businesses. Assistant House Majority Leader Rachel Talbot Ross, D-Portland, wants to address the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on people of color. Rep. Jon Connor, R-Lewiston, wants to eliminate sales tax on hard-hit restaurants and lodging establishments. Sen. Cathy Breen, D-Falmouth, wants legislative oversight over how the state spends federal COVID-19 relief funds. Sen. Lisa Keim, R-Dixfield, wants to establish a COVID-19 review commission.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan announced steps Tuesday to speed up vaccinations against COVID-19 to “get more shots into more arms.” Hogan said 270,150 doses of the vaccine have been put directly in the hands of front-line vaccinators in the state over the past three weeks. However, as of Tuesday, only 76,916 people had been vaccinated so far, or about 1.3% of the state’s population. “While none of us are thrilled with the pace of this rollout over the first couple of weeks, I can assure you that it is improving every day,” Hogan said at a news conference. The governor said 11,553 people were vaccinated Tuesday, the highest number so far. Starting Wednesday, the Republican governor said the National Guard would begin to dispatch emergency vaccination support teams across the state to help local health departments to expand vaccination capacity. Hogan also said there has been uneven data reporting of vaccinations that have been administered so that the state can determine where help is needed. He also said any facility that has not administered at least 75% of its total first doses may have future allocations reduced until it can speed up vaccinations.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Northeastern University has become one of the first colleges in the U.S. to administer the coronavirus vaccine. The Boston school announced Tuesday that 88 people who work in the university’s Cabot Testing Center and the Life Sciences Testing Center received their first dose. Those who received the vaccine included clinical and nonclinical health care workers doing direct COVID-19-facing care, police and first responders. “It’s not only remarkable that we’re one of the first to have the vaccine, but also that we’ve built a testing facility that is the gold standard,” President Joseph Aoun said in a statement on the school’s website. Iloisa Teixeira, who works in the Cabot Testing Center as a medical assistant overseeing swabbing, was the first Northeastern community member to receive the vaccine. About 1,500 people in the university community are eligible for vaccinations in the state’s first phase, the school estimated.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state will begin issuing COVID-19 vaccines to seniors and front-line workers such as teachers and police next week, officials said Wednesday while announcing accelerated access for people who are at least 65 years old. The state had planned to next immunize people 75 and older and essential workers including first responders, prison guards and child care providers. But residents age 65 to 74 will be included, too. “Every shot in the arm is a step closer to ending this pandemic,” Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said. So far, the vaccine has been limited to health care workers and nursing home residents – those in Phase 1A of the vaccine rollout plan. At least 152,000 people in the state have received the first dose in just over three weeks. Michigan will move to Phase 1B on Monday and will also include 65- to 74-year-olds from Phase 1C. Seniors can book appointments by contacting county health departments and other local vaccine clinics. Essential workers including police, firefighters, prison and jail staff, pre-K-12 teachers and child care providers will be notified by their employers about clinic dates and locations.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Bars and restaurants can resume limited indoor service starting Monday, Gov. Tim Walz announced Wednesday as he also loosened up coronavirus restrictions on youth sports, gyms, entertainment venues and churches. “The situation in Minnesota is undeniably better than it was last month,” Walz said in a statement. “We have reasons to be optimistic, and Minnesotans’ sacrifice and commitment to their communities helped change the pandemic’s trajectory and saved lives. But we need to protect the progress we’ve made.” The dialing-back returns bars and restaurants about to where they were before Walz imposed a “pause” amid soaring cases in mid-November and extended it last month, which kept them closed through the holiday season except for takeout and delivery service. The restrictions generated sharp pushback, with some bars and restaurants defiantly reopening in recent weeks, risking fines and losses of their liquor licenses. The state has gone to court against several violators. The Democratic governor noted that new cases and hospitalizations have been falling in Minnesota in recent weeks, while tens of thousands of front-line medical personnel and nursing home residents and staff have gotten their first vaccine doses.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Mississippi State Department of Health reported 38 new coronavirus-related deaths Wednesday, topping the 5,000 mark since the pandemic began, and 2,791 new cases. A single-day record of 91 deaths was reported Tuesday. Since the virus hit the state in March, a total of 228,235 cases and 5,013 coronavirus-related deaths have been reported. Daily case reports over the past 30 days have continued to hover around the 2,000 mark. Health experts have warned they expected the number of cases and deaths to continue to climb following the holidays. It takes anywhere from two to 14 days for symptoms to appear after exposure, health experts have said. Hospitalizations remain at record levels, putting a strain on health care resources. The department on Tuesday reported 1,444 hospitalizations of confirmed coronavirus cases, with 349 patients in intensive care units and 223 on ventilators.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: A group of medical professionals is leading an effort to persuade Black residents in the metro area to overcome their skepticism and get the COVID-19 vaccine. Kansas City’s Black Health Care Coalition and a team of Black medical professionals are working to get information about the vaccine to about 45,000 Black residents in the region. During a media briefing Monday, they said Blacks are concerned about the vaccine’s possible side effects and how quickly it was rolled out. They also noted many Blacks distrust the medical profession because of past controversial medical experiments that were performed on Black citizens, KCUR reports. City Councilwoman Melissa Robinson, president of the coalition, said Blacks also are less likely to be able to work from home or take time off work, which increases the risk of infection. The doctors said evidence has shown the vaccine to be safe. And they said the country won’t be able to defeat the pandemic unless Black citizens participate in the vaccination effort.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A lawmaker’s decision to block residents from testifying before a state Senate committee via videoconferencing didn’t last very long Tuesday before the chairs of all Senate committees decided to allow such testimony amid the coronavirus pandemic. Committee leaders overruled Republican state Sen. Keith Regier’s decision Tuesday, Kyle Schmauch, a spokesperson for the Senate Republican caucus, told the Montana State News Bureau. Regier, a Kalispell Republican, said Tuesday morning that the Senate Judiciary Committee would not allow the public to testify over Zoom but would take submitted written comments, as the committee has done before in non-pandemic sessions. “For 130 years, people have been coming to this building to testify on bills. They rode their horse, their old Model T, but they came here physically to the Capitol. And I’ve decided not to accept Zoom testimony from witnesses outside of the building here,” Regier said. The legislative session is being held under a hybrid model that allows lawmakers to participate remotely to limit the spread of COVID-19. Most Republicans plan to come to the Capitol daily, and many are not wearing masks.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A new, more contagious strain of the coronavirus that has been discovered in five states is probably in Nebraska as well, but officials haven’t yet confirmed its presence, the state’s chief medical officer said Wednesday. Dr. Gary Anthone said the new strain is concerning because it could lead to an increase in hospitalizations. Anthone said the state’s public health lab is purchasing its own equipment to test for the mutated virus. The new strain has led to a national lockdown in England, and the virus has been detected in California, Florida, New York, Georgia, and neighboring Colorado. “We can all say with some certainty that it’s most likely … here in Nebraska,” Anthone said at a press conference with Gov. Pete Ricketts. Ricketts said state officials plan to keep close watch for the new strain, and he expects to see a confirmed case soon given the state’s proximity to Colorado. Anthone said the current tests provided through state-sponsored TestNebraska sites can identify positive cases from the mutated strain but can’t determine which strain has infected a person. He said the new version of the virus shows the need for continued mask-wearing in public and social distancing.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The city’s unemployment rate is the highest in the nation among big metropolitan areas. A U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics report released Tuesday showed an estimated 11.5% of Las Vegas workers were out of jobs in November. That’s the highest rate among 51 metros with at least 1 million people. The COVID-19 pandemic has essentially transformed Las Vegas from a global destination to a regional gambling hub dependent on drive-in business. Casinos downsized, operating hours atrophied, and thousands were left to navigate pandemic life without paychecks. In April, Gov. Steve Sisolak ordered all casinos to close to stem the coronavirus’ spread. With the closure of The Strip and other Nevada businesses, Las Vegas’ jobless rate jumped to 34%. Visitation is now down to levels the state hasn’t seen since 1993. With concerts and conventions canceled and hotel towers closed, Nevada will remain in financial trouble with thousands of jobless residents stuck in a jammed unemployment system until COVID-19 restrictions are rolled back and travelers regain their confidence.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDurham: The usual shoulder-to-shoulder was more like bumper-to-bumper for the state House of Representatives on Wednesday as one of the world’s largest legislative bodies convened from the socially distant confines of their cars instead of the Statehouse. The start of the legislative session was delayed by more than an hour as cars lined up to get into the lot at the University of New Hampshire where the session was being held. Legislators were greeted by a handful of protesters who felt the session has failed to reasonably accommodate members with disabilities. One sign read that drive-ins are for movies and making out, “NOT for the NH State Legislature!” Minority leader Renny Cushing, D-Hampton, said he was stuck in traffic for nearly an hour. “It kind of reminded me of going to a Patriots football game,” he said. As business got underway, House Clerk Paul Smith advised, “If you’re having trouble with voting, please put on your hazard lights.” Some lawmakers also honked their horns to get the staff’s attention. The 24-member Senate also convened Wednesday, but in a fully remote session. The House clerk and speaker will conduct their session from a heated platform, while members watch and listen via a large movie screen or through their car radios.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Police officers and firefighters in the state are eligible to get the COVID-19 vaccine beginning Thursday. They follow health care workers as the second wave of professionals eligible to get the shot. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy made the announcement Wednesday. “We are able to open up vaccination to them based on the available supply,” Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli said. New Jersey has about 400,000 shots on hand, she has said, and more than 134,000 vaccines have been administered so far, up from 101,000 the previous day, she said. Persichilli said health care workers and those in long-term care homes continue to be a priority, and expanding vaccination eligibility to another group doesn’t mean earlier categories are now closed to getting the shots. More than 450,000 people have signed up so far on the state’s new vaccine pre-registration site, Murphy said. They will get word when they’re eligible to get the shots. The state launched the website Tuesday and faced technical problems stemming from high demand. Murphy said the state is working with the vendor to fix issues so the site works without interruption. New Jersey passed the 500,000 mark Wednesday for confirmed cases.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: O’Reilly Automotive Stores Inc. has said it will pay $79,200 in penalties to the state for violating a public health order intended to limit the spread of COVID-19. The New Mexico Environment Department announced Tuesday that the company agreed to pay the fine before Feb. 1 after the auto parts store in Santa Fe received two citations following multiple citizen complaints to the department. The payment is expected to be deposited in the state’s general fund. It is believed to be the largest penalty related to coronavirus public health violations issued by the department so far, the Albuquerque Journal reports. Inspectors with the department’s Occupational Health and Safety Bureau cited the store for failing to enforce the use of masks by employees and for failing to post signs requiring the use of masks after an inspection in July. Officials said subsequent inspections determined store management corrected the violations, the Santa Fe New Mexican reports. O’Reilly contested the penalties but agreed to a settlement with the state that does not admit to a violation.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a plan Wednesday to offer COVID-19 vaccines to most city police officers, only to have Gov. Andrew Cuomo say an hour later that the officers aren’t yet eligible for them. De Blasio said the city hoped to offer the vaccines to 25,000 officers and to provide shots to 10,000 by Sunday. “We want to make sure that all of these front-line workers, folks who work directly with everyday New Yorkers, folks who do things like having to perform CPR or working in very close proximity, that they’re going to get the opportunity to be vaccinated starting right now, starting today,” the mayor said at his daily coronavirus briefing. But Cuomo said at his own briefing an hour later that most members of the New York Police Department don’t qualify for vaccinations yet under state guidelines. “We need to get the health care population done first because they are the front line,” Cuomo said. The NYPD has about 35,000 uniformed members, but only about 25,000 hold public-facing jobs. A smaller number are emergency service officers who might be considered vaccine-eligible front-line workers under Cuomo’s rules.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s top public health official said Tuesday that most nursing home workers are refusing to take COVID-19 vaccines being offered. North Carolina has become one of the slowest states in the nation to get doses into peoples’ arms. Mandy Cohen, secretary of the state Department of Health and Human Services, attributed some of the sluggishness behind the rollout to staffing shortages, lack of familiarity with the state’s technological systems, and logistical hurdles of working with dozens of hospitals and 100 different counties throughout the state. “We have a decentralized system in North Carolina,” Cohen said. “We have 83 local public health departments; we have 100 counties. We have great pride in that, but when you decentralize things, it does create slowness.” Nearly 110,000 people in North Carolina had received their first dose as of Tuesday morning, according to data from the state health department. Nearly 500 people had received a second dose. Data gathered and shared by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday placed North Carolina as the sixth-worst state in the country in per capita first-dose vaccinations.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State health officials said Wednesday that hospitalizations due to the coronavirus dropped from 93 to 85 in the past day, with 13 patients currently requiring treatment in intensive care units. Medical facilities across the state have seen a steady drop in patients since the middle of November, when many of the largest facilities scrambled to provide staffed ICU beds. The state’s hospital tracker showed 31 staffed ICU beds and 326 staffed inpatient beds available throughout the state Wednesday. Health officials reported 341 new positive tests in the prior 24 hours, with a daily positivity rate of 5.4%. Five new deaths were confirmed, lifting North Dakota’s fatality count to 1,334. The per capita death count compared to the rest of the country moved up from sixth- to fifth-highest based on data compiled Tuesday by the COVID Tracking Project. Health officials say data updated through Saturday showed the state had administered about two-thirds of its existing COVID-19 vaccine supply.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: About 35 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine expired after a nursing home overestimated the number needed and left pharmacists scrambling to get shots into arms. A nursing home in Lawrence County at the southern tip of Ohio requested too many COVID-19 vaccines from pharmacy partner Walgreens. After inoculating staff and residents there, the pharmacy had about 195 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine left over, or 39 vials, said Dan Tierney, a spokesman for Gov. Mike DeWine. “They did everything they could. They got everyone who would take a shot, but they had some leftover, a lot leftover,” DeWine said at Tuesday’s news conference. The pharmacy reallocated 13 vials to other long-term care facilities and distributed 19 vials to residents 65 years and older and Walgreens pharmacy employees. After that effort, seven vials, or about 35 doses of the vaccine, expired before they could be administered on New Year’s Eve, a Walgreens spokesman confirmed. “There were some that were wasted. That was the first time that has occurred, to our knowledge, in Ohio,” DeWine said Tuesday. Tierney did not know the name of the nursing home, only its location.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Registration began Wednesday for residents to be notified when they are eligible for a COVID-19 vaccination, according to the state health department, which later reported a one-day record increase in deaths due to COVID-19. Those who register at vaccinate.oklahoma.gov will be notified by email when an appointment is available, the department said in a news release. The availability of appointments depends on the vaccine supply in each county, which changes weekly, health officials have said. Residents will enter personal information to determine when they are eligible for vaccinations based on the state’s distribution plan that began Dec. 14 with front-line health care workers being inoculated. Beginning Thursday, Oklahoma residents 65 and older, health care workers and first responders will be able to schedule appointments on the site as part of the program’s second phase. The Oklahoma State Department of Health later reported 3,305 additional cases of the virus and 62 more deaths due to COVID-19, eight more than the previous daily high of 54 on Dec. 2. It also reported a one-day record of 1,994 hospitalizations.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: State health officials had a goal of administering 100,000 coronavirus vaccines by the end of 2020 but as of Tuesday had only administered 51,283. Now, Gov. Kate Brown has set a new goal of 12,000 vaccinations per day within the next two weeks. Health authority officials said Tuesday that if they expand the number of administration sites and adjust prioritization requirements, they are confident they will reach that goal. “In the first 19 days of COVID-19 vaccinations, we’ve learned some key lessons we’ll use to speed our vaccination efforts,” Oregon Health Authority Director Patrick Allen said. The first phase of vaccination prioritization focused on health care workers and residents and staff in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. Effective this week, Oregon Health Authority will expand vaccinations to hospice programs, mobile crisis care, outpatient settings serving specific high-risk groups, in-home care services, non-emergency medical transport, health care providers in other outpatient settings, and public health workers.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Pennsylvania’s Farm Show Complex is usually bustling with activity in the days leading up to the annual agricultural event. But this year the arenas and exhibit halls are quiet. And, with the exception of some baby ducks, they will remain quiet throughout the show that opens Saturday and runs through Jan. 16. Because of concern surrounding COVID-19, officials made the difficult decision to hold a virtual Farm Show for its 105th year. When that decision was announced in August, the plan was to still hold a variety of competitions, including some livestock events. Those plans changed as a second wave hit the state, and safety concerns grew. The only livestock competition that will be held this year is for the largest cattle. But the event won’t be held at the Farm Show Complex. And the kids won’t be there to show their cattle. “That’s the saddest part of this,” Department of Agriculture Press Secretary Shannon Powers said Tuesday. “The decision had to be made back in the summer, and one group of kids had already purchased their animals. That show will be held at New Holland Sales Stables.” Powers said the kids won’t be there to show the animals, but they still will be judged on their hard work.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: State health officials said Tuesday that several hundred people not currently eligible to be vaccinated against COVID-19 attempted to get inoculated with the help of eligible people who improperly shared their confidential appointment registration links. Health officials said the link given to employers for their workers to register for vaccinations was shared. The employers were not identified. The state took down registration links and canceled hundreds of appointments this week after discovering the problem. The issue is being addressed, said Alysia Mihalakos, co-lead of the state Health Department’s Mass Vaccination Workgroup. “The demand for the vaccine is clearly high, and people are willing to push others aside to get themselves and their loved ones vaccinated,” Mihalakos said during a remote news conference. The state has prioritized getting the vaccine to those at highest risk from the virus.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: After being rebuked in court for trying to spend his share of federal COVID-19 money on private school tuition grants, the governor wants to spend the money on early childhood education, job training and tutors for foster children instead. Gov. Henry McMaster announced Tuesday how he will spend about $20 million of the $48 million set aside for him to spend at his own discretion. The governor has a May deadline to decide how to spend the remaining $28 million in grant money. McMaster’s initial plan announced in July was to spend most of the money on grants of up to $6,500 to help parents send children to private or religious schools, which were providing in-school instruction when most schools across the state were still holding virtual classes at least part of the time. The state Supreme Court ruled in October that McMaster’s plans broke the state constitution by sending public money to private schools. The decision also put on hold $2.4 million set aside by the governor for technology improvements to historically Black universities and colleges. McMaster has not announced if he will restore that money.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: State health officials on Wednesday confirmed six new deaths due to complications from the coronavirus, after two straight days with no fatalities. The deaths lifted the total to 1,519 since the start of the pandemic. That death count is the seventh-highest per capita in the country at about 171 deaths per 100,000 people, according to the COVID Tracking Project. The update showed 608 new positive tests, including 144 in Minnehaha County, 31 in Lincoln County, 36 in Brown County and 35 in Codington County. The state has confirmed 91,875 cases overall. South Dakota ranks 34th in the country for new cases per capita in the past two weeks, Johns Hopkins University researchers said. One in every 302 people in South Dakota tested positive in the past week. Hospitalizations in the state fell by six, to 264.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: State officials have set up an online tool that helps people figure out when they will be eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine. Gov. Bill Lee’s office announced the initiative Tuesday as the state reported more than 169,000 Tennesseans have been vaccinated with their first dose so far. Tennessee also continues to struggle to contain one of the highest new case counts per capita nationwide. There were 1,221 new cases reported per 100,000 people in Tennessee over the past two weeks, which ranks third in the country on that metric, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. Tennessee’s online tool involves completing a form with questions about age, county, type of employment, health conditions and other risk factors. It provides risk-based and age-based phase information at the county level. The website lets people opt in to receive updates and notifications about their vaccine phase. It can be found at covid19.tn.gov.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Coronavirus cases are exhausting the availability of intensive care unit beds in parts of Texas as hospitalizations of COVID-19 patients continue to soar to record levels, state health statistics showed Tuesday. Hospitalizations set their ninth consecutive record by topping 13,300 on Tuesday, with 626 patients requiring intensive care, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. All ICU beds at hospitals in the Abilene and Bryan-College Station areas are full, while only two are available in the Laredo area and three in the Paris-Texarkana area. ICU bed availability is in the single digits in the Wichita Falls-Northwest Texas, Lufkin-Piney Woods, Waco, Galveston-Beaumont and Victoria areas. Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo tweeted that the Houston region officially topped the state’s hospitalization threshold triggering COVID-19 reopening rollbacks. For seven days in a row, COVID-19 patients have filled in 15% of the Houston region’s hospital beds, according to state health statistics. But U.S. Rep. Dan Crenshaw, the Republican congressman representing some of Houston’s northern suburbs, urged the public to ignore the appeal by Hidalgo, a Democrat, and said that “businesses should not comply.”\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: People waving Trump flags, holding “Stop the Steal” signs and largely ignoring coronavirus safety rules rallied at the Utah Capitol on Wednesday as violent clashes broke out between supporters of the president and police in Washington, D.C., while Congress was trying to confirm the Electoral College’s votes for the presidency. The crowd of about 200 people in Salt Lake City crowded around a television monitor on the steps of the state Capitol to watch the president give a speech promoting his baseless claims of election fraud at a rally in Washington. The majority of Utah protesters were not wearing masks or abiding by social distancing guidelines. Colton Fiedler, 23, of South Jordan, said he was the first person to arrive at the statehouse at just before 9 a.m. in the hopes that the nation’s representatives in Congress would “finally find the courage to do the right thing.” “I am a registered Republican, but I don’t know how much longer I will be,” said Fiedler, who was holding a Trump 2020 sign. “The Republican Party is dead as of this year. It is the party of Trump now.”\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The group representing hospitals across the state says uncertainty about the amount of COVID-19 vaccine they will receive is prompting delays in administering those doses. In a Wednesday news release, the Vermont Association of Hospitals and Health Systems, which represents the state’s 14 nonprofit hospitals, said hospitals have routinely experienced delays in the arrival of doses. They have also received fewer doses than expected. Conversely, there have also been cases in which vaccine vials have contained more doses than expected. “We have a population that is eager to be vaccinated, and we’ll need ongoing patience and support to continue making progress,” said association President Jeff Tieman. Despite the challenges, Vermont Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine said the state ranks seventh in the nation for the percentage of doses received that have been administered.\n\nVirginia\n\nWilliamsburg: Busch Gardens Williamsburg, in a reversal of pandemic-era trends, is keeping its gates open during the winter for the first time since it opened 45 years ago, park officials said. The popular theme park is looking at ways to rethink its operations by hosting smaller, limited-capacity special events, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reports. “We had to figure out how to operate safely and how to operate (economically) and still give our members and guests something that they love doing,” park spokeswoman Cindy Sarko said. The park said it will operate on certain weekends in January, February and March for three new limited-capacity events, including Mardi Gras and St. Patrick’s Day. The winter events will be held on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays and will admit a maximum of 4,000 people each for each of the slots on those days, the park said. Busch Gardens held similar limited-capacity events last year. Being open in January and February also has been a request of patrons for years, Sarko said. The park typically opens in mid-March for the beginning of the season.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Gov. Jay Inslee on Tuesday announced a regional economic reopening plan, with some COVID-19 restrictions on entertainment and individual fitness training being eased next week, but prohibitions on indoor dining at restaurants and indoor gyms remaining. The new guidelines, which will go into effect Monday, will require regions to meet four metrics in order to move to the next phase, at which point restaurants and indoor fitness center can open indoor dining at 25% capacity, sports competitions can resume with limited spectators, and wedding and funeral ceremonies can increase their number of guests. Each Friday, the state Department of Health will be looking at the regional case rates, hospital admission rates, intensive care unit occupancy rates and test positivity rates to see which areas can move to a new phase. While in the first phase, some outdoor entertainment – limited to 10 ticketed guests – is allowed, and appointment-based fitness training with one client per 500 square feet is also allowed, as are things like outdoor tennis instructions, gymnastics, and no-contact martial arts, as long as it is limited to five athletes.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nFairmont: The Marion County Chamber of Commerce is working on a project to attract remote or self-employed workers to move there, news outlets report. Marion County offers indoor and outdoor recreation along with good local restaurants and access to major cities like Pittsburgh and Washington, D.C., in just a few hours’ drive, officials said. “We don’t want to change Marion County per se; we love Marion County as it is. However, we want to share Marion County with everyone that we can,” Chamber Board Chairman Jonathan Board said. The coronavirus pandemic has changed how many people work, with many now working from home, which means some have more flexibility in where they can live, officials said. The Marion County chamber has been working with local organizations to put together a video highlighting the area’s best points. The full video won’t be released until next month, officials said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: More than 5,000 people have died from COVID-19 in the state since the start of the pandemic. Wisconsin crossed the milestone Wednesday, reporting the most recent 1,000 deaths in just the past 25 days. It took about five months for the first 1,000 Wisconsin residents to die from COVID-19. By Halloween, the state had reached 2,000 deaths. Three weeks later, on Nov. 21, Wisconsin hit 3,000 COVID-19 deaths. Another three weeks later, on Dec. 12, it passed 4,000. Experts at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation were nearly correct when they projected Wisconsin would pass 5,000 deaths from COVID-19 just before the end of the year. The institute now projects more than 1,800 people could die from COVID-19 in Wisconsin in the next month, and the state could see a death toll of more than 7,700 by April 1. Meanwhile, total COVID-19 cases are nearing 500,000 in the state. The state was just over 5,000 cases away Wednesday. The average positivity rate – first-time positive tests over the past seven days – was 32% Wednesday.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: Lawmakers will consider a proposed $100 million public education funding cut when they meet this winter. The bill would take away millions of dollars from school districts across the state while increasing the state sales tax by a percentage point, the Gillette News Record reports. Wyoming has been struggling with a steep decline in revenue from the coal, oil and natural gas industries due to low prices and the coronavirus pandemic. The virus has resulted in less travel and lower demand for oil worldwide. Gov. Mark Gordon in November submitted a proposed supplemental budget for 2021-22 containing more than $500 million in cuts to some of the state’s largest agencies, including the Department of Health, Department of Corrections, Department of Family Services and the University of Wyoming. The Legislature is scheduled to convene a one-day, online session Jan. 12. Lawmakers usually meet for about eight weeks in odd-numbered years. This year, they plan to reconvene for either a virtual session in February or an in-person session in Cheyenne in March, depending on COVID-19 trends.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/01/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/11/us/national-climate-change-report-cop27/index.html", "title": "New report paints dire picture of America's future as climate crisis ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: John D. Sutter is a CNN contributor, climate journalist and independent filmmaker whose work has won the Livingston Award, the IRE Award and others. He recently was appointed the Ted Turner Professor of Environmental Media at The George Washington University.\n\nCNN —\n\nSometimes it’s helpful to state the obvious truth. And then restate it, again and again.\n\nThat’s one of the benefits of the National Climate Assessment, a new draft of which was released this week ahead of President Joe Biden’s trip to the UN’s climate summit in Egypt.\n\nThe federal report paints a dire picture of what life is now like in America amid the climate crisis, and the incredible changes in store in the future. And it outlines some painful truths about global warming we must confront, but so far have not.\n\nThe COP27 climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, along with recent advances in US climate policy, may give the impression the world is doing something about an existential crisis, and we’re taking it seriously. The truth is, global emissions continue to rise, and will continue to do so for at least the next several years, even as scientists warn fossil fuel use must be slashed immediately.\n\nIn the meantime, the report’s authors write, “the things Americans value most are at risk.”\n\nThe National Climate Assessment, which is a congressionally-mandated report the federal government releases every four or five years, summarizes all the latest science and research on climate change in the United States. The new draft, which will go through a long period of public review before it is officially published next year, provides vital context about the very real pain the climate crisis is causing in the United States today, and how far we are from creating a world safe for future generations.\n\nIt is both familiar – as we have lived with these impacts for years now – and devastating to see it laid out in such stark synthesis.\n\nHere are the report’s key takeaways:\n\nThe US is warming faster than the global average\n\nThe world already has warmed a little more than 1 degree Celsius, according to the report, with the US warming faster than the global average.\n\nThe goal of the Paris Agreement — which is being discussed this week in Egypt — is to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, or at most to 2 degrees Celsius. To do it, the US needs to reach “net-zero” carbon emissions by about 2050, which will require a total clean energy transformation, and will likely require technology to suck our previous planet-warming emissions back out of the atmosphere.\n\nFor the United States to reach net-zero by 2050, the country’s emissions need to fall by a whopping 6% per year. US emissions fell just 12% over the course of nearly two decades between 2007 and 2019.\n\nClimate disasters are getting worse\n\nA broken section of road and destroyed houses are seen in Matlacha, Florida, on Saturday, October 1.

Many of the harmful impacts that people across the country are already experiencing will worsen as warming increases, and new risks will emerge.”\n\nIt’s exacerbating the water crisis\n\nThe cracked lake bed at drought-stricken Lake Mead in September. Frederic J. Brown/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe rampant burning of fossil fuels is contributing to a worsening US water crisis. The report lays out how droughts will continue to become more intense and more frequent, “most notably in the Southwest.”\n\n“Between 1980 and 2021, drought and related heatwaves across the country caused $291.1 billion (in 2021 dollars) in damages,” the report notes. “Recent droughts have strained surface and groundwater supplies, reduced agricultural productivity, and lowered water levels in major reservoirs, threatening hydropower generation.”\n\nThe report’s authors highlight the threat to the country’s aquifers — massive reservoirs of underground water built up over thousands of years — which are “particularly vulnerable to over-pumping.”\n\nIt’s playing a role in migration and economic woes\n\nClimate change is bringing about a new era of forced migration, and “millions of people” are expected to be displaced in the United States.\n\nFactors leading to future migration within the US include wildfires in California, rising seas in Florida and more frequent flooding in the South, according to the report.\n\nThe global economy is also in jeopardy. Global warming is expected to “reduce midcentury global economic output by 11% to 14%,” or about $23 trillion, according to the report.\n\nTeresa Reynolds sits exhausted as members of her community clean debris from flood-ravaged homes in Hindman, Kentucky, on Saturday, July 30.

Ahead of the official opening – a day more than a decade in the making – the center opened for a sneak peek to the community Saturday and Sunday. The National Park Service selected ASU as the site for the third center in 2008 and began construction in 2014.

Matthew, 8, of Orlando, Florida, is a cancer survivor who expressed a desire to the Make-A-Wish Foundation to make a snowman in Alaska. His dream was fulfilled last week at the Fairbanks Ice Art Park, television station KTVF reports. Matthew has battled Stage 4 high-risk neuroblastoma, a cancer that develops from immature nerve cells, with chemotherapy, multiple surgeries, stem cell transplants, radiation treatment and months of immunotherapy. The ice art park features ice sculptures and activities for children such as ice slides. Park officials offered Matthew more than a tour. They let him help harvest a thick block of ice from a pond. Matthew was lifted into a telescopic forklift. With assistance from a heavy equipment operator, he jerked the machine forward and lifted a massive cube of ice for sculpting.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: Mission San Xavier is set to undergo its biggest preservation project in more than a decade. The Arizona Daily Star reports scaffolding could go up by late fall around the iconic church’s east tower. Workers will spend the next two years carefully removing and replacing problematic plaster around the structure’s centuries-old brick walls. Patronato San Xavier has overseen preservation and fundraising for Arizona’s oldest intact European structure since 1978. During the 1940s and 1950s, the mission’s well-meaning stewards covered the building with concrete plaster made from Portland cement. But decades later, caretakers discovered that moisture trapped by the concrete plaster was being drawn by gravity down through the building, damaging the walls and interior. The old stuff will be replaced with new coats of traditional lime-washed plaster mixed with cactus juice, which allows the walls to breathe and release moisture.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Supporters of a state law to expand the procedures optometrists may perform filed a new lawsuit Friday to prevent an effort to repeal the measure from appearing on the ballot this fall. The group, Arkansans for Healthy Eyes, asked the state Supreme Court to disqualify the referendum on the eye surgery law from the November ballot. The law approved by the Legislature last year would allow optometrists to perform several procedures that previously only ophthalmologists could, including injections around the eye, removing lesions from the eyelids and certain laser eye surgeries. The lawsuit contends that signature-gatherers gave out misleading information about the law. It also challenges the wording of the referendum and the validity of thousands of signatures submitted. A Pulaski County judge last month dismissed another lawsuit by Arkansans for Healthy Eyes aimed at blocking the referendum effort.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: A baby hippopotamus born at the San Diego Zoo last month has a name. The zoo says the river hippo calf will be called Amahle, which means “beautiful one” in Zulu. The name was announced Friday on “Good Morning America,” which held an online poll asking viewers to choose among three African names. Amahle, born Feb. 8, weighs about 100 pounds and is “active and healthy,” a zoo statement said. Amahle is the ninth hippo calf born at the zoo and the 13th to her mother, Funani. Amahle’s father, Otis, is an East African hippo who arrived at the zoo in 2009 specifically to breed with Funani, zoo officials said. Zoo visitors can see Amahle and her mother in the hippo habitat on Tuesdays, Thursdays and weekends, officials said.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: An elected prosecutor for the state’s northeastern rural plains surrendered to authorities Friday, one day after being indicted on drug charges following an investigation by the state’s attorney general. Brittny Lewton, 40, was charged with three drug felonies, including conspiracy and possession, as well as official misconduct, a misdemeanor, according to online court records. She turned herself in to authorities in Logan County, one of seven counties in the 13th Judicial District where she serves as the district attorney. Online court records did not specify the type of drug or drugs in the indictment, which has not been made public. Lewton’s attorney, Stan Garnett, said the charges appear to be based on one incident in July 2019 involving an alleged exchange of prescription medication. Garnett, a former district attorney in Boulder County, said he could not elaborate.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: An expert on torture with the United Nations is calling out the use of solitary confinement as punishment in the state’s prisons, saying it could amount to psychological torture. Nils Melzer, special rapporteur on torture for the U.N., criticized on Friday the use of solitary confinement in the United States but specifically mentioned Connecticut’s Department of Correction’s practices. “The DOC appears to routinely resort to repressive measures, such as prolonged or indefinite isolation, excessive use of in-cell restraints and needlessly intrusive strip searches,” Melzer said in a statement. “There seems to be a State-sanctioned policy aimed at purposefully inflicting severe pain or suffering, physical or mental, which may well amount to torture.” He said the alleged practices can trigger and exacerbate psychological suffering, especially for those who may have experienced previous trauma or have mental health conditions or psychosocial disabilities.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A 12-year-old boy was arrested Thursday after he ordered Chinese food, then stole the delivery driver’s car, New Castle County Police said. Officers were dispatched to the Paladin Club Apartments for a vehicle theft, police said. When they arrived, they spotted the vehicle driving through the complex. The officers turned on their emergency lights, and the vehicle began to slow down. Before the vehicle stopped, the boy got out and ran, police said, and the driverless vehicle then drifted into a marked patrol car. Police caught the boy in a neighboring apartment complex. No injuries were reported, and both vehicles sustained minor damage. The boy was arrested and charged with vehicle theft, resisting arrest, reckless driving and leaving the scene of an accident, an official said. He was arraigned and released to his parent on $1,450 unsecured bail, an official said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The nation’s capital will soon have two statues on display in the nation’s Capitol, just like the 50 states, after a concerted effort lasting more than 10 years, WUSA-TV reports. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Wednesday that she will accept a second statue to be displayed on the House of Representatives’ side of the Capitol. Pierre L’Enfant, the architect of D.C.’s layout and the National Mall, will be memorialized among the Capitol’s statue collection. In 2013, D.C. got to display its first statue in the Capitol. Famed abolitionist Frederick Douglass’ likeness sits in Emancipation Hall at the Capitol Visitor Center. The L’Enfant statue is currently on display in the lobby of 1 Judiciary Square, a D.C. government building. It will be the sixth statue listed under “other statues” that are on display at the Capitol. Neither L’Enfant’s or Douglass’ statue will be considered part of the official National Statuary Hall Collection.\n\nFlorida\n\nPanama City: Spring breakers be forewarned: You still can’t drink booze in March on the beach in this town seeking to curb rowdy parties. The Panama City News Herald reports that the monthlong ban is paired with a 2 a.m. deadline to buy alcohol anywhere within city limits. Panama City Police Chief Drew Whitman says a zero-tolerance policy originally enacted in 2015 has helped the city transition from a national spring break hot spot to a more family-friendly destination all year long. Whitman says enforcing the ban includes extra officers on the beach, some on all-terrain vehicles. Violators can be fined or even jailed.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A state Supreme Court justice announced Friday that he plans to resign in November, citing family obligations. Justice Keith Blackwell, 44, said in a letter to Gov. Brian Kemp that he has decided to return to private law practice, according to a statement from the court. “Our oldest daughter will leave for college in only a couple of years, and her sisters will follow not long behind,” Blackwell wrote. “I have decided that it is best for my family that I return to the private practice of law.” Blackwell was appointed to the high court in 2012 by then-Gov. Nathan Deal after having served for two years on the state Court of Appeals. His last day on the Supreme Court will be Nov. 18, and Kemp will appoint his replacement. Justice Robert Benham announced earlier this year that he would retire March 1. The process to find his replacement, also to be appointed by Kemp, is underway.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The speaker of the state’s House of Representatives said Friday that he wants to form a committee to examine the potential economic effects of the coronavirus outbreak so lawmakers can be prepared to cut spending if tax revenue drops sharply. Scott Saiki recalled the state had to slash $2.1 billion in spending from state budgets over a three-year period when tax revenue sank during the recession a decade ago. That led to furloughs for government employees, a four-day week for public school students, and dramatic cuts to mental health and other services. The speaker said he wasn’t proposing to cut spending and build up financial reserves but wanted to assess the economic effect of the outbreak before taking such steps. But such cuts are a possibility, he said. Saiki said House members would vote Tuesday on a resolution that would create a select committee including government officials, industry leaders and union members.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A bill that would ban any public money from going to organizations that provide abortions was approved Friday by a panel of state lawmakers despite opposition on both sides of the abortion debate, including some who complained that it still allowed exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape and incest. The House State Affairs Committee sent the legislation to the full House with a “do pass” recommendation. Federal and state law already ban public funding for abortion except in certain circumstances. But health care providers who perform abortions can receive public funding for other medical services. The bill aims to prevent any public funding from going to health care providers if they perform abortions except for in certain situations. Those exceptions are narrower than the ones already set by state law, and the Idaho attorney general’s office has warned lawmakers that the legislation would likely draw lawsuits.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A spike in crime on the city’s rail system and some recent high-profile outbursts of violence have prompted the police department to put 50 more officers in trains and on platforms and assign four detectives to investigate nothing but Chicago Transit Authority crimes, officials announced Friday. Hours after the new security plan was unveiled, Chicago police said an officer shot a man on the platform of a CTA station in Chicago’s River North neighborhood. Officers confronted the man after he was observed moving from car to car of a moving train, a city ordinance violation, said Deputy Superintendent Barbara West. The wounded man was taken to a hospital, where he was in critical but stable condition after surgery, West said. Days before the announcement by Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Interim Chicago Police Superintendent Charlie Beck, riders began seeing more police SWAT officers boarding trains and manning platforms on the nation’s second-largest public transit system.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: One of the state’s largest school districts canceled bus service Friday after too many drivers called in sick in an apparent labor dispute, and parents were warned over the weekend to find “alternative ways” to get their kids to school Monday morning. Indianapolis Public Schools said schools remained open, but students unable to get to them because of no buses would not be marked absent. The city’s public schools will open Monday, regardless of whether bus service is restored for all of its students, the district said Saturday evening. Superintendent Aleesia Johnson and other district leaders were meeting with representatives for the bus drivers’ union to resolve the situation, district spokeswoman Carrie Cline Black said. IPS announced Jan. 30 that it would not renew a contract with bus vendor Durham School Services that expires June 30 in a cost-cutting move.\n\nIowa\n\nIndianola: Warren County supervisors have approved construction of a long-sought justice center in the city. The board on Thursday backed a trimmed-down plan for the $30 million-plus project. Construction is expected to begin this summer with a goal of completion in the next 18 to 19 months. The new plan retains the four courtrooms and 88-bed jail. Voters had approved $29.9 million for the project in 2018, but the bids came in more than $7 million higher. A referendum to let the county borrow an additional $3.5 million for the project gained support from nearly 56% of the voters, but the referendum required approval from 60%. The state had ordered the county to close the jail. Among its problems: failing a state fire marshal’s inspection, inadequate water supplies, inmate escapes, mold, cleanliness. The jail was on the third floor of the Indianola courthouse, which has since been torn down.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A foul-mouthed judge who cursed at courthouse employees so often that a trial clerk kept a “swear journal” documenting his outbursts should be publicly censured and receive professional coaching but not kicked off the bench, a disciplinary panel recommended Friday. The Kansas Commission on Judicial Conduct unanimously concluded that Montgomery County Judge F. William Cullins violated central judicial canons of independence, integrity and impartiality. Its recommendations will be sent to the Kansas Supreme Court, which will ultimately decide his fate. An admonishment or a “cease and desist” order was not sufficient discipline, the panel concluded. His attorney, Chris Joseph, had argued during disciplinary proceedings that his speech is protected by the First Amendment and does not diminish his integrity. But Cullins’ use of foul, derogatory words directed at women manifested a clear bias based on sex, the panel found.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: More than 150 members of the local Cuban community snaked through the city Saturday in a caravan of U.S. and Cuban flag-draped cars, calling for an end to Cuba’s socialist government. With horns blaring and Cuban music blasting, the rally came in the wake of presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders’ praise for Cuba’s high literacy rate. Critics said it lacked context, partly because Cubans aren’t free to read and write what they want. At the rally Saturday, signs read “No Socialism in America,” “Cuba Libra” and “Make Cuba Great Again,” mixed in with signs supporting President Donald Trump. Others said they were Democrats, reflecting the Cuban community’s political diversity. The attendees gathered outside a Cuban market, giving fiery speeches denouncing the Cuban government, before driving through the city to a parking lot near Louisville Slugger Field downtown, where they they sang the old Cuban national anthem.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Three state historic sites are open for additional days to visitors starting this month, the Office of State Parks announced. The Audubon State Historic Site in St. Francisville, Longfellow-Evangeline State Historic Site in St. Martinville and Port Hudson State Historic Site near Baton Rouge will operate from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., seven days a week. The expanded visiting hours start Monday. “This goes a long way in fulfilling our mission to provide the best possible experience of all of Louisiana’s treasure to both our residents and our visitors,” Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser, who oversees the state parks and historic sites, said in a statement. The three facilities join Poverty Point World Heritage Site and Rosedown Plantation State Historic Site in operating seven days a week.\n\nMaine\n\nFort Kent: Thirteen mushers have launched their annual dash across the wilderness of northern Maine. The 250-mile Can-Am Crown kicked off Saturday in Fort Kent with mushers from Maine, Minnesota, Iowa and several Canadian provinces. The grueling course takes mushers to Portage Lake and then to the town of Allagash before looping back to Fort Kent by Monday morning. Each race is different. The temperature plummeted to minus-38 during the first Can-Am Crown and then soared to 61 degrees a year later. But the weather is cooperating this year. A winter storm on Thursday left a fresh layer of 10 inches of snow on the course, and temperatures were dipping to single digits at night, ideal conditions for the dogs.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A $3.2 million study that was supposed to evaluate the city’s risk of storm flooding was suspended after the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers failed to secure federal funding. The agency’s Baltimore division announced Tuesday that work would be halted on the risk management study. It would have, in part, assessed the vulnerability of Baltimore’s port terminals, highways, evacuation routes, hospitals, public utilities and local airport facilities in the case of severe storms, the Corps said. The Baltimore region was identified as a focus area due its high susceptibility to flooding outlined in a 2015 report in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, according to the agency. The Corps said it will request the funding again during the 2021 fiscal year.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: New England Aquarium officials have expressed opposition to a proposed 600-foot skyscraper that would be built in place of the Boston Harbor Garage. A crowd gathered Thursday at the first public meeting to discuss concerns for Don Chiofaro’s proposed $1.2 billion, 42-story skyscraper, the Boston Herald reports. The proposed tower, called “The Pinnacle,” would have two floors for retail and dining, 22 floors of office space, and 200 apartments on the top 18 floors, according to plans filed with the Boston Planning & Development Agency. “The New England Aquarium stands in staunch opposition to this proposed development,” said Vikki Spruill, the president and CEO of the New England Aquarium. “Climate change is at the heart of our concerns about this development. … This is about the future of our downtown waterfront.” The aquarium is located on Central Wharf behind the garage.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The outlook on the city’s debt has been upgraded from “stable” to “positive” by Moody’s Investors Service. The adjustment means the city’s finances are pointing in a positive direction, and there is a higher chance the city will be upgraded in the next year or two, Moody’s said in a news release. The rating and new outlook apply to $135 million of general obligation debt. Moody’s affirmed the city’s Ba3 bond rating and added that the rating remains three notches below investment grade. Moody’s said the revised outlook reflects the city budget’s ability to finance service improvements and capital investments and to accommodate an increase in pension contributions. The city emerged from bankruptcy in December 2014, having restructured or wiped out $7 billion in debt.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Janitors who work at Twin Cities commercial buildings are striking as part of a push for higher wages and better benefits in their contracts. The Star Tribune reports more than 100 janitors walked off the job Thursday and rallied along Nicollet Mall, waving signs and beating drums outside the skyscrapers they clean each day. They were joined by a separate group of youth climate strikers who marched in solidarity. The Service Employees International Union, which represents 4,000 janitors who clean Twin Cities commercial buildings, organized the daylong strike before a bargaining session Friday. Members have also been pushing for paid sick days and a program to expand the use of nontoxic cleaning chemicals, among other things.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Authorities on Saturday released the identity of one of two inmates who died earlier in the week at a penitentiary that is under U.S. Justice Department investigation. The Mississippi Department of Corrections said Timothy R. Sharpe, who was serving a 20-year-sentence for sexual battery and child molestation, died Friday at the prison hospital at the Mississippi State Penitentiary in Parchman. He was 61. The statement said the name of another inmate who died Thursday at Parchman’s prison hospital hasn’t been released pending notification of relatives. The statement didn’t give any details about the deaths. In a news release Friday, Sunflower County Coroner Heather Burton said there was “no evidence of foul play” in either death. Autopsies were planned in both cases. With those included, at least 21 inmates have died in Mississippi prisons since late December.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Democrats in the state House want to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, but their proposals have yet to be assigned to a committee for a hearing. The sponsor of the Missouri Nondiscrimination Act, state Rep. Greg Razer of Kansas City, told St. Louis Public Radio he’s frustrated about the lack of progress. State law already bans discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, sex and disability. Past proposals to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity have fallen flat in the Legislature. Opponents say they believe businesses should be able to create their own policies. Democrats are also concerned about a proposed constitutional amendment that would require all public school athletes to compete against students of their biological rather than chosen sex. Opponents fear it would unfairly exclude transgender students or put them at risk of harassment.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: For the first time in a decade, schools in the state are using fewer emergency authorizations than the year before as small, rural schools continue to struggle finding teachers. The state’s “last resort” option effectively allows teachers to work in a school for a year despite not being qualified to do so under state law. Its numbers have mushroomed in recent years as the state encouraged schools to use the option instead of taking an accreditation ding. In 2019-2020, it dropped to 84 compared to 94 last school year. Montana’s small rural schools have long struggled to attract and keep qualified teachers, but the shortage has reached “crisis” levels in recent years, according to experts. The decrease is far from a sign that the issue is solved, and it’s still the second highest figure in recent years.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Selling the natural gas generated at one of the city’s wastewater treatment plants will produce $2 million of new revenue annually, the mayor said. The sales also will further the city goal of environmental sustainability, Mayor Leirion Gaylor Baird said Thursday. Lincoln has used the gas to produce electricity that helped power the wastewater treatment plant. City officials decided in 2017, however, that upgrading the system at the Theresa Street plant and selling the biogas locally or nationally would provide a greater return on investment. The $8 million upgrade will be complete this summer, and city officials plan to begin sales under an agreement with a Utah-based energy management company, Blue Source. The Blue Source contract is set for public hearing and a council vote Monday.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The state’s casinos continued a hot streak in January, topping $1 billion in house winnings for the second consecutive month and eighth time in the past year. The state Gaming Control Board on Friday reported the statewide “casino win” figure was slightly lower than in December but was up almost 5.5% compared with the same month in 2019. Board analyst Michael Lawton said casinos reported increases in all categories, including table games, blackjack, roulette, sports betting, slot machines and baccarat. Baccarat winnings sometimes jump or drop significantly in a month. They were up 17% in January, totaling more than $112 million. Lawton noted the game is a favorite of Asian tourists, and the Chinese Lunar New Year fell in January this year. The holiday was in February last year.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: State officials will use federal funds to examine the effects of rising seas on major highways and connecting routes along the coast. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is funding a “vulnerability assessment” for the I-95, Route 1 and Route 1A corridors and local connector roads, New Hampshire Public Radio reports. Researchers will combine traffic models and climate change projections to determine what areas have a higher risk of flooding from rising sea levels. A 2015 report by the Rockingham Planning Commission found that a 1.7-foot rise in sea levels would flood 5 miles of New Hampshire coastal roads. A 4-foot rise would flood more than 23 miles of roads. A state report released last year estimated that a 1-to-3-foot rise is “likely” by 2100 under most scenarios and that there is a 1-in-20 chance that a 4-foot rise could happen by the turn of the next century.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWest Orange: A dozen sea turtles that nearly froze when they were too far north last fall as water temperatures abruptly plunged off the state’s coast survived that ordeal but remain threatened by the pneumonia most of them developed afterward. Sea Turtle Recovery, a nonprofit group operating out of the Turtle Back Zoo in northern New Jersey, got the turtles through their initial medical crisis, with two needing CPR. But 11 of them went on to develop pneumonia, a common problem in turtles that survive so-called cold-stunning and one that could yet kill some of them. The turtles are being treated with medications, and their progress and conditions are checked daily in a hospital on the grounds of the turtle-themed zoo that is popular with children. Ten of the 12 are green turtles, along with one loggerhead and one endangered Kemp’s Ridley turtle.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: U.S. land managers on Friday made public a list of possible alternatives for managing development in one of the nation’s oldest oil and gas basins, but environmentalists and others say the options fail to take into account the cumulative costs of increased drilling and threats to Native American cultural sites in northwestern New Mexico. Officials with the Bureau of Land Management and the Bureau of Indian Affairs indicated their preference for an alternative that would “balance community needs and development” while limiting impacts on the traditional, socioeconomic and cultural way of life of those who call the area home. The alternative emphasizes local and tribal perspectives and includes a range of options for limiting development around Chaco Culture National Historical Park, the officials said. The World Heritage site has become the focal point in a decades­long fight over oil and gas.\n\nNew York\n\nSeneca Falls: People threw punches and were dragged to the ground Saturday as a long-simmering leadership dispute in the Cayuga Indian Nation flared up for a second time in a week. The altercation followed a news conference by a group of chiefs who oppose the authority of Clint Halftown, the federally recognized leader of the roughly 500-member western New York tribe. Halftown on Feb. 22 sent bulldozers to demolish a convenience store and other buildings controlled by tribe members who oppose him. The seven chiefs called a news conference Saturday adjacent to a disputed property to address the incident and brought supporters from other American Indian nations that make up the Haudenosaunee Confederacy. A group that crossed the caution tape and walked onto the property after the news conference was immediately confronted by a large group wearing Cayuga Nation Police jackets, and fighting broke out, according to The Citizen of Auburn.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The shuffling of Gov. Roy Cooper’s original Cabinet became official Friday with changes at the transportation and information technology departments. Eric Boyette, the new Department of Transportation secretary, and Tracy Doaks, secretary of the information technology department, were sworn in to their posts by Court of Appeals Judge Reuben Young in a private ceremony, Cooper’s office said. Doaks, most recently the chief deputy state chief information officer, suceeded Boyette as secretary at the state IT office. At DOT, Boyette succeeded Jim Trogdon, who retired from state government. Boyette previously worked in DOT as inspector general and the Division of Motor Vehicles commissioner before going over to information technology in 2015. Cooper announced the changes last month. The other eight members of Cooper’s Cabinet from 2017 are still in their original jobs.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A man shot and killed by police last month did not fire at officers as authorities initially reported, though he did point a handgun at them, justifying the use of deadly force. The Bismarck Tribune reports an investigation found Cody Carnes, 30, of Bismarck, also had a handful of encounters with police in the two weeks leading up to his death that were tied to alleged drug use, mental health issues and threats against law enforcement. Burleigh County State’s Attorney Julie Lawyer on Monday said the shooting of Carnes was justifiable. Authorities said Carnes pointed a gun at officers outside his window after police were called to a noise complaint at his residence Jan. 9. A report that Lawyer sent to Bismarck Police Chief Dave Draovitch stated that one of the two firing officers “believed he saw and heard Carnes fire a round from the handgun and returned fire,” but the other officer “stated he did not believe that Carnes had fired the handgun.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A proposed constitutional amendment that would set 16-year term limits on legislators serving in the state House or Senate has cleared its initial hurdle. Ohioans for Legislative Term Limits is the group seeking to close a loophole that’s allowed multiple legislators to jump back and forth between the House and Senate after reaching the current eight-year limit in one or the other chamber. The group’s goal is to place the amendment on the Nov. 3 ballot. Republican Attorney General Dave Yost’s office certified the campaign’s first 1,000 signatures Thursday and also certified that the summary petition language is “fair and truthful.” The issue goes next to the state Ballot Board, which must determine whether it contains a single issue or multiple issues.\n\nOklahoma\n\nNorman: Dozens of students at the University of Oklahoma have ended a sit-in outside the school’s administrative offices following two instances in which professors used racial slurs in their classrooms. The three-day sit-in organized by the Black Emergency Response Team ended Friday with the student group saying progress had been made. OU Dean of Students David Surratt said in a statement Friday that the students “raised legitimate concerns,” and their demands “were actually solutions” the university has included in a strategic plan to be presented to OU regents. One idea was the creation of a student advisory committee. BERT co-director Miles Francisco told The Oklahoman that the student advisory committee will provide “insights and advice to the office of the senior president and provost.”\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A federal judge said he wouldn’t block new city housing screening and security deposit rules that took effect over the weekend because a rental industry group waited too long to file a legal challenge. U.S. District Judge Michael Simon on Thursday said he was denying a request from Multifamily NW for a temporary restraining order to delay two Fair Access in Renting ordinances. He said it was because the almost yearlong gap between when the City Council approved them and when the group sued Feb. 21 “implies a lack of urgency or a lack of irreparable harm,” The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. Multifamily NW and two landlords sued the city, claiming the new rules were unconstitutional and ultimately should never go into effect. Simon said he didn’t believe U.S. District Court was the appropriate venue to sort out the constitutionality of city policies.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: A man stole an ambulance and tried to run over an officer who shot him three times, leading to a low-speed chase through the city that lasted more than an hour Friday night, authorities said. Authorities were called to a motel in northeast Philadelphia about 9:20 p.m. for reports of a domestic disturbance involving a man and a woman that necessitated medical attention for one or more parties, Staff Inspector Sekou Kinebrew of Philadelphia police said. The man became combative and jumped into the ambulance, driving at one of the officers who medics called for backup, Kinebrew said. The officer fired his weapon four times, striking the man three times: twice in the left leg and once in the side. The officer was struck by the ambulance and hospitalized with injuries that Kinebrew described as non-life-threatening.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Former British Prime Minister Theresa May is speaking at Brown University this week. May is giving an address about global affairs at 5:30 p.m. Wednesday at the university’s campus in Providence. University President Christina Paxson will lead a discussion on the successes, challenges and inspirations behind May’s decades­long government career. The event is free and open to the public, but attendees must register in advance, and tickets are limited. May served as prime minister for three years. In her final months, Parliament repeatedly rejected the Brexit divorce deal with the European Union that was the cornerstone of her administration. She finally accepted that her Conservative Party was hopelessly divided on the issue and succumbed to pressure to step down. May’s address is titled “Politics, Populism and Polarization: Perspectives on the Global Economy.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nTravelers Rest: Investigators shut down an entire state park Saturday as they searched for a man wanted for murder, but they didn’t find the suspect. Greenville County deputies found an SUV they think was driven by Ryan Kedar just outside Paris Mountain State Park and decided to close the park, sheriff’s spokesman Lt. Ryan Flood said. About 100 officers searched all day Saturday at the park north of Greenville but did not find Kedar or anything else except for the SUV tying him to the park, Flood said in a statement. Kedar allegedly shot and killed 58-year-old Mark Jermon at a park in Taylors on Wednesday, authorities said. The men knew each other, but deputies aren’t sure what led to the shooting, Flood said. Kedar, 49, is an avid camper and hiker at state and national parks, Flood said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSturgis: A motorcycle club is opposing a move by the city to annex some of the club’s property on the western edge of town. Jackpine Gypsies Motorcycle Club President Brett Winsell said the annexation goes beyond the potential for higher property taxes. He said the club is more concerned with current and future city ordinances concerning noise, signage and other issues that may prevent the club from staging its races and other events on the grounds. The Jackpine Gypsies and founder J.C. Pappy Hoel began the Sturgis motorcycle rally in 1938 and have hosted motorcycle races, hill climbs, motocross and other events. City Manager Daniel Ainslie said the Jackpine Gypsies property and other parcels under consideration for annexation benefit from city services and should pay for them. The Rapid City Journal reports a public hearing is scheduled Monday, followed by a council vote on the intent to annex.\n\nTennessee\n\nManchester: More than three months before the start of the 2020 Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival, the event is already sold out in record time. That includes all general admission passes and VIP packages, plus the new mid-tier “GA+” tickets. Bonnaroo says this is the quickest sellout in the festival’s 19-year history. For comparison’s sake, last year’s event was also a rare sellout, but that didn’t happen until the day before the music began. It also continues an impressive commercial rebound for the fest. Last year marked Bonnaroo’s first sellout since 2013 and came three years after a dismal 2016, when ticket sales hit an all-time low of roughly 46,000 in 2016. The 2020 Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival takes place June 11-14 at Great Stage Park in Manchester. Lizzo, Tool and Tame Impala headline, alongside Miley Cyrus, Lana Del Rey, Vampire Weekend, Bassnectar, The 1975 and Flume, among 100-plus acts.\n\nTexas\n\nSan Antonio: State health officials say people who visited the cattle barn at the San Antonio Stock Show and Rodeo may need to be assessed for possible rabies exposure because a cow there had the virus. The Texas Department of State Health Services said Saturday that people who visited the barn Feb. 11-14 may need to be assessed. Health officials say they’ve been in contact with the people who were caring for the cow and the animals in nearby stalls. The cow was being shown by a student. Rabies is spread through the saliva of infected animals. It can be prevented if treatment is started before symptoms begin; however, once symptoms start, it’s almost always fatal, health officials said. If someone is exposed, it usually takes between three weeks and three months for them to get sick.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Polygamy wouldn’t be a felony crime in the state for the first time in 85 years under a bill that passed the Legislature on Friday and appears to be supported by the governor. Lawmakers voted overwhelmingly for the proposal that supporters said will allow the 30,000 or so people living in the state’s polygamous communities to come out of the shadows and report abuses such as underage marriage by other polygamists without fear of prosecution. “It seems so surreal; you’re so used to it not being this way,” said Joe Darger, a Utah polygamist who has three wives. Republican Gov. Gary Herbert has indicated he will likely sign the proposal that makes polygamy between consenting adults an infraction, like a traffic offense, that carries no possible jail time. “This one has overwhelming support, though it’s not without some controversy,” Herbert said during his monthly news conference at PBS Utah on Thursday.\n\nVermont\n\nFerrisburgh: Oliver the camel, a quirky roadside attraction and social media darling, has died at age 17 in Vermont. “Ollie” delighted travelers along Route 7 in Ferrisburgh for nearly two decades. Many motorists stopped for photos and selfies with the friendly creature, which sported two humps. Oliver Camel’s Facebook page anounced Friday that he died Feb. 21. It did not cite the cause of his death. The Facebook post noted that “Ollie” was loved and spoiled and looking forward to an afterlife. “My next adventure is ahead and I am ready to take it on – to go where no camel has gone before!!” the post said. Ollie lived on a sheep farm. He was a Bactrian camel that’s native to Asia, so the cold weather didn’t bother him. His owner didn’t immediately return a message Saturday.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Officials from southwest Virginia have mounted a last-minute push to oppose the possible early closure of one of the country’s newest coal plants. A Dominion Energy facility in Wise County that opened eight years ago and is frequently touted as the cleanest of its type could close decades sooner than expected under a sweeping rewrite of the state’s energy generation policy that Democrats are advancing through the General Assembly. Advocates of the bill say Virginia needs to move away from fossil fuel-fired generation in order to address climate change. But Republican lawmakers and local officials in southwest Virginia have called its potential early retirement a “tragedy” that would blow a hole in the budgets of two localities and devastate a region that’s been working to revitalize an economy built on coal mining but isn’t there yet.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A man who recently served prison time on a gun charge amassed an arsenal of homemade “ghost guns” after his release even though he was on federal supervision, according to a criminal complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court. Nathan Brasfield, 40, of Edmonds, was sentenced to four years in prison after a 2014 arrest for being a felon in possession of a firearm. He began a three-year term of supervised release in October 2017. The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Seattle said in a federal complaint unsealed Thursday that when agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives searched his home and vehicle Feb. 6, they found dozens of guns as well as several machines used in home manufacturing of firearms: a 3-D printer, drill press and computer numerical control machine – also known as a “ghost gunner.” Agents reported finding 17 pistols, 24 rifles and 10 silencers, with most of the guns being homemade and having no serial numbers.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state may soon stiffen fines for restaurants that fail to secure the lids of grease pits after a young girl fell into one of the collection traps last year. The House of Delegates on Friday unanimously approved a measure to increase fines from $5 to $50 per day for businesses that don’t secure the grease pit lids. The proposal, which was unanimously approved by the Senate earlier this month, now goes back to that chamber with some minor amendments. The bill followed an incident last November in which 5-year-old Kambria Cvechko stepped on one of the lids outside a Charleston restaurant and fell into the pit’s narrow opening, submerging into the dark, putrid grease. Her panicked mother scurried down the hole headfirst as two other children anchored her feet, clawing through the slick liquid for her daughter’s arms as she could hear the girl gasping for air. Eventually, Kambria was lifted out of the pit without any major injuries.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: Gov. Tony Evers vetoed Republican lawmakers’ tough-on-crime legislation Friday. The vetoes were hardly a surprise, as the governor campaigned on cutting the state’s prison population in half. The bills would have required the Department of Corrections to recommend revoking a person’s extended supervision, parole or probation if he or she is charged with a crime; expanded the list the violations that could land a child in a youth prison to include any act that would be an adult felony; forbid prosecutors from amending charges of illegally possessing a gun against a person convicted of a violent felony or attempting to commit a violent felony; and blocked violent criminals from participating in early release programs. Evers said in his veto messages that the revocation recommendation bill would have cost the state $200 million in just the first two years. The DOC has projected the bill would force the agency to build two new prisons to handle the influx of new inmates.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A measure to impose a 5% statewide lodging tax appears likely to pass the Legislature after the state Senate approved it. The Senate, which defeated a similar bill last year, passed the lodging tax measure Friday by a 16-13 vote. The measure had previously passed the House. A committee must negotiate differences in the versions that each chamber approved before the bill advances to the governor. Gov. Mark Gordon has previously endorsed the bill, saying a lodging tax is the only new tax he would support. Wyoming is seeking ways to shore up its budget amid declining energy production revenue, but the Republican-dominated Legislature is reluctant to support tax increases. Other tax bills have been defeated in the legislative session or failed to generate enough support to be introduced.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/07/12/weeding-robots-goat-lottery-liquor-shortage-news-around-states/117484386/", "title": "Weeding robots, goat lottery: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A state agency said Friday that it will work with private organizations to encourage more elderly and disabled people to get vaccines for COVID-19, which is on the rise as the state’s inoculation rate trails the nation. With Alabama ahead of only Mississippi in vaccinations and just 30% of the state’s population fully inoculated against the illness caused by the coronavirus, the Alabama Department of Senior Services said a new marketing campaign was aimed at overcoming vaccine hesitancy. The agency will work with local agencies for the aging and disability organizations to encourage more people to get shots. A telephone hotline will allow people to reach local services and make vaccination appointments, which has been difficult for some disabled people. Vaccination rates have dropped statewide to the lowest point since early this year, when doses were scarce, and only certain people were eligible to receive shots. While less than a third of the state’s population is fully vaccinated, precautions like face masks and social distancing are increasingly rare in the state. Meanwhile, hospitalizations are rising in a trend that is troubling to health experts. State statistics showed 252 people were being treated for COVID-19 in hospitals Thursday compared to a low of 166 late last month.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A state court judge is scheduled to hear arguments Monday in a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a voter-approved initiative that would end party primaries in Alaska and institute ranked-choice voting in general elections. Scott Kohlhaas, who unsuccessfully ran for a state House seat last year as a Libertarian; Bob Bird, chairman of the Alaskan Independence Party; Bird’s party; and Anchorage attorney Kenneth P. Jacobus sued in December, shortly after the initiative was approved. In court documents, they say people “exercise their right of free political association by forming political parties for the purpose of electing candidates” and advancing issues and principles. They call the new voter-approved system a “political experiment” and say it was designed in a way to harm political parties. They cite concerns that candidates for minor parties, like the Alaskan Independence Party, could get “lost in the shuffle” in a primary where all candidates are listed on one ballot and the top four vote-getters advance to the general election. Attorneys for the state Department of Law in court documents say the plaintiffs’ opposition includes a mix of policy arguments and speculation. They say the claims raised by the plaintiffs “rest on a misunderstanding” of what the initiative does, according to court filings.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Gov. Doug Ducey on Friday signed legislation banning state or local governments from requiring training in “critical race theory” and a bill creating a new small-business income tax category that will allow small-business owners to avoid paying any of the 3.5% income tax surcharge voters approved in November. The new small-business tax is expected to cut $292 million from the original $836 million schools would have received under Proposition 208, according to the Legislature’s budget analysts. Backers of the initiative have vowed to block the new law by referring it to the ballot. Ducey also signed a measure that tightens the state’s sex education law and requires parents to give permission for instruction that includes sexual issues in non-sex ed classes. The broad requirement would block discussions of historic events that have a sexual component, like the 1969 Stonewall riots in New York, considered the genesis of the modern gay rights movement, or even the U.S. Supreme Court ruling legalizing gay marriage, without parental preapproval. “Parents should have the right to know what their children are learning in school,” Ducey said in a statement. “This is a no-brainer piece of legislation that protects our children from learning materials that aren’t suited for them.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Arkansas State Police on Friday handed over to prosecutors the results of the agency’s investigation into a deputy’s fatal shooting of a white teenager that has drawn the attention of civil rights activists nationwide. Lonoke County Prosecutor Chuck Graham said his office received the case file on the shooting of 17-year-old Hunter Brittain by Lonoke County sheriff’s deputy Sgt. Michael Davis during a June 23 traffic stop. Graham said the file has been taken to the state prosecutor coordinator since he’s requested a special prosecutor to handle the case. Authorities have released few details about the shooting, and State Police earlier Friday referred questions about the case file to Graham’s office. Brittain’s family has said the teenager was unarmed and holding a jug of antifreeze at the time of the shooting. Prosecutor Coordinator Bob McMahan said a special prosecutor should be named early this week. Davis was fired by Lonoke County Sheriff John Staley last week for not turning on his body camera until after the shooting occurred. Staley said there’s no footage from the shooting, only the aftermath. The Rev. Al Sharpton and two attorneys who represented George Floyd said the teen’s death highlighted the need for interracial support for efforts to reform police practices.\n\nCalifornia\n\nBurbank: Batman’s secret cave, Harry Potter’s cupboard under the stairs and the apartment from “Friends” are major centerpieces to the huge Warner Bros. studio lot expansion. Warner Bros. Studio Tour Hollywood recently reopened more than a year after doors were shuttered because of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, attendees will have a chance to explore the studio’s nearly 100 years of television and filmmaking history, highlighting the DC Universe and “Harry Potter.” A firsthand look took place a couple of days before the tour opened in late June at the Southern California studio, which now welcomes families with children ages 5 and older. Warner Bros. officials said the expansion – which includes a new building – took five years to develop in Burbank. Officials say the studio tour will follow all city, state and federal COVID-19 safety protocols. “One of the most incredible things about Warner Brothers is the incredible history of epic films that are legendary,” said “Wonder Woman” director Patty Jenkins, who helped reopen the tour.\n\nColorado\n\nDurango: A 10-year-old died of plague in La Plata County, San Juan Basin Public Health said Friday. Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and health officials said they are investigating the case and will provide more information as it becomes available, 9News reports. No other information on the child was immediately released. “We are so sad for the loss of this young Coloradan, and our deepest condolences go to the family,” said Dr. Jennifer House of the health department. “Public Health is doing an epidemiological investigation and wants Coloradans to know that while this disease is very rare, it does occur sometimes and to seek medical care if you have symptoms.” Officials say plague is caused by bacteria that can be transmitted to humans by the bites of infected fleas or by direct contact with infected animals. The risk of contracting certain animal-borne diseases, while present year-round, increases during the summer when humans and animals are frequently in close contact. Most human plague cases are acquired directly from fleas. Officials say it’s important to wear repellent when outdoors and keep up to date on pet vaccinations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says symptoms of the plague include fever, headache, chills, weakness, and one or more swollen, tender and painful lymph nodes.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: State employee union leaders are suing to stop Gov. Ned Lamont’s order to have workers return to the office now that much of the state has emerged from the pandemic, accusing him of violating prior telework agreements reached with the unions and ignoring the benefits of having people work from home. The State Employees Bargaining Agent Coalition, which filed the request for an injunction in Hartford Superior Court on Tuesday, said in a statement that state workers proved throughout the COVID-19 crisis that a flexible teleworking agreement could be beneficial to the state of Connecticut. “From increased productivity and quality performance to the positive environmental impacts like reduced emissions, improved air quality and public health, the benefits of telework are clear and something that the Administration should be taking a proud step in leading,” SEBAC said in a statement posted on its website. In May, Lamont sent an email to state employees announcing that they would be returning to their offices as of July 1 and that any telework would be limited to no more than 50% of their time, with manager approval.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: More than 111 years after it sank off the Delmarva coast and 43 years after divers found and looted it, researchers can finally – and officially – say where the USS Nina is located and why the U.S. Navy steamer built in the 1860s likely sank. The University of Delaware is a big reason why. A two-day mission out of Lewes led by UD oceanographer Dr. Arthur Trembanis in mid-June used the school’s new autonomous underwater vehicle to help identify the sunken ship. The university has been partnering with the Navy for nearly a decade, and Trembanis’ group has been mapping the seafloor for years. The drone used during the mission has a shape similar to a small torpedo. Trembanis needed to test the new equipment and said the “stars aligned” nicely for this mission since Dr. Jim Delgado, senior vice president of SEARCH Inc., a cultural resource management firm, had been talking about a mission to officially identify the Nina. Using UD’s technology, the mission did in hours what divers and researchers may have needed days or weeks to do. “We’re really privileged at UD to have one of the most largest and advanced fleets of autonomous systems in the country,” Trembanis said. A violent February storm appears the likely culprit for the ship’s loss.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: With more homicides so far in 2021 than by this same time in 2020 and carjacking incidents skyrocketing, the police department is trying to get a handle on the crimes by getting back to the basics of community policing. D.C. police officers in the 4th District have been hitting the streets, knocking on doors and starting conversations with people in the community, WUSA-TV reports. “This is an opportunity for folks to really give us some feedback – let us know what we’re doing right, what we’re doing wrong,” Inspector James Madison Boteler said. The work officers are doing is part of an initiative called “100 blocks in 100 days.” “It’s really just a get-back-to-the-basics kind of police work,” he said. Boteler, who is in a newly appointed position with the 4th Police District, is teaming up with officers covering parts of Northwest and Northeast to build better relationships with neighbors. “The amount of folks that live in the city versus the amount of crime that we respond to on a daily basis is ever-increasing,” Boteler said. To help fight that crime and the growing number of homicides year after year in the district, Chief Robert Contee selected a handful of inspectors to serve as second-in-command for larger police districts.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: Red tide could cause people along certain parts of the Gulf Coast to experience respiratory irritation, health officials said. The Florida Department of Health in Pinellas County on Sunday recommended that anyone with chronic respiratory problems consider staying away from areas experiencing red tide, the Tampa Bay Times reports. Officials also advised people not to swim around dead fish and to keep pets away from water, sea foam and dead marine life. The National Weather Service in Tampa issued a beach hazards statement Saturday evening cautioning that red tide can cause coughing, sneezing and tears in the eyes and that symptoms can be worse for people with asthma, emphysema or other chronic lung diseases. Red tide is an algae bloom producing toxins that kill fish. The toxins may also make the surrounding air difficult to breathe and often turn the water red. Those with allergies also can be affected, National Weather Service meteorologist Paul Close told the newspaper. “And just the smell, dead fish smell,” he said. St. Petersburg crews cleaned up 9 tons of dead fish in 24 hours last week, the paper reports. During a news conference Friday, St. Petersburg Emergency Manager Amber Boulding said red tide blooms killed the fish, and Tropical Storm Elsa pushed them ashore.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The Biden administration’s decision to reevaluate Georgia’s plan to overhaul how residents buy health insurance under the Affordable Care Act came as a “surprise” and suggests it wants to revisit the plan’s approval, which is not allowed, Gov. Brian Kemp’s office said. The “Georgia Access” plan would improve the experience of shopping for insurance and encourage the private sector to enroll uninsured residents, the director of Kemp’s Office of Health Strategy and Coordination said in a letter to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “Despite unsubstantiated claims to the contrary, Georgia Access will put more affordable, quality insurance coverage within reach of consumers in our state than a one-size-fits-all federal solution,” said the letter by Grant Thomas. Under the Republican governor’s plan, residents would bypass healthcare.gov and shop for federally subsidized health insurance through private agents. Critics worry the move will make it harder to shop for insurance and drive healthy people to cheaper plans that provide limited coverage, increasing premiums for older and sicker people who need the comprehensive benefits required by the ACA because the move to private websites would make it easier for consumers to simultaneously see plans that don’t provide all the benefits required by the federal health care law.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: To protect historic lands from invasive goats, officials will distribute the live animals to the public via a lottery. Hawaii officials will hold the lottery as a way to remove at least 700 goats from Puuhonua o Honaunau National Historic Park, which is an important cultural and historical site on the west side of the Big Island, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Those interested in the goats may apply for permits, which will be issued through a random lottery July 28. The state Department of Land and Natural Resources will distribute 20 to 50 goats per permit. Applicants must indicate how many goats they want and can’t choose individual animals. Lottery winners must have a 16-foot enclosed horse trailer or equivalent to pick up the goats so that they don’t escape. A permit can be refused if a trailer isn’t secured.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little on Friday mobilized the Idaho National Guard to help fight wildfires amid an ongoing drought and extreme heat. The Republican governor issued an emergency declaration allowing soldiers to help fight fires on the 9,700 square miles in mostly northern Idaho where the state provides fire protection. “Wildfire is presenting an imminent threat to life, property, and the environment, and we need all hands on deck,” Little said in a statement. “I appreciate our firefighters and fire managers for working so hard under such challenging conditions, and I am grateful that our guardsmen are able to step in once again to support Idaho communities.” It’s the first time the Idaho Department of Lands has requested the governor issue such an emergency declaration. The agency said the soldiers will help with fire suppression and logistics support. State officials didn’t say how many soldiers might be deployed to help with wildfires. Officials also said National Guard Blackhawk helicopters could be used to drop water or other suppressants on fires as well as transport firefighters and supplies. Besides tapping the National Guard, the Lands Department has also requested workers in the agency with fire line qualifications to make themselves available for fire assignments.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Visitors to this year’s Illinois State Fair will be able to visit one of the nation’s more historic highways with the creation of the Route 66 Experience. The multiyear project will turn the Springfield fairgrounds’ Gate 2 into a year-round destination for visiting a microform of the Mother Road in Illinois, from Chicago to the Chain of Rocks Bridge over the Mississippi River in Madison. It will highlight communities and attractions along the way. The project sponsor, the Illinois Route 66 Scenic Byway, will have the first phase completed by the state fair’s opening Aug. 12, executive director Casey Wichmann said. “Being able to provide visitors a central location to experience what our historic road has to offer is an amazing opportunity prior to the 100th anniversary of Route 66,” Wichmann said. The 2,448-mile highway, one of the nation’s first interstate “hard roads,” was begun 95 years ago. Dubbed the “Mother Road” by John Steinbeck in his novel “The Grapes of Wrath,” it runs from Chicago’s Loop business district to Santa Monica, California. Its path through Illinois is similar to that of current-day Interstate 55. Once running, the exhibit will feature Quick Response codes and story boards detailing historic attractions and businesses. Those communities lining Route 66 will be invited to participate.\n\nIndiana\n\nBunker Hill: Six inmates are alleging in lawsuits that they were kept in near-total darkness for weeks at a time and suffered electric shocks from exposed wires at a state prison. The lawsuits filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana claim the conditions at the maximum-security Miami Correctional Facility near Peru amounted to cruel and unusual punishment. The lawsuits claim that the six men were held in isolation cells that had no lights and that some of them suffered cuts from broken window glass and were shocked by dangling wires from a broken light fixture while trying to make their way around in the dark. ACLU of Indiana attorney Ken Falk called the prison’s action “torture.” Inmate Jeremy Blanchard’s lawsuit filed in March said he was kept in nearly total darkness for about a month last year, and the conditions led to hallucinations and severe anxiety. Attorneys for the state have denied the allegations and asked a federal judge to dismiss the lawsuit. The other five lawsuits were filed this month. A Department of Correction spokeswoman declined to comment on those cases.\n\nIowa\n\nVentura: The road running between a marsh wildlife area and Clear Lake in this small northern Iowa city is dangerous for turtles, even with a turtle crossing sign. So five boys have spent some time this summer helping the turtles cross it. On one recent summer day, they spent several hours assisting turtles, saving 20 to 30 from being flattened by motorists, and they reckon they’ve saved close to 200 overall, the Mason City Globe Gazette reports. “One time, I saw a pile of flattened turtles and two baby turtles – their parents must’ve died – so that motivated me to save other turtles,” said 10-year-old Zacaious Moe. Four friends have joined Zacaious in the turtle rescuing: Keygan Hoover, 9; Blake Meyer, 8; Cole Meyer, 10; and Casen Wenzel, 8. “That’s such a neat thing for them to spend their day doing that,” said Ventura City Administrator Else Taylor. Taylor said the turtle crossing sign and a geese crossing sign have been up for several years. “We have had issues with geese and turtles getting run over in large amounts,” she said. “I walk my dog by some of these places, and there are turtle pancakes.”\n\nKansas\n\nCheney: A central Kansas farmer has invented robots that can whack weeds and reduce the use of pesticides on crops. For years, Clint Brauer has struggled with keeping weeds out of his row crops. Along with keeping living roots in the ground, organic practices and no-till methods, he tried crimping, but the pigweeds just grew taller. Three years ago, Brauer, an ex-California-based executive who farms in Haven and Cheney, decided to implement a wild plan, using robots to behead weeds. “I realized there was no great way to get the weeds out at scale without chemicals,” Brauer said. “I needed to invent one.” So he started Greenfield Robotics. Before chemicals replaced them, workers pulled weeds from the farm. Greenfield Robotics puts the “workers” back in the field with a new kind of worker – a mechanized one. “We want to control weeds with labor and make it robot labor,” Brauer said. “Robotics is our way of putting (mechanized) labor back into the farm.” The challenge was that he felt regenerative farming did not work for large fields without the heavy use of agrichemicals. “I came up with the idea for it and tested it manually,” he said. “No one knew if it would work. It has to fit between rows.” Brauer uses the weeding bots on other farmers’ soybean crops in the area and hopes to work with sorghum, cotton and possibly canola farmers.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state Capitol is open again for visitors, but some fresh security regulations are in place. The new rules include measures detailing the types of masks allowed in the Capitol and prohibiting visitors from congregating in office entrances but still allow people to carry any gun of their choosing, with certain restrictions on ammunition and how they are secured. Gov. Andy Beshear said the emergency Capitol security measures were needed following the deadly Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, where supporters of former President Donald Trump stormed the building and forced the evacuation of members from both chambers. He also cited “a rise in domestic terror around the country.” Armed protesters have been a common sight outside the Capitol since the onset of the pandemic and even after the Jan. 6 insurrection, with the president of the Kentucky Three Percenters notably hanging the governor in effigy at one protest. About a dozen masked men wearing camouflage and carrying rifles posed for photos in the Capitol Rotunda in early 2020 – the same day as a large protest against a proposed “red flag” gun law – near the governor’s office, while the House and Senate were in session. Visitors won’t be allowed to wear their own face mask in the Capitol but will be given one by security as they enter.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLake Charles: The state’s newest food trail has the quirky name No Man’s Land: Gas Station Eats. No Man’s Land was one of the names for a buffer zone between U.S. and Spanish territories for about 13 years after the Louisiana Purchase. The Gas Station Eats food trail is starting with three stops in each of seven southwest Louisiana parishes, The American Press reports. The 450-mile route runs through Calcasieu, Allen, Beauregard, Sabine, Natchitoches, Vernon and DeSoto parishes. Stops range from the South Beau Dairy Barn in the Beauregard Parish community of Longville to French Market Express, which offers meat pies, plate lunches, yam cakes, cookies and pies in Natchitoches. There’s also an Exxon station in Natchitoches, Big Thicket BBQ in DeRidder, a Shop-A-Lott in Mansfield and another in Many, Anacoco Mercantile, and a Grab N Geaux in Lake Charles. Several stops offer fried boudin balls and whole sausages such as boudin and andouille. Others have fried fish, burgers, sandwiches – and, in Zwolle, tamales. All are in the seven-parish area known as No Man’s Land and the Neutral Strip from about 1806 until a treaty in 1819 established the Sabine River as the boundary between the United States and what later became the state of Texas.\n\nMaine\n\nBangor: The state is nearly tripling the number of acoustic shark detectors in coastal waters a year after its first fatal shark attack. The Maine Department of Marine Resources deployed eight acoustic receivers in coastal waters a year ago between Wells and Popham Beach, raising the number of sensors to 11. This summer, the state has deployed 32 acoustic receivers between York and Boothbay Harbor, said agency spokesperson Jeff Nichols. The sensors don’t provide real-time data. They must be brought to shore for the data to be downloaded to determine if they detected sharks that were previously tagged with transmitters by researchers, the Bangor Daily News reports. The extra sensors come a year a fatal attack in Harpswell. Julie Dimperio Holowach, 63, of New York City, was killed by a great white shark while swimming. It was Maine’s first fatal shark attack and the third fatal shark attack in New England. An increasing presence of large sharks in New England waters is tied to a growing number of seals.\n\nMaryland\n\nTowson: Mobile crisis teams in Baltimore County respond to fewer than half of calls to help people having mental health crises. But The Baltimore Sun reports that a pilot program funded by a $1.6 million federal grant aims to add more behavioral health professionals and set up a system to redirect some 911 calls from police to behavioral health resources. Of 4,319 calls for service since September, crisis teams have responded to 1,844, according to police data. When teams aren’t available – about 57% of the time – requests for aid are rerouted to officers, according to Police Chief Melissa Hyatt. “We have a significant capacity limitation,” Hyatt told lawmakers during a state Commission to Study Mental and Behavioral Health briefing earlier this year. There are 20 part-time and full-time clinicians and 12 officers with 40 hours of crisis intervention training in the county of nearly 830,000 residents. Next month, officials begin planning the program’s rollout, police spokeswoman Joy Stewart said. The program was announced just weeks before a May rampage in which a man set his Woodlawn home on fire and killed three neighbors before police killed him. Police said crisis teams had previous interactions with him but didn’t disclose more details.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nPlymouth: Archaeologists combing a hill near Plymouth Rock where a park will be built in tribute to the Pilgrims and their Native American predecessors have made a poignant discovery: It’s not the first time the site has been used as a memorial. David Landon of the University of Massachusetts-Boston’s Fiske Center for Archaeological Research said his team unearthed a cache of personal items he thinks were buried there in the late 1800s, most likely by a brokenhearted settler who had outlived all three of her children. Landon said the objects – eyeglasses, clothing, sewing implements, a pocket watch and a book – gave him chills because they turned up during final excavations of Cole’s Hill, a National Historic Landmark site in Plymouth where Remembrance Park is set to be constructed. “Someone clearly used that space in that fashion in the past to memorialize members of their family,” said Landon, whose team spent the past month scouring the waterfront site where the Pilgrims are said to have come ashore in 1620. Remembrance Park originally was conceived to mark 2020’s 400th anniversary of the Pilgrim’s 1620 arrival, the founding of Plymouth Colony and the settlers’ historic interactions with the indigenous Wampanoag people. But then the coronavirus pandemic hit, idling events as well as construction.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Massive amounts of green are being spent to find green ways to prevent basements, yards, streets and freeways in the city from flooding during heavy storms like one last month. Of $100 million pumped each year into infrastructure upgrades for the city’s aging water and sewer systems, $10 million goes toward installing detention ponds, bioswales, rain gardens and permeable pavement. Called green stormwater infrastructure, the features hold and slowly release rainfall into sewers, lessening flooding that has plagued Detroit and other older cities for decades. “It’s not the end-all-be-all, but it is a type of intervention that reduces wet weather flows into the system or delays them,” said Palencia Mobley, deputy director and chief engineer for Detroit’s Water and Sewerage Department. City officials say 6 inches of rain that poured down in the area June 25-26 was the most at one time in 80 years. As with a funnel beneath a swiftly flowing faucet, the volume of water moved faster than it could be pumped out or pushed through sewers to water treatment plants. Water pooled in streets and yards as debris clogged sewer grates. Untreated water pushed up through basement drains. Motorists were stranded on freeways. New vehicles in one auto plant lot were nearly submerged.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state is planning to close all but one of its COVID-19 mass vaccination sites by Aug. 7. A statement from Gov. Tim Walz late Friday said the state will focus on the several hundred smaller vaccination sites around the state, at pharmacies and health care providers. Minnesota Public Radio reports the state’s COVID-19 vaccination rate has been stagnant in recent weeks, at about two-thirds of residents 16 and older with at least one vaccine dose. Health officials have been turning to small-scale, targeted efforts to get the shots to more people. As of Friday the state reported administering more than 618,000 vaccine doses at the mass vaccination sites since January. The Mall of America location will be the only state-run mass vaccination site to stay open past the first week of August. As of Sunday, the state-run sites in St. Paul, Oakdale, Lino Lakes, Duluth, Rochester, Mankato and St. Cloud are only offering second doses of the COVID-19 vaccine in their final weeks of operation. The state-run site at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport will offer the one-dose Johnson and Johnson vaccine until it closes in early August.\n\nMississippi\n\nGreenwood: The Justice Department is continuing its investigation into the killing of Emmett Till, the Black teenager whose slaying 65 years ago in the Mississippi Delta community of Money sparked outrage and illustrated the brutality of racism in the segregated South. The department’s latest report on civil rights cold cases, released late last month, lists three investigations dating back decades that were closed because witnesses or suspects have died, leads went nowhere, or cases were too old to prosecute, but the Till case wasn’t among them. Relatives of Till said they didn’t know of anyone in the family who’d received official notification that the review had ended, a key step in the department’s process. “That’s all we know, that it’s still open,” family member Marvel Parker said Friday. Her husband, Wheeler Parker, was with Till the night he was taken from a family home at gunpoint. The youth’s brutalized body was later pulled from a river, where it had been weighted down with a cotton gin fan. Some news outlets reported last year that the investigation had ended. Initially closed in 2007, the case was reopened after a 2017 book quoted a key figure in the case, Carolyn Bryant Donham, as saying she lied when she claimed that the 14-year-old Till grabbed her, whistled and made sexual advances.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Three of the state’s top health officials said Friday that trusted local leaders and community representatives must be the primary influencers in the state’s efforts to reduce a surge in COVID-19 cases. During a virtual news conference, Robert Knodell, acting director of the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, said the state continues to have a strong relationship with federal health experts, but they all believe local health department workers and community representatives are the best avenue for persuading residents to be vaccinated. Knodell said federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials agree that people from out of state cannot “parachute” into Missouri to persuade residents to get vaccinated. “We’re on the same page as it relates to that,” Knodell said. The comments came after Republican Gov. Mike Parson said last week that he does not support a suggestion from President Joe Biden’s administration that government employees go door-to-door to urge people to get vaccinated. Jeffrey Zeints, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, responded that the program would rely on local doctors, faith leaders and others, and suggesting otherwise was “misinformation.”\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov. Greg Gianforte has discontinued Montana’s membership in a coalition of two dozen states dedicated to fighting climate change. The U.S. Climate Alliance is a nonpartisan group committed to achieving the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement and avoiding the worst impacts of climate change. Democratic former Gov. Steve Bullock joined the alliance in 2019. The alliance is made up of nearby Western states, including Colorado, Washington and Oregon. Evan Westrup, of the U.S. Climate Alliance, said Gianforte did not respond to the organization’s invitation to continue the state’s membership, Montana Public Radio reports. Gianforte spokesperson Brooke Stroyke said in a statement that the governor believes the solution to climate change is unleashing American innovation, not overbearing government mandates. She said the Paris Agreement punishes the U.S., while letting countries like China off the hook. Stroyke didn’t respond to requests to clarify Gianforte’s climate goals, or what sort of innovation is necessary in Montana. Amy Cilimburg, executive director of Climate Smart Missoula, said the state needs more than innovation. “The U.S. Climate Alliance was not some kind of a radical group; it was governors realizing that we’re stronger together,” Cilimburg said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Roughly 200 people were possibly exposed to a rabid bat while staying overnight at Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium, the zoo said. The zoo and Nebraska health officials recommended that roughly 186 campers who stayed overnight at the aquarium in recent weeks, as well as some staffers, get rabies shots. A camper on July 4 woke up to a wild bat flying around her head. A zoo emergency medical technician didn’t find any bites or scratches on her. The zoo found seven wild bats in the aquarium and euthanized them. One tested positive for rabies. The zoo in a news release Friday said it has recommended that people exposed to wild bats while they were sleeping get rabies shots. The zoo gave campers refunds and is paying for their shots. Animal Health Director Dr. Sarah Woodhouse said in a statement that guests who visited the aquarium during the day shouldn’t be concerned because bats only come out at night. “The bats we identified were little brown bats, a common bat species in Nebraska that anyone could find in their backyard or attic,” Woodhouse said. “It is not unusual for a wild bat to be infected with rabies, which is why you should never directly touch a wild bat.” Zoo staff didn’t find any signs of long-term bat roosting at the aquarium.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The U.S. Department of Energy has agreed to pay the state $65,000 after the government mislabeled and mischaracterized low-level radioactive waste that was shipped to a disposal site north of Las Vegas for more than five years. The settlement agreement announced Thursday certifies that multiple changes have been made to prevent unapproved waste from being shipped and disposed of at the Nevada National Security Site in the future, state and federal officials said. It also establishes an additional groundwater monitoring well at the site. The Energy Department has said none of the materials shipped to Nevada posed any health or safety threats to workers or the public. They were mischaracterized as the wrong category of low-level waste and should have been classified as low-level mixed waste, the state’s review determined. Low-level waste can include equipment or worker’s clothing contaminated by exposure to radiation, while mixed low-level waste can include toxic metals. Former Energy Secretary Rick Perry notified Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak in July 2019 that 33 packages of unapproved waste were sent in 10 shipments between 2013 and 2018 to the site from the Energy Department’s Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A council tasked with addressing broad issues around housing affordability and stability in the state seeks to increase housing availability by 13,500 units by 2024, according to its plan released Friday. The plan includes a three-year framework to specifically address homelessness across the state, with emphasis on the need for an increase in inventory of affordable housing. Recommendations include promoting new housing development, reducing barriers to affordable housing, and using a data-driven approach to understand regional needs. “The plan serves as a blueprint for our collective efforts – statewide, regionally, and locally – with a focus on alignment, coordination, innovation, and accountability,” Gov. Chris Sununu, who created the council last year, said in a statement. Sununu created the Council on Housing Stability after state police cleared a homeless encampment outside a courthouse in Manchester. It represents a revamping of the existing Interagency Council on Homelessness.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nSeaside Heights: Gov. Phil Murphy signed a package of bills Friday aimed at moving the state closer to its goal of generating 100% of its power from clean sources by 2050. The measures make it easier to develop some solar energy projects and to locate and build electric vehicle charging stations. But still waiting for action by the Democratic governor is another bill that would remove most local control from where and how offshore wind energy projects come ashore. Murphy did not mention that bill at a signing ceremony in Seaside Heights in a municipal parking lot across the street from a popular water park. “From wind turbine component manufacturing to solar to electric vehicles, we are well on our way to putting New Jersey back to its rightful place as a national leader” in clean energy, Murphy said. One measure makes it easier to locate electric vehicle charging stations throughout the state, eliminating the need to go before planning or zoning boards to get them approved. A similar bill signed by the governor encourages development of zero-emission vehicle fueling and charging infrastructure in redevelopment projects. Murphy also signed two measures dealing with solar power projects. One allows so-called dual use solar projects located on unpreserved farm land that is still also used for agricultural purposes.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Republican lawmakers are asking the state attorney general to weigh in on a spending dispute over $1.75 billion in federal pandemic relief aid. GOP leadership in a letter sent Thursday asked New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas, a Democrat, to issue a legal opinion declaring the funds must be allocated by the Legislature to protect the body’s fiscal authority. Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has said her administration must distribute the money because of the way Congress passed the pandemic relief bill. The Legislature allocated money earlier this year, but Lujan Grisham used her veto power to effectively bring the money under discretionary control by her office. Republican lawmakers took issue. They, along with one vocal Democratic senator, signed a petition that called for an extraordinary legislative session to be convened to override the governor’s veto and bring the funds back under the Legislature’s control. Democratic majorities in the House and Senate did not sign on. “Standing on principle isn’t always popular,” Sen. Jacob Candelaria, D-Albuquerque, said on Twitter in response to a news article. “Was easy for my Dem colleagues to challenge (the) power of (former Republican Gov. Susana) Martinez. Such a fair weather commitment to the law.”\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state is seeing an uptick in COVID-19 cases as vaccination rates slowly rise, according to data released Saturday. About 525 people each day tested positive for the coronavirus in New York for the seven days through Friday. That’s up from 369 people – a 42% increase – for the prior week. It’s unclear why more people in New York are testing positive, at a time when fewer people are getting tested. The state Department of Health said a higher percentage of cases are linked to more contagious variants and urged more people to get vaccinated. New York City is driving much of the increase in positives, though cases are also rising on parts of Long Island. Meanwhile, hospitalizations are flattening: Hospitals reported 342 COVID-19 patients as of Friday, similar to 340 patients from last Friday. About 55% of 20 million New Yorkers are fully vaccinated. That’s up from nearly 48% as of June 6. Vaccination rates are lowest in parts of western and central New York; about one-third of residents in Allegany County are fully vaccinated. Rates are also lower in parts of New York City: 43% of Bronx residents and 45.5% of Brooklyn residents are fully inoculated.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nFayetteville: Fayetteville State University has used pandemic relief funds to clear $1.6 million in tuition debt for nearly 1,500 students. The Fayetteville Observer reports the historically Black school utilized money from the federal legislation that’s known as the American Rescue Plan. Signed into law in March, it provided nearly $40 billion to higher education institutions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. FSU cleared tuition that was not covered by federal student grants or loans. The school also plans to use $4.7 million in federal funds to provide free summer classes to 1,400 undergraduates through the summer of 2023. “The university is focused on students’ success by clearing past due balances and erasing debt,” FSU spokeswoman Joy Cook said. “When the burden of financial stress is taken away, student success increases.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A Midwestern network and technology services provider says it plans to invest $200 million to upgrade and expand its fiber network in North Dakota. Midco said it’s part of a larger $500 million investment to its network in the upper Midwest that will benefit telehealth, education, government operations and remote working. Upgrading to 10-gigabit speed by 2030 is a goal toward which the cable provider has been working for the past couple years. “Now we think we can do it sooner,” said Midco President and CEO Pat McAdaragh. The phased upgrade begins in earnest in 2022, doubling Midco’s fiber network to 22,000 miles, McAdaragh said. Work in North Dakota will begin with a $100 million first phase in Bismarck, Dickinson and Fargo, lasting about three years. “Then immediately we’ll begin spending the other $100 million and getting to areas we haven’t gotten to done yet, so we’re looking at more of a six-year process than 10,” McAdaragh said. More than 25 communities, many of them rural, stand to benefit from the upgrade in North Dakota, the Bismarck Tribune reports. Midco expects remote work to continue to be an employment trend, sparked by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nOhio\n\nRootstown: An Ohio State Highway Patrol trooper successfully performed the Heimlich maneuver after a man allegedly attempted to swallow a bag of cannabis when he was pulled over for speeding. Ohio State Police Sgt. Ray Santiago said the traffic stop occurred July 3 in Portage County. Trooper Charles Hoskin stopped a vehicle that was allegedly traveling at 94 mph in a 70 mph zone, WEWS-TV reports. Dash camera video posted to the Ohio State Police Twitter account shows Hoskin asking if the driver could breathe before helping him out of the car and performing the Heimlich. The man expelled a bag of marijuana and apologized to the officer. After the man recovered, Hoskins asked: “Do you want to die over a minor misdemeanor?” The man received citations for speeding and failing to wear a seat belt, according to Santiago. The man also received a summons for marijuana and was released at the scene.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Health officials on Friday urged more residents to get vaccinated amid an alarming spike in new cases and hospitalizations for COVID-19, particularly in the northeastern part of the state. Oklahoma is seeing an uptick in cases with the emergence of the new delta variant of the coronavirus, particularly in rural areas where there are lower rates of vaccinations, said Oklahoma Health Commissioner Dr. Lance Frye. He said those numbers will likely continue to increase following the Fourth of July holiday. “Vaccination numbers for 12 to 34 years old are particularly low, meaning this demographic is especially at risk,” Frye said. “We want people to get out and enjoy their lives and their freedoms. Vaccination is the way to get there.” Oklahoma has the 11th lowest percentage of its population fully inoculated at 38.9%, compared to a national average of 47.8%, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Oklahoma has risen over the past two weeks from 190.29 new cases per day June 23 to 278.71 new cases per day Thursday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Meanwhile, the CDC on Friday said it identified 47 cases, all with the delta variant, in April and May associated with a central Oklahoma gymnastics facility.\n\nOregon\n\nPendleton: Dozens of baby hawks, desperate to escape a blast of early summer heat in recent weeks, bailed from their nests and plummeted to the ground. Calls poured into Blue Mountain Wildlife day after day as temperatures pushed beyond 110 degrees across Eastern Oregon. Lynn Tompkins told the East Oregonian that she hadn’t seen anything like it in her 30 years as director of the wildlife rehabilitation center outside Pendleton. “They had no choice,” said Tompkins, 68. “It was just too bloody hot to survive.” In all, the center took in nearly 50 nestling Swainson’s and Cooper’s hawks after they leaped from their nests in the extreme heat wave that baked the Pacific Northwest. Thirteen of the raptors suffered injuries severe enough that they had to be euthanized. “We knew the temperature was going to spike beforehand, and we assumed we might get a few more calls,” said Trisha Marquez, a volunteer who fielded the calls and who is Tompkins’ niece. “But we did not expect this at all.” The influx was more than the small staff could handle. They hardly had the space to put them all and, eventually, asked people to turn on their sprinklers and hoses and set out pans of water for less-injured birds to cool themselves down.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: A museum has returned to public view a 19th-century diorama that shows lions attacking a camel and its human rider, about a year after covering it up in response to complaints about how the courier was depicted. The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review reports a curtain around “Lion Attacking a Dromedary” at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History was removed a week ago, and information was posted to address the controversy. X-rays have confirmed that the figure contains a human skull and jaw, presenting an ethical problem for the museum, which does not know where those remains originated. The courier’s costume has been determined to be derived from at least five separate North African cultures. A new sign tells museum patrons that the exhibit, which vividly depicts two lions attacking a camel and its knife-wielding rider, is popular but reinforces stereotypes. “For the present, the museum is keeping the diorama on display,” the sign says. “We want to engage with visitors, staff, and community members to listen and learn from you as we consider the future of this diorama.” Museum director Gretchen Baker told the paper the curtains “were more harmful than not having them up at all,” and in hindsight covering the exhibit may not have been the right approach. The French-built diorama has been at the Carnegie since 1899.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Dan McKee has vetoed legislation that would make property owners register with the state before listing short-term rentals through online lodging websites, to the chagrin of some concerned about the unregulated nature of the industry. “I cannot support this bill because it will create additional burden for property owners,” the Democratic governor wrote Thursday in a veto message. “Short-term rental concerns, like other property/land use and small business matters, are most effectively addressed at the municipal level.” Some municipal leaders and residents are worried about properties rented on vacation rental websites like Airbnb and VRBO becoming de facto hotels. Calls for a registry increased in the spring after a 22-year-old University of Rhode Island student was fatally stabbed during a party at a rental property in Newport. The proposal was overwhelmingly approved by the heavily Democratic Legislature, which can override McKee’s veto. Senate President Dominick Ruggerio and House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, both Democrats, wrote in a joint statement that they were “disappointed” by the veto.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Conservationists have pulled a historic canoe from a river and plan to put it on display. Volunteers with the Chattooga Conservancy hauled the weathered wooden canoe out of the South Carolina side of the Chattooga River on Tuesday after a group of canoeists headed downstream discovered the craft last fall, The State newspaper reports. Archaeologists at the University of South Carolina say the boat could be 200 to 250 years old, a discovery that could shed light on life in the late 1700s. Canoes of that age are rarely found along the Chattooga, a free-flowing mountain river that runs along the Georgia-South Carolina border. Most of South Carolina’s historic canoes have been found in the state’s Lowcountry region, said underwater archaeologist James Spirek. “Up in the mountains on the rivers, they’re a little rare,” Spirek told the newspaper. “It’s interesting to find people were using canoes on some of these wild rivers.” The experts said the canoe was hollowed out using an iron hatchet or ax, suggesting it was made after Europeans settled in the Southeast. A nail was also found at one end of the canoe. Volunteers are expected this week to pull the boat up a mountain slope and down a bank to then float it down a calmer river stretch to move it out of the river corridor for storage or display.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Two Native Americans announced Thursday that they were joining a lawsuit against South Dakota alleging that state agencies failed to offer voter registration services. The two tribal members, along with the Lakota People’s Law Project, said they were asking a federal district judge to allow them to join a lawsuit that alleges state agencies are breaking federal law by not providing ample opportunities to register to vote or update voter registration information at places like motor vehicle and public assistance offices near Native American reservations. Federal law requires the agencies to help people register to vote at those kinds of offices, including ones that provide public assistance or serve people with disabilities. The Oglala Sioux Tribe and the Rosebud Sioux Tribe initiated the legal challenge last year. The state has denied those allegations in court documents and asked that the lawsuit be dismissed. The tribes have argued that state practices already make it difficult for Native American people to register to vote. They alleged that they have documented instances in which people tried to register their votes at state agency offices but were turned away.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A federal judge on Friday halted enforcement of a new state law requiring businesses to post special signs if they allow transgender people to use the bathroom of their choice. The first-of-its-kind law went into effect July 1 and would require such businesses to post signs on multiperson bathrooms that say: “This facility maintains a policy of allowing the use of restrooms by either biological sex, regardless of the designation on the restroom.” Businesses in Nashville and Chattanooga sued over the law, claiming that being forced to post those signs would violate their First Amendment rights by compelling them to communicate language they find offensive. The state of Tennessee argued in court that the signs are merely factual. In her Friday decision, U.S. District Judge Aleta Trauger handed a victory to the businesses that sued, granting a preliminary injunction that effectively prevents the state from enforcing the law while the case works through the courts. She noted that the U.S. Supreme Court has found that compelling individuals to “mouth support for views they find objectionable” violates a cardinal constitutional command unless justified by “the strongest of rationales.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A Houston man who received widespread attention after standing six hours in line to cast a ballot in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary was in jail Friday on charges that it was illegal for him to vote at all because he was on parole. Hervis Rogers became an overnight face of Texas’ battle over voting access when he emerged from a polling center at a historically Black college around 1:30 a.m. He was among Houston voters on Super Tuesday who waited more than an hour – some for several hours – in mostly minority, Democratic neighborhoods. Lines in mostly white, Republican neighborhoods were shorter. “The way it was set up, it was like it was set up for me to walk away,” Rogers told reporters. He was arrested this week on two counts of illegal voting, a second-degree felony that carries a possible sentence of two to 20 years in prison. His bail was set at $100,000. Rogers, 62, voted last March while still on parole from a felony burglary conviction, making him ineligible to cast a ballot under Texas law. Andre Segura, an attorney for the ACLU of Texas who is representing Rogers, said his client did not know he was ineligible to vote. “We shouldn’t be prosecuting people for innocent mistakes,” Segura said. The rare arrest on illegal voting allegations comes as Texas Republicans begin a second attempt at passing many of the same restrictive voting measures blocked by Democrats during a dramatic late-night walkout in May.\n\nUtah\n\nMilford: Just outside this town of about 1,400 people in southwest Utah, researchers behind a major energy project are hoping to tap into a limitless supply of clean, reliable power. The energy exists thousands of feet below the surface, where the natural heat from the Earth’s core can be used to create electricity. Researchers at the Utah-based FORGE lab are working on technology to create geothermal reservoirs almost anywhere in the world, KUER reports. Geothermal power already exists but currently makes up just 0.4% of energy production in the U.S. So far it’s largely been limited to select areas around naturally occurring hot springs, such as the Roosevelt Hot Springs in Beaver County. FORGE lab researchers have recently completed one of two major wells they’ll use to develop the tools to build “enhanced geothermal systems” – human-made versions of natural geothermal reservoirs that pump water through cracks underground, heat it, and use the steam to power turbines or to heat buildings. If successful, the project and others like it could lead to “a 40-fold increase over present geothermal power generating capacity,” according to the U.S. Department of Energy. “The world is looking at Milford,” said Joseph Moore, a geologist and lead researcher at FORGE.\n\nVermont\n\nWinooski: The state is undergoing a pandemic-related liquor shortage, regulators say, leading to empty shelves in some stores and warehouses, WCAX-TV reports. “It is a global issue. A lot of it has been exacerbated by the pandemic. It’s not going to be a quick fix,” said Wendy Knight, deputy commissioner of the Vermont Department of Liquor and Lottery. It’s a global supply chain issue “from production gearing back up from the pandemic, worker shortages, shipping issues, and a glass shortage. That comes on top of demand from restaurants and bars reopening,” she said. The Burlington bar The Archives planned to open a second location in Winooski last year, but the pandemic kept it closed until Thursday. Now the arcade bar is facing another obstacle. “The liquor shortage has been a challenge,” the bar’s co-owner Matthew Walters said. Bars and restaurants are not the only ones feeling the tight supply. “There’s enough to at least have your second choice, if not your first,” George Bergin of the Beverage Warehouse in Winooski told the news station. “With all the bars and restaurants opening up everywhere, everyone is trying to restock their shelves, and it’s just taking a little bit of time to get caught up with the sudden demand.” Vermont saw a 13% increase in liquor sales amid the pandemic, Knight said.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: Cheers erupted Saturday as a Confederate statue that towered for nearly a century over downtown was carted away by truck from the city where it had become a flashpoint for racist protests and deadly violence. It was a day of palpable joy and immense relief for scores of residents and visitors who lined neighboring streets to watch the larger-than-life figure of Gen. Robert E. Lee as it was hoisted from its pedestal and taken – at least for now – to storage. The statue’s removal came more than five years after racial justice activists had renewed a push to take down the monument, an initiative that drew the attention of white supremacists and other racist groups, culminating in the violent “Unite the Right” rally in 2017. “I’m ecstatic that we’re here now. It’s sad that it’s taken so much to get us to this point. But this is an incredible day,” said Don Gathers, a local Black activist who long advocated for the statue’s removal. Work to remove Lee’s statue, as well as one of Confederate Gen. Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson shortly after, proceeded peacefully and without interruption. Also removed Saturday was a statue depicting Sacagawea and explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark that has been criticized for a depiction of the Native American guide and interpreter that some view as subservient and weak.\n\nWashington\n\nTacoma: A federal jury has convicted a timber thief who authorities said started a large forest fire in a case that prosecutors said marked the first time tree DNA had been introduced in a federal trial. The jury deliberated for about seven hours before convicting Justin Andrew Wilke, 39, on Thursday of conspiracy, theft of public property, depredation of public property, and trafficking and attempted trafficking in unlawfully harvested timber, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for Western Washington said in a news release. The wood he sold to a mill in the city of Tumwater had been harvested from private property with a valid permit, Wilke said. But a research geneticist for the U.S. Forest Service, Richard Cronn, testified that the wood he sold genetically matched the remains of three poached trees. Wilke used gasoline to destroy a wasp’s nest in the base of a maple tree he was stealing, prosecutors said, though jurors did not convict him of charges related to the fire. Some witnesses testified that, although Wilke was standing next to the nest when the fire began, they did not actually see his actions in the dark. Wilke and others conducted an illegal logging operation in the Elk Lake area of the Olympic National Forest, near Hood Canal, between April and August 2018, according to records filed in the case.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice called on Saturday for the resignation of a state lawmaker who posted a sexually explicit TikTok video to his public account. State Del. Joe Jeffries was stripped of a committee assignment Friday after word spread of the social media posting, according to a statement from House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, who called his fellow Republican an “embarrassment.” On Saturday, the GOP governor issued a statement calling Jeffries’ behavior “sad” and “childish.” “Not only did he yell graphic comments about me to a group of senators during the recent Legislative Session, but now we find that his not-so-secret TikTok is full of disgustingly vulgar videos, which are especially insulting to women,” Justice’s statement said. “This is the behavior of an immature child, not a 39-year-old father and elected official.” The governor said he had expected to hear an apology from Jeffries by Saturday morning, “but all he has done is hide from the media and the criticism.” Jeffries, whose district includes a group of counties near Charleston, posted the video Thursday. His account was set to private Friday. Belinda Biafore, chair of the West Virginia Democratic Party, said Jeffries “has a slew of inappropriate and vulgar videos with his own sexually explicit commentary on a social media app aimed at youth.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A bishop has taken the unusual step of removing a priest from the ministry after he made a series of divisive remarks about politics and the pandemic. The Diocese of La Crosse said in a statement Friday that Bishop William Patrick Callahan has issued a decree immediately removing the Rev. James Altman as pastor of St. James the Less, a parish in the city of La Crosse. The decree will remain in effect for an undetermined length of time, the statement said. “(The bishop) and his diocesan representatives have spent over a year, prayerfully and fraternally, working toward a resolution related to ongoing public and ecclesial concerns of the ministry of Fr. James Altman,” the statement said. “The obligation of a Bishop is to ensure that all who serve the faithful are able to do so while unifying and building the Body of Christ.” Diocese officials didn’t release the decree and didn’t immediately respond to a request for a copy. Altman told conservative news outlet LifeSiteNews.com that he’s not surprised the Catholic hierarchy is trying to silence him. “Unfortunately for the corrupt hierarchy, I will not be silenced by any arbitrary Decree, nor will I be cowed by any action against my priestly faculties,” he said.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: A rancher who was pinned by an all-terrain vehicle survived on beer and bottled water for two days. Frank Reynolds, 53, was trying to round up a cow and calf on a neighbor’s pasture outside Gillette when the vehicle tipped over on him July 4, Reynolds told the Gillette News Record. “It was scary as hell is what it was,” Reynolds said Wednesday from a hospital room. Family thought Reynolds had gone camping or was with friends, said Quentin Reynolds, the Campbell County undersheriff and Frank’s brother. Later Monday, they began to worry. Eventually, they learned Frank Reynolds had planned to do some work on the property, where he was laying with a dislocated shoulder and broken ribs. A search began. Reynolds, meanwhile, honked the ATV’s horn so much he wore down the battery – to no avail. He was able to ration a couple of bottles of water and Keystone Light beers from a cooler, Sheriff Scott Matheny said. Searching on horseback, neighbor Don Hamm found Reynolds about 8 a.m. Tuesday. By that point, Reynolds recalled he was “pretty much out of it.” “Everything on the left side pretty much hurt, from the top of my head to my toes,” he said. He was expected to remain in the hospital a few more days and eventually recover.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/02/28/pachyderm-vacation-rental-cookie-monster-overdoses-stolen-baby-jesus-statue-found-news-around-states/111376276/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery:Two legislative committees approved a bill Wednesday that would ban gender therapies for minors such as prescription hormones or gender reassignment surgery. Rep. Wes Allen of Troy and Sen. Shay Shelnutt of Trussville are the sponsors of the Vulnerable Child Compassion and Protection Act. Allen said last week that children who struggle with their gender identity should receive mental health counseling and not medications or surgeries that cause physical changes. The Alabama House Health Committee approved Allen’s bill Wednesday morning, news outlets reported. Later, the Senate Health Committee approved Shelnutt’s bill in a 10-1 vote. Both bills will move on to the full House and Senate for consideration, respectively. Under the legislation, doctors would be charged with a felony for prescribing puberty-blockers or hormones to anyone under age 19. Surgeries on minors would also be prohibited. The bill also states teachers, principals and school counselors would be charged with a misdemeanor if they don’t tell parents their child identifies as transgender. This is the second bill in Alabama targeting transgender issues. Rep. Chris Pringle, R-Mobile, is sponsoring a bill that would prohibit public schools from allowing transgender students to participate on sports team that do not match the gender on their birth certificates.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The state approved a regulation change establishing a personal-use salmon dipnet fishery on a portion of the Susitna River. The Alaska Board of Fisheries voted last week to create the fishery that will be available from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Wednesdays and Saturdays between July 10 and July 31, The Anchorage Daily News reported. The Susitna system empties into Cook Inlet and is home to all five species of Pacific salmon. Dipnetters will be able to harvest up to 25 salmon in the new fishery in Southcentral Alaska, though chinook salmon will be off limits. Several groups backed the new fishery, including the Matanuska Valley Fish and Game Advisory Committee and the South Central Alaska Dipnetters Association, which both submitted proposals to the board. Personal-use fisheries are only open to Alaska residents and allow permit holders to harvest up to 25 salmon per head of household each year, with an additional 10 salmon for each additional family member. Personal-use salmon fisheries exist in Cook Inlet on the Kenai River, Kasilof River on the Kenai Peninsula and Fish Creek. There is also a personal-use fishery at the Copper River, which empties into Prince William Sound southeast of Anchorage. The proposal submitted by the Matanuska Valley committee said the new fishery would give area residents an opportunity to harvest salmon closer to home.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:Early risers in several Western states reported seeing what appeared to be a meteor streaking across the sky before dawn. The American Meteor Society received multiple reports from Arizona, California, New Mexico and Utah about the fireball. “This does appear to be a bright meteor as observations are spread out from Southern California, southern Utah, and Arizona,” observer Robert Lunsford with the American Meteor Society told KNXV-TV. The phenomenon was captured on video by meteorite hunter Robert Ward in Prescott, Arizona, and posted on the organization’s website. It was also captured by a video camera mounted on Phoenix City Hall. “This is the best time of the month to view meteor activity as the moon will not be a factor at all,” the American Meteor Society said in their Meteor Activity Outlook for the week, noting the moon’s current phase.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: State regulators have dismissed one violation and sustained two others against a medical marijuana dispensary in Hot Springs. The Arkansas Alcoholic Beverage Control Board voted Wednesday to sustain two violations against Green Springs Medical dispensary. The Hot Springs dispensary is the state’s most successful since opening May 1, selling more than 1400 pounds of medical marijuana as of Feb. 14, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported. The next closest dispensary, the Releaf Center in Bentonville, sold just more than 670 pounds in the same time period. Green Springs Medical had been charged with a series of rule violations, including inadequate labeling and improper signs. The board also decided Wednesday to reduce the facility’s fine from $7,025 to $1,000, noting that the dispensary’s owner has been cooperative with investigators and put in an effort to comply with regulations.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco:A winter with little precipitation has left most of California abnormally dry and officials are bracing for the possibility of an early and more intense wildfire season amid record-breaking temperatures. Drought has expanded to nearly a quarter of the state, mainly in central California, the heart of the state’s agricultural sector, according to a U.S. Drought Monitor map mad public Thursday. The map shows 70% of the state is abnormally dry. February is shaping up to be driest on record for much of the state, with chances of light showers on the horizon on March 1 and then not again until March 10. Sierra Littlefield, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Sacramento, said there is a strong chance the state’s capital will see a completely dry February – something that has never happened. Downtown San Francisco is on its way to its first rain-free February since 1864, said meteorologist Anna Schneider. The dry beginning of the year comes after a wet 2019 that capped mountains with snow, delivering water to reservoirs and helping to boost lush vegetation that can quickly turn into fuel for wildfires during dry, windy conditions. About 75% of California’s annual precipitation typically occurs from December through February, mostly from atmospheric rivers – long plumes of moisture originating far out in the Pacific Ocean. State officials were scheduled Thursday to conduct a survey of the Sierra Nevada snowpack, which supplies about 30% of California’s water. The first reading of the winter there, on Jan. 2, found a snowpack that was 97% of the January average. But that had changed by the end of a largely dry January when the amount of water in the snowpack dropped to 72% of the Jan. 30 average, state water officials said.\n\nColorado\n\nVail: An avalanche took the lives of two people who had turned back to avoid a dangerous area, a report said. The Feb. 15 avalanche north of Vail killed Dillon Block and Cesar Almanza Hernandez, The Vail Daily reported Tuesday. Block, Hernandez and a companion who was not identified were riding in the back country on low-angle slopes and in meadows and were avoiding steeper slopes, the Colorado Avalanche Information Center report said. They were operating snowbikes, which are off-road motorcycles modified for use in the snow. After riding into a creek bottom in the afternoon, the riders entered an open area and turned around to head back. An avalanche started and the third rider was able to ride into nearby trees, but Hernandez and Block were buried in the slide, the report said. Volunteers worked to free Block and Hernandez until responders with Vail Mountain Rescue Group arrived at the scene around 9 p.m. “Given the time elapsed, darkness, increasing snowfall, and no easy way to evaluate the avalanche danger above the site, the group left and returned to the Red Sandstone trailhead,” the report said. A Vail Mountain Rescue Group team returned the next morning to recover the bodies.\n\nConnecticut\n\nStamford: A man who got into a fight while leaving his son’s hockey game last month has asked for leniency. Matthey Zolin, 51, made a brief appearance before a judge at a Stamford courthouse where his attorney applied to a diversionary program for first-time offenders that will result in his charges being expunged, the Greenwich Time reported Wednesday. The Greenwich resident was arrested on Jan. 31, along with another father, after the two began fighting while exiting a game where their sons played against each other. Both men were charged with misdemeanor third-degree assault and interfering with police. Officials said the altercation became physical after one of the two said something denigrating about the abilities of the other’s son. Prosecutors have made no objection to Zolin’s application to enter the diversionary program. If he is granted acceptance and successfully completes the program, the charges against him will be expunged and his criminal record will remain clean.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover:Two more wells near a military base have elevated levels of chemical contaminants, according to state environmental officials. Delaware’s environmental protection department was recently notified by officials at Dover Air Force Base that the wells near the base might have levels of perfluorooctane sulfonate, or PFOS, and perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA, above federal advisory levels of 70 parts per trillion. The notifications come after high levels of PFOS and PFOA were found in four other wells near the base last summer. One of those wells had a PFOS level of 168,000 parts per trillion and a PFOA level of 2,460 parts per trillion, according to a document provided to The Associated Press. The Air Force is continuing to provide alternative water supply to those properties. The owners of the more recently tested wells, which provide water to a single commercial business, also are being provided bottled water. Officials said Tuesday that samples taken at 10 other wells indicated PFOS and PFOA levels below the EPA’s health advisory level. PFOA and PFOS are among a class of man-made compounds known as perfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS. The compounds have been used in a variety of consumer and industrial products, including nonstick cookware, stain- and water-resistant fabrics, food packaging and, notably, firefighting foam that has been used at military bases across the country.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:A landlord facing ongoing lawsuits with the district’s attorney general has been arrested for failing to pay for repairs, according to court documents. The documents said Mehrdad Valibeigi with the Bennington Corporation has been charged with contempt of court and is being held in the D.C. jail after Valibeigi failed to make a payment required by the judge’s order. A spokesperson for Attorney General Karl Racine said his office first filed a complaint against Valibeigi in October 2018 for allegedly collecting rent, but failing to maintain his apartment buildings and make necessary repairs. The AG requested a Receiver for the 35 units that comprise the Bennington Apartments, located at 4480 C Street, 4459 Benning Road SE and 4569 Benning Road SE in Ward 7. Court documents showed Racine also asked for restitution for those tenants, as well as penalties for the owner. Tenants quoted in the initial complaint said nails were coming out of their ceilings, roaches had consistently been a problem for decades and mice found their way into apartments through multiple holes in the walls and sinks. Documents state Valibeigi was supposed to deposit $25,000 into an account for the Receiver to fund repairs by November. He paid $5,000, but still has not paid the rest, according to the documents. The judge said in the most recent January hearing that if Valibeigi did not fulfill the court’s order to pay the remaining $20,000 by Feb. 24, he would be arrested. Racine’s office said Valibeigi failed to comply and was taken into custody on Monday, where documents stated he will be held until he has paid the outstanding amount. Court documents showed that a status hearing is scheduled for Feb. 28.\n\nFlorida\n\nKey West: The government of the United Arab Emirates has granted a $3.5 million gift to help kick off a major coral reef restoration program in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. The grant, announced Wednesday by officials of United Way of Collier and the Keys, is the first funding commitment of the $100 million Mission: Iconic Reefs program announced last December by The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and its Keys sanctuary. The program, to be funded by public and private resources, calls for restoring seven iconic coral reef sites off the Keys consisting of nearly 3 million square feet of the Florida Reef Tract, about the size of 52 football fields. The effort is likely to take two decades and is to be accomplished in two phases, Sanctuary officials said. Since the 1970s, tropical cyclones, heat-induced coral bleaching, cold snaps and disease events have reduced coral coverage in the Keys. Over the past 15 years, pioneering restoration efforts involving growing and transplanting corals have proved successful in the Keys, setting the stage for the large-scale restoration effort. Running from Key Largo to Key West, the Sanctuary includes Carysfort Reef, Horseshoe Reef, Cheeca Rocks, Sombrero Reef, Newfound Harbor, Looe Key Reef and Eastern Dry Rocks. The $3.5 million coral restoration gift is part of a $10 million pledge from the UAE to communities in Florida for recovery activities following Hurricane Irma. The United Way helped to secure the UAE financial gift for the Keys coral reef project.\n\nGeorgia\n\nJuliette: Officials in a Monroe County said they will pay to test water wells for coal ash contamination. County Manager Jim Hedges told WGXA-TV that the county will pay $10,000 to test about 55 private wells across the county. The tests come after environmental group Altamaha Riverkeeper tested wells of residents around Juliette and found chemicals they said indicate contamination from the coal ash pond at Georgia Power Co.’s Plant Scherer. Georgia Power, a unit of Atlanta-based Southern Co., said its own testing of wells around the coal-fired power plant showed no contamination above federal or state limits. The company plans to extract water from the coal ash, cap the pond in place and monitor it for future contamination. Juliette residents came to the state Capitol Monday to lobby for a bill that would require Georgia Power to dig up the coal ash and bury it in a lined landfill. Hedges said the results should come back within 7 to 10 days. Residents are also lobbying to be connected to a water system, but county officials said that could cost $20 million and take two years to complete. Beyond the county testing, Duke University Professor Avner Vengosh, who studies coal ash contamination, is scheduled to visit Monroe County to study 10 to 12 private wells within 2 miles of Plant Scherer. The county will pay travel costs for Vengosh and a student.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The U.S. military authorized the transport of World War II aircraft on government ships and planes for use in the 75th anniversary commemoration of the end of the war, officials said. Up to 24 privately owned aircraft will be transported to Oahu for the events between Aug. 29 and Sept. 2, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported Tuesday. The transport of the vintage planes will be conducted by Air Force cargo planes or ships including an aircraft carrier or other flattop vessel, officials said. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said in a Jan. 27 memo that he wants a coordinated effort for a “lift of opportunity” to bring the planes to the commemoration. “As we approach the 75th anniversary of V-J Day (Victory over Japan) on Sept. 2, 2020, I am encouraging all services to seek opportunities to honor this important milestone,” Esper said. Elissa Lines, executive director of the Pearl Harbor Aviation Museum, said 19 aircraft owners have applied to participate. The aircraft include a B-25 Mitchell bomber, A-26 Invader, SBD Dauntless dive bomber, P-40 Warhawk, TBF Avenger torpedo bomber, P-51 Mustang, F4F Wildcat, C-47 transport, PBY Catalina, F-8 Bearcat, and T-6 Texan, she said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Roughly a month after one of Idaho’s newest Fish and Game commissioners had to step down because of his political affiliation, a panel of lawmakers has approved a bill to remove the commission’s bipartisan membership requirements. The commissioners set hunting and fishing regulations, seasons and other wildlife policy. They’re appointed by the governor, and Republicans have held a majority on the commission for years. The remaining spots sometimes go to commissioners who are unaffiliated, rather than Democrats. The bill, which would end the current rule that no more than four members of the seven-member commission be from the same political party, was approved by the House Resources and Conservation Committee on Tuesday, The Times-News reported. Idaho Wildlife Federation executive director Brian Brooks opposed the bill, noting the commission was created by the state’s first voter initiative in 1938, which specifically called for a bipartisan approach to prevent undue political influence on resource issues. He said politicization is one of the biggest concerns for Idaho hunters. It passed 14-4, and now heads to the full House. Former commissioner Bradley Melton was appointed in September but stepped down in January after it was revealed that he had changed his political affiliation from Republican to unaffiliated shortly before he applied for the post. At the time, Gov. Brad Little thanked Melton for his candor and service, and said the next appointment would be made “in accordance with the spirit of the law.” Rep. Paul Shepherd, a Republican from Riggins – the same region that Melton represented on the commission – said Tuesday that the best candidates for the job shouldn’t be disqualified because of their party affiliation. Rep. Fred Wood, who previously served on the commission, said appointments are made based on experience with and views on the environment, and party affiliation doesn’t factor in.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A program that honors women veterans and their service wants to send those in Illinois to Washington, where they will tour war monuments for a day and be celebrated for their service upon their return home. Operation HerStory is seeking 100 women that served during World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and periods in between 1940 to 1975 to participate in the Honor Flight. The program has partnered with organizations, including Honor Flight Chicago, which is a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing veterans with honor and closure. It will be the first all female Honor Flight in the state, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. The trip was announced at the Pritzker Military Museum and Library on Tuesday. John Ptak, president of Honor Flight Chicago, said that although the nonprofit has brought more than 8,700 veterans to Washington, fewer than 200 of the participants have been women. Almost 40 have signed up already, said Ginny Narsete, the founder of Operation HerStory and a retired master sergeant in the Air Force. The flight departs the morning of Oct. 7, returning later that day. The women will tour the Women In Military Service for America Memorial and the Vietnam Women’s Memorial. Narsete said she doesn’t know what’s next for the program after the trip, but she hopes it will help the veterans to accept the honor and recognition they deserve.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis:The City-County Council forged ahead with its new tenant rights initiative on Monday night despite recent legislative effort at the Statehouse to undercut the effort, which seeks to protect residents from retaliatory landlords and educate tenants about rental rights. The first part of the proposal, which passed with an 18-5 vote, appropriates $250,000 to establish a tenant information hotline and provide legal assistance for renters in need. The council’s five Republicans voted against it. The second proposal strengthened protections for renters, requiring landlords to notify tenants of their rights and responsibilities and fining landlords who retaliate against tenants. That proposal passed 19-4, with Republican Michael Paul-Hart crossing party lines to vote in support. But the initiative might be partially moot if the state legislature approves new language added to a bill earlier on Monday, drawing scorn from Mayor Joe Hogsett’s office and Democratic councilors. The amendment to Senate Bill 340 prevents cities from regulating landlord-tenant relations without approval by the General Assembly. It would nullify the requirement to notify tenants of their rights and would also eliminate the fines for retaliation. The move came after concern from the Indiana Apartment Association and other groups, once again highlighting the contrast between a heavily Democratic state capital in a largely Republican state. Yet the public voiced strong support for the council’s efforts on Monday night to combat an issue they highlighted as a crisis.\n\nIowa\n\nSioux City:A mother has complained to the local school board after she said her sixth-grade daughter suffered a broken arm and elbow at the hands of two classmates carrying out a viral online prank. The woman said Monday night during a school board meeting that her daughter had been injured on Feb. 7, when two West Middle School classmates cajoled her into a jumping contest, then kicked the girl’s feet out from under her midjump, causing her to fall on her shoulder, the Sioux City Journal reported. Called the “skull breaker challenge,” the prank was made popular on the social media platform TikTok and has led to reports of children across the country suffering serious head and other injuries. The woman complained that a physical education teacher who was in charge was distracted by his cellphone when the incident happened and that school officials didn’t report the incident to the girl’s parents or seek immediate medical care. “She has no motion in her fingers, no motion in her wrist,” the mother said. “She may never play volleyball again.” School board members did not respond to the complaint during the meeting. Sioux City Community Schools Superintendent Paul Gausman did not immediately return a message left Wednesday seeking comment.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: A mother is suing a suburban Kansas City school after a teacher was caught on surveillance video last year kicking her daughter, who was in kindergarten. The woman filed the lawsuit last month against the Shawnee Mission School District and the case was moved to federal court this week, the Kansas City Star reported. She contended that the district was negligent in its hiring, training and supervision of the first-year teacher, Crystal Smith, who was fired after the abuse came to light. The mother, who is identified only by her initials in the lawsuit, said her daughter got upset last February because she found some of her artwork crumpled on the floor at the Bluejacket-Flint Elementary School in Shawnee, and that her daughter approached the school librarian to show her the damage. When her daughter crawled into a bookshelf, Smith “yanked her out” and pinned her arms behind her back, causing her pain. Smith then asked the librarian to contact the principal for help, and when the librarian’s back was turned, Smith kicked the girl while she was lying on the floor, according to the suit. The mother said she learned about what happened when she picked up her daughter after school, and that she then confronted the teacher, who told her the girl wasn’t being truthful. She said she then spoke with the principal and requested that school surveillance video be reviewed. She says she received a letter from the principal nearly a week after the incident that said the teacher had admitted grabbing and kicking the girl. The girl’s mother says that if her daughter hadn’t told her what happened, it might never have come to light and her daughter could have suffered “more abuse at the hands” of the teacher. Her lawsuit seeks an unspecified amount in damages. A district spokesman said the school system doesn’t comment on pending litigation.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The Kentucky House voted Wednesday to create a tax on vaping products and increase taxes on snuff and chewing tobacco. The bill passed the House on a 75-17 vote and now goes to the Senate, media outlets reported. It’s estimated to raise $50 million of new tax revenue over the next two fiscal years. It aims to reduce vaping and smokeless tobacco use in a state with one of the nation’s highest cancer rates. The bill would add vaping products to the list of smokable tobacco products such as cigars that are subject to a wholesale tax, with that rate increasing under the measure. The legislation also doubles the per-unit tax on nonsmokable and chewable tobacco products, but does not affect the tax rate on packs of cigarettes. An organization representing 400 vape shop owners recently told legislators the bill would hurt their small businesses and discourage adults from vaping as a way to quit smoking cigarettes. The bill’s supporters, including organizations like the Foundation for a Healthy Kentucky, said the price increase on e-cigarettes will help curb the increased use of highly addictive vaping products by youth in the state.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge:Ronnie Anderson, the longest serving Farm Bureau state president in America, will retire this summer after 31 years of leading the largest agriculture network in Louisiana. Anderson won an astounding 31 straight elections before deciding he won’t seek reelection during the annual Louisiana Farm Bureau Convention in June. “It’s the right time for me,” Anderson said. The Louisiana Farm Bureau has been a powerful political force under Anderson, which elevated its influence in agriculture advocacy. Anderson has also served on the LSU Board of Supervisors in all but two years since former Gov. Mike Foster appointed him in 1997, hiring presidents and football coaches. He has engaged with governors, members of Congress and American presidents in his role as state president and as a member of the American Farm Bureau board in shaping agriculture policy. Anderson’s former first assistant, Jim Monroe, said Anderson has been able to maintain the confidence and support of Farm Bureau members for so long because of his ability to connect with them in a way the members trust. Monroe retired last year after serving 30 years as assistant to the president, the highest-ranking full-time staff position within the Farm Bureau Federation. The president serves as a full-time volunteer. Monroe was succeeded by Kyle McCann. The Louisiana Farm Bureau has grown from about 67,000 members in 1989 to more than 148,000 under Anderson’s watch. Anderson, 71, grew up on a dairy farm in East Feliciana Parish and returned to join the family business after graduating from LSU.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The rate of newborns in Maine who experience health problems because they’re exposed to opioids in the womb is nearly five times the national average, according to a report released by the state health department. Maine’s incidence of the health problems was a little more than 33 per 1,000 live births in 2018, according to the report, provided to the Maine Legislature by the Maine Department of Health and Human Services. The national rate was seven per 1,000 live births. The finding was one of many in the annual report from the Maine Maternal, Fetal and Infant Mortality Review Panel that spoke to health challenges for mothers and babies in the state. According to the report, the percentage of women who smoked during pregnancy in Maine was nearly 12%, almost twice the national average of 6.5%. Slightly more children were also born to women with diabetes, and the percent of births to women who were overweight or obese was also about 5 percentage points higher than the national average, the report stated. The high rate of babies exposed to opioids before birth is a function of the state’s crisis, Stephen Meister, president of the Maine chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said Wednesday. The rates of smoking and obesity reflect longstanding challenges in Maine, he said.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City:A statue of an infant Jesus stolen from St. Paul’s by-the-Sea Episcopal Church is again in the church’s possession after it was missing for nearly a year. “We were very grateful,” said Father Matthew D’Amario, who noted the statue was returned in mid-January “surprisingly undamaged.” D’Amario said the statue, part of the church’s Nativity scene, had been stolen once before ahead of his tenure at the church. That time, it was inexplicably recovered from the ocean near the Inlet. In the latest incident, church staff reported the statue missing on Jan. 4, 2019. Video footage showed it was stolen on Dec. 31, 2018, according to police. Police later identified 43-year-old Cameron Coke of Towson, Maryland, as a suspect. Coke’s trial, on fourth-degree burglary and theft, was set for Jan. 8 but was postponed. Patrol officers stopped Coke as he was driving to the Inlet parking lot because of erratic driving, according to police. During a search of his vehicle, the statue was found. Officers determined Coke was under the influence of a narcotic, found cocaine in his possession and arrested him on charges including drugs and possession of paraphernalia. Coke told officers that he was involved in the theft and that he intended to return the statue to either St. Paul’s or Ocean City police, according to OCPD. Coke is scheduled to appear in Ocean City District Court on April 17, where he will be tried for burglary and theft..\n\nMassachusetts\n\nPlymouth: A 17-year-old boy is responsible for recently spraying red paint all over Plymouth Rock and several other sites in the historic Massachusetts community, police said Thursday. The teen faces 11 felony counts of vandalism and one misdemeanor count of trespassing, Plymouth Police Chief Michael Botieri said in a statement. The suspect’s name was not released because he is a juvenile, but the chief did say he is a resident of the town, which this year is marking the 400th anniversary of the Pilgrims’ arrival. The rock symbolizes the spot where the Mayflower Pilgrims disembarked in December 1620. The suspect was identified by detectives who reviewed hours of surveillance video from the area, the chief said. In addition to Plymouth Rock, the National Monument to the Forefathers and the Plymouth Maiden statue were found defaced on Feb. 17. Most of the places were defaced with the number and letter combination 508 MOF. Botieri told The Patriot Ledger the boy offered no explanation for what was written. The vandalism has since been cleaned up. The Feb. 17 vandalism is not connected to vandalism to the town’s 9/11 Memorial discovered last Sunday, the chief said.\n\nMichigan\n\nCorunna:The former home of a man accused of murder and cannibalism sold at auction for more than $20,000 over the asking price. The home of Mark D. Latunski, located at 703 Tyrrell Road in Bennington Township, had four bidders come forward Feb. 26 in Shiawassee County Circuit Courthouse in Corunna to place offers on the house. Shiawassee County Sheriff’s Sergeant Douglas Chapman told MLive the highest bid came in at $101,733.28 – $21,001 over the minimum asking price. Property records showed the home has a market value of about $93,000 and was originally purchased in May 2001 for $80,000, according to MLive. The name of the highest bidder was not revealed because the deed is not yet registered, MLive reported. Latunski is facing murder charges for the alleged killing and cannibalizing of 25-year-old Kevin Bacon in Latunski’s basement around Christmas Eve. Bacon’s naked body was found hanging from the ceiling by his ankles on Dec. 28. acon’s reported roommate, Michelle Myers, told police he connected with Latunski on Grindr, a dating app for gay, bi, trans and queer people, and met up with him Dec. 24. He was officially reported missing Dec. 25 by his family after he did not show up to Christmas breakfast at his parents’ home. Latunski reportedly admitted to police he stabbed Bacon twice in the back of the neck before stringing him up and slicing his throat. He confessed he then castrated Bacon and took his testicles and cooked and ate them. Michigan’s Center for Forensic Psychiatry deemed Latunski incompetent for trial Feb. 24. He was found incompetent for trial Thursday by a judge. He was referred to the State of Michigan’s Forensic Center for treatment in the Saline.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSauk Rapids:The Sauk Rapids-Rice school board has decided to enter into negotiations with Thief River Falls public schools Superintendent Brad Bergstrom to become their superintendent in July. The board made the decision Wednesday night after the second of two daylong interviews with two finalists. Robbinsdale Area Schools Director of Community Education Kristine Wehrkamp toured the district Monday, and Bergstrom followed the same schedule on Wednesday. Following the interviews, the board unanimously decided to select Bergrstrom, citing his experience and collaborative approach to leadership. Both finalists answered similar questions, first at a public interview at the Sauk Rapids Government Center and then, after a break for dinner, at a special meeting of the school board. Board members had received feedback from students and staff members who had met with the finalists as they toured the district. Bergstrom is in his fourth year as superintendent at Thief River Falls. He was a director of human resources, a high school principal and an area learning center director in the Austin school district. Earlier in his career, he was a teacher and a dean of students in Fergus Falls and Birchdale. He also coached hockey. Bergstrom will start contract negotiations with the district, and, if approved, will start July 1. He will replace Aaron Sinclair, who announced his resignation in December.\n\nMississippi\n\nOxford:The University of Mississippi has apologized to dozens of African Americans who were arrested in 1970 for protesting racial inequality on the mostly white campus where Confederate images were a deeply ingrained part of campus culture. “I am sorry it took us 50 years to do this,” Provost Noel Wilkin said Tuesday during a conference called “Black Power at Ole Miss: Remembrance, Reckoning, and Repair at Fifty Years.” The university also awarded a diploma to one of the people who was arrested. Linnie Liggins – now married and known as Linnie Liggins Willis – had completed her coursework before her arrest but the university at the time refused to give her the diploma she had earned. She has worked as executive director at Lucas Metropolitan Housing Authority in Toledo, Ohio. On Feb. 24, 1970, 40 members of the Black Student Union presented a list of demands to the university’s chancellor, Porter L. Fortune Jr., The Daily Mississippian reported. They wanted the university to hire more black faculty members, begin a black studies program and eliminate Confederate imagery at a time when many white students still waved rebel flags at football games. Also in February 1970, a group of black students burned a Confederate flag and danced on tables in the cafeteria to the music of B.B. King. The next day, almost half of the black students at the university participated in a protest during a campus concert of Up With People, a international traveling group that sang upbeat songs, including at least one tune about racial inclusion. A photo published in the student newspaper at the time showed that some of the protesters stood on stage with their fists in the air – a symbol of the black power movement. During and after the concert, 89 people were arrested and sent to a local jail or to the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman. They were released the next day. Eight of the students were suspended from the university: Donald Ray Cole, John Donald, Theron Evans Jr., Paul D. Jackson, Linnie Liggins, Kenneth Mayfield, lva Ruth Peyton and Henriese Roberts. The arrests happened less than eight years after Ole Miss enrolled its first black student under a federal court order and with protection of U.S. marshals. Five of the eight suspended students returned to campus for the conference Tuesday.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Republican lawmakers on Wednesday took steps to resurrect a Missouri voter photo identification law that was gutted by the state Supreme Court. The court last month permanently blocked a central provision of the 2016 law that required voters who lacked a photo ID to make a sworn statement in order to cast a regular, nonprovisional ballot. In response, Republicans are trying to pass a new voter ID bill that is similar to the 2016 law but doesn’t include the sworn statement provision that the judges found objectionable. House members on Wednesday gave initial approval to the measure, which would give voters only two options, instead of three: either show a photo ID to cast a regular ballot or else cast a provisional ballot. Provisional ballots would be counted if voters return to their polling places on the same day with a valid photo ID or if their signatures match the ones on file with election authorities. To cast provisional ballots, voters would need to sign sworn affidavits that include their birth dates, addresses and the last four digits of their Social Security numbers, and that swear the information is correct. Missouri is one of several states where Republican-led legislatures have passed voter photo ID laws touted as a means of preventing in-person voter fraud, which studies have shown is rare. Democrats generally oppose such laws, arguing that they are really meant to disenfranchise voter groups that tend to support their party, including the poor, elderly and disabled as well as transient college students and minorities who are less likely to have photo IDs.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings:The Trump administration said Wednesday a resumption of coal sales from public lands that had been blocked under former President Barack Obama will result in a negligible increase in greenhouse gas emissions. Critics accused the administration of producing a flawed analysis of the federal coal program that ignores its broader impacts. A federal judge last year had faulted the administration for failing to consider potential damage to the environment when former U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke in 2017 lifted a moratorium on coal sales imposed by his predecessor. U.S. District Judge Brian Morris in Montana stopped short in his April 2019 ruling from halting coal sales but said the Department of Interior had to conduct an environmental review of its decision. The Trump administration review focused on potential emissions from only four coal leases in Utah and Oklahoma that were sold after the moratorium was lifted. That’s a small piece of a federal leasing program that accounts for about about 40% of U.S. coal production, primarily from Western states that also include Wyoming, Montana and Colorado. Burning that fuel accounts for about 11% of annual U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, according to previous studies. Interest in federal leases has slackened considerably over the past decade as many utilities switched to natural gas or renewables and demand for coal plummeted. In documents released Wednesday, administration officials acknowledged Zinke’s order had hastened the resumption of federal coal sales before a three-year review begun under Obama was complete. But they argued those sales would have resumed regardless. Companies have mined about 4 billion tons of coal from federal reserves in the past decade, contributing $10 billion to federal and state coffers through royalties and other payments.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The condition of two of the people who tested positive for COVID-19 in Omaha after being evacuated from a cruise ship in Japan has improved significantly, officials said Wednesday. Two of the 15 people being monitored at the University of Nebraska Medical Center were being cared for at the Nebraska Biocontainment Unit because of the severity of their symptoms. Health officials said Wednesday, those two people improved enough to be transferred to the National Quarantine Unit where the other 13 people are being treated. Two of the 15 have tested negative for the virus and could be released from quarantine March 2. The people who tested positive for COVID-19 will have to test negative for it twice before they can be released.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: There were more than 4.1 million passengers at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas last month, according to new numbers released by the airport Thursday. The airport reported that the number of arriving and departing passengers in January was a 6.6% increase over the same month in 2019. It’s the 11th moth in a row where more than 4 million people passed through the airport, and a record for January travel. Most of January’s passengers, or about 3.8 million, were flying on domestic trips. McCarran saw a 7% increase in arriving and departing passengers on domestic flights up from 2019.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu is ordering flags to be flown at half-staff on Saturday in memory of an Air Force pilot from Hudson who recently was killed in Afghanistan. Capt. Ryan Phaneuf and another airman died Jan. 27 in a plane crash. Phaneuf, who was 30, was a 2007 graduate of Alvirne High School. Sununu will present the New Hampshire Medal of Honor to Phaneuf’s parents and wife at his memorial services on Saturday.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nMargate:Lucy the Elephant, a six-story National Historic Landmark in Margate, is being offered up for overnight stays March 17-19 on the house-sharing website Airbnb. The one-night stays for two people are being offered for $138 – a price that pays homage to the number of years Lucy has been around – and booking is set to begin March 5 on a first-come basis. The pachyderm-shaped dwelling has an entrance in her back legs that takes guests to a remodeled living quarters. But, Lucy’s caretakers said she doesn’t have running water, so Airbnb is placing a heated bathroom trailer with a shower, sink and toilet for guests on the site. The promotion with Airbnb and the Save Lucy Committee is designed to encourage more visitors to the shore and to the elephant, which is one of the oldest surviving roadside attractions in America. Airbnb will make a donation to help support the committee, which has restored the wooden landmark and maintains her for the more than 130,000 visitors she receives in a year. The listing said Lucy has been a home before, as well as a tavern in a previous life.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A grandfather’s effort to euthanize the family duck drew police after residents reported multiple shots fired. Santa Fe police initially confiscated a handgun from Lorenzo Pacheco, who had fired four shots at the bird, the Santa Fe New Mexican reported. His granddaughter, Kaelyn Pacheco, said in a phone interview Wednesday that officers showed compassion toward the man after learning he had carried out the shooting in an act of mercy. Police arrived just before a burial for the bird was about to start. Kaelyn Pacheco said the duck, a family pet, had become paralyzed and couldn’t walk, and it also had an eye infection. A police report of the incident said Lorenzo Pacheco “felt bad and did not want to break the neck of the duck and thought using a firearm would be more humane.” He placed the duck in an enclosed area and fired four shots, the report said. Officers went to Lorenzo Pacheco’s home, where he showed them the pistol he had used to shoot the duck. According to the report, the officer “collected the weapon for safekeeping and placed it into safekeeping.” Lorenzo Pacheco said in an interview that police returned his gun to him Tuesday after determining there was no cause for a charge of negligent use of a firearm.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Drivers who get five camera-issued red light tickets or 15 camera-issued speeding tickets in a 12-month period will have to take a traffic safety course or risk losing their vehicles under a bill signed by Mayor Bill de Blasio on Wednesday. The law will take effect on Feb. 26, 2021 and will apply to tickets incurred after Oct. 26 of this year. The vehicles of drivers who exceed the ticket limit can be impounded unless the drivers take a safe driving course overseen by the city Department of Transportation. City officials estimated that the new law will affect about 3,000 to 6,000 vehicles, a fraction of the nearly 2 million vehicles registered in the city. The mayor and City Council will decide after three years whether to renew the law. De Blasio, a Democrat has sought to reduce traffic fatalities through measures such as lowering speed limits and adding speed cameras. But at least 20 pedestrians have been killed by motor vehicles on city streets this year, including a 10-year-old girl who was struck by a school bus on Tuesday.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A female wrestler has made history by winning a state high school wrestling championship. The North Carolina High School Athletic Association said on its website that junior Heaven Fitch of Uwharrie Charter became the first female to win one of the association’s individual state wrestling championships. She won the 106-pound weight class in the 1A division on Saturday. A photo released on the association’s official Twitter account showed her beaming, standing next to three boys who finished behind her in the tournament. She had a 54-4 record for the season and won Most Outstanding Wrestler for the 1A division. Fitch beat Robbinsville’s Luke Wilson to win an eight-person bracket that included seven male wrestlers, said James Alverson, assistant commissioner for the high school association. Overall, she was one of three female wrestlers in the tournament, he said. Last year, she became the first female wrestler to place, coming in fourth in her division.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: The risk of spring flooding in the Red River Valley has been reduced slightly because of limited precipitation in the last few weeks, although National Weather Service forecasters said Thursday there’s still a lot of moisture in the system. The latest outlook showed a 50% chance that the Red River in the Fargo and Moorhead, Minnesota, area will reach just under 35 feet, or 17 feet above flood stage. That could lead to some road and bridge closures, but most structures would not be threatened. There’s a 5% chance the river could top 39 feet, down 5% from the last report. Fargo city leaders said earlier this week they would fill 250,000 sandbags in case that happens. The weather service said precipitation totals since Sept. 1 remain at record highs in many areas along the Red River and the snowpack is at or above normal and could lead to a high runoff. However, the forecast no longer indicates a cooler and wetter late winter and early spring period. Conditions could change quickly depending on the rate of thaw and spring rains, the report said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Transgender females would be banned from competing in Ohio high school and college girls and women’s sports under a bill introduced Wednesday by House Republicans. The legislation would apply to all public schools and colleges and any private schools or colleges that are members of a state or national athletic association. The bill prohibits biological males from competing in girls or women’s sports. It comes as three high school girl runners in Connecticut are suing to block a policy that allows transgender athletes to compete in girls sports. Currently in Ohio, transgender girls can participate in sports after they have completed a minimum of one year of hormone treatment related to gender transition, under Ohio High School Athletic Association rules. Alternatively, transgender girls can compete if they demonstrate to OHSAA officials “by way of sound medical evidence” that they don’t possess physical advantages over girls of the same age. Similar bills have been introduced in Alabama, Arizona, Idaho and Mississippi. The Ohio bill sponsors are Rep. Jena Powell, of Arcanum in western Ohio, and Rep. Reggie Stoltzfus of Paris Township in northeastern Ohio.\n\nOklahoma\n\nNorman:Dozens of University of Oklahoma students staged a sit-in for a second day Thursday outside OU’s administrative offices following two instances of professors using racial slurs in the classroom. OU’s Black Emergency Response Team, known as BERT, gathered Wednesday morning in Evans Hall and called for the resignation of OU provost Kyle Harper, mandatory equity training for faculty, semester-long diversity training and a new multicultural center on campus. Some students spent the night in Evans Hall and the group said it would remain there “until these demands are met.” The sit-in comes days after interim OU President Joseph Harroz Jr. announced that a history professor read from a historical document in class that used the N-word repeatedly. Earlier this month, an OU journalism professor stepped down from teaching the course for the rest of the semester after telling students during class that the N-word is no more offensive than the term “boomer.” The university said in a statement late Wednesday that leaders had met with the students to discuss their concerns. “We identified areas of agreement that will move our university forward,” the OU statement said. “We have agreed to continue these discussions. We will also advance these conversations with other student, faculty, and staff leadership.”\n\nOregon\n\nNewport: A body found in Newport Bay has been identified as that of a fisherman who has been missing for nearly three weeks, the Newport Police Department said Thursday. Norman Grant was reported missing on Feb. 9 and hadn’t been seen since the evening of Feb. 8, Chief Jason Malloy said in a statement. Cellphone records and video from local surveillance cameras put Grant’s last known location near a fishing boat that he worked on called the F/V Prolifik. The boat was moored at Hallmark Fisheries. Grant’s body was discovered about 80 feet south of the Hallmark Fisheries dock when another boat ran into something under the water on Feb. 26. A subsequent inspection of the boat found clothing entangled in the vessel’s prop and a diver was called in. No cause of death or other details about the case have been released.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nWest Newton: A mother wearing a Cookie Monster costume apparently overdosed on heroin while sitting in her running car, shortly after she had dropped off her 9-year-old son at a babysitter’s home. Rachel Love Martin, 38, of Westmoreland County was charged Wednesday with child endangerment. It’s not known if she has retained an attorney. The babysitter called police to her home because she was concerned Martin might have been under the influence of drugs, authorities said. Police found Martin slumped over the steering wheel of her car, and emergency responders soon gave her Narcan, a drug used to revive people suffering from a drug overdose. Meanwhile, police found Martin’s son wasn’t wearing any shoes or socks when he was dropped off, just a pair of pants and a T-shirt at a time when temperatures were in the low 40s, authorities said. It’s not clear why Martin was wearing the Cookie Monster costume, authorities said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nWarwick: Firefighters are sharing nearly $500,000 in retroactive payments to end the last outstanding grievance stemming from recent contract negotiations. A panel of arbitrators ruled that the city should retroactively pay firefighters an extra 2.25% for work performed during the budget year that ended June 30, The Providence Journal reported. The decision will cost the city $478,456, according to Mayor Joseph J. Solomon. The firefighters union negotiated a new three-year agreement in January, partially retroactive, for the period from July 1, 2019, through June 30, 2022. That agreement had not resolved the firefighters’ wages for the fiscal year that ended on June 30. The union had previously sought a 4% raise for wages during that period, and later it sought 3%, according to Solomon. Solomon had hoped to settle the matter by giving the firefighters 1.5% but he said the arbitrators’ decision is “fair and reasonable.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A law banning sex education teachers from mentioning any relationships other than heterosexual – unless the talk involves sexually transmitted diseases – is fueling a climate of state-sanctioned discrimination, a federal lawsuit said. The National Center for Lesbian Rights and Lambda Legal said the lawsuit filed Wednesday seeks to overturn the Comprehensive Health Education Act of 1988 as an unconstitutional violation of the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution. The law, which mandates how sex education classes are taught, also subjects students to bullying and violence and stigmatizes a group that’s already at a heightened risk of suicide, the lawsuit contends. State Superintendent of Education Molly Spearman, named as a defendant in the lawsuit, agreed that the law is on shaky ground. She requested an opinion on its constitutionality from South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson. That opinion said “a court would likely conclude” that the law violates the equal protection clause requiring that people in similar circumstances be treated the same under the law. Parents can have their children opted out of the school sex education curriculum, said Ryan Brown, a spokesman for the state Department of Education.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: The state Senate on Wednesday unanimously approved a proposal to start four schools based around Native American language and culture.The House will next consider the proposal, which aims to address high drop-out rates in some Native American communities in the state. The schools would teach an Oceti Sakowin curriculum centered on Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota language and culture. It is pushed by a group of educators who are planning to open the schools in Native American communities. When Sen. Troy Heinert, a Democrat from Mission, introduced the bill, he had hefty opposition from Gov. Kristi Noem and education groups. But he was able to win the Republican governor’s support through a rewrite of the bill. He also won the support of the Republican-dominated Senate. Education groups oppose the proposal, saying that the current school system can accommodate innovative programs. The schools were originally called charter schools in the bill, but the term was switched to “community-based schools.” The schools would need to apply to school districts to start within the district, and they would receive funding based on the number of students enrolled in the schools. They would purchase or lease school facilities independently from the school districts.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Meharry Medical College and health care provider Remote Area Medical are offering free dental care at an event this week. They will provide free cleanings, fillings, extractions and dental X-rays on Saturday on Meharry’s campus in Nashville during Oral Health Day. Services will be provided to up to 600 uninsured or underinsured middle Tennessee residents, according to a news release from the school. There will also be free kidney screenings provided by the Tennessee Kidney Foundation, the release said. Remote Area Medical is a nonprofit provider of mobile medical clinics that delivers free dental, vision and medical care to people in need. To receive treatment, patients must be at least 18 years old. They will be seen on a first-come, first-served basis. Services are free, and no insurance or identification is required. Check-in is at Henry A. Moses Ph.D. Alumni Hall on Meharry’s campus. Tickets will be distributed beginning at 6 a.m. Services will be available at 7 a.m. No children will be permitted. Care will be provided by Meharry dental students, Meharry School of Dentistry alumni and volunteer dental students and providers.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Emergency crews rescued stranded drivers from the roofs of their vehicles on Thursday after a water main broke and flooded a Houston freeway. The flooding submerged vehicles on an eastern section of Loop 610, a highway that circles the city. Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez tweeted early Thursday afternoon that all occupants were out of flooded vehicles. There were no reports of injuries. Drivers in the low-lying city are used to navigating flooded roadways during storms, but the water main-caused flash flood caught many by surprise on a sunny day. The fire department said on Twitter that it had rescued three people and searched and cleared 12 vehicles. Houston officials said the 8-foot water main burst as a contractor doing exploratory work for a city water line project moved soil from the line. The city said contractors are in the area to isolate the break and make repairs. City officials said they had received reports about low water pressure across a large swath of the city but that once the valves are closed, pressure should be restored. Gonzalez said some nearby businesses were reporting that they had no water service.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Leaders of a new Salt Lake City Olympic bid committee vowed Wednesday to be transparent and frugal as they design a plan based around existing venues and experience from hosting the 2002 Winter Olympics but that will also include new, modern ideas. The committee held its first meeting as it sets out to assess whether Salt Lake City should bid for the 2030 or 2034 Winter Olympics. There’s no timeline for that decision. Committee chair Cindy Crane told board members that every conversation they have about the Olympics should be considered public as the part of a completely open process. Crane, a former CEO of a major utility company, said after the meeting that the remark was made to establish ground rules and was not a direct reference to a bribery scandal that nearly derailed the plans for the 2002 Winter Olympics hosted by Salt Lake City. But, she said, “The strength of our operating principles are to make it very, very clear that those days are well behind us and not in our path forward.” The bribery scandal broke in 1998, three years after Salt Lake City was chosen over cities in Canada, Sweden and Switzerland. Salt Lake’s bid committee doled out $1 million in cash, scholarships, medical care, gifts and other favors to International Olympic Committee members and their families. That included ski trips, NBA tickets, plastic surgery, knee replacements, violins and housing and salary for children of IOC members, according to report by an ethics panel. It led to the expulsion of six IOC members, the resignation of four others and severe warnings for several others, though none faced criminal charges. U.S. prosecutors brought criminal charges against two Salt Lake bid leaders, but both men were acquitted by a judge halfway through a federal trial.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier:The state House advanced a bill to tax and regulate marijuana sales in the state, after the Senate passed legislation last spring. Current Vermont law that went into effect in 2018 allows for the possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, but it does not include a mechanism to tax and sell marijuana. The House vote on the tax-and-regulate legislation late Wednesday was approved 90-54. Rep. John Gannon, a Democrat from Wilmington, called Vermont’s existing law “awkward” because it legalized recreational pot but did not create “safe and legal access to it.” He told lawmakers that the question before them was whether cannabis, which was already legalized in Vermont, should be regulated. A House amendment has proposed a 14% excise tax on retail sales of marijuana products and a 6% sales and use tax for a total rate of 20%. The bill establishes a license for current medical dispensaries to start selling marijuana in February 2022. Other retailers would need to apply for licenses and could start selling it in July 2022. Cultivators, wholesalers and product manufacturers would need to apply for other licenses available. The program for licensed cannabis establishments would be administered by an independent Cannabis Control Board within the executive branch, which would be responsible for establishing rules, compliance and enforcement. The use of cannabis in public places would be prohibited unless specifically authorized by law. Republican Gov. Phil Scott has said he was concerned about highway safety, and said he wanted to see an effective way to test for impairment.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: An animal control company said it removed an 8-foot-long beehive from someone’s apartment. Virginia Wildlife Management and Control said in a statement that it removed the hive from the ceiling of a living room in Richmond on Monday. The space was in between tenants at the time. The company said the hive produced about 80 to 100 pounds of honey, although only about 15 to 20 pounds was able to be salvaged. Rich Perry, owner of the wildlife control company, told The Charlotte Observer that the hive was large enough to support 100,000 to 150,000 bees. But he said it wasn’t fully occupied Perry said it was extremely unusual to find such a large hive inside a building. He said the hive of Italian bees was likely to be at least 2 years old. He said the bees probably got in through holes in the siding and found a home between rafters and sheet rock.The company said it has a “no kill” policy with bees. But he said the company could not find the queen after an extensive search and that the hive could not be saved.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: A measure prohibiting homicide defendants from claiming as a defense that panic brought on by a victim’s sexual orientation or gender identity has been passed by state lawmakers. Nine states – California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Nevada, New Jersey New York and Rhode Island – have legislatively banned the use of gay or transgender panic as a legal defense. The Washington measure, passed by the Senate on a bipartisan 46-3 vote Wednesday, is named after Nikki Kuhnhausen, a transgender teen who was killed last year, The Columbian reported. Kuhnhausen, 17, disappeared in early June and her remains were discovered Dec. 7, southeast of Battle Ground. A Vancouver man has been charged with second-degree murder and malicious harassment, which is a hate crime in Washington. Authorities said Kuhnhausen was strangled after her assailant learned she was transgender. He has pleaded not guilty. There was no immediate indication if he will attempt to use a “panic” defense. The bill, which passed the House earlier this month on a 90-5 vote, would block a defendant from using a defense based on discovery or disclosure of the victim’s actual or perceived gender identity or sexual orientation and would prevent a claim of “diminished capacity” because the defendant did not fully comprehend the nature and gravity of the alleged crime. The legislation now goes to Gov. Jay Inslee for his signature.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Investigators are seeking help from the public as they try to determine the cause of separate fires on the same day at adjacent businesses in southern West Virginia. A medical building under renovation and a gun shop were destroyed in the Feb. 10 fires in Williamson, the state fire marshal’s office said in a news release Thursday. Although firefighters battled a fire at the Williamson Health and Wellness Center, crews discovered the gun shop had been broken into and items had been removed. The second fire at the gun shop occurred about four hours later with flames shooting through the roof, the statement said. The state fire marshal’s office is working with Williamson police in the investigation. Although the statement said it’s not known how the fires started, it said a $5,000 reward is being offered for information leading to an arrest and conviction.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison:The number of abortions performed in Wisconsin increased for a second straight year in 2018 after eight years of declines, the latest report from the state Department of Health Services showed. Abortions increased 7% in 2018 over 2017, the report said. There were 6,042 abortions in Wisconsin in 2018, up from 5,640 the year before. That’s nearly double the rate of increase between 2016 and 2017 when abortions went up 3.7%. The growth is due to there being 539 more medication abortions in 2018 compared with 2017. Planned Parenthood opened a clinic in Sheboygan in May 2018 that offered medication abortions. The latest report showed that women ages 20 to 24 had 30% of the abortions in 2018, the most of any age group. The total number of abortions had dropped steadily from 2009 until 2017. Anti-abortion groups Pro-Life Wisconsin and Wisconsin Right to Life both decried the increase. Republicans who control the Legislature passed a number of bills restricting abortion access in recent years. Democratic Gov. Tony Evers last year vetoed for Republican-backed bills designed to limit the number of abortions.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Federal investigators want help from the public as they try to find out who poisoned a golden eagle and ravens in southwest Wyoming four years ago. They’re offering a reward of up to $2,000 for information leading to a conviction. The golden eagle and four ravens were found dead southwest of Wamsutter in 2016. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said Tuesday investigators also found poison-laced baits in the remote area of interspersed private and U.S. Bureau of Land Management lands. Investigators said the case is unrelated to the 2018 poisoning deaths of three dogs, a bald eagle and dozens of other birds in the Dubois area. The Fish and Wildlife Service and Wyoming Game and Fish Department are offering rewards up to $7,000 in that case. Golden eagles are federally protected under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act. A person who kills one illegally can get up to a year in prison and a $100,000 fine.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/05/13/beckoning-tourists-evangelical-outreach-vaccine-sweeteners-news-around-states/116175936/", "title": "Beckoning tourists, evangelical outreach: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: With the state’s jobless numbers already nearing pre-pandemic levels and competition on the rise in a changed job market, the search for hospitality workers may not end with Alabama’s participation in federal supplemental unemployment benefits. Some who lost jobs in the industry “went off and found a job that has more … dependable wages,” said Jacqueline Allen, spokeswoman for state workforce development agency AIDT. “Everybody who basically wants a job right now has a job.” That’s My Child youth nonprofit founder Charles Lee said every member of his teens-to-work training program now graduates with a job, and the phone keeps ringing with employers asking for more. Meanwhile, he said federal relief payments and jobless benefits have changed people’s outlook on what’s possible. “It’s the most money some people have ever seen,” Lee said. “I think it’s just whoever is willing to go up to that $15 is going to get that workforce.” Transportation and child care issues were complicated by the pandemic, too. Child care alone is pricey in the best of times, if it’s available at all. Sam Addy of the Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Alabama estimated better access to child care could bring 120,000 more people into the state’s labor force.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The runoff race for mayor remained too close to call after Tuesday’s election, with the two candidates separated by only about 100 votes and thousands of ballots still uncounted. Preliminary election results showed Forrest Dunbar leading opponent Dave Bronson by a slim margin, garnering 50.08% of the votes tallied thus far, Anchorage Daily News reports. The election was on track for a record number of votes cast. An unknown amount of ballots cast in person Tuesday, left in secure ballot boxes throughout the city or postmarked by Election Day continue to arrive. As more ballots arrive, it’s likely that turnout will eclipse the city’s last record in the 2018 race for mayor. While technically nonpartisan, the mayoral race has been heated, fomenting partisan divisions among residents who disagree over how the city should move forward. The two candidates take starkly contrasting approaches to issues like the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, the homelessness crisis and the city’s economy. Bronson has criticized Anchorage’s public health measures and restrictions on businesses and targeted Dunbar over the city’s handling of homelessness. Meanwhile, Dunbar has largely supported the city’s pandemic policies, saying that without them, more people would have died from COVID-19.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Gov. Doug Ducey’s order last month rescinding the mask mandate for schools inflamed and confused the debate over face coverings, as many parents incorrectly interpreted it as a “masks off” directive. Ducey’s action tossed the decision to school administrators, putting them in the driver’s seat on mask policy. For many, it has been a hot seat. “It’s been pretty wild,” said Deb Dillon, president of the Prescott Unified School District board. Prescott opted to make mask usage voluntary last month but reversed itself May 4 after a coronavirus outbreak. The Prescott meeting was orderly, in contrast to earlier events in southern Arizona, where anti-mask protesters crowded into lobbies outside the board meetings of the Vail and Tanque Verde districts, demanding to speak. Both meetings were canceled. The protesters at Vail held a mock election to appoint themselves school officials. That led to incorrect accounts that circulated nationwide that their complaints had scared the official board members into quitting. The Arizona School Boards Association issued a statement condemning actions that threaten school board members. “Too often this year they have been treated as faceless bureaucrats who are optimal targets to release rage and frustration over the circumstances of the pandemic,” the statement said.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Tuesday formed a panel to come up with ways to spend the $1.5 billion the state is receiving from the latest federal coronavirus relief package. The Republican governor formed a 15-member steering committee for the state’s share of the $1.9 trillion relief measure that became law in March. Hutchinson formed a similar committee for the coronavirus relief money that was approved last year. The panel will be made up of eight Cabinet members and three members each from the state House and Senate. “We have to be methodical about this and not rushed,” Hutchinson told reporters. The U.S. Treasury Department on Monday issued broad guidance on how the relief funds can be spent. Hutchinson said he believed the priority for the state’s share of the relief spending should be capital investments, citing broadband and cybersecurity as two areas he’d like funded with the additional money. “It needs to be investments we can make that do not incur long-term spending and indebtedness of the state,” Hutchinson said. Because Arkansas’ unemployment rate is not significantly higher than its pre-pandemic level, the state is eligible to receive just half of its $1.5 billion allotment immediately, with the rest being provided one year later.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLong Beach: The city is offering tickets to the Aquarium of the Pacific as an incentive to overcome resistance to COVID-19 vaccinations. Long Beach will give two aquarium tickets to anyone receiving their first dose of Pfizer or Moderna vaccine or a single dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine at city-run vaccination sites, the city said Tuesday. The offer runs through Saturday. “While we have made tremendous strides in vaccinating 60% of eligible Long Beach residents and 96% of our seniors, we know that vaccine hesitancy for some is real,” Mayor Robert Garcia said in a statement. “We are going to do everything we can to encourage folks to get vaccinated, and that includes incentives.” The Aquarium of the Pacific is one of the Los Angeles region’s major attractions, drawing about 1.7 million visitors annually. A regular adult general admission ticket costs $36.95. City Health and Human Services Director Kelly Colopy said the recent slowdown in vaccinations in California includes Long Beach, and officials are looking for innovative solutions.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: Some health officials have warned that continued high numbers of COVID-19 hospitalizations point to the pandemic not being over yet despite the state’s average infection rate decreasing by nearly a third since April. Colorado was averaging 1,731 newly confirmed coronavirus cases each day in late April – the most since Jan. 19 – but the numbers have fallen nearly every day since then, The Gazette reports. The state has averaged 1,182 newly confirmed cases over the past week, health officials said. “Colorado is heading in a positive direction again, and vaccination coverage is almost certainly playing a key role in this decline,” said Glen Mays, chair of the Colorado School of Public Health’s department of health systems. But Elizabeth Carlton, who also works for the department, said there are more worrying metrics, including hospitalizations. Carlton said the state was averaging about 100 new hospital admissions from COVID-19 daily since April 28, but that figure has risen to more than 650 as of Monday. Carlton said the metric means the “the number of people developing severe COVID-19 in Colorado doesn’t appear to be declining right now.” Some researchers said infection control efforts have fallen, and the time people spend away from home is rising, meaning current trends could continue.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Nursing home workers continue to struggle with severe staffing shortages, a lack of protective equipment and low pay during the coronavirus pandemic, according to a report released Monday, days before planned employee strikes across the state. The report also accuses nursing home owners of failing to follow federal guidance on the use of protective equipment and having inadequate infection control, testing and quarantine procedures during the pandemic. It alleges state officials haven’t done enough to oversee nursing homes and hold them accountable. The report, titled “We Were Abandoned: How Connecticut Failed Nursing Home Workers and Residents During the COVID-19 Pandemic,” was written by Yale Law School students for the Service Employees International Union’s District 1199 New England, which represents about 5,000 nursing home workers in Connecticut. “These workers risk their lives and the lives of their loved ones back home to care for these residents in unsafe conditions and for low pay,” Yale student Aaron Bryce Lee said at a news conference Monday. “The state must make the financial investments necessary to improve compensation, benefits and staffing levels.” Workers at 33 nursing homes are ready to strike beginning Friday if demands for better wages, benefits and staffing aren’t met.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Delaware State University will cancel more than $700,000 in student debt for recent graduates who “faced financial hardship during the COVID-19 pandemic,” the school announced Wednesday. The average eligible student will qualify for about $3,276 in debt relief, the school said. The funds, which will total $730,655, became available through the federal government’s latest coronavirus relief package. More than 200 students qualify, according to the university. A spokesperson for the school, Carlos Holmes, said most students should already know if they’ve qualified, but they can check with financial aid. School President Tony Allen said the debt reduction is consistent with the school’s initiatives to keep student debt manageable. “We haven’t raised our tuition in over six years; we issue every incoming student an iPad or a MacBook; we are replacing traditional textbooks with less expensive digital editions, and our Early College High School saves the average family of nearly $50,000 in college expenses,” he said in a statement. “Our students don’t just come here for a quality college experience. Most are trying to change the economic trajectory of their lives for themselves, their families, and their communities. Our responsibility is to do everything we can to put them on the path.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Residents face a Friday deadline to apply for a local program to help those who have fallen behind on their mortgage because of the pandemic, WUSA-TV reports. The Home Saver Program, offered by the D.C. Housing Finance Agency, has $4 million on the table to aid families in need, said Christopher Donald, executive director and CEO of the agency. “You’ve got to be a resident of the District of Columbia,” Donald said. “If they own a home here, and it’s their primary residence, and they’re behind on their mortgage, they’re either unemployed or underemployed, they can get up to 16 months of assistance, up to $60,000.” Money is also available through the Restore Program for people who have returned to work but need a boost to get out of the red. “The assistance does cover delinquent condo fees and HOA fees,” Donald said. The money comes in the form of a grant, so it doesn’t have to be paid back, and there is no income requirement to apply. Relief is also available for small landlords who have taken a financial hit during the pandemic.\n\nFlorida\n\nPensacola: Hot dogs, hamburgers, minor league baseball and COVID-19 shots are coming together. This week at Blue Wahoos Stadium, adult ticket buyers are eligible to receive the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine at several games. The shots were distributed Tuesday and will also be available at games Saturday and Sunday. J&J’s vaccine requires only one dose. Shots will be available to eligible fans for free, with no appointment necessary. “The Blue Wahoos’ mission statement is to improve the quality of life in our community, so when we had the opportunity to partner with the Florida Department of Health, it was a no-brainer for us,” said Donna Kirby, the team’s vice president of operations. “We thought, ‘Absolutely.’ What great fun to have fans back for baseball, to be able to provide them with vaccinations if they so choose.” A total of 500 doses will be administered at the ballpark on a first-come, first-served basis. They will not be divvied up over the course of the three games, Kirby said, so there is a possibility that all 500 shots could be administered before the end of the three-game stretch. To get in the spirit, team President Jonathan Griffith will receive his shot during the seventh-inning stretch of Saturday’s game.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Twelve-year-old Jane Ellen Norman is looking forward to a little more freedom in her life and a possible return to summer camp after getting her first dose of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine Tuesday, one day after U.S. regulators expanded its use to children her age through 15. Georgia is one of the first states to open up the shots, Reuters reports. Being able to see her friends without staying far apart and worrying they might get sick was top of mind for Jane Ellen after her shot at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in downtown Atlanta. “I hope they all get vaccinated,” the sixth grader said. Jane Ellen’s mom, English Norman, said she scheduled an appointment for her daughter and 14-year-old son immediately after hearing about the FDA authorization. She said her kids have been good about wearing masks, washing their hands and staying socially distant, but they’ve still been very anxious about leaving the house. “I think it’s exciting that now their anxiety can start to lessen and they can feel safe,” she said. Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock said Monday that the authorization brings the country “closer to returning to a sense of normalcy and to ending the pandemic.” For Jane Ellen, that means a chance to go back to her summer camp, which was canceled last year as the pandemic raged. “I’m excited to go there and see all my camp friends,” she said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The chief executive of a company accused of defrauding banks of money meant to assist businesses affected by the coronavirus pandemic pleaded not guilty Wednesday. Martin Kao, CEO of Martin Defense Group LLC, formerly known as Navatek LLC, is charged with bank fraud and money laundering. Authorities say he defrauded banks of more than $12.8 million through the Paycheck Protection Program, which Congress authorized to provide emergency financial assistance through forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and other expenses. Kao transferred more than $2 million into his own personal accounts, according to an indictment. Investigators talked to an executive and a former employee who said the company wasn’t affected by the pandemic, court documents said. Authorities describe his company as a “research, engineering, design, and innovations company that specializes in novel systems for the Department of Defense and other partners in academia and other scientific fields.” During a brief arraignment via telephone Wednesday, defense attorney Michael Green entered the not guilty plea on behalf of Kao.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state is moving into a new stage of Gov. Brad Little’s coronavirus reopening plans and lifting restrictions on the size of gatherings. Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Director Dave Jeppesen made the announcement Tuesday, noting that the state’s health care system isn’t strained and that plenty of vaccine is available for interested residents. “Eighty-three percent of hospitals are operating as normal, and there’s no hospital in the state that has a resource limitation going on,” Jeppesen said during a news conference. In November and December, some hospitals were intermittently turning away people or sending them elsewhere because they didn’t have enough healthy staffers or available beds to admit them. In Stage 3 of the reopening plan, gatherings were supposed to be limited to 50 or fewer people, though political, religious, educational and health care events were exempt from the restriction. The current move to Stage 4 means there is no limit on gatherings, though public health officials are encouraging people to follow guidance from federal and local health agencies on how to gather safely. Face coverings are still recommended at times when physical distancing is difficult, and people and businesses should continue to follow physical distancing and sanitation recommendations, Jeppesen said.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Capitalizing on the availability of vaccines, cabin fever and an imminent easing of pandemic restrictions, Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Wednesday launched a $6million advertising campaign to promote road-trip tourism and revive Illinois’ devastated hospitality industry. The “Time for Me to Drive” campaign makes use of a play on words from the 1978 song “Time for Me to Fly” by REO Speedwagon, a rock band that got its start in Champaign. The campaign will focus on attracting visitors from within Illinois and from surrounding states to hundreds of sites where they can enjoy Chicago architecture, southern Illinois wineries, hiking in state parks, restaurants throughout the state, and Springfield’s Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum. “More and more travelers are ready to get back out there,” Pritzker said at a news conference at the presidential library. “Recent surveys show that half of Americans plan to travel this summer, and half of them intend to drive. ... After an incredibly difficult year in which the pandemic kept us all close to home and staying apart, lifesaving vaccines are bringing us back to life and heading toward a summer of fun and venturing out.” More than 60 potential driving itineraries are available online at enjoyillinois.com.\n\nIndiana\n\nFishers: The Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra is bringing back its popular Symphony on the Prairie performances, a year after the pandemic forced the cancellation of the long-running outdoor concert series. Officials announced Monday that this year’s Kroger Symphony on the Prairie season will begin June 25 with the symphony’s rendition of songs by the Beatles performed for an audience on the grassy lawn at suburban Indianapolis’ Conner Prairie. A series of other performances will be held throughout the summer at the venue in Fishers, just north of Indianapolis, with the last performances set for early September. Tickets go on sale May 24. This year’s concerts will be different after last year’s shows were canceled for the first time in the events’ 40-year history due to the threat that the coronavirus posed to musicians, staff and patrons. The symphony plans to sell only up to 4,000 tickets – or 50% of the venue’s capacity – for the first concerts to help patrons maintain social distance. The dance floor in front of the performance stage will also be closed, and there will be limits on table rentals and reserved seating. People will also have to wear masks when entering the venue, on pathways, in restrooms, and when they wait in line for food and drinks.\n\nIowa\n\nIndianola: Simpson College won’t require students, staff or faculty to get vaccinated before the fall semester, but it also plans to hold off on returning to normal campus operations until most have gotten their COVID-19 shots. The college’s crisis management team, led by Heidi Levine, vice president for student development and planning, and Simpson President Marsha Kelliher’s leadership cabinet, announced the decision on the college’s online COVID-19 dashboard last week. According to the announcement, the team hopes to see 80% of the campus community vaccinated before transitioning to a “Green” operating phase, but it also plans to strongly encourage everyone on campus to get vaccinated. Some colleges across the country have recently announced vaccine requirements, “but that is still the minority of colleges,” Levine said, adding that Grinnell College is the only Iowa college of which she’s aware that plans to require students to be inoculated by August. Grinnell College officials announced the requirement last month but said students will be able to request an exemption for medical or religious reasons.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: The families of 16 students have sued two suburban Kansas City school districts, arguing their children should be allowed to attend school during the pandemic without wearing masks. “The parents are terribly, terribly upset. There’s a groundswell of dissatisfaction,” said their attorney, Linus Baker. The Kansas City Star reports the lawsuit against the Blue Valley and Olathe school districts in Johnson County argues students should be granted individual exemptions to mask mandates. The parents contend masks are interfering with their children’s ability to learn. Districts offer medical exemptions, generally for students with special needs or disabilities. They also relax mask rules for students during some sports and other activities. Two parents already have medical exemptions but are suing to seek reimbursement for the costs to obtain them. Both districts have fielded challenges since the Legislature passed a bill that empowers parents to fight COVID-19 restrictions. But their school boards have so far upheld their mask mandates. District officials have argued that the mandates cannot be repealed under the new law because they were enacted last summer. The law requires individuals to contest them within 30 days.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state government will receive more than $2.1 billion from the latest round of federal coronavirus aid – a smaller-than-projected amount due to the commonwealth’s improving economic performance, Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday. The U.S. Treasury announced state allocations based on a formula that included each state’s share of the nation’s unemployed from October through December 2020, Beshear said. Kentucky performed better than expected during that period, he said. As a result, its allotment will be $2.18 billion, down from an initial estimate that state government would receive $2.44 billion, he said. “In other words, Kentucky has recovered stronger than the federal government anticipated, faster than most, and it impacted a little bit on the dollars that will be available to us,” the Democratic governor said at a news conference. Beshear has pointed to a recent series of upbeat economic developments – from record sales tax collections to a credit rating agency’s upgraded assessment of the state’s financial outlook – in touting Kentucky’s prospects as more people get COVID-19 vaccines. He has used the economic news to try to deflect criticism from some prominent Republicans calling for a much faster pace in lifting remaining virus restrictions.\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport: New research being done at LSU Health Shreveport offers an up-close view of how SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, can spread to the brain. The study helps explain the alarming array of neurological symptoms reported in some patients with COVID-19 and reveals clues as to why some patients suffer severe neurological effects, while others experience none at all. The researchers, working with colleagues at Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha in Spain, report evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can infect both neurons, the nerve cells that power the brain, and astrocytes, the cells in the brain and spinal cord that support and protect neurons. “Our findings suggest that astrocytes are a pathway through which COVID-19 causes neurological damage,” said Dr. Ricardo Costa, a postdoctoral fellow at LSU Health Shreveport and the study’s first author. “This could explain many of the neurologic symptoms we see in COVID-19 patients, which include loss of sense of smell and taste, disorientation, psychosis and stroke.”\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state is rolling out free fishing licenses, baseball tickets and L.L. Bean gift cards to encourage more residents to get vaccinated before the end of the month, Gov. Janet Mills announced Tuesday. The Democratic governor unveiled the public-private program, “Your Shot to Get Outdoors,” during a virtual discussion President Joe Biden hosted with several governors. The items include up to 5,000 hunting licenses, fishing licenses, Maine Wildlife Park day passes and state park day passes, along with up to 10,000 $20 L.L. Bean gift cards and up to 5,000 Portland Sea Dog tickets and passes for Oxford Plains Speedway. “Whether you’re an angler or a hunter, a baseball fan or a racing fan, or someone who just all-around enjoys being outside, now is a great time to protect yourself from COVID-19 and take to the outdoors,” Mills said. The program led by the Maine Department of Health and Human Services comes as the number of COVID-19 vaccinations administered dipped to less than 63,000 last week, down from a peak of more than 125,000 doses in the first week that eligibility opened to all adults. The state hopes the new program along with federal approval of a COVID-19 vaccine for younger teenagers will encourage more vaccinations.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: Seeking a big comeback after a pandemic-decimated 2020, city officials are hoping a new ad campaign will remind Americans of just why they love visiting the resort for summer vacation. About this time last year, Ocean City was reopening its hotels, beach and Boardwalk after COVID-19 forced closures. Despite reopening for the 2020 summer season, the pandemic wreaked havoc on Ocean City, causing businesses and the town to lose millions. This May, hotels, as well as the beach and Boardwalk, are all open, and “the pathway to the summer much brighter than it was last year,” Ocean City Mayor Rick Meehan said. This year’s ads offer a relatively traditional message, reminding viewers of the memories they’ve made at the beach and encouraging them to come make new ones. In one commercial, heartfelt music plays as a narrator reminds viewers that the 10 miles of beach in Ocean City aren’t “just made of sand and water; it’s made of memories.” That message has been carefully crafted since the end of last year, said Jessica Waters, the city’s acting tourism director. The two ads, “10 Miles of Memories” and “Ocean Calling,” were developed to focus on the “simple moments” and memories people create at the beach.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: While there was a slight increase in the overall number of confirmed and suspected opioid-related drug overdose deaths in the state in 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic, overdose deaths among Black men soared by almost 70%, health officials said Wednesday. There were 2,104 confirmed and suspected opioid-related overdose deaths in the state last year, a 5% increase over the prior year, according to a report from the Department of Public Health. Among Black, non-Hispanic males, the confirmed opioid-related overdose death rate increased 69%, from 32.6 to 55.1 per 100,000 people – the highest increase of any ethnic or racial group in 2020. “The disparities in overdose trends among Black men underscore the need to continue our public health-centered, data-driven approach to the opioid epidemic that is disproportionately impacting high-risk, high-need priority populations,” Public Health Commissioner Dr. Monica Bharel said. Battling opioid use was complicated by the coronavirus pandemic, but Massachusetts is among the states with the smallest increases in all drug overdose deaths last year, officials said. “Both the COVID-19 pandemic and the opioid epidemic have underscored the importance of supporting disproportionately impacted communities,” Republican Gov. Charlie Baker said in a statement.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Health officials on Wednesday urged primary care physicians to enroll to administer COVID-19 vaccines, as the state prepared to quickly begin vaccinating 12- to 15-year-olds following U.S. authorization. “The most important thing we can do right now is to make vaccines available for whenever someone is ready,” Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, the state’s chief medical executive and chief health deputy, said during a news conference. “We know that patients trust their doctors, and when they are ready to get vaccinated, we want you to have vaccine on hand.” She encouraged doctors to check whether their patients have been vaccinated and ask if they have any questions. About 55% of Michigan residents ages 16 and older have been inoculated. The push to make doses available in physicians’ offices will complement the state’s focus on taking mobile clinics to places such as churches and vaccinating people who are homebound. Dr. Srikar Reddy, president-elect of the Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, said it is time to shift attention to residents who are hesitant about the vaccine and to the newly eligible children. “It only makes sense to visit your family physician to get vaccinated and to get your teenager vaccinated, too,” he said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state government will get about $200 million more than it was expecting under President Joe Biden’s coronavirus relief package, and Democratic Gov. Tim Walz expressed hope Monday that new guidelines for how states can spend the aid might help speed up the slow pace of negotiations over Minnesota’s next budget. The legislative session is due to adjourn next Monday, but the governor and leaders of the divided Legislature have yet to agree on target numbers for a dozen broad spending bills at the core of the state’s next two-year budget, which is expected to come in at about $50 billion. Walz told reporters that at least they now know how Minnesota can and can’t spend its $2.8 billion in federal relief. “The clarification from Treasury is huge,” he said. “That’s what we’ve been waiting on.” Republican leaders said the new federal guidance clears the way for Minnesota to exempt Paycheck Protection Program loans and extended unemployment insurance benefits from state taxes, which have been GOP priorities this session. Democrats have sought to cap the PPP exemption so that larger, profitable companies would pay taxes on forgiven loans.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state will stop accepting supplemental unemployment benefits from the federal government next month, Republican Gov. Tate Reeves said Monday. Reeves said the weekly supplement of $300 per person was intended to help people “who are unemployed through no fault of their own” because of the coronavirus pandemic. “After many conversations over the last several weeks with Mississippi small business owners and their employees, it has become clear that the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) and other like programs passed by the Congress may have been necessary in May of last year but are no longer so in May of this year,” Reeves wrote on Facebook. He said he’s directed the Mississippi Department of Employment Security to tell the federal government that the state will opt out of the additional federal unemployment benefits June 12, the earliest date allowed by federal law. Without the federal supplement, the maximum weekly unemployment benefit in Mississippi is $235, according to the department. “It has become clear to me that we cannot have a full economic recovery until we get the thousands of available jobs in our state filled,” Reeves wrote. A 40-hour-per-week job at the minimum wage of $7.25 an hour would pay $290 a week before taxes are taken out.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: State lawmakers pushed back Wednesday against local coronavirus restrictions, passing legislation limiting the duration of public health orders that have shut down businesses and schools and limited how many people can gather. The legislation would limit emergency orders restricting businesses, churches, schools or gatherings to 30 days, unless extended by the local governing body. It would take effect immediately upon Gov. Mike Parson’s signature, meaning it could affect pandemic restrictions still in place in St. Louis County or other jurisdictions. It also would affect any future local health orders. “We want to be able to get this enforced as soon as possible,” said House Speaker Pro Tem John Wiemann, R-O’Fallon, who handled the bill. The House and Senate passed the legislation by overwhelming votes and with little discussion. Lawmakers have complained repeatedly during this year’s session about local pandemic restrictions that they say infringe on individual liberties and the ability to earn a living. The bill would allow local governing bodies to halt public health orders at any time by a majority vote. It also would prohibit cities and counties that receive public funds from requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination to use public accommodations or transportation systems.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state is sharing COVID-19 vaccines with Canadian truck drivers from neighboring Alberta. About 2,000 truck drivers from the province who transport goods from Canada to the U.S. are eligible to be vaccinated at a highway rest stop near Conrad through May 23, according to a memorandum of understanding signed between the state and the Canadian province. “By working together and taking this critical action, we keep our trade channels open between Montana and Alberta,” Gov. Greg Gianforte said in a statement. The border between Canada and the U.S. has been closed to all but essential traffic since last spring. “Alberta depends on trade with our American neighbors and this program will ensure our goods get to market while stopping the spike of COVID-19,” Alberta Premier Jason Kenney said in a statement. The province has reported record numbers of new COVID-19 cases this month. A similar program to vaccinate truck drivers from Canada began in North Dakota last month. The announcement came after the Blackfeet tribe in northern Montana gave about 1,000 doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to their relatives and neighbors across the border last month.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A sweeping bill that would shield businesses and local governments from coronavirus-related lawsuits won initial approval from state lawmakers Tuesday, despite complaints that senators haven’t done enough for workers who were at risk. Lawmakers advanced the proposal, 39-3, through the first of three required votes. The measure would bar pandemic-related lawsuits against businesses or governments as long as they were following federal public health guidelines. At least 29 other states have enacted laws addressing the issue, including 12 that are similar to the Nebraska proposal, said state Sen. Tom Briese, of Albion, the measure’s sponsor. He said Nebraska businesses face the threat of “needless, unwarranted” lawsuits from the pandemic if lawmakers don’t pass legal protections. The proposal has strong backing from Nebraska businesses, hospitals, schools, counties and cities. Organizations representing Nebraska trial attorneys and public school teachers opposed it. Some senators also criticized the bill because they said lawmakers haven’t done enough to help on-the-ground workers who faced the pandemic directly, risking their own health. Lawmakers this year have rejected paid sick-leave requirements for businesses and additional coronavirus protections for meatpacking workers.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Gambling giant MGM Resorts International on Wednesday joined a growing number of Las Vegas Strip casinos with state regulatory approval to open casino floors at 100% capacity and no person-to-person distancing requirement. The company said the Nevada Gaming Control Board granted its waiver for nine properties based on its workforce vaccination rate. “We will continue working to vaccinate as many people as possible and remain vigilant with health and safety protocols,” company CEO & President Bill Hornbuckle said in a statement. Approval applies to casino floors at the Bellagio, ARIA, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay, Mirage, New York-New York, Luxor, Excalibur and Park MGM. Three-foot distancing and 80% occupancy restrictions remain at restaurants, swimming pools and other non-gambling areas. Masks are still required. Clark County lawmakers with jurisdiction over Las Vegas-area businesses have approved plans to allow 100% occupancy once 60% of eligible county residents get a vaccine shot. As of Tuesday, the figure was 47%. Southern Nevada Health District Chief Health Officer Dr. Fermin Leguen said the county might not reach the threshold by June 1, given lagging demand.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The Prouty, an annual event to raise money for cancer research, is allowing some in-person participation this year, its 40th, after going virtual last summer because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Prouty combines cycling, walking and other events to raise funds for the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Norris Cotton Cancer Center. This year, in-person options include golf July 9 in Grantham, a 20-mile cycle July 10 in Hanover and a 5K walk July 11 in Hanover. Designated start times will be assigned to small groups to meet capacity restrictions. Local health guidelines and enhanced safety protocols will be followed. People can participate in activities virtually between June 1 and July 10. “The Prouty has always been about hope, and this year’s hybrid model is a stepping stone to a return to normalcy from the pandemic,” said Jacklynn Rodriguez, executive director for the Friends of the Norris Cotton Cancer Center. Since its inception in 1982, The Prouty has raised more than $50 million to support cancer research and patient and family support services.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNew Brunswick: For the second year in a row, Rutgers University will host virtual commencement ceremonies for graduates of its New Brunswick, Newark and Camden campuses. However, the school announced Tuesday that it will commend the graduates of 2020 and 2021 with in-person celebrations this fall. A notice on the university’s website asks students to save dates for their campus’s events: Rutgers New Brunswick and Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences on Oct. 22-23, Rutgers Newark on Nov. 8-10 and Rutgers Camden on Dec. 1-4. “While we had hoped to bring you together sooner, the continuing public health emergency associated with the pandemic prevented us until now,” said a statement signed by University President Jonathan Holloway and each school’s chancellor. Details on the events will be posted to the university’s website at a later date. “We are excited that Rutgers will have the opportunity this fall to bring you together in person and salute you for your accomplishments,” the announcement said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: A year after holding only drive-thru graduations, the school district for the state’s second most populous city has scheduled in-person graduation ceremonies at the district’s soccer stadium for its six high schools over two days later this month. Las Cruces Public Schools scheduled ceremonies May 21 for Onate and Mayfield high schools and Arrowhead Park Early College High School and on May 22 for Las Cruces and Centennial high schools and Rio Grande Preparatory Institute. Each graduating senior can invite up to 16 ticketed people, with the limit set due to the COVID-19 pandemic plus construction-related traffic in the area of the Field of Dreams stadium. Social distancing and mask-wearing will be required for all attendees while inside the venue. “I do want to thank all the graduates for their continuous resilience throughout this whole pandemic and really doing the best that they can,” interim Superintendent Ralph Ramos said. “We want to have this ceremony.” Ramos said the district is looking into ways to celebrate the class of 2020, which didn’t have a normal graduation.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: State regulators will soon draft rules that will require employers to protect workers from airborne infectious disease. A new state law tasks state labor and health officials with coming up with minimum workplace standards around things like the availability of personal protective equipment, social distancing and quarantine requirements. Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed the bill into law last week. Employers will have to come up with safety plans that comply with the yet-to-be written state standards and provide them to workers. Employers who don’t comply could face fines. Workers could also sue for up to $20,000 from employers who don’t follow safety standards or retaliate against workers for reporting noncompliance. The law was intended to help people like Maritza Ovalles, who has worked in the nail salon industry for over two decades but left her job when the COVID-19 pandemic struck and left her exposed in a workplace that she said lacked adequate health and safety protections. “When the pandemic began, the level of risk of not having proper protections was life or death,” said Ovalles, who advocates for better working conditions as a member of the NY Nail Salon Workers Association.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: Public health officials across Western North Carolina are asking the public to get involved as they work to identify the most pressing health needs for the next three years, such as impacts from COVID-19, cancer or infant mortality. National research firm PRC will conduct phone surveys with 300 Buncombe County residents through June, a confidential survey asking about residents’ health status, behaviors and experiences, according to a statement announcing the start of data collection. The 20-minute surveys will go to randomly selected households, but even folks who don’t get the call can take the survey online at www.buncombecounty.org/publichealth. Buncombe County Public Health Director Stacie Saunders urged residents to take part. “If you receive the call to participate, please do lend your voice to the survey,” she said in the release. “This is your opportunity to help us identify health priorities in our community.” Buncombe is joining 17 other counties this year in the regional community health assessment, WNC Healthy Impact, a collaboration with hospital organizations, public health departments and other community partners.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The United Tribes Technical College International Powwow and associated events will return late this summer after a year’s hiatus due to the coronavirus pandemic. However, the Tribal Leaders Summit that’s traditionally held at the Bismarck Event Center before the outdoor powwow has been called off for a second year. The Bismarck Tribune reports this year’s powwow will be the weekend of Sept. 10-12, starting with the grand entry Friday night and continuing through Sunday. Associated events will include Powwow Youth Day that Friday, a golf tournament Friday, a three-day softball tournament and a three-day youth basketball tournament beginning Friday, and the Powwow Thunderbird Run on Saturday. The powwow put on by the five American Indian tribes in North Dakota typically brings about 10,000 people to Bismarck and boosts the area economy by more than $4 million, according to the college. It attracts dancers from dozens of tribes across the U.S. and Canada and awards more than $100,000 in prize money. It’s considered one of the top powwows in the nation. United Tribes uses proceeds to fund student scholarships.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: State lawmakers have passed changes to ensure that if Kroger is allowed to sell flowers during a pandemic, the local florist can, too. Senate Bill 134, also known as the Business Fairness Act, passed the Ohio Senate 31-0 on Wednesday. The measure would prevent Gov. Mike DeWine’s administration from closing small businesses while their larger competitors remain open, assuming everyone can follow the same safety guidelines. “I would argue you are safer in a small business where you may be the only customer in that business at that time,” Sen. George Lang, R-West Chester, said on the floor Wednesday. The disparity came to light in March 2020 when DeWine’s state health department closed a slew of businesses to prevent the spread of COVID-19 but allowed groceries, pharmacies and other businesses to remain open. The result: Wal-Mart and Kroger stayed open, while the local jeweler had to close. “The playing field must be level,” said Chris Ferruso, a lobbyist for Ohio’s National Federation of Independent Business. “The government should not be picking winners and losers.” And small businesses were among the losers last year. A survey of National Federation of Independent Business members found 1 in 3 closed because of COVID-19 orders.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A new state law that creates a sales tax exemption for the University Hospitals Authority and Trust will grant OU Health funding to train more medical professionals. The law recently approved by the Legislature and Gov. Kevin Stitt restores a sales tax exemption that will allow the health system to train 160 additional nursing graduates and nurse practitioners annually and 70 additional medical residents within three years. State lawmakers and University of Oklahoma officials said the law will help address Oklahoma’s nurse and physician shortage and improve medical care across the state. Oklahoma has 40% fewer nurses per capita than the national average, said OU College of Nursing Dean Julie Hoff. “These nurses will soon be on the front lines of health care, allowing our facilities to increase their staffing levels and making it easier for everyone in the state to get the care they need,” she said. The state is 46th in the nation for physicians per capita, OU President Joseph Harroz Jr. said at a news conference Tuesday.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Gov. Kate Brown on Tuesday announced statewide and county COVID-19 vaccination targets, with the hope of reopening the state’s economy. Most statewide restrictions will be lifted when 70% of residents 16 and older receive their first vaccine dose, Brown said. In addition, counties will be eligible to move into the “lower risk” category when 65% of the area’s eligible population is vaccinated. “We still have some work to do to reach our 70% goal, but I am confident we can get there in June and return Oregon to a sense of normalcy,” Brown said. “We each play a part.” Currently, more than half the state’s eligible population has received a first dose. “For the first time since the start of the pandemic, we’ll be able to say the virus no longer controls the timelines in our lives – we will if enough Oregonians make the choice to get vaccinated,” said Pat Allen, the Oregon Health Authority’s director. Counties with 65% of their 16-and-up population inoculated will be eligible for the “lower risk” category, which permits indoor gatherings of 10 people or outdoor gatherings of 12 people. Restaurants, gyms and indoor and outdoor entertainment can open up to 50% capacity. Benton and Hood River counties have already vaccinated more than 65% of adult residents and are ready to move to the lower risk category May 21, unless they opt out.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state is allowing more people at indoor and outdoor events. Beginning Monday, occupancy limits will be increased to 50% of capacity for indoor events, up from 25%, and to 75% for outdoor events, up from 50%. “As more Pennsylvania adults get vaccinated and guidance from the CDC evolves, we can continue to move forward with the commonwealth’s reopening efforts,” Gov. Tom Wolf said in a statement Tuesday. The state has previously announced that nearly all pandemic restrictions will go away on Memorial Day, including capacity limits on bars, restaurants and other businesses, as well as indoor and outdoor event gathering limits. The state’s mask mandate will remain until 75% of adults are fully vaccinated. Statewide, about 45.6% of people 18 and older had been fully vaccinated as of Tuesday, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In Philadelphia, meanwhile, city officials announced pandemic restrictions will be eased beginning later this month and will go away almost entirely June 11. Starting May 21, retail stores and offices will no longer have to operate at reduced capacity, and the city is lifting its rule that bars and restaurants can only serve alcohol with food. Capacity limits on gyms, exercise classes and theaters will be eased, as well as for catered events.\n\nRhode Island\n\nPawtucket: With no baseball team in town, McCoy Stadium is being put to good use with the opening of a vaccination clinic at the site on Wednesdays. The drive-up, walk-up site will be open every Wednesday from 5 p.m. until 8 p.m., according to a statement from the city. Residents can make an appointment for a COVID-19 shot at the state’s vaccine signup portal, but people without an appointment are also welcome and encouraged, city officials said. The goal is to make getting vaccinations as convenient as possible. “We want to make sure that everyone has the opportunity to get a vaccine,” Pawtucket Public Health and Equity Leader Elizabeth Moreira said. “We believe that opening this site gives everyone another great option for vaccination appointments later on in the day.” The clinic will be run in partnership with the Rhode Island National Guard and Rhode Island Medical Reserve Corps Disaster Medical Assistance Team. The coronavirus testing site at the stadium will continue operating.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state’s public schools chief on Wednesday said the governor had no legal basis for allowing parents to opt their children out of wearing masks in schools, writing that Gov. Henry McMaster is “inciting hysteria and sowing division” as the school year ends. In guidance sent to state education superintendents Wednesday, education officials said the agency could find “no legal grounds” for the governor to set aside a policy instituted by another constitutional officer, under his or her own powers and not due to an emergency declaration. On Tuesday, the Republican governor issued an executive order letting parents opt their children out of wearing masks in public schools, citing widespread COVID-19 vaccine access for adults across the state. In response, education officials said state Superintendent Molly Spearman had opted to rescind a face-covering policy, with the exception of a federally instituted school bus mask mandate, “rather than wage a debate over constitutionality that would pit elected officials, students, and families against one another.” Guidance had required that students, teachers and staff wear face coverings while entering school buildings, moving through hallways and other instances where social distancing is not possible or optimal.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: The South Dakota Department of Health said Wednesday that the state has crossed the 50% threshold for the percentage of adults fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Health officials say more than 304,000 residents have received their shots. “I want to take this opportunity to thank all South Dakotans who have chosen to get their COVID-19 vaccine– protecting themselves, their family and their community,” Secretary of Health Kim Malsam-Rysdon said. “Vaccines are safe and are the quickest way out of this pandemic.” State health officials began Phase 2 of South Dakota’s vaccination plan April 5. It made vaccines available to all residents age 16 and older, in addition to any eligible person who had not been inoculated in the first phase. Parents, schools and vaccine clinics are rushing to begin inoculating younger children after U.S. regulators this week endorsed Pfizer’s vaccine for those as young as 12, a decision seen as a breakthrough in allowing classroom instruction to resume safely around the country. A handful of cities started offering shots to children ages 12 to 15 less than a day after the Food and Drug Administration gave the vaccine emergency use authorization for that age group.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: As she oversees the state’s response to the pandemic, Dr. Lisa Piercey knows getting back to normal may hinge on her ability to convince Christians and conservatives to get vaccinated. Piercey, 43, Tennessee’s top health official, is navigating a crisis of vaccine hesitancy that runs rampant in the rural swathes of the Volunteer State. “Being the hands and feet of Jesus is the way to go,” said Piercey, a 2019 appointee of Gov. Bill Lee. “They might not do it for themselves, but they should do it to help other people.” She said her office is unleashing a media campaign aimed partly at the people who are most hesitant, and she is reaching out to faith leaders to convince those residents on the virtues of vaccination. “It’s their pastor they trust,” Piercey said. And she’s confident the approach will work because she is one of them. An evangelical Christian farm girl from West Tennessee, Piercey said she doesn’t believe in evolution and struggles with the timelines of dinosaurs and man, but she still wears a mask around other people and has strict vaccination rules in her family. On May 20, the mother of four’s triplets will turn 16. “On that morning, they will get the vaccine first and their driver’s licenses second,” Piercey said.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: With the coronavirus pandemic not yet licked, some activities will look a little different again this summer, including dips in the city’s beloved, “68-degrees-year-round” watering hole, Barton Springs Pool. Starting later this month, anyone planning a swim at Barton Springs will need to make an advance reservation online. Two-hour time slots will help the pool “to manage capacity for the safety of staff and guests,” according to the city’s website. Those who have purchased a season pass, are older than 80, are city employees, or are veterans or active military members will be allowed to enter the pool without a reservation, but that won’t apply to anyone accompanying them. At this time, Barton Springs Pool is not accepting group reservations. Reservations can be made on a city website. A reservation fee will cost Austin residents $2 if they’re between 1 and 11 years old, $3 for those 12-17, $5 for all adults and $2 for anyone over 61. For nonresidents, it’s $4 for those 1-11, $5 for those 12-17, $9 for all adults and $5 for anyone over 61. All payments must be completed online ahead of time. Those with a seasonal swim pass will also not need to reserve a spot ahead of time before visiting Barton Springs. Passes went on sale earlier this week.\n\nUtah\n\nRoy: A resident has said a hacker stole her personal information and swapped out her banking information to steal about $400 of weekly unemployment benefits. “I feel like being robbed at gunpoint would’ve been better than what’s going to happen now,” said Heidi Howell, who lost her job in March and had her identity and unemployment check stolen. Howell told KUTV-TV that she is now waiting to find out if she can still claim the unemployment check. She also froze her credit reports, filed a police report and changed her bank account numbers. Kevin Burt, director of the Utah Unemployment Insurance Division, said this is the first case he’s seen among 450,000 people seeking benefits in the state during the coronavirus pandemic. He believes the hacker got her login information from another website. “Make sure that you have a secure password,” Burt said. “I think that helps quite a bit – that’s different than your other passwords that you use for more casual online interactions.” Howell said she used a unique password and is not sure how someone gained access. Burt said the state has not seen much of a rise in hacks to the unemployment system, although fraud is up nationwide because of the historic volume of claims being filed.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: A community group of members of the state’s minority populations is working to make sure as many of those residents as possible are vaccinated against COVID-19. The Vermont Health Equity Initiative said it will be providing vaccinations for those who are Black, indigenous and people of color through July 10. Clinics are being offered with support from the Vermont Department of Health and the City of Burlington. So far, the initiative has collaborated to deliver more than 2,800 total doses of the vaccine. The group said that as of Monday, about 70% of white, non-Hispanic Vermonters in Chittenden County had received at least one dose of the vaccine, while 58% of minority members had received at least one dose. The clinics were established in an effort to close the racial gap in vaccinations to protect the larger community and in response to the city of Burlington’s declaration of racism as a public health emergency in July 2020. “We’re offering an in-person experience that has been missing for vaccinations for these members of our community,” said Belan Antensaye of the Racial, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging Department of the city of Burlington and the Vermont Professionals of Color Network.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Restaurants and drinking establishments will be able to seat up to 100 patrons indoors and a maximum of 250 guests outdoors starting May 15, Gov. Ralph Northam recently announced, but establishments say they may not be able to accommodate more guests due to a shortage in workers. Eric Terry, president of the Virginia Restaurant, Lodging & Travel Association, estimated about 100 Richmond restaurants closed in 2020 but said there have been minimal closures this year. Many restaurants are likely nearing 80% of their pre-pandemic revenue levels, according to Terry. While full recovery for the industry is underway, Terry said the biggest revenue factor is a restricted labor force. “I was on the phone yesterday with two restaurant operators who said they are having to close two days a week because they can’t get enough staff,” he said. The new limit will double the number of indoor guests allowed as of April 1. Restaurants may return to selling alcohol past midnight, and dining room closures between midnight and 5 a.m. will no longer be required. Northam has said all restrictions will be lifted June 15 if the number of new COVID-19 cases remains low and vaccinations rise. But restaurants with limited staff will not be able to accommodate diners at full capacity, Terry said.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Authorities say schools in the state won’t consider a requirement to mandate COVID-19 vaccines in schoolchildren until a vaccine is fully approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA on Monday signed off on emergency use of the Pfizer vaccine in 12- to 15-year-olds. The state’s secretary of health, Umair Shah, said Tuesday that more than 370,000 Washington teens and adolescents are in that age group. Vaccines undergo rigorous review before they’re fully approved, but the FDA can allow use under so-called emergency use authorization in instances when vaccines meet certain criteria and there are no approved alternatives. The Seattle Times reports that until a COVID-19 vaccine is formally approved, officials from the Washington State Board of Health – the board that oversees state vaccine policies – say they won’t consider adding it to the list of required immunizations. “The board would not require a COVID-19 vaccine for school entry until it’s approved by the FDA and recommended by Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices,” Kelie Kahler, spokesperson for the board, wrote in an email, referring to a committee housed within the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that sets national vaccine guidance.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Democratic U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin is joining first lady Jill Biden and actor Jennifer Garner during a visit to the state Thursday. Biden’s office announced Wednesday that she and Manchin will arrive at Yeager Airport in Charleston before joining Garner at a COVID-19 vaccination center and delivering remarks at Capital High School. A previously announced visit to Arnoldsburg Elementary School in Calhoun County has been scrubbed due to a coronavirus quarantine in the school district. Biden and Manchin will then visit with members of the West Virginia National Guard and their families at the airport before departing, the first lady’s office said in a statement. Garner grew up in Charleston. She has previously testified before Congress in support of education programs for preschoolers in poverty.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Native Americans are struggling to overcome increased drug abuse related to the COVID-19 pandemic, a tribal leader said in the annual State of the Tribes address. Speaking to Assembly lawmakers at the state Capitol on Tuesday afternoon, Lac du Flambeau President John Johnson Sr. said increased drug abuse has claimed those most vulnerable during the public health crisis. “The flow of drugs into the Northwoods has escalated during the pandemic, as mental health, economic and social challenges exert growing pressure on our people and families,” Johnson said. He said Gov. Tony Evers’ budget proposal for a regional mental health center in northern Wisconsin is “a crucial building block and a foundation of dismantling the scourge of drugs,” Wisconsin Public Radio reports. Evers has proposed investing more than $150 million in mental health services, including more than $25 million over the next two years for regional crisis centers, training and other services. Republican state lawmakers have stripped hundreds of proposals from the governor’s budget. Johnson also said tribes continue to face harassment and racism as they defend their federal treaty rights to hunt, fish and gather. He specifically highlighted harassment of those spearfishing in northern Wisconsin.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The governor has announced that the state will end its participation in federal supplemental benefits intended to address high unemployment across the U.S. caused by the pandemic. Republican Gov. Mark Gordon said Tuesday that the decision will end the weekly $300 payments starting June 19 and no longer expand eligibility to people who previously could not collect benefits, such as self-employed residents, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. The Wyoming Department of Workforce Services reported last month that the unemployment rate in the state was 5.3% in March – below the national 6% rate. “Wyoming needs workers; our businesses are raring to go,” Gordon said. “I recognize the challenges facing Wyoming employers, and I believe it’s critical for us to do what we can to encourage more hiring.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/05/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/07/anti-pipeline-push-lynyrd-skynyrd-gopher-frogs-news-around-states/118674524/", "title": "Anti-pipeline push, Lynyrd Skynyrd: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Gov. Kay Ivey on Friday reallocated $12.3 million of the state’s coronavirus relief funds to hire travel nurses to help hospitals overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients. The Republican governor announced the move as the state continues to see a surge in virus cases, straining hospital resources and staff. “I’m pleased to see more folks getting vaccinated, but we are still in the thick of COVID-19 and our hospitals are overwhelmed,” Ivey said in a statement. “The money is coming from the state’s share of CARES Act funds. Until our vaccination rates rise and our COVID-19 hospitalization rates fall, we will need the extra support these nurses provide.” The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated a nurse staffing crisis, sending U.S. hospitals into a competition for travel nurses and staff to handle the crush of patients this summer. Hospitals need more staff to handle the patient loads, while some nurses have left because they are exhausted, taken lucrative travel jobs or are out sick because they themselves are sick with COVID-19. Baptist Medical Center South in Montgomery, like hospitals across the country, has turned to travel staff to fill positions. “It’s a national arms race for clinical talent,” CEO Peter Selman, said. He said the hospital is paying up to $155 an hour to national staffing firms.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Residents in Wrangell and Petersburg now have the ability to text 911 for help when calling isn’t an option. “It’s been working out excellent,” Petersburg Police Department Chief James Kerr said. “It’s designed for the hearing impaired or domestic violence situations. If you can’t talk to the dispatch but you need help, you can text.” A third-party provider helped implement the technology with the two police departments. “One of the really big benefits I see with this is for search and rescue,” Kerr said, noting Alaska’s rugged terrain can make it difficult to get a call signal. “But you can send a text through. It gives us GPS coordinates and everything else.” The Juneau Police Department is also investigating a similar system, Lt. Krag Campbell said in an email to the Juneau Empire. He noted texting 911 could be useful in active shooter situations or other times when speaking into the phone would put a caller at risk, betraying their position. Currently, the option is only available to AT&T and GCI customers, Kerr said. Texters using other providers get a message that the service is not available. No one has texted police yet with it, other than kids trying to play a prank. But the text sent to emergency services also comes with the texter’s location, allowing police to arrive at the kids’ location and caution them not to misuse the service.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: The father of an elementary school student was arrested after he and two other men showed up to the campus with zip ties, threatening to make a “citizen’s arrest” on the principal over a coronavirus quarantine, school officials said Friday. Diane Vargo, principal of Mesquite Elementary School in Tucson, said the parent came to her office Thursday with his son in tow. The father was upset the child would have to isolate and miss a school field trip because of possible exposure to someone with COVID-19. She said two other men also “barged in.” One was carrying “military, large, black zip ties and standing in my doorway.” Vargo said she tried to deescalate the situation while explaining the school had to follow county health protocols. “I felt violated that they were in my office claiming I was breaking the law and they were going to arrest me,” a visibly shaken Vargo said in a video statement released by the Vail Unified School District. “Two of the men weren’t parents at our school, so I felt threatened.” In a video posted on social media, Vargo can be heard calmly asking them to leave. One of them replies they aren’t leaving because they’re not going to let her control the situation. The principal called Tucson police. School officials said the man arrested was the father. Vargo said they are pursuing charges against the other two men.\n\nArkansas\n\nParis: The Frontier’s Day festival returns to town Oct.2. Tonya Fletcher, executive director of the Paris Area Chamber of Commerce and organizer of the festival, described Frontier’s Day as “where yesterday meets today for today.” This year marks the 43rd year Paris has celebrated Frontier’s Day. Typically, the festival draws 3,000 to 4,000 people each year, but Fletcher said it is hard to say how many people the pandemic will keep at home. “I still think we’ll have a good crowd,” she said, allowing that it will likely be a smaller gathering than in the past. Frontier’s Day will officially begin at 9 a.m. and end at 4 p.m., but Paris will celebrate its monthly “First Fridays” music night the evening prior, wrapping at 11 p.m. For the festival, the city will block off three sides of the square, only leaving Highway 22 open to traffic. Frontier’s Day has fun activities lined up for all ages, Fletcher said. Children can roam the free pumpkin patch, where they can pick out pumpkins to decorate. There will be live music, and the day will begin with a parade and end with a pageant. During opening ceremonies, area historian Curtis Varnell will discuss the legacy of the Paris Courthouse, which turned 150 this year.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The mysterious deaths of a Northern California family of hikers and their dog have led federal officials to close 28 miles along the Merced River, where high levels of toxic algae were detected. The Bureau of Land Management closed campgrounds and recreation areas along the river, between the towns of Briceburg and Bagby, on Friday after receiving test results of water samples downstream from where the family died. Algal blooms can form in waterways that are shallow and warm. “These algal blooms can produce toxins that can make people and pets extremely sick,” Elizabeth Meyer-Shields, a BLM field manager, said in a statement. “We will continue to monitor for the algae’s presence and look forward to when the public can safely recreate in the Merced River.” The bodies of John Gerrish, his wife, Ellen Chung, their 1-year-old daughter, Miju, and their dog were found Aug. 17 on a hiking trail close to the river in the Sierra National Forest. A family friend had reported them missing. A cause of death has not been determined, and investigators are considering whether toxic algal blooms or other hazards may have contributed to the deaths. Toxicology reports are still pending, and investigators have ruled out any weapons being used or dangerous gases from a mine along the trail.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state’s nonpartisan redistricting commission has proposed a congressional map that would create a new swing seat in the northern Denver suburbs and lump conservative firebrand Rep. Lauren Boebert into a Boulder-based, solidly Democratic seat currently held by liberal Rep. Joe Neguse. The proposal from the commission staff Friday would rearrange the political geography as part of the once-a-decade redistricting process. It’s the first test of the commission model approved by voters in 2018. The map will be followed by a series of hearings, along with a map of state legislative districts. Both may change significantly in the weeks to come as the commission races to meet an end-of-the-month deadline to approve maps. The congressional map keeps the four Democratic seats relatively safe, as well as preserving three as solidly Republican. It would add a new swing seat running from Adams County to Greeley that voted Democratic by 1.9 percentage points in last year’s Senate election. That could make the final breakdown of the state’s congressional districts 4-4, an underwhelming split for Democrats in a state they won by 13 points in last year’s presidential election. Still, Democrats see the map as an improvement over the initial map, which had a similar partisan division.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Nursing homes will once again be allowed to hire temporary nursing aides as they deal with staffing shortages during the pandemic. Gov. Ned Lamont on Friday signed an executive order that revives the state’s nurses aides program that was used last year. Under the program, the temporary workers will be allowed to provide nursing-related services – but nothing that requires a license. The governor’s office said the idea is to use those aides to help serve residents who do not have COVID-19, allowing permanent staff to focus on patients who have tested positive for the coronavirus. The measure also will assure adequate staffing at long-term care facilities, which have struggled with hiring and retaining workers, the governor’s office said. Connecticut recorded 111 cases of COVID-19 among nursing home patients and 94 cases among staff between Aug. 18 and Aug. 31, according to the state Department of Health. There were 16 patient deaths related to the coronavirus during that time and none among staff. The governor on Friday also extended to Sept. 27 the deadline for nursing home workers to be vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Numerous Walgreens pharmacies across the state have been unable to process prescriptions because of flooding from the remnants of Hurricane Ida. The internet services vendor for the stores was affected by the historic flooding Thursday, bringing delays for people receiving vital medications. Walgreens has apologized for the inconvenience. The company said it is working to address the issues that have caused the delays. “Our internet services vendor is currently working to fully restore their operations as a result of the storms in the Northeast, which has resulted in some technical difficulties causing longer than normal wait times in several of our stores,” a Walgreens spokesperson said in an email over the weekend. “I ended up at the urgent care on Friday because my throat was starting to close due to an allergic reaction I had and couldn’t get my meds in time,” one person commented on a Facebook post about the issue from the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services. “This is an issue and delay of care that represent lives at risk.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A new art exhibit in the nation’s capital is remembering the twin towers, just ahead of the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. The show opened Saturday at the National Building Museum and features more than 50 years of photos of the World Trade Center, WUSA-TV reports. The images, all captured by photographer Camilo Jose Vergara, chart the history of the iconic towers from their construction to the attack that brought them down and what came next. “I closely followed the construction of the towers, watching heavy trucks bring in steel or haul away dirt amid the noise of jackhammers and clanging metal,” Vergara wrote in an essay accompanying the photographs. “As they rose to become the tallest buildings in the world, I regarded them as a wild expression of mistaken priorities in a troubled time. “Eventually, my early resentment faded, and I grew to see them as great human creations. As I traveled farther away to photograph the towers from distant boroughs, they seemed to lose their solidity and become mysterious, fantastic, and alluring.” Chrysanthe Broikos, a consulting curator at the National Building Museum, said she hopes the exhibit inspires visitors to think about what the towers and those who worked there meant to the world, as well as how the world responded when they fell.\n\nFlorida\n\nJacksonville: The store that inspired Lynyrd Skynyrd’s “The Ballad of Curtis Loew” has been demolished. Jacksonville’s Woodcrest Grocery Building, where Ronnie Van Zant allegedly met “the finest picker to ever play the blues,” was torn down late last month. The abandoned store was a hangout for generations of kids. The song, written by Van Zant and Allen Collins, tells the story of a young boy who collected bottles to raise money so the old man who hung out at the corner store could play his dobro. Curtis Loew was fictional, but the store was real. It was known as Claude’s in the late ’50s and early ’60s and was right down the street from the house where Van Zant was raised. Scott Hill, who grew up in the neighborhood, said fans started dropping by the site last week to grab cinder blocks as souvenirs after hearing about the demolition. Gene Odom, who wrote a book about the band and leads tours of Lynyrd Skynyrd landmarks for fans, said the building has been vacant for decades. The building started collapsing during the demolition of nearby trailers and had to be taken down. A real estate group said a residential home will be built there. The band is still touring but pulled out of the Pro Football Hall of Fame concert last month after guitarist Rickey Medlocke tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Morehouse College announced Friday that it has canceled this year’s homecoming festivities due to a surge of COVID-19. Events were scheduled to occur Oct. 10-17 and will not be rescheduled. The Oct. 16 football game against Fort Valley State University will still be played but without the “homecoming” designation and with fewer tickets available to the game to implement social distancing. University officials said they made the decision last week as Georgia broke its record for COVID-19 hospitalizations. “The state has the sixth-highest per capita infection rate in the nation, and an unprecedented number of young people have become ill with the virus,” Morehouse President David Thomas said. “Given the circumstances, a massive in-person gathering on our campus presents a public health risk to our students which is impossible to ignore.” Thomas said nearly 100% of the students and employees on campus have met the school’s vaccination requirement. With “aggressive” masking requirements and other safety protocols, Morehouse has limited the spread of the coronavirus on campus, he said. But he had to consider the broader community. “Keeping our students safe is our top priority,” he said. In place of homecoming, the school will host a students-only fall festival.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: President Joe Biden’s appointment of two Native Hawaiians to the U.S. Department of the Interior could influence federal policy for the state’s Indigenous people and other Pacific Islanders. Summer Sylva, who is currently head of the Native Hawaiian Legal Corporation, was appointed last week as senior adviser for Native Hawaiian affairs. Keone Nakoa, the Washington, D.C., bureau chief for the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, has been appointed deputy assistant secretary for insular and international affairs. The positions carry a great deal of influence over federal policy involving Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, Hawaii Public Radio reports. Sylva will report directly to Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American to lead the agency. “She’s in a critical role to be in the secretary’s inner circle,” said Esther Kia’aina, a Honolulu City councilwoman who led the department’s Office of Insular Affairs under former President Barack Obama’s administration. Sylva’s appointment signals the agency’s desire to tackle Native Hawaiian issues, including homelands and self-governance, Kia’aina said. Nakoa will be serving in an office that oversees the U.S. territories of American Samoa, Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: State officials are boosting pay and offering bonuses to try to attract and maintain correctional officers. About 24% of correctional officer positions at the Idaho Department of Correction were vacant last month, including 190 vacancies at the agency’s prisons in Kuna, south of Boise. “Attracting and hiring the right people to our security ranks is only one part of the equation,” Jeff Ray, the department’s public information officer, told the Idaho Press. “We’re putting an equal amount of emphasis on retaining the staff who have and continue to admirably serve the people of Idaho.” New correctional officers will receive $19 an hour, up from the previous $16.75. New hires will also get $1,500 bonuses and be eligible for $1,500 yearly retention bonuses during their first five years. Current employees will see hourly raises ranging from $0.75 for wardens to $2.25 for correctional officers starting Sept. 5. Also, on Oct. 15, all current correctional officers will receive a one-time retention bonus of $1,500. Correctional officers often must work mandatory 16-hour shifts because there aren’t enough workers. Department of Correction Director Josh Tewalt said the pay Idaho offers correctional workers isn’t competitive with surrounding states, such as an Oregon prison paying new correctional officers $22.64 an hour.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Years in the making, the visitor center and state historic site grounds at the Pullman National Monument have officially opened to the public. Chicago’s first national monument marks the site where Pullman passenger railroad cars were built. Employees lived nearby in the neighborhood on the city’s South Side. The sprawling Pullman company factory closed in 1982. The National Park Services’ visitor center features exhibits on worker demonstrations that helped plant the seeds of the modern labor movement. For instance, Black railroad workers won a significant labor agreement in the 1930s that helped lead to worker protections. Robert Bushwaller, a Historic Pullman Foundation board member, said he was encouraged by the crowd Saturday. Some drove vintage cars to mark the opening day during the Labor Day weekend. “The public support has been better than expected,” Bushwaller told the Chicago Sun-Times. “The turnout is tremendous. They remember so much from how it used to be and want to see if it still tasted that way, and they’ve been satisfied.” Former President Barack Obama designated the factory and surrounding area a national monument in 2015. Restoration and revitalization at the site has been ongoing for years.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Gov. Eric Holcomb issued seven pardons to convicted criminals during his first year in office but hasn’t granted any more pardons in the past 31/ 2 years, with officials saying the number of applications for the governor to clear criminal records has declined to a trickle, The (Fort Wayne) Journal Gazette reports. Indiana’s expansive expungement law – first passed by the Legislature in 2013 – has meant fewer people seeking pardons, as that process of asking a judge to clear past convictions is both simpler and more private, said Charles Miller, vice chairman of the Indiana Parole Board. “Quite frankly, I knew the numbers were way down, but even I was shocked by just how low they were,” Miller said. “Speaking personally, pardons are the best part of my job, as you get to the good things people accomplish after what is usually just an unfortunate mistake.” The pardons Holcomb issued in 2017 were largely holdovers from when Mike Pence was governor. The most prominent case was that of Keith Cooper, whose pardon request over his conviction for a 1996 robbery in Elkhart languished under Pence even as the state parole board, the local prosecutor and witnesses supported his exoneration.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: The University of Iowa’s graduate student workers union is calling for stronger on-campus mitigation protocols against the coronavirus. The union members sent a list of demands to the UIowa administration and state’s Board of Regents in a letter dated Sept. 1 and followed that up Thursday morning with a “die-in” protest on the Pentacrest to draw attention to their plea. Demands include more remote work options, a mask mandate inside campus buildings, and required COVID-19 vaccinations or mandatory weekly virus testing of unvaccinated people, none of which are currently in place. The union represents about 250 members and 1,800 in the collective bargaining unit. Members hold a unique position at the university, as they are there not only to learn but to teach classes. Members of the organization approved the list of demands before it was sent out. “We are very concerned for our health and safety this fall,” the letter said. “We are deeply disturbed by the obligation we face to share spaces with others who may be putting us at risk, or whom we may be placing in danger, because of inconsistent vaccination and the optional status of mask wearing and social distancing on campus.” About two dozen people gathered on campus at 10 a.m. Thursday for the “die-in.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly has placed 87 of the state’s 105 counties under a drought watch or warning. Kelly said Thursday that most of the state has been in drought or abnormally dry conditions for several weeks, and she encouraged residents to do what the can to minimize the risk of fire. Fourteen counties were placed under a drought warning and 73 under a watch. The 18 counties not included in the declaration are all in southeast Kansas. The action was recommended by Connie Owen, director of the Kansas Water Office and chairwoman of the Governor’s Drought Response Team. Kelly said in a statement that while some areas have had normal or higher amounts of rain so far this year, counties in the northwest, central and south-central have received less than 60% of their normal precipitation. Owen said future outlooks call for the drought-like conditions to continue into the fall, particularly in the northwest counties.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Tucked into the pandemic-heavy agenda for a special legislative session is a request to strengthen Kentucky’s negotiating hand in trying to reel in mega-sized economic development projects. Gov. Andy Beshear said Saturday that he will ask the GOP-led Legislature to give the state’s recruiting team more flexibility in offering incentives for investment projects topping $2 billion. “As we sit here today, we have at least five potential projects that would be that size,” Beshear told reporters. “In other words, the largest in our commonwealth’s history.” The Democratic governor announced Saturday that he’s calling lawmakers back to the statehouse for a special session that begins Tuesday and will be dominated by coronavirus-related issues. After winning a legal battle against Beshear, lawmakers will take the lead in crafting policies to respond to a recent surge of COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations, fueled by the delta variant of the virus. But Beshear is hoping the work on economic development policy helps put the state at the front of the pack in trying to land $2 billion-plus projects. Such a massive development would be certain to create loads of new jobs, with plenty of spin-off opportunities for even more job growth.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Families looking for their loved ones who evacuated from Hurricane Ida to a state shelter are getting help from the state. The Louisiana Department of Children and Family Services on Saturday launched “Connect,” a tool that will help families connect with each other. The number to call is 225-342-2727. Families can also fill out a form online to reach out to loved ones who may be in state-run shelter. The department said people will be required to provide the name, address and date of birth, if known, of the person they’re trying to find, as well as their name and contact information. DCFS will then determine whether the person is in one of the state’s congregate shelters and, if so, pass along the caller’s message. Individuals looking for loved ones evacuated from one of seven nursing homes linked to an evacuation warehouse site in Tangipahoa Parish should call 211, the department said.\n\nMaine\n\nOxford: The state is continuing to try to slow the spread of the invasive emerald ash borer with new restrictions. The Maine Forest Service has issued an emergency order preventing the movement of ash trees and products from areas including Norway, Oxford and Lovell in Oxford County. The order limits the movement of ash trees for planting and ash tree products such as logs, pulpwood, lumber and firewood from areas that are considered likely to harbor the pest. The new areas are in addition to areas already covered by a quarantine. The state’s ban on untreated firewood from outside Maine remains in effect as another way of preventing the pest’s spread.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Nursing homes in the state are seeing another rise in coronavirus cases, leading facilities to suspend visits from loved ones. The Washington Post reports the halt to visitations has led to a new wave of despair in facilities that were struck hard by COVID-19. The impact of loneliness on the health of the elderly has been extreme. Maryland has 227 nursing homes. Gov. Larry Hogan had ordered that all nursing home employees receive at least one vaccine dose by last week. Facilities that fail to comply will be subject to fines. The percentage of employees who have received a vaccine dose is 82%. At the same time, nearly 90% of all nursing home residents have had at least one vaccine dose, and 86.1% are fully inoculated. Meanwhile, outbreaks are rising in Maryland’s nursing homes. Outbreaks are defined by the federal government as at least one COVID-19 case. In July, fewer than 10 facilities had an outbreak. But by early August, there were 33. On Friday, there were 92.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSalem: What started as a project to restore the gravestones of three Black men and women who played a role in the abolitionist movement on the North Shore is evolving into a larger effort to find and restore the final resting places for other African American families, officials said. In Salem’s Howard Street Cemetery, two of the stones marking the burial sites of Venus Chew, Prince Farmer and Samuel Payne, all of whom died in the 1850s, are broken into pieces, The Salem News reports. The graves to be restored are in what Rachel Meyer, a stone conservator with Epoch Preservation, described as a corner of the cemetery, effectively segregated from the main cemetery. They occupy a square piece of land the city donated to expand the cemetery to bury African Americans. The three stones in question have fallen over in time and were sinking into the ground when an area resident contacted Meyer about fixing them. Doreen Wade, president of Salem United, said she’s enthusiastically behind the project because of what it represents – more than just repairing fragmented gravestones, it’s repairing a fragmented story of Salem’s past.\n\nMichigan\n\nFlat Rock: A Ford plant is the source of benzene vapor in sewers that forced the evacuation of 10 homes and a school in the Detroit suburb of Flat Rock, according to state and company officials. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy confirmed Friday that the source of the flammable vapor is a fuel leak at the Ford Flat Rock Assembly Plant. “HAZMAT technicians will begin mitigating flammable vapors in the municipal sanitary system by injecting fire suppressant foam. These activities will take place at various locations where levels of benzene have been detected in a 4-square-mile perimeter of Flat Rock,” the department said. Ford on Wednesday discovered “what originally looked to be a relatively small leak in a pipe that carries gasoline used to fuel vehicles built at the plant,” said Bob Holycross, Ford’s vice president of sustainability, environment and safety engineering. But on Friday, the company “determined that the scale of the fuel leak was much larger and that Ford is the likely source of the problem in Flat Rock, for which we apologize,” he said. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy said in an email late Friday that an estimated 1,000 to 3,000 gallons of unleaded gasoline spilled into the sewers.\n\nMinnesota\n\nBemidji: Four congressional Democrats who are part of the progressive “Squad” and want President Joe Biden to stop construction of the Enbridge Line 3 oil pipeline traveled to the shores of the Mississippi River to make their plea. Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Cori Bush of Missouri, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan spent the holiday weekend visiting Bemidji and other parts of northern Minnesota to speak with members of Indigenous communities and others who have been protesting the project. Line 3 starts in Alberta and clips a corner of North Dakota before crossing Minnesota en route to Enbridge’s terminal in Superior, Wisconsin. The 337-mile line in Minnesota is the last step in replacing the deteriorating pipeline that was built in the 1960s. “We have been encouraged by Joe Biden’s boldness so far,” Omar said, referencing his January decision to cancel a border-crossing permit for the Keystone XL pipeline that would have carried oil from Canada to Nebraska. “Now we have another chance to reject a moving pipeline. We hope you will act.” Minnesota Republican legislators condemned the visit, which they said “will only serve to incite the obstructionists,” the Star Tribune reports.\n\nMississippi\n\nMoney: A historical marker describing the events leading up to the killing of Emmett Till was knocked down just days after the 66th anniversary of his death. The black Mississippi Freedom Trail marker with gold writing typically stands in front of the remains of Bryant’s Grocery and Meat Market, where, in 1955, the Black 14-year-old was accused of whistling at a white woman. Till was later kidnapped, beaten and killed. The sign is part of the Mississippi Freedom Trail, a route dedicated to honoring people and places in the state that had a significant role in the civil rights movement. Allan Hammons, president of Hammons and Associates, which manages the Freedom Trail, said a large vehicle like a tractor-trailer likely accidently knocked the marker from its post. The area is under construction, and Hammons suspects the driver of the vehicle may have not even realized they hit the sign. The marker was picked up by workers with the LeFlore County road department and stored in a storage facility until Hammons can inspect it. The Emmett Till Interpretive Center tweeted Thursday that it believes someone ran the sign down with a vehicle and removed it. The sign details how Till stopped by the store for candy before his abduction and death.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Republican Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft is urging the General Assembly to prohibit local election workers from helping absentee voters correct mistakes, a move that would mean some votes aren’t counted. “We would like to see legislation that does not allow for curing of absentee ballots,” Deputy Secretary of State Trish Vincent told the House Elections Committee last week. “Curing” is a common term for fixing errors. The Kansas City Star reports the request adds to a growing list of measures advanced by Republicans to alter the state’s elections, including restoring a photo ID requirement and making it harder to amend the state constitution through voter-initiated ballot measures. Some similar proposals failed this year but could be considered again in the 2022 session. During the COVID-19 pandemic last year, Missouri lawmakers temporarily made all voters eligible to cast a ballot by mail but required most to have their ballot notarized. Missouri previously required an excuse for voting absentee. More than 28% of Missouri voters cast ballots by mail in November, up from 8% in 2018. “I don’t think we’re going to go back to the mail-in like we did during COVID,” said Republican Rep. Dan Shaul of Imperial, chairman of the House Elections Committee.\n\nMontana\n\nWest Glacier: Wildlife workers at Glacier National Park trapped and killed a black bear that officials said became a public safety risk after it lingered around a campground. The bear took apples from an open vehicle trunk while visitors were nearby at the Many Glacier Campground, officials said. It kept returning despite park staff attempts to scare it away. It was later trapped near a housing area in a large trap made out of a culvert and was euthanized Thursday. The female bear was about 4 years old and 120 pounds, park officials said. It’s believed to be the same bear that had been approaching people near Glacier’s Grinnell Lake the week prior, prompting the closure of a trail. A necropsy showed the animal had been in healthy condition. But officials said it had become used to getting human food and was unlikely to break the habit. They said it could not be relocated due to safety concerns.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: State education officials halted their plans Friday for new health education standards after criticism from some parents and conservative family-values groups that the content was sexually inappropriate. The State Board of Education voted 5-1 to indefinitely postpone the standards, with one member abstaining, according to the Omaha World-Herald. The standards were nonbinding recommendations, so local schools could simply have ignored them, but opponents still railed against the proposal. The new resolution the board passed says members will determine an appropriate time to address health education standards after considering the status of the pandemic and the needs of local children, schools and communities. Under board rules, any member can attempt to revive the process with support from the majority. The first draft released in March faced strong opposition, as did a second draft released in July, despite removal of many topics opponents disliked. The initial draft called for teaching children as young as first grade about gender identity and gender stereotypes and older children about homophobia, transphobia, and vaginal, oral and anal sex. Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts blasted the draft, saying it was developed with input from activists and promoted “gender ideology.”\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A federal judge has denied tribal leaders’ bid to temporarily block digging for an archaeological study required before construction can begin for a lithium mine on what they say is sacred land where their ancestors were massacred more than century ago. U.S. District Judge Miranda Du refused three tribes’ request for a preliminary injunction blocking the trenching planned to collect samples near the Oregon state line at the site of the largest known lithium deposit in the United States. The tribes say their ancestors were massacred in the late 1800s at the proposed Thacker Pass site. Du emphasized in the ruling late Friday in Reno that she has pledged to hear and rule on the merits of the case before Lithium Nevada Corp. hopes to begin construction early next year on the mine the U.S. Bureau of Land Management approved in January. She rejected a similar request in July for a preliminary injunction sought by environmentalists who claim the digging would destroy critical habitat for greater sage grouse. Du said Friday that she was “not unpersuaded by the tribes’ broader equitable and historical arguments.” But she said that there was no evidence the bureau acted unreasonably, nor that the mine was planned on an actual massacre site, and the agency has contingency plans if “human remains are unexpectedly discovered.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu was released from the hospital Saturday after tests confirmed Friday that a bleeding ulcer was the cause of his flu-like symptoms. The Republican will continue to recuperate at home, according to a statement from his office. “New Hampshire is blessed with amazing health care staff and generous blood donors,” Sununu said in the statement. “Valerie and I can’t thank them enough and are grateful for everyone’s prayers and positive outreach.” Sununu was admitted to Portsmouth Hospital on Friday after experiencing the flu-like symptoms since Wednesday. He had tested negative three times for the coronavirus. Sununu said Wednesday that he tested negative, hours after his office said he wasn’t feeling well, postponed a meeting and began isolating. Sununu, 46, is fully vaccinated against COVID-19. He received the single-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine April 10.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nMullica Hill: One of the most intense tornadoes recorded in New Jersey history all but demolished the state’s largest dairy farm. When Marianne and Wally Eachus, the owners of Wellacrest Farms, came out of their basement along with other family on their homestead, they saw that two of their massive grain silos had toppled over. Some barns were completely reduced to concrete, with roofs ripped off others, equipment demolished and uprooted trees crashed into the old farmhouse. “There was just metal, wood, debris, everywhere,” Marianne Eachus said. Hundreds of cows were trapped under collapsed barns. Thirteen have died; a couple dozen more suffered injuries. A crew was milking when the twister ripped through and had only seconds to hide and hold on. They saw several cows swallowed by the funnel. Up to 100 cows were still missing Monday. Somehow, there were no more deaths on the dairy farm from the EF3 tornado spawned by the remnants of Hurricane Ida. But the storm produced historic rain and massive flooding. Wellacrest Farms produces more than 17 million pounds of milk annually and works with other farmers to share and sell crops. There are 1,400 cows on the property. In the days after the destruction, the Eachus family has seen an outpouring of support and help, both physical and financial.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A group of Democrats in the state House has outlined a package of criminal justice bills intended to combat crime that includes penalties for failing to safely store guns, enhanced pay for police, and changes in the pretrial supervision and bail system. A record-setting number of homicides in Albuquerque this year is spurring concerns about violent crime and shortcomings of the police and justice system. In a statement Thursday, 17 House Democrats announced a lengthy list of goals for the next regular legislative session in January. Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has said she’ll put criminal justice initiatives on the agenda for the 30-day session that is confined to budget negotiations and a few additional governor-picked topics. Republican lawmakers are asking the Legislature to reconsider a long list of their recent crime bills that were rejected. House Democrats listed legislative goals in 16 bullet points. To address gun violence, the legislators want to place new restrictions on high-capacity magazines and establish an office of gun violence prevention. Enhanced penalties are part of the plan. Democrats want a longer statute of limitations on second-degree murder charges and tougher sanctions. A crackdown is proposed on property damage in the theft of copper and catalytic converters in automobiles.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A staff shortage at Rikers Island left two units without corrections officers for more than 24 hours last Tuesday and Wednesday, a prisoner reported, and a city oversight board said ongoing personnel problems factored in a wave of suicides in the jails since December. Two Rikers units were without corrections officers through at least through noon Wednesday, leaving inmates in the strange position of helping other inmates get to court transport and video conferences, said Terrence Ferguson, the hip-hop artist known as 2 Milly. “We are really running the dorm by ourselves. I’ve never seen anything like this,” said Ferguson, who is serving a sentence for gun possession. He said Wednesday that there had been no officer on his floor since 6 a.m. Tuesday. “I’ve been answering the phones,” he said. The two unmanned units together house about 80 prisoners. Department of Correction officials declined comment on whether parts of Rikers have gone unguarded for longer than 24 hours. But the department has acknowledged a personnel shortage. Officials have said that in July, about 3,500 of Rikers’ 8,500 officers either called in sick or were medically exempt from working with detainees. Another 2,300 just didn’t come in to work at some point. Rikers’ population has roughly doubled since July 2019.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: A gay substitute teacher was wrongfully fired by a Roman Catholic school after he announced in 2014 on social media that he was going to marry his longtime partner, a federal judge has ruled. U.S. District Judge Max Cogburn ruled Friday that Charlotte Catholic High School and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Charlotte violated Lonnie Billard’s federal protections against against sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Cogburn granted summary judgment to Billard and said a trial must still be held to determine appropriate relief for him. “After all this time, I have a sense of relief and a sense of vindication. I wish I could have remained teaching all this time,” Billard said in a statement released Friday by the ACLU, which represented him in court. “Today’s decision validates that I did nothing wrong by being a gay man.” Billard taught English and drama full time at the school for more than a decade, earning its Teacher of the Year award in 2012. He then transitioned to a role as a regular substitute, according to his 2017 lawsuit. The defendants said they fired Billard not because he was gay but because “he engaged in ‘advocacy’ that went against the Catholic Church’s beliefs” when he publicly announced his engagement to another man, the ruling said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The idea to split the state’s legislative districts in half for House seats hasn’t gained traction with lawmakers, but some voters groups say the concept would benefit tribal nations that don’t have enough residents to stand alone as legislative districts. The Legislature’s Redistricting Committee meets Wednesday in Fargo as the state continues to examine redrawing legislative districts. Sen. Ray Holmberg, R-Grand Forks, who has served on redistricting committees since 1981, told the Bismarck Tribune splitting legislative districts would have to take into account tribal nations, and “that would make a difference according to how the Department of Justice views taking care of minority populations ... so we need to explore that, and it may happen,” Holmberg said. North Dakota Native Vote Executive Director Nicole Donaghy said subdistricts would allow “people on reservations to elect candidates of their choice.” She said in the past decade there have been elections encompassing the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in which “we’ve had several Native Americans run for county commission, run for a legislative seat for that district, and they were not able to be elected because of the dilution of the populations with the non-Native population that surrounds the reservation.”\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A Butler County judge has ruled that West Chester Hospital cannot be compelled to administer ivermectin to a COVID-19 patient. Common Pleas Court Judge Michael Oster Jr. issued the ruling Monday morning as a 14-day temporary injunction granted by another judge expired. Ivermectin is an antiparasitic treatment commonly used for livestock and recommended by the FDA to treat “infections caused by some parasitic worms” in humans, as well as head lice and rosacea. Interest in the drug as a COVID-19 treatment has spiked, fueled by endorsements from allies of former President Donald Trump and some Fox News personalities. While some studies are underway, none of the major medical organizations recommend the drug as a treatment for COVID-19, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control has warned that reports of poisoning related to ivermectin have increased threefold this year. The judge said it is “impossible not to feel sympathetic” for Julie Smith, the guardian for her husband, Jeffrey Smith, 51. He’s been in the hospital since July 15, according to court documents. But the judge wrote that he must leave emotions out of the decision and must also consider the rights of the hospital and the impact that forcing a hospital to give a drug could have.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The city is paying $2million to settle a former death row inmate’s federal lawsuit over his 1988 conviction for two murders. Robert Lee Miller Jr. was set free in 1998 after DNA tests implicated a convicted rapist in the deaths. Miller sued in 2019 after an Oklahoma County judge ruled he had presented sufficient evidence to establish “a prima facie case of actual innocence of the crimes.” He had sought $95 million in compensatory and punitive damages. A jury trial had been set for January. He dismissed the case Friday after the Oklahoma City Council agreed 6-0 to the $2 million settlement. The city did not admit wrongdoing. “It was a tragedy from Day One,” said his attorney, Mark H. Barrett, of Norman. “If they had got DNA done before he got tried instead of afterward, all this would have been a very different story.” Miller, 62, has talked about using the settlement to start his own house-building business, Barrett said. In the lawsuit, the attorney complained that Oklahoma City police detectives used “bizarre, unreliable and coercive techniques” in their interrogations to fabricate a case against Miller. His attorney also blamed disgraced police chemist Joyce Gilchrist for Miller’s conviction and accused the city of condoning her shoddy, unreliable and fraudulent work.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A federal judge has ordered the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to take immediate action to improve fish passage at dams in the Willamette Basin. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports that in a final opinion and order issued last week, U.S. District Judge Marco Hernandez said the Corps had for years failed to provide adequate passage for threatened chinook salmon and winter steelhead trout at dams it operates in the basin. “As evinced by the listed species’ continuing decline, the Corps’ failure to provide adequate fish passage and mitigate water quality issues is causing substantial, irreparable harm to the salmonids,” Hernandez wrote in the opinion. The order comes after the court decided in favor of three environmental organizations that sued the Corps and the National Marine Fisheries Service, arguing the agencies weren’t doing their part to protect the species. Chinook salmon and steelhead in the Upper Willamette River system are both listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Dams on the Willamette and its tributaries have blocked access to spawning grounds for the fish, contributing to population declines.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The Republican leader of the state Senate and a group of parents filed a lawsuit Friday seeking to overturn the Wolf administration’s new mask mandate for schools. The governor’s spokesperson dismissed what she called the GOP’s “effort at undermining public heath.” The suit, filed in Commonwealth Court, asserts that Acting Health Secretary Alison Beam failed to comply with state law when she ordered masks to be worn in all Pennsylvania public and private schools, as well as child care facilities. The masking order isn’t valid because it didn’t go through the state’s regulatory review process, the lawsuit said. It also accused the Wolf administration of trying to circumvent newly approved constitutional amendments limiting a governor’s emergency powers. “The Secretary of Health’s order subjects healthy, non-infected teachers, children, students, staff, and visitors ... to the wearing of face coverings,” the suit said. The plaintiffs, it said, are “not patients, they are heathy, non-infected children.” The parents said in affidavits that they intend to send their children to school without masks, claiming Beam’s order is illegal. The lawsuit seeks an injunction against the masking order. The court scheduled a hearing for Sept. 16.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Nineteen fire departments are getting a total of $5.5 million in federal grants that can be used to buy new equipment and upgrade training to enhance public safety, the state’s congressional delegation said. “These grants will help lift the budgetary burden on local governments and better protect the health and safety of the public and firefighters,” Sen. Jack Reed said in a statement Friday. The Warwick Fire Department is getting the largest chunk of the grant money, including almost $900,000 for an aerial ladder truck and more than $100,000 for portable radio equipment. The East Providence Fire Department is getting more than $800,000 for paramedic training. The Newport Fire Department is receiving more than $400,000 for portable radio units, mobile repeaters and associated communications equipment. The Federal Emergency Management Agency grants are also going to departments and fire districts in Bristol; Central Falls; East Greenwich; Johnston; Lincoln; Narragansett; North Kingstown; Pascoag; Portsmouth; Providence; Prudence Island; the Rhode Island Firefighting Academy in Exeter; West Warwick; and Woonsocket.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Wildlife scientists and Riverbanks Zoo are teaming up to save endangered gopher frogs. The survival rate of the eggs and tadpoles for the frogs is extremely low, so the Department of Natural Resources finds the eggs in Lowcountry wetlands, and the zoo raises them in captivity. “It’s a matter of how we can best use our strengths for species conservation,” Natural Resources herpetologist Andrew Grosse said in a statement. Wildlife scientists are also working to restore habitat for gopher frogs so that the eggs and tadpoles have a better chance at survival when they are returned to the wild, Grosse said. The frogs live in longleaf pines and are a good indicator at the health of that environmental system. “They have a very complex life history and highly specialized habitat requirements,” Grosse said. “All of the pieces must be in place and functioning at a high level to support these fragile populations.” Several hundred frogs have been saved through the South Carolina program and similar efforts in North Carolina, Alabama and Georgia, officials said. The project is attempting to keep the frogs off the federal endangered species list. Scientists are calling it “Head Start” since it gives the frogs a head start at surviving.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem wants to pass tougher abortion restrictions after the U.S. Supreme Court allowed a Texas law banning most abortions in that state to go forward. The Texas law, which took effect Wednesday, prohibits abortions once medical professionals can detect cardiac activity, usually around six weeks and before many women know they’re pregnant. “Following the Supreme Court’s decision to leave the pro-life (Texas) law in place, I have directed the Unborn Child Advocate in my office to immediately review the new (Texas) law and current South Dakota laws to make sure we have the strongest pro life laws on the books in (South Dakota),” Noem said in a statement on social media Thursday. Women in South Dakota are currently barred from terminating a pregnancy after 22 weeks. Noem has previously said she wants to ban abortions completely, with no exceptions in cases of rape or incest. The Texas law authorizes private citizens to sue abortion providers and anyone involved in aiding an abortion, including someone who drives a woman to a clinic. The law is being challenged by Planned Parenthood and other groups. The American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota has vowed to push back against more abortion restrictions.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order late Friday blocking Gov. Bill Lee from allowing parents to opt out of school mask requirements in Shelby County. U.S. District Judge Sheryl Lipman issued the temporary restraining order for the county’s schools after it was sought by the parents of two children with health problems. The parents argued in a federal lawsuit filed the week prior that the Republican governor endangered students with health conditions and hurt their ability to attend in-person classes by allowing parents to opt out of a mask mandate via an executive order. The temporary restraining order remains in effect until Sept. 17. The students attend school in the Memphis suburbs of Collierville and Germantown, which began classes Aug. 9 under a universal mask requirement issued by the Shelby County Health Department. Lee resisted implementing a statewide mask mandate for schools, and he had initially left the decision to local officials. But on Aug. 16, he signed a statewide order allowing parents to opt out of the requirement for nonmedical reasons. Hundreds of students have been attending classes without masks ever since. The parents’ lawsuit claims Lee’s order violates the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: A judge has temporarily shielded some abortion clinics from being sued by the state’s largest anti-abortion group under a new law banning most abortions. The temporary restraining order was issued Friday by District Judge Maya Guerra Gamble in Austin in response to a Planned Parenthood request. Although the law remains in effect, the judge’s order shields Planned Parenthood’s clinics, specifically, from whistleblower lawsuits by the nonprofit group Texas Right to Life, its legislative director and people working in concert with the group. A hearing on a preliminary injunction request is scheduled for Sept. 13. The law, which took effect Wednesday, prohibits abortions once medical professionals can detect cardiac activity, usually around the sixth week of pregnancy and before some women realize they’re pregnant. The law also leaves enforcement to private citizens through lawsuits instead of to prosecutors through criminal charges. Planned Parenthood said in a statement Friday that the law was “already decimating abortion access in the state, as providers are forced to turn people away” once cardiac activity can be detected. It said historically, 85% to 90% of women who have gotten abortions in Texas were at least six weeks into their pregnancies.\n\nUtah\n\nFarmington: A paraplegic man who was injured on a roller coaster is now suing an amusement park, saying his paralyzed leg wasn’t properly secured while he was on the ride, and his foot was shredded. The Salt Lake Tribune reports Matthew Christensen filed the lawsuit against Lagoon Amusement Park on Thursday in Davis County’s 3rd District Court. The lawsuit said Christensen’s ligament in his big toe was “irreparably shredded,” and he suffered fractures to his lower leg, toe, and two other foot bones. A spokesman for the theme park in Farmington, north of Salt Lake City, said he couldn’t speculate on the facts of the incident, which are under investigation. “The ride in question has a lap restraint similar to others used throughout the amusement industry,” Adam Leishman said. Christensen is paralyzed from the waist down and was using a wheelchair at the park during an October 2020 visit with his family and a friend. Christensen’s son and friend helped transfer him from the wheelchair to the roller coaster car. According to the lawsuit, Christensen had the lap restraint secured correctly, but his right leg was not secured properly by the leg restraint, which caused the man’s paralyzed leg to dangle below, and he was injured when it got caught in the platform.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The first two years of a state program set up to keep patients healthier while reducing costs saved money on Medicare patients and kept more people out of the hospital, an evaluation of the program has found. The report commissioned by the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services and released last week looked at the first two years of Medicare participation in Vermont in what is known as the all-payer model of health care. The report found that in 2018 and 2019, the costs for Medicare patients in the system being studied saved about 4.7% from the previous year. For all of Vermont’s Medicare patients, the system saved about 6.5% over the previous year. In 2019 the system reduced by almost 18% acute care hospital stays by people in the system. It reduced the acute care days patients stayed in the hospital by 14.7% and reduced the number of people being readmitted to the hospital within 30 days by 12.4%. “Those declines are very encouraging,” Ena Backus, Vermont’s director of Health Care Reform, said Friday. The same report found the project run by the organization OneCare Vermont has not signed up as many people to participate in the system as had been hoped. In 2019 it had been hoped the program would be covering 75% of eligible Medicare patients, but it reached only 47%.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Curbside recycling pickup for some in the area has been delayed by labor shortages exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic and the hot weather. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports the Central Virginia Waste Management Authority has warned customers that shortages of drivers and other waste workers could cause delays. The authority oversees waste and recycling collection in 13 local jurisdictions. The authority said Friday that residential recycling pickups that normally occur on Thursdays in a number of areas have been delayed for at least a week. TFC Recycling, a Chesapeake-based company that performs collections for about 265,000 residences in the authority’s jurisdiction, said pandemic-related labor shortages also affecting other businesses have made it harder to hire and retain drivers and other workers. The summer heat has made it even harder to find people to do the hands-on work. “In the last several months, we have had some real issues trying to recruit and maintain drivers – not only drivers but helpers, too,” said Tad Phillips, general manager of TFC’s Richmond-area operations, told the newspaper. Hiring has also become harder as package delivery companies compete for some of the same workers for their trucks as people turn to online ordering during the pandemic.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Days after suing to block what is believed to be among the nation’s strictest COVID-19 employee vaccine mandates, Washington’s largest state labor union has announced a tentative agreement for Gov. Jay Inslee’s order for state workers. The Northwest News Network reports the Washington Federation of State Employees has negotiated terms for Inslee’s mandate that all 46,000 of its union members be fully vaccinated by Oct. 18 or lose their jobs. The Democratic governor issued the order in August, citing the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus. The union countered with a labor complaint, claiming Inslee’s administration was bargaining in bad faith. The new agreement, which still needs to be ratified, was announced Saturday and defines the exceptions and religious and medical exemptions process for employees who can’t or won’t get their shots. “This agreement is a victory for both public health and due process,” WFSE said in a statement. “It puts in place a fair, equitable and consistent process for members seeking a legitimate exemption to the mandate.” Anyone who is eligible to retire by the end of the year can forgo the vaccine if they use accrued or unpaid leave until they reach their retirement date.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state had one of its worst weeks of the coronavirus pandemic as the number of newly confirmed cases neared a seven-day record. The 6,705 confirmed statewide cases for the six days ending Saturday already surpassed the previous week’s total and were the fourth-highest for any week since the first case was reported in the state in March 2020, according to state health data. The record is nearly 8,200 confirmed cases for the week ending Jan. 10, followed by about 7,600 cases the week ending Jan. 3. The number of COVID-19 patients in hospital intensive care units was 216, just shy of the record 219 set on Jan. 6. On July 4, there were only 17 virus patients in hospital ICUs across the state. And the number of patients on hospital ventilators has surpassed the previous high of 104 set Jan. 10.\n\nWisconsin\n\nJunction City: The state’s cranberry crop is expected to end up being about average – or maybe even above average – by the time harvest begins in about a month. The U.S. Cranberry Marketing Committee forecast in August that Wisconsin growers will produce 4.92 million barrels this year. But Wisconsin Cranberry Growers Association Executive Director Tom Lochner said this year’s estimated crop is closer to the state’s average of 5.5 million barrels. “We still have a few weeks to go before we start harvesting, and the continued warm weather might help the fruit size up a little bit,” Lochner told Wisconsin Public Radio. Dave Hansen, manager of DuBay Cranberry Company in Junction City, said this summer’s weather was warmer and drier than he prefers, but the crop ended up looking good. Lochner said the COVID-19 pandemic has helped boost domestic sales of the fruit, with more people consuming cranberry juice and dried fruit at home, while international sales tapered off during the pandemic, perhaps due to tariffs. The European Union has maintained a 25% tariff on U.S. cranberry products. The pandemic has also created labor issues for the cranberry industry. Lochner said some growers have been working to bring in migrant workers from Southern states to help this fall.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Cheyenne-based Big Boy No. 4014 returns home Tuesday from a monthlong tour of the nation. Led by Ed Dickens, the Union Pacific Heritage Steam program’s showpiece is the massive locomotive that concluded its restoration in 2019 with a tour that marked the 150th anniversary of the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad, which became known as the “overland route” that linked the nation. The steam locomotive, along with 15 support and vintage railcars, is expected to arrive at the Steam Shop in Cheyenne about 1:45 p.m. Tuesday. It should be visible on track on the east end of town starting about 1 p.m, arriving from Greeley, Colorado, its last official stop before arriving home in Cheyenne. Dickens runs the Steam Shop and the UP’s Heritage program, and he is usually found in the engineer’s seat on Big Boy while it is en route. “It’s been excellent,” he said of the 2021 tour. “Our collaboration with our colleagues across the Union Pacific has ensured that we’re consistently running on time, much to the delight of the huge crowds that have greeted us everywhere we’ve been.” The completely rebuilt vintage steam engine has performed outstandingly throughout the trip,” Dickens said. “All of the long hours we put into its restoration and continuing maintenance are paying off.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/12/29/news-around-states/40907031/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nRogersville: A nonprofit group is accepting donations to help clean up Joe Wheeler State Park, which was badly damaged by a tornado earlier this month. The News Courier reported the Alabama State Parks Foundation will take contributions to restore the park near Rogersville. As many as 150 acres of land at the popular park was badly damaged, said superintendent Chad Davis. The damaged areas include campgrounds and day-use areas that are closed indefinitely. Dozens of trees are down and some buildings were damaged. The park would be working with the Alabama Forestry Commission during the cleanup, Davis said. The lodge, marina and some other areas have reopened at the park, which is located along park the Tennessee River. The weather service said it was struck by a twister with 110 mph maximum winds that left a trail of damage as wide as 500 yards.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Transportation officials have launched an updated monitoring system providing drivers real-time road and traffic conditions throughout the state. The Alaska Department of Transportation launched Friday the 511 road condition alert system designed to be more user- and mobile-friendly, the Anchorage Daily News reported. Users can set up notifications and alerts on personalized routes, zoom in and out of the map and click on areas to find out more information, department officials said. The old version was removed from the store and users must download the new version, she said. The system will show traffic speeds and integrates a Google-owned application Waze allowing users to report road conditions, closures or crashes, officials said. The system can be accessed by calling 511, visiting 511.alaska.gov or downloading the mobile app from Google Play or the App Store, officials said. About 450,000 travelers used the 511 website, more than 68,000 calls were made to the 511 phone system and the app was downloaded more than 9,000 times this year, department officials said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:The mood along the streets of central Phoenix was lively, even before the Fiesta Bowl Parade officially began at 9 a.m. Saturday. Historic cars roared their engines as they drove through the blocked-off streets and children holding plastic balloon souvenirs waved hello to a team of police officers mounted on bicycles as they rode through the parade route ahead of its start. A sea of lawn chairs lined Central Avenue, with most of their occupants wrapped in blankets and clutching coffee-filled thermoses as the temperature hovered around 45 degrees — arguably a glacial temperature, by Phoenix standards anyway.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has announced plans for a new outpatient medical clinic in Fort Smith, which is expected to create about 100 jobs. The agency announced plans Thursday for the new clinic, which will have more than double the space now available at the existing VA clinic in Fort Smith. About 15,000 veterans in Crawford, Sebastian and Franklin counties use the facility, officials said. The larger clinic is expected to improve access to medical care for veterans in the area and create about 100 jobs, including positions for doctors, nurses and support staff, the Fort Smith Regional Chamber of Commerce said. The outpatient clinic will offer primary care, mental health, audiology, optometry, radiology and lab services.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: A federal judge has temporarily blocked a California law banning the import and sale of alligator and crocodile products. U.S. District Judge Kimberly J. Mueller also scheduled an April 24 hearing on Louisiana’s request for a longer-lasting order called a preliminary injunction. Both sides agreed to the temporary order, Mueller wrote. It was signed Sunday and made public Monday in online court records. Mueller noted that California is not conceding anything by agreeing to the temporary restraining order and might continue to enforce laws barring the importation of alligator and crocodile bodies and body parts that are forbidden under the Endangered Species Act. American alligators are one of only two alligator species. Chinese alligators are one of the world’s most endangered crocodilians but American alligators are thriving, partly with help from alligator farmers. Their harvest and sale remain regulated, for their own sake and, under an international treaty, because they look like some species that are endangered or threatened. American alligators were removed from the U.S. endangered species list in 1987. The alligator business has played a key part in bringing back the animals and is important in protecting marshes and swamps and other species that depend on wetlands, according to Louisiana’s lawsuit. The big reptiles don’t breed well in captivity, so farmers get permits to collect eggs from the big heaps of plants that alligators pile up as wetland nests. When the alligators hatched from those eggs are 3 to 5 feet long, the number that would have survived to that length in the wild must be returned to the wild, where most hatchlings get eaten if the eggs don’t get eaten first.\n\nColorado\n\nPueblo: A puppy that was thrown at a vehicle by a homeless man last week was adopted on Friday following a raffle organized by animal shelter officials. Officials with the Humane Society of the Pikes Peak Region set up the drawing in Pueblo. KKTV-TV reported the lucky winner is Beth Sisneros of Peyton. Shelter workers had dubbed the dog “Bob” and Sisneros renamed the pup, Buddy Junior. An anonymous donor paid for Buddy’s $400 adoption fee. The Pueblo Chieftain reported that the puppy was thrown by a man reportedly under the influence of meth at a vehicle that was occupied by a mother and her daughter Dec. 15, authorities said. Amanda Belcher was in the car with her daughter when she said the man approached her vehicle and threw the puppy at the roof of the vehicle with force, authorities said. The man was cited for animal cruelty, authorities said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Guided hikes will be offered on New Year’s Day at 15 parks and recreation areas across the state. The free First Day Hikes, which average one or two miles, are being hosted by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. It’s part of America’s State Parks’ First Day Hikes initiative, which is taking place in all 50 states on Wednesday. The goal of the First Day hikes is to encourage people to get outside, exercise, enjoy nature and welcome the new year with friends and family. Parks staff and volunteers will lead the hikes. Information about the locations can be found on the Connecticut State Parks and Forests website. Some hikes, such as one planned at Burr Pond State Park in Torrington, allow dogs on leashes. But others, such as a hike through the Candlewood Hill Wildlife Management Area in Groton do not. Those looking for adventure might consider a moderate two-mile hike through Kettletown State Park in Southbury. First Day Hikes began more than 25 years ago at the Blue Hills Reservation, a state park south of Boston.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:Davian Higgins-Reeves might not have been in her new home for the holidays, but she has the keys in her hands. She and her family will be living in a new Simonds Gardens home after receiving the keys during a home dedication ceremony by Habitat for Humanity of New Castle County. The home, the fourth either built or renovated by Habitat in Simonds Gardens, will get Higgins-Reeves out of an apartment she shares with her sister and cousin and into housing that will allow her to save money and have something she helped build. Higgins-Reeves, who got the keys Dec. 20 and is expected to move into the house in January, put in more than 250 hours of “sweat equity” – the term Habitat uses for the investment the owner provides before moving into a home. This can be anything from helping build the house to being engaged in their new community. Along with the sweat equity, families in the program attend financial coaching classes, home maintenance training and civic engagement training. Higgins-Reeves will be moving into her new home with her husband and her younger sister.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:A 15-year-old boy was arrested nearly a month after two individuals were shot near the ZooLights display at the National Zoo, WUSA-TV reported. Police said on Nov. 30, a group of teens set off fireworks near the zoo, which some visitors mistook for gunshots. During this incident, police said a 15-year-old suspect approached two victims in the 2800 block of Connecticut Ave., Northwest and pulled out a handgun. Then, he shot the victims. The suspect fled the scene, and the victims were taken to a hospital for treatment of their nonlife-threatening injuries. D.C. Police said they arrested a 15-year-old boy from Pittsburgh and charged him with assault of a dangerous weapon (gun). Following the incident, zoo officials looked to increase security measures and tighten up safety precautions. National Zoo spokeswoman Pamela Baker-Masson said that zoo officials held a discussion with D.C. Police, the Smithsonian Office of Protection Services and Metro Transit Police following the shootings to determine what those safety precautions will look like and how they will be carried out. Following that discussion, Baker-Masson said there would be an increase in security staff, as well as temporary screening stations that will include bag checks and wanding. In addition to increased precautions in the zoo, Baker-Masson said D.C. Police would have a heavier presence outside the zoo, as well.\n\nFlorida\n\nTampa: A cat that went missing two years ago in Florida during Hurricane Irma has been reunited with the pet’s owner. The Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office tweeted late last week that the cat showed up at one of its offices in the Tampa area and deputies were hoping to find the owner. The sheriff’s office provided an update on Friday, saying that the owner had been traced via microchip after deputies took the cat to a local veterinarian. The sheriff’s office didn’t identify Eva’s owner but said the cat disappeared during the 2017 hurricane, whose path cut through the middle of Florida. “Tonight, the owner was reunited with Eva,” the sheriff’s office tweeted. “Eva is now living in luxury. MEOW, that is a great story!”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Supporters of Georgia’s South River are hoping it becomes more popular. They believe that if the river south of Atlanta was used more frequently for recreation, it might bring more funding and protection. The South River traverses for about 60 miles from East Point into DeKalb County, before it winds south through five more metro Atlanta counties into Jackson Lake Reservoir in Butts County, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Part of the South River traverses by Panola Mountain State Park, forming the border between DeKalb and Rockdale counties. The hope is that more use will give it added protection from development and pollution. Despite its history of sewage spills, water quality in the river has improved over the last two decades, officials said, and Jackie Echols, board president of the watershed alliance, said it is safe enough for recreational uses such as kayaking.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Authorities said a pilot mobile homeless center program has seen success after launching multiple inflatable tents at a park on Oahu. The Homeless Outreach and Navigations for Unsheltered Persons project set up 10 tents at Waipahu Cultural Garden Park this month, providing homeless people access to food, showers, restrooms and kennels for pets, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. The 400-square-foot tents house up to 10 people each, authorities said. People housed in the tents are being helped by social services agencies to find more permanent housing solutions, authorities said. The program is a three-year, $6 million pilot project staffed by the Honolulu Police Department and Department of Community Services. The program expects to spend 90 days in Waipahu before moving to another city-owned park, officials said. More than 20 of those who stayed at the camp and were placed in shelters were from Waipahu, but others have come from Kakaako, Pearl City, Ewa Beach and Waianae, authorities said. The next location for the mobile shelter could be somewhere in the McCully or Moiliili area where many complaints have been received about large homeless encampments, Lambert said.\n\nIdaho\n\nHailey: Authorities said there have been five mountain lion attacks that have killed or injured dogs in the same central Idaho community in the past week. The Idaho State Journal reported a Labrador retriever was attacked early Saturday morning near Hailey after its owners let the dog outside in their unfenced backyard. It marked the fifth case in the Wood River Valley in the span of a week, according to the Idaho Department of Fish and Game. The Labrador has since recovered and returned home, but at least three other dogs have died. The state said there has been an increasing number of predators in the area because elk and mule deer can now be found there year-round. It urged residents to be vigilant in the early morning and evening hours.\n\nIllinois\n\nAurora: A man who made more than 27,000 crosses to commemorate victims of mass shootings across the country is retiring. Greg Zanis came to realize, after 23 years, his Crosses for Losses ministry was beginning to take a personal and financial toll on him, according to The Beacon-News. Zanis has set up crosses after the school shootings at Columbine, Sandy Hook and Parkland. He also placed crosses after the Las Vegas music festival shooting and the Orlando nightclub shooting. In 2016, he made more than 700 crosses that were carried along Michigan Avenue in Chicago to honor each person who had been killed that year. Earlier this year, Zanis found himself making crosses for his hometown of Aurora after a Henry Pratt Co. employee opened fire on his coworkers. Zanis said he hopes to pass on his ministry to the nonprofit Lutheran Church Charities of Northbrook.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis:An electric car-sharing service that debuted in 2015 is pulling the plug on its network of rechargeable cars after residents failed to embrace the vehicles. Blue Indy will end its collaboration with the city of Indianapolis on May 21, saying in a statement that the car-sharing service would end “because we did not reach the level of activity required to be economically viable.” When Bolloré Logistics launched Blue Indy in Indiana’s capital in September 2015, the Paris-based company predicted it would be operating profitably by 2020, with at least 15,000 members, 200 stations and 500 cars. But as of August, Blue Indy had just 3,000 active members, a fifth of the total it had projected that it needed for profitability. And it had 92 stations and 200 cars – 80 fewer than it had two years ago. The Blue Indy project cost about $50 million, with the company investing $41 million, the city contributing $6 million and Indianapolis Power & Light Co. covering the remaining $3 million. The company did not say what would happen to the cars’ charging stations, which can be found all over Indianapolis.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:A dozen people have applied to fill a vacant seat on the Iowa Supreme Court left by the death in November of Chief Justice Mark Cady. Court officials said the State Judicial Nominating Commission will conduct interviews on Jan. 9 of the applicants. Those interviews, to be held in the Iowa Supreme Court courtroom in Des Moines, are open to the public. Following the interviews, the commission will select three nominees to be forwarded to Gov. Kim Reynolds. The Republican governor will then have 30 days to appoint the new justice from the three nominees. The applicants are Joel Barrows, a district judge from Bettendorf; Romonda Belcher, a district associate judge from Des Moines; Mary Chicchelly, a district judge from Cedar Rapids; Ames lawyer Timothy Gartin; David May, an Iowa Appeals Court judge from Polk City; Des Moines lawyer Matthew McDermott; Iowa City lawyer Craig Nierman; Muscatine County Attorney Alan Ostergren; Cedar Rapids lawyer Dana Oxley; assistant Iowa attorney general Lisa Reel Schmidt; Theresa Wilson, an assistant appellate defender; and Des Moines lawyer William Miller. Iowan residents can email written comments regarding applicants to the commission no later than 5 p.m. Jan. 7 to sjnc@iowa.gov.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A voluntary recall of several pork products produced in Clay Center will be issued on Monday because of possible listeria contamination, Kansas health officials said Saturday. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment said in a news release that Clay Center Locker Plant will issue the recall for any ready-to-eat product including smoked pork loins, ham hocks and smoked ham from the plant produced on Nov. 21. The department is urging the public not to consume any of the products, including those bought at the retail counter in the plant and hams that were delivered to the Future Farmers of America chapters in Clay Center and Chapman. To date, no illnesses have been linked with the recall, the department said. The department said the recall was initiated after tests from routine samplings by the state Agriculture Department found listeria monocytogenes. Listeria can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems.\n\nKentucky\n\nVersailles:Jim Beam was fined $600,000 earlier this month after a July warehouse fire sent a nearly 23-mile plume of alcohol into the Kentucky and Ohio rivers, killing fish. The distiller agreed to the fine in a Dec. 6 order from the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet, The Courier-Journal reported. Jim Beam will also reimburse the state agency $112,000. The July 3 fire was started when lightning struck a massive barrel warehouse near the Woodford-Franklin County line. The blaze sent flames shooting into the night sky that could be seen for miles and generated so much heat that firetruck lights melted. About 40,000 barrels of aging whiskey were destroyed, with the runoff pouring into nearby Glenns Creek and then downstream into the rivers. The Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources found dead fish along 62 miles of Glenns Creek and the Kentucky River. There were also dead fish in the Ohio River, but Energy and Environment Cabinet spokesman John Mura has described the impact there as “negligible.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nDonaldsonville: Seven people have been arrested on charges of dogfighting in south Louisiana and officials said more arrests might be pending. Ascension Parish Sheriff Bobby Webre on Friday said deputies responded to a call regarding dogfighting at a residence in Donaldsonville on Dec. 20. Detectives rounded up 10 dogs, two of them had been fighting and were severely injured. One of the injured dogs died. Investigators also searched 10 vehicles left at the scene and seized drugs, guns, cash, dogfighting paraphernalia and drug paraphernalia, news outlets reported. “Cases of animal cruelty will always be taken seriously,” Webre said. “We will not tolerate dogfighting or anything like it in Ascension Parish.” Anyone with information about this case is urged to contact the Ascension Parish Sheriff’s Office at 225-621-4636.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A bill backed by Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine that is designed to protect animals by cutting down on illegal wildlife trafficking and poaching has been signed into law. Collins joined Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon in proposing the Rescuing Animals With Rewards Act. The proposal authorizes the federal government to offer financial rewards for information that leads to disruption of wildlife trafficking networks, the senators said. Illegal trafficking of wildlife is a “transnational crime that requires a coordinated and sustained global effort” to be stopped, Collins said. Collins and Merkley submitted their proposal in May. It has the support of numerous animal welfare organizations.\n\nMaryland\n\nForestville: Ulysses Currie, a powerful former Maryland lawmaker who was censured in an ethics scandal has died. He was 82. Currie’s wife, Shirley Gravely-Currie, told The Washington Post that he died Friday from advanced dementia at his home in Prince George’s County. The Democrat had represented the area as a state lawmaker for more than three decades until his term ended earlier this year. The son of a sharecropper, Currie was a teacher who rose to become a popular and leading black lawmaker. He was elected to the House of Delegates in 1986 and then elected to the state Senate in 1994. Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller praised his former colleague, saying his story “is the story of the best of our state and this country.” Currie was the chairman of the powerful Senate budget committee in 2002 but stepped down from the chairmanship when he was indicted in federal court in 2010 for failing to disclose work for a grocery store chain that paid him about $245,000 over several years. He was acquitted of all charges, including conspiracy, bribery and extortion. The Senate voted unanimously to censure him, making it the first time in 14 years the chamber had disciplined one of its own.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: A couple reunited for extra-sweet wedding vows at the same Dunkin’ Donuts where their young love splintered nearly 30 years ago. Valerie Sneade and Jason Roy were married Friday afternoon, joined by family, friends and customers buying coffee and pastries at the Dunkin’ Donuts on Grafton Street in Worcester. Sneade and Roy mostly didn’t see each other for 25 years after a conversation about their future at the same shop in 1992 led the young, in-love couple to step back from their relationship. Sneade blamed misunderstandings at the time and words that didn’t come out right. Roy joined the Navy, married and had three children. Sneade also had a first marriage and moved to Florida. She became a singer and actress, developing her own cabaret shows. Both later divorced. When Roy learned Sneade was performing a Valentine’s Day-themed musical revue in Worcester in February 2018, he showed up and sat in the front row. Three months later, she moved back to Massachusetts. Roy proposed that New Year’s Eve.\n\nMichigan\n\nGladstone: A small-town tradition in the Upper Peninsula spread holiday cheer and helped a charity. Firefighters riding in fire trucks went door-to-door last weekend in Gladstone, distributing candy canes while collecting food and $465.79 for the local St. Vincent de Paul branch. The Daily Press in Escanaba said the tradition started more than 20 years ago with five volunteers and one truck. Now more than 20 people are involved. Children eagerly looked out their windows as fire trucks decorated with Christmas lights went up and down Gladstone’s streets, playing holiday music. Stockings full of candy canes were donated by Walmart.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: An 11-year-old boy who was overcome by fumes at a western Minnesota grain silo has died, becoming the third victim to die from the farm accident that claimed his father and uncle, authorities said. Alex Boesl was pronounced dead on Friday, according to the Douglas County Sheriff’s Office. The boy had been hospitalized at Children’s Hospital of Minneapolis since breathing in the silage gas on Dec. 21. The boy’s father, 47-year-old Curt Boesl, and uncle, 49-year-old Steven Boesl, also died. Authorities said Curt Boesl and Alex were working on top of the silo near Millerville when they apparently were overcome by fumes. Steven Boesl tried to rescue his brother and nephew and also was overcome. By the time deputies arrived, all three were unconscious. Emergency responders removed the three from the silo. Ambulance personnel declared Steven Boesl dead at the scene. Curt Boesl died on the morning of Dec. 22. Community members in Millerville, a town of about 100 residents, have rallied around the Boesl families. A GoFundMe account set up to be split between the two families had raised more than $65,000 from about 800 donors as of Friday night, the Star Tribune reported.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state is asking a federal appeals court to reconsider a ruling that said the state’s ban on most abortions at 15 weeks of pregnancy is unconstitutional. The ruling was issued Dec. 13 by a panel of three judges on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, dealing a blow to those seeking to overturn the landmark Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion nationwide. The next day, Republican Gov. Phil Bryant said he wants the state to appeal to the Supreme Court. Papers filed Friday are an in-between step. Mississippi is asking the full 5th Circuit to toss out the panel’s decision and reconsider the case. Attorneys for the state wrote that the panel’s decision conflicted with a Supreme Court ruling in an abortion case “which requires courts to consider not only the burdens a law might impose but the benefits that it provides.” The 5th Circuit panel said U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves ruled correctly when he blocked the Mississippi law from taking effect in 2018.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: The state has stopped withholding union dues from the bimonthly paychecks of prison guards in what the union’s grievance officer calls a “pitiful attempt to bankrupt” the labor organization. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that the maneuver by Republican Gov. Mike Parson’s administration has left the Missouri Correctional Officers Association with a funding shortfall as it negotiates a new contract with the state for 5,000-plus guards and sergeants. The decision by the state was announced in a Dec. 9 letter from the Office of Administration, which Parson controls. Stacy Neal, director of the agency’s division of accounting, said in the letter that the state would no longer withhold union dues because the bargaining unit is not covered by an existing labor agreement. The union and the state have been negotiating a new contract since the old one expired Sept. 18. Union members have been working under the terms of the old contract since then. Missouri prison guards are among the lowest paid in the nation even after Parson earmarked money for raises in the current budget.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A minimum of $4 million should be raised to invest in much-needed improvements to Hell Creek State Park in order to make it a “genuine destination park” on Fort Peck Reservoir. That’s the recommendation of Tom Towe, a Billings attorney who was appointed as a special liaison to Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks Director Martha Williams, the Billings Gazette reported. Towe was appointed by Gov. Steve Bullock in 2017 to lead the discussion of funding for the park. He submitted his suggestions to Williams in a letter dated Dec. 18. The last Legislature’s investment of $700,000 into a new sewer and water system for Hell Creek also demonstrated a political will for supporting Hell Creek, he said. Towe got tangled in the fray that erupted when the previous park director was dismissed and the Legislature latched on to unused park funds. After he was dismissed by the governor, Towe negotiated his term as a liaison, despite the fact that he had lobbied to make state parks a separate entity from FWP. Now he is reporting to the FWP director. In his 13 page letter to director Williams, Towe “strongly” recommended that the lease be renewed with the Corps of Engineers so that the state could enter into a 20-year contract with a concessionaire to operate the marina and hotel. That facility is currently operated by Clint and Deb Thomas. Towe said the contract for the concessionaire should be put out for bid, without the state playing “favorites.”\n\nNebraska\n\nValentine: The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission has declared a fish salvage for Hackberry Lake on the Valentine National Wildlife Refuge. The lake was scheduled to have its existing fish population renovated during 2019 to eliminate common carp on the refuge. But the renovation was not completed because of wet conditions and unsuitable water levels. The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission said length limits are rescinded during the salvage, which runs through Sept. 30, but daily bag limits are maintained. Fish can be taken only by fishing or archery. Game fish can be taken by archery from July 1-Sept. 30, and nongame fish, such as common carp, can be taken any time. Salvaged fish cannot be sold or used for stocking into other public or private bodies of water.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Wildlife officials said the biggest threat to the state’s desert bighorn sheep is bacterial pneumonia, which continues to kill off entire herds statewide. The Las Vegas Sun reported that the problem was first identified in 2012 and has afflicted herds of the bighorn sheep across the U.S. Desert bighorn sheep, Nevada’s official state animal, number about 10,400. Pat Cummings, a game biologist for the Nevada Department of Wildlife, said officials have learned more about the origins and spread of the disease, but “it’s not in any kind of control.” Nevada Department of Wildlife veterinarian Peregrine Wolff said the sheep likely first caught the bacteria generations ago when they were brought to the U.S. from Europe. Wild bighorn sheep had no immunity to the bacteria, unlike domestic sheep, which has left them vulnerable. Wildlife officials are surveying the estimated 100 herds of bighorns in the state over the next few months. They’re collecting tissues from sheep in each herd to try to identify if they have any conditions that could make them more vulnerable once exposed to bacterial pneumonia, and try to determine what percentage of Nevada’s herds are infected.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHolderness: Registration opens soon for an annual program aimed at helping women learn skills for outdoor activities. The New Hampshire Fish and Game Department’s Winter Becoming an Outdoorswoman workshop will be held Feb. 22 at the Owl Brook Hunter Education Center in Holderness. Participants will choose among activities such as ice fishing, winter outdoor survival, snowshoeing and wildlife tracking and woodland target shooting. Registration will open Jan. 10.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nHamilton: A crane being used to remove a tree at a central New Jersey home somehow crashed into the residence on Friday, but authorities said no injuries were reported. The 63,000-pound tri-axle crane came down shortly after noon in Hamilton, while crews were working in the back yard of the Miry Brook Road home. The home sustained some damage in the accident, but the extent and severity was not immediately clear. The crane remained on the home for several hours as emergency responders secured the scene and sought to determine the safest way to right the machinery. The cause of the accident remains under investigation.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: A future mother-in-law tasked with making a phone recording of her future son-in-law proposing to her daughter apparently missed the moment. She ended up recording a selfie on her reaction to what she was seeing. KOB-TV reported Susan Griego somehow took a selfie video of herself watching Benjamin Steele Bacon proposed to her daughter Amber. She did capture the moment Bacon popped the question to Amber by the penguin exhibit at the Albuquerque Biopark. The couple said the selfie video made the proposal more memorable. “People have asked about it. I feel like that’s kind of our relationship. Something wacky and random,” Amber said. “It’s the perfect start to this.” Her mother admitted she’s probably “not very good at photography.”\n\nNew York\n\nLatham: The New York Army and Air National Guard are on track to provide military honors at the burials of about 11,050 veterans during 2019, the state Division of Military & Naval Affairs said Saturday. The expected total is close to the numbers in the last two years. Among the veterans who received the honors this year was Sgt. Francis S. Currey, who was one of the last three surviving Medal of Honor recipients from World War II when he died in October at age 94. Currey, of Selkirk, received the medal for his actions during the Battle of the Bulge. The New York Army National Guard also provided honors for Pfc. Needham Mayes, who had successfully appealed to the Army to reverse his 1956 dishonorable discharge, allowing him to be buried in a veterans’ cemetery with military honors. Mayes, of New York City, died on Veterans Day at age 85. In New York, the burial honors generally involve two National Guard soldiers or airmen presenting an American flag to the veteran’s family and sounding taps on an electronic bugle.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nFletcher: A small plane landed in a fiery crash near a western North Carolina airport late Saturday afternoon, officials said. There were no serious injuries reported. The crash occurred about 5:30 p.m. at the Western North Carolina Agricultural Center about a quarter-mile from the Asheville Regional Airport, according to local television stations. There were no fatalities and no one was taken to a hospital, Buncombe County Sheriff’s Office public information officer Aaron Sarver said, according to WYFF-TV. Citing the Federal Aviation Administration and emergency officials, WLOS-TV reported a Piper PA-32 crashed east of the airport into a parking lot as it was taking off. Social media posts showed fire and smoke coming from a plane. Firefighters also could be seen watering down wreckage. The crash occurred hours after a small airplane crashed in a Louisiana parking lot, killing five people who were on board.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMinot: A man who was hunting pheasants in the Custer Mine area near Garrison on Thursday shot and killed a mountain lion that had emerged from tall grass and charged at him. Gary Gorney told the Minot Daily News that he expected to see a rooster pheasant after his German shorthaired dog had pointed to the area. Instead he was greeted by a female lion that weighed more than 100 pounds. Gorney said he doesn’t remember dropping his dad’s 100-year double-barrel shotgun and reaching for his 9-millimeter handgun underneath his jacket. “My instincts as a military law enforcement officer took over,” Gorney said. “There was no thought process. It was self-defense.” The lion came within 10 feet of Gorney before she was shot. Both of his dogs sprang into action and jumped on the lion. Gorney said he wanted to pull them off but “wasn’t going anywhere near that lion.” Gorney, who has a picture of himself holding the big cat, said it was the first mountain lion he had seen in 31 years of hunting. He said the grass perfectly matched the lion’s coat.\n\nOhio\n\nAda: A town long associated with the manufacturing of footballs has set a Guinness World Record for the most thrown at the same time. The organization certified the record after the attempt was made Oct. 25 by 950 people simultaneously throwing a football on the Ada War Memorial Stadium football field, the Lima News reported last week. Students from kindergarten through 12th grade joined teachers, coaches, bus drivers, school staff and community members to set the record. The Wilson Football Factory in Ada donated more than 1,000 commemorative footballs for the attempt. Workers at the factory make about 3,000 footballs a day, cutting, stitching and lacing each by hand in a 25-step process. The company supplies the football used by the NFL.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A group seeking to legalize the recreational use of marijuana in Oklahoma refiled their petition on Friday after facing a fierce backlash over what the plan might do to the state’s burgeoning medical marijuana industry. Two Oklahoma City residents – Michelle Tilley and Ryan Kiesel – filed the new paperwork for State Question 807 with the Oklahoma Secretary of State’s Office. Tilley said the petition was redrafted to make sure there were greater protections for the existing medical marijuana industry and its patients. Kiesel is the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma. The state question also includes provisions that would allow certain people with previous marijuana convictions to be resentenced or have their criminal records expunged. Once the petition clears a review and challenge period, organizers will have 90 days to gather nearly 178,000 signatures from registered voters to qualify the question for the ballot. A second, separate petition to decriminalize marijuana in Oklahoma also was filed Friday by a Tulsa man, Paul Tay.\n\nOregon\n\nCloverdale: Authorities are searching for information after three garbage bags full of the remains of ducks and geese were found near the Oregon coast. Oregon State Police said in a release that a person walking their dog on Thursday near the Nestucca River in Tillamook County reported the gruesome discovery. Eight geese and five ducks were found in the garbage bags, with the breast meat removed from three of the geese. The remains were found near where the Cloverdale Boat Launch and the Cloverdale Water District building are located. Anyone with information should contact Oregon State Police troopers in the fish and wildlife division\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHouston: Officials said a large western Pennsylvania public burial ground thought to contain hundreds of remains actually has many more than previously thought – and there’s a new resource available to those who believe a relative might be buried there. Potter’s Field – a term for common graves, those for paupers or unclaimed bodies – was believed to contain as many as 502 people, many of whom might have fallen victim to tuberculosis, The (Washington) Observer-Reporter reported. But research conducted at the behest of Commissioner Harlan Shober, encompassing records kept for 66 years until 1945, concludes that more than 1,300 were likely buried there in unmarked graves. In 1830, state lawmakers mandated that the county care for the poorest of its residents, which often included burial in unmarked graves. Almost 300 grave markers – bearing no names, only numbers – dot the hillside on a field near the site of the old Washington County Home for the Poor in Chartiers Township. A ledger contained the names of 57 people buried from 1879 to 1882, and another microfilm list had deaths from 1912 to 1921. The rest of the data was transcribed from an old, leather-bound ledger listing all deaths at the Washington County Home for the Poor and everyone buried in Potters’ Field from 1912 to 1945, she said. A brief history of the Washington County poor farm, orphanage and homes for aged men and aged women is posted on the county website. The database is available through http://pottersfield.washcopa.org/PottersField/index.aspx.\n\nRhode Island\n\nCranston: The state will receive an extra $50 million in federal funds for bridge improvement and repair projects. The funding was included in a new federal transportation legislation co-authored by Democratic U.S. Senator Jack Reed, the ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation and Housing and Urban Development. The federal transportation bill was signed into law earlier this month. Reed said the additional funds, the maximum amount allowable, will help finance repairs to six bridges in Cranston and Providence. Four of them are considered structurally deficient. Reed said the state has received nearly $350 million in federal funds for road, bridge and mass transit improvements in 2019.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Minimum wage employees of Bon Secours St. Francis Health System are in line for a raise. Salaries for those workers are going up to $15 an hour by 2022, the hospital’s parent company, Bon Secours Mercy Health, announced last week. The move is designed to provide employees and their families “a dignified livelihood while working, and in retirement,” officials said in a news release. More than 8,100 employees, or 14% of the system’s 60,000 workers, will be affected by the change, which represents an additional $17 million investment over the next three years, officials said. Bon Secours St. Francis Health System had 3,452 employees in South Carolina in 2017, according to tax filings. Larry Pitts, human resources director for the hospital, said 475 employees will be affected by the increase locally, The Greenville News reported. The move will make the hospital more competitive by attracting health care workers and reducing turnover, he added. The increase will be phased in at all of the system’s U.S. markets, adjusted for cost of living variances. Exceptions include union workers whose wages are negotiated as part of their collective bargaining agreements, or about 7% of the workforce, and the Ireland market, which joined the health system in 2019, officials said. The federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. South Carolina’s minimum wage is also $7.25 according to the National Employment Law Project.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSturgis: Two Sturgis police officers who pulled a man from a burning home in May 2018 are among 18 people selected to receive Carnegie Medals, known as the nation’s highest civilian award for heroism. Sturgis Police Sgt. Christopher Schmoker and Officer Dylan Goetsch are being recognized by the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission for rescuing Jason McKee, who had passed out from heavy smoke in an upper-level bedroom., the Rapid City Journal reported. Using water-soaked clothing tied around their faces as makeshift masks, the officers dragged McKee’s unconscious body down a stairway and got him to the home’s front door, seconds before the fire overtook the living room and hallway where they had just been.\n\nTennessee\n\nKnoxville: Officials said a bear that decided to make its way through the University of Tennessee campus ended up stuck inside the baseball stadium. The Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency said in a Facebook post that the bear was reported on the Knoxville campus and stuck inside Lindsey Nelson Stadium early Sunday morning. Wildlife Sgt. Roy Smith and Wildlife Officer Jeff Roberson responded to the scene, where they quickly tranquilized and removed the bear with the help of University of Tennessee police officers. The agency did not say how the bear got stuck inside the stadium. State officials will now transport and release the bear to a “more suitable bear habitat.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The limestone cliffs of Santa Elena Canyon in Big Bend National Park will soon adorn priority mail postage stamps across the country. Designed by art director Greg Breeding with original art by Dan Cosgrove, the stamp depicts the Rio Grande flowing through the 1,500-feet-high canyon, one of the park’s most visited destinations. The stamp, to be released Jan. 18, is part of a focus in 2020 on stamps that celebrate “the people, events and cultural milestones unique to the history of the United States,” according to a release from the Postal Service. The Postal Service receives about 30,000 suggestions annually for stamp ideas. The Citizens’ Stamp Advisory Committee, made up of experts in fields such as history, science and art, review the suggestions and pare down a list for the Postmaster General. Priority mail delivers a package anywhere in the United States in one to three days.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Utah is about to start requiring nonresidents to get a new type of permit for using an off-highway vehicle in state parks or on public lands. KSL-TV reports that the $30 permit good for 12 months is a result of Utah dropping its recognition of off-highway vehicle registrations from Nevada or any other state. The new requirement takes effect Wednesday. Utah State Parks officials said revenue from permit sales will support recreational areas. Program coordinator Chris Haller said that fewer and fewer states have honored each other’s permits and that only 13 had reciprocity with Utah at the beginning of 2019.\n\nVermont\n\nLewis: The Department of Fish and Wildlife is celebrating eight years of improving trout habitat in northeastern Vermont rivers and streams. Trout thrive in streams that offer places to hide, such as under trees that have fallen into the streams. Fallen trees also create a mix of pools and shallow areas that are used by trout for feeding, reproducing, avoiding high flows and hiding from predators. The Caledonian Record reported that more than 27 miles of brook trout streams have been improved by the placement of large trees in strategic locations. A six-year study in the East Branch Nulhegan River watershed found that on average brook trout abundance tripled in just three years at sites with added trees. The fallen trees store sediment and organic material, helping to reduce the flow downstream of sediment, nutrients and slow runoff, reducing downstream flooding. The work has been done by a variety of organizations including Vermont Fish and Wildlife Department, Trout Unlimited on lands owned by Weyerhaeuser and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nVirginia\n\nFalls Church: One of the largest school districts in the United States has announced that it will allow students one excused absence per school year to participate civic activities such as protests. Fairfax County Public Schools in Virginia plans to start allowing the absences on Jan. 27, news outlets reported. The district is the largest school system in the state. Students in seventh through 12th grades can use the day for “civic engagement activities” such as attending marches or meeting with lawmakers, according to district spokeswoman Lucy Caldwell. The new policy was introduced by Fairfax School Board member Ryan McElveen, according to The Washington Post. He said the rule might be the first of its kind in the U.S. Students must give at least two days notice before the absence, school officials said. A parent or guardian has to give permission and students must fill out a form to explain the reason they’re missing school, McElveen said. To address worries about accreditation, the student must stop by their school campus at least once on the day of their excused absence, McElveen said.\n\nWashington\n\nTacoma: A memorial service has been scheduled for a western Washington sheriff’s deputy who died in a car crash while rushing to assist other officers. Pierce County Sheriff’s Deputy Cooper Dyson, 25, will be honored with a public service at 1 p.m. Monday at the Tacoma Dome. The street procession will begin at 11 a.m. at Joint Base Lewis-McChord. Dyson died on Dec. 21 after his patrol car crashed into a commercial building while he was on his way to back up two fellow officers dispatched to a house in Parkland for an urgent domestic violence call. Dyson had been with the department since 2018. He is survived by his 2-year-old child and his pregnant wife. It was the first motor vehicle collision death of a Pierce County Sheriff’s deputy since 1941.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: West Virginia Secretary of State Mac Warner announced the formation of a committee to plan events commemorating the passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920, which gave women the right to vote. Kat Williams, a professor of U.S. women’s history at Marshall University, is helping with the planning. “There will be marches; there will be speeches; and there will be a number of different, exciting events,” she told The Herald-Dispatch. One of the committee’s main goals is to raise awareness of the milestone and its importance, she said. Williams is teaching a special class in the spring 2020 semester that will discuss the history of U.S. women since the passage of the amendment. Helen Gibbins, president of the League of Women Voters of the Huntington Area, said her group is helping to plan local and statewide events. They include a parade on Women’s Equality Day in August, which will begin on Marshall’s campus. A “Right to Vote” Reader’s Theater that the League has performed in years prior will have a special focus on women’s suffrage in 2020, Gibbons said. A complete list of events statewide will be released by the Secretary of State’s Office at the start of the new year.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:A water main break flooded streets just south of Interstate 94 in Milwaukee on Saturday. The water main ruptured Saturday morning in the area of Hawley Road and Main Street. Law enforcement rerouted traffic and closed off-ramps on the interstate at Hawley Road. Numerous vehicles were partially submerged. Twitter users posted videos showing water gushing down roads into yards and parking lots, and drivers walking in thigh-high water to reach their vehicles and move them to higher ground, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. The cause of the break was not immediately reported.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Landowners have raised concerns about health risks after a potential drilling project was announced near city limits. Samson Energy Company has announced plans to drill 10 to 15 oil wells east of Cheyenne, The Wyoming Tribune Eagle reported. The drilling spacing units run from Iron Mountain Road in the north to Interstate 80 in the south and were approved by the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, company officials said. The project would remain 1,000 feet from any occupied structure and cannot even cover the entire area, company officials said. Application for the drilling permit will narrow where the drilling will occur, officials said. Part of the proposed 12-square-mile zone falls within city limits, landowners and residents said. An October report from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment found people living within 2,000 feet of fracking sites could face an elevated risk of short-term health issues like nosebleeds, headaches, breathing trouble and dizziness, said Wayne Lax, vice president of the landowners coalition. Drilling could begin next summer if permits are approved, company officials said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/06/18/mural-missing-women-jedi-cremations-mri-party-news-around-states/39593307/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: Planned Parenthood is building the stage for another possible fight over abortion in the state – a large women’s clinic that’s under construction despite the state’s passage of a near-total ban on abortions. Located beside an interstate highway downtown, the structure is now nothing but a steel frame and roof. Work is being done under the constant watch of security guards. The new facility could be complete around November, the same time the new state law will take effect unless blocked by courts. Abortion critics vow to oppose the opening, but a spokeswoman for the women’s health organization says neither the new law nor opponents were a factor in the project. “We are a doctor that Birmingham has counted on for decades, and we are committed to continuing to provide that care,” says Barbara Ann Luttrell, a spokeswoman for the Atlanta-based Planned Parenthood Southeast.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Sealaska Heritage Institute officials say they are collaborating with a university that is studying how the DNA of indigenous people might have been affected by trauma linked to European colonization. Researchers from the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign will be at the Juneau-based institute this week for the project focusing on Tlingit people with ties to Hoonah. Another research trip to Hoonah is planned for later this year. Institute officials say researchers anticipate recruiting 50 volunteers to give blood samples and take a survey. Participants will receive $50 Amazon gift cards. Officials say individual information by participants will be anonymous, and the institute is consulting on the effort with the Hoonah Indian Association and the Southeast Alaska Regional Health Consortium.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: State officials and architects are pondering the future of newly vacated space in the Capitol complex. The Arizona Capitol Times reports that ideas for the state library’s former home on the third floor of an annex sitting between the 118-year-old copper-domed Capitol and the nine-story Executive Tower are percolating. The ideas include adding a dignitary reception venue and a neutral meeting ground for legislative leaders and executive branch officials. Such facilities are common among states, but Arizona’s setup of separate House and Senate buildings leaves little extra space for joint activities. When legislative leaders want to meet with the governor, they usually go to the governor’s office. The current planning includes refreshing plans drafted in the mid-2000s that were put on the backburner by the Great Recession.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Lockheed Martin says it is spending $142 million and hiring 326 new workers over the next few years as it expands its south Arkansas facility. The Maryland-based company on Monday announced the expansion of its plant in Camden, about 85 miles southwest of Little Rock. The Camden facility currently employs about 700 workers. The expansion will support new construction and improve existing facilities for products such as the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, Army Tactical Missile System and others, plus new machinery and equipment. The company and Gov. Asa Hutchinson announced the expansion at the Paris Air Show. State Economic Development officials say the company is receiving a performance-based income tax credit and cash rebate for the expansion.\n\nCalifornia\n\nPalm Springs: It’s little surprise that the former playground of pianist Liberace, actor Rock Hudson and entertainer Tab Hunter is gaining a reputation as a great place where older people from the LGBTQ community can live and feel welcome. Palm Springs recently was named the world’s best place for LGBTQ seniors to travel to or retire. Other cities on the list, created by AARP Travel Center and Expedia, include well-known, gay-friendly places like Provincetown, Massachusetts; Minneapolis; and New York. LGBTQ seniors can find a number of resources in Palm Springs that other cities might not have, like the Stonewall Gardens Assisted Living home. Other highlights mentioned on the list include many of the town’s notorious pastimes that have helped turn it into a gay mecca, like its pool parties, drag shows, mid-century shopping and spectacular scenery.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Thousands of people turned out for the Denver Pride Parade on Sunday. Gov. Jared Polis, the nation’s first openly gay governor, and his partner, Marlon Reis, served as grand marshals along with Colorado’s first transgender state legislator, Brianna Titone, Out Boulder executive director Mardi Moore and drag performer Peppermint. The parade headed past the state Capitol decorated with a rainbow flag with the Colorado state logo on it. The parade was part of a weekend long PrideFest and marked the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots in New York City. The Denver Post reports that festival organizers expected attendance this year to exceed last year’s estimated crowd of 425,000.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state Department of Agriculture has been busy processing applications from dozens interested in growing industrial hemp as part of a new research pilot program. The state’s goal has been to get the licenses approved for the new growing season. As of Friday, the agency had approved 35 licenses for growers. An additional 24 applications were undergoing a review. Department of Agriculture Commissioner Bryan Hurlburt says in total, the approved licenses and completed applications equate to 130 acres approved for growing hemp. A handful of people so far have sought permits to process the hemp or manufacture hemp products. Connecticut’s program will ultimately need final federal approval, which is expected in 2020. After that, hemp growers and processors will no longer be required to “research” hemp.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: State senators are set to vote on a bill expanding the decriminalization of simple possession of marijuana to juveniles. Possessing an ounce or less of marijuana is currently a civil violation for anyone over 21 but a criminal misdemeanor for those under 18. Nineteen and 20-year-olds currently are subject to a civil violation for a first offense but misdemeanor charges for a second or subsequent offense. A bill to be voted on Tuesday makes possession of an ounce or less of pot a civil violation for a first offense in all cases. The bill would make a third or subsequent offense for anyone under 21 a misdemeanor.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A locally based group called Make Integrity Great Again has refiled a complaint to the D.C. Alcoholic Beverage Control Board asking the board not to renew the Trump International Hotel’s liquor license, WUSA-TV reports. The organization initially wrote the ABC Board last June protesting the renewal of the liquor license, according to the board’s ruling documents. In its statement, Make Integrity Great Again argued that D.C. law states that applicants of a liquor license must be of “good character and generally fit for the responsibilities of licensure.” According to the group, President Donald Trump doesn’t embody those requirements. The ABC board declined to take the 2018 case, stating the group of D.C. residents filed their petition after the hotel had already been granted its license. But the group refiled the petition before the license was up for renewal.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: A South Florida man thought he snagged a deal when he paid $9,100 in an online auction for what he thought was a villa. What he got was a 1-foot-by-100-foot strip of land. Valued at only $50, the land starts on a curb and goes under a wall separating two villas in the Spring Lake community and then out to the back of the lot. An official tells the South Florida Sun Sentinel there’s not a lot Kerville Holness can do about his purchase. Holness says he was deceived. He says property appraiser photos linked to the auction site show a villa being on the parcel for which he made a bid. But the newspaper says the appraiser’s site and information on the county’s tax site show no building value.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: The number of sea turtle nests along the state’s coast is on pace to set a record this year. Kris Williams, director of Caretta Research Project, a sea turtle conservation organization, told the Savannah Morning News that beach patrols along the Georgia coast between Tybee and Cumberland islands had recorded 1,726 nests by early last week. Last year’s season total was 1,742. Georgia Department of Natural Resources Wildlife Biologist Mark Dodd said if nesting continues increasing, he expects up to 4,500 nests by the end of the season. The previous record, set in 2016, is 3,289 loggerhead nests. Loggerhead sea turtles are the species seen most often in Georgia. Nesting season usually reaches its peak in June and continues into early July. Less intense nesting usually lasts through August.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The popular Kalalau Trail and Haena State Park are reopening on the Hawaiian island of Kauai this week but will have fewer people. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports only 900 visitors a day will be allowed inside the park starting Monday. That’s down from an estimated 3,000 people who used to visit daily. The 11-mile Kalalau Trail, which begins inside the park, is heralded as one of the world’s most beautiful hikes. The limits are outlined in a new master plan developed over two decades. Park users must now make online reservations. Visitors are encouraged to ride a shuttle to the park due to limited parking for private vehicles. Also reopening is Kuhio Highway leading to the park. The road suffered severe damage when record-breaking rains triggered mudslides last year.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A federal judge has ruled that work can go forward on a trail crossing private land that connects the popular central Idaho tourist destinations of Redfish Lake and Stanley. U.S. Magistrate Judge Candy Dale late last week rejected a request by the owners of Sawtooth Mountain Ranch to halt construction of the 4.4-mile trail for pedestrians, cyclists, horseback riders and snowmobilers. The U.S. Forest Service has a conservation easement deed dating to 2005 that allows a trail 30 feet wide to cross about 1.5 miles of private property. Ranch owners David Boren and Lynn Arnone filed the lawsuit in April seeking to halt work, contending the plan needs additional environmental reviews. But Dale ruled that Boren and Arnone failed to show they were likely to succeed on the merits of their arguments.\n\nIllinois\n\nPeoria: A recent retirement party at a medical center looked like a typical farewell celebration. Co-workers posed for pictures, shared a cookie cake and said their goodbyes. But the guest of honor sat silent as the small crowd gathered to celebrate 10 years of service. The retiree also weighed 12,000 pounds and was hoisted from the facility by a forklift. The Pekin Daily Times reports that the OSF HealthCare center in Peoria recently celebrated the retirement of its MRI machine. The old medical imaging device was removed from the facility last week, and it’s being replaced by a new, wide-bore MRI this summer. Jamie White, a manager at the center, describes saying goodbye to the machine as “bittersweet.” She says it was the first open MRI machine the center acquired.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A historic, one-of-a-kind covered bridge is going to the Geist neighborhood, thanks to some quick dealmaking between Hamilton and Jackson county commissioners. The 330-foot-long Bell Ford Bridge, built in 1869, spanned the East Fork of the White River near Seymour until storms damaged it years ago. It is the last remaining covered bridge in the United States with a combination timber and wrought iron frame, or truss, and is on the National Register of Historic Places. Hamilton County officials will place the Bell Ford over Fall Creek to connect Geist Park and a nature trail. The county received a $2.7 million federal grant to restore the Bell Ford. One section of the bridge collapsed into the White River during a storm in 1999, and the other half fell into the river in 2006. The parts were fished from the riverbed and saved.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows the state set a record for rain and snow over the past 12 months. The state saw nearly 51 inches of precipitation from June 2018 through May of this year. That’s about 16 inches more than the 34.42 inches the state averaged per year from 1981 to 2010. State climatologist Justin Glisan says the past 12 months have been the wettest since 1895, the year officials began keeping weather records. He says Iowa can expect more rain as temperatures increase this summer because higher temperatures create more water vapor in the atmosphere. The USDA Midwest Climate Hub in Ames is predicting higher-than-average rainfall for most of the summer.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly says she plans to issue an executive order to end a long-standing economic border war between her state and Missouri in the Kansas City area. Kelly told reporters Friday that her executive order will mirror a new Missouri law that prevents incentives from being used to lure businesses across the border in the metropolitan area. The Missouri law takes effect only if Kansas acts. It was the first time that Kelly publicly committed to issuing an executive order. In Missouri, such a policy requires a change in state law. Both states have spent millions of dollars luring businesses across the state line over the past decade. Area officials see such efforts as wasteful and want to focus on attracting businesses from outside the region.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The Kentucky Public Service Commission has ruled that electric car charging stations are not utilities and do not need to be subject to regulation. The ruling is intended to remove any ambiguity over the legal status of charging stations. The commission says it should also pave the way for more stations to be installed in the state. The commission says Kentucky has lagged neighboring states in the availability of public charging stations. The state has 94. The ruling hinged on whether charging stations are providing electric service to the public, which would make them fall under the commission’s jurisdiction. Commissioners determined the stations are consumers and end users of electricity.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: It’s a bad year for people who make their living from seafood in this part of the Gulf of Mexico. Floods from the Midwest are killing oysters and driving crabs, shrimp and finfish out of bays and marshes, into saltier water where they can survive. “On a scale of 1 to 10, we are 9-and-a-half destroyed,” says Brad Robin, whose family controls about 10,000 acres of oyster leases in Louisiana waters. “The light at the end of the tunnel right now is about out.” Many species that depend on a brackish mix of fresh and saltwater in coastal estuaries are decamping as this year’s huge floods flush in fresh water, laden with pollution from farms and cities in the Mississippi River basin. The situation is grim: Louisiana’s oyster harvest is 80% below average for this time of year, and more oysters are expected to die as temperatures rise, according to a preliminary report.\n\nMaine\n\nBoothbay Harbor: Former Republican Gov. Paul LePage’s wife won’t be the only one in their family spending the summer working at a restaurant. LePage will be joining her as a bartender. McSeagulls Restaurant owner Jeff Stoddard says he hasn’t finalized the former governor’s schedule but expects him to be tending bar for the entire summer in Boothbay Harbor. The governor’s wife, Ann, will be working there again as a server. The restaurant posted photos on social media showing the former governor and first lady wearing McSeagulls T-shirts that proclaimed, “Eat, Drink & Flounder, Just for the Halibut.” The LePages spent the winter at their home in Florida. It’s unclear where they’re staying this summer. They sold their Boothbay home last summer.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The Baltimore Symphony Orchestra is locking out its musicians now that contract and salary negotiations have stalled. The Baltimore Sun reports the lockout starts Monday. Musicans say they’re also losing 12 weeks of pay since management abruptly canceled summer concerts. Musicians have been playing without a new contract since September. A statement from orchestra president and Chief Executive Peter Kjome says its business model needs to change. The management wants to cut the performers’ pay and vacation time as well as reducing the season from year-round to 40 weeks. The musicians say managers aren’t willing to make similar cuts to their own salaries and are starving the organization to protect its endowment.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Hundreds gathered over the weekend to celebrate the opening of a park named in honor of the youngest victim of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. Gov. Charlie Baker joined Mayor Mary Walsh and members of Martin Richard’s family Saturday to open Martin’s Park. It features an accessible playground, including a replica of a boat, a water play garden and open space. Martin was one of three people killed when two bombs exploded at the finish line. His younger sister Jane lost a leg. During Saturday’s ceremony, Jane sang “A Million Dreams,” from the film “The Greatest Showman.” Martin’s father, Bill Richard, said in a statement that the park is a “symbol of the commitment of so many individuals and their dedication to building a more kind, just and inclusive community here.”\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The onetime home of President Ulysses S. Grant is being moved from the former Michigan State Fairgrounds to the Eastern Market, where it will be refashioned as a public education and resource center. Sandra Clark, the director of the Michigan History Center, said Thursday that the two-story white clapboard house will be established as a museum to explore Grant’s life and his impact on Detroit. The Civil War general lived at the house with his wife, Julia Dent, from April 1849 to May 1850. The Michigan State Housing and Development Authority is helping to fund the move, which Clark says could cost $200,000. The move is tentatively set for August. HistoricDetroit.org says the house is moving to make way for development on the fairgrounds that have been dormant since 2008.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: For decades, the state has resisted allowing cameras in courtrooms for the usual arguments – lawyers would grandstand, witnesses would be intimidated, decorum would be disrupted. Under rules that allowed the judge, prosecutors or defense attorneys to veto camera coverage during the trial phase, seeing a Minnesota trial on TV “would be as common as running into a unicorn in deer hunting season,” as media attorney Mark Anfinson put it. But video coverage of high-profile sentencings – which don’t require approval from the parties involved – is giving a more frequent glimpse inside Minnesota courts. That’s cheered advocates of openness in the court system, even as they wish for easier access at the trial phase. “It’s a definite first step. It’s not the finish line,” says Anfinson, who has seen an increase in video requests from news organizations since the launch of a pilot project in 2015.\n\nMississippi\n\nNatchez: Workers have started installing the foundation for a monument honoring civil rights activists who were arrested in 1965 and taken to a notorious prison where they were held several days without being put on trial. The Natchez Democrat reports the “Proud to Take a Stand” monument is being built near a spot downtown where the mostly young, black protesters were held before being taken to the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman. Mayor Darryl Grennell says his father, Jonathan Grennell, was among the protesters arrested while marching for civil rights. They did not have a permit, as was then required by a city ordinance. The rule was later declared unconstitutional. Grennell says he’d like to have the monument finished by Oct. 2, the anniversary of the march.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: The state could soon become the first to allow outdoor cremations. A bill dubbed the “Jedi Disposal Act” would allow licensed funeral directors to organize outdoor cremations at licensed crematoriums or private sites that have permits. The bill got its name from the “Star Wars” movie franchise, in which two Jedi Knights are cremated in public ceremonies. It passed nearly unanimously in this year’s legislative sessions and is awaiting Gov. Mike Parson’s signature. Sen. Jason Holsman, a Kansas City Democrat, says outdoor cremations have been performed “since the dawn of man,” including by Native Americans and U.S. settlers. The Kansas City Star reports that the only place in the U.S. where public outdoor cremations are legal is the small Colorado town of Crestone.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: Glacier National Park has rolled out a new online tool that aims to help visitors find places to park. The Missoulian reported Saturday that the Montana park’s Recreation Access Display gives live updates on campgrounds, parking lots, car access restrictions and weather. The website has a chart indicating whether each campground is open, closed or full. It also gives the times when the campgrounds filled the previous day. It gives the same information for each of the eight parking lots. Park public affairs assistant Kristine Abbey says the website is currently for optimized for computers, but it does work on mobile phones.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A community college is using robots to put long-distance students inside the classrooms. Students establish communication through a tablet computer mounted on a self-balancing chassis on wheels. They can then navigate the Southeast Community College campuses in Lincoln, Beatrice and Milford as robotic avatars, guided by personal digital devices. Christopher Cummins, the college’s director of instruction technology, told the Lincoln Journal Star that teleconferencing often used by long-distance students can be “the incorrect tool for what the instructor is trying to accomplish.” He says robots give students the chance to interact in class, join small-group activities or linger behind after class to ask follow-up questions.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Officials at the National Atomic Testing Museum say it has outgrown its space east of the Las Vegas Strip and is looking for a new location to expand its nuclear testing exhibits. The museum opened in 2005 and became affiliated with the Smithsonian Institution in 2011. It chronicles the development of atomic weapons and Nevada’s history hosting above-ground tests for the weapons for decades. The museum’s education director, Jordan McGee, told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that the museum has been in the same location for 15 years. She did not have details on where the museum might move. The museum’s displays include radiation detectors, a simulator for an atmospheric test blast and pop culture memorabilia from the atomic age.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPinkham Notch: The annual race up the highest peak in the Northeast ended in the first photo finish over the weekend. Brittni Hutton, 29, of Lubbock, Texas, led the entire race, but Heidi Caldwell, 27, of Craftsbury Common, Vermont, caught her at the finish line Saturday. Both finished with a time of 1 hour, 16 minutes, 17 seconds in the women’s division of the 7.6-mile race to the 6,288-foot summit of Mount Washington. Judges initially thought Hutton had won but later declared a tie. Eric Blake, 40, of West Hartford, Connecticut, won the men’s division with a time of 1:02:52, besting Kenyan Francis Kamiri by about a minute. Mount Washington, known for weather extremes, had a temperature of about 37 degrees and gusts of 50 mph at the start of the race.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state has unveiled a pair of regulations aimed at returning it to a regional greenhouse gas-reduction coalition. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy announced the rules Monday. Murphy says one would mean a 30% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions at electricity-producing plants by 2030. Murphy announced last year that New Jersey would rejoin the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative after Republican Chris Christie pulled the state from the group in 2011. The cap-and-trade program is made up of nine New England and Mid-Atlantic states working to reduce carbon emissions from power plants. One rule calls for setting an 18 million-ton cap on carbon emissions in 2020. Figures from the Energy Information Administration show that’s roughly the same as 2017. The second rule crates a framework for implementing involvement in the group.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: A new mural seeks to honor missing and slain Native Americans amid a nationwide push to bring more attention to the issue. Artist Sebastian “Vela” Velazquez recently erected the mural in Las Cruces in conjunction with the city’s eighth annual “Illegal” graffiti art show. The work is part of a large-scale mural wrapping around the entirety of the Cruces Creatives building. In the mural, a Native American woman stands in front with her fist raised. She’s screaming, and the words below say: “NO MORE STOLEN SISTERS!” “The news gets turned off, and Facebook gets put down and turned off, and those issues kind of disappear and everything that comes with it,” Velazquez says. “Having that piece up there, and why we sponsored it, is because you can’t really turn off a mural. It’s there every day and every night.”\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The battle to contain the worst U.S. measles outbreak in 27 years has a new front – summer camp. Vaccinations have been made mandatory this summer for campers and staff in several counties north of New York City that annually fill up with kids from the Orthodox Jewish communities that have been hit hardest by measles. Ulster County took the extra step of mandating the measles vaccine or proof of immunity at all day camps and overnight camps, becoming the latest county in the area to issue immunization requirements. Rockland County announced a similar order this month, following mandates from Sullivan and Orange counties. “We have to make sure our t’s are crossed and our i’s are dotted in making sure all these vaccination records are in,” said Rabbi Hanoch Hecht, of Ulster County’s Camp Emunah, which hosts many girls from a Chabad community in Brooklyn’s Crown Heights.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nMebane: A burglary suspect who was fought off by an 11-year-old boy with a machete was caught Sunday, nearly two days after he slipped away from the hospital where he was treated for a head wound. His capture came after a manhunt and finger-pointing about who was to blame for his escape. Sgt. Shane Brown of the Burlington Police Department said Jataveon Dashawn Hall was arrested there Sunday afternoon. Hall, 19, was returned to Orange County, where the sheriff’s office said he faces charges including breaking and entering and assault. Authorities said the boy was alone in the house in Mebane on Friday morning when Hall broke in after another suspect rang the doorbell and a third waited outside. Hall forced the boy into a closet and was stealing electronics when the boy emerged, grabbed a machete and hit the suspect in the head with the blade, drawing blood, according to the sheriff’s office. Hall and the other suspects then fled.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The Federal Highway Administration has approved construction of a bridge across the Little Missouri River in western North Dakota, although some private landowners have been fighting the project, and supporters have not said how they will pay for it. The Bismarck Tribune reports that the Billings County Commission wants the river crossing to improve emergency response. Opponents worry it would alter the remote and scenic landscape of the Badlands. One rancher has said it would destroy his property. An environmental study last year identified the site north of Medora as the preferred route, which the feds approved last week. Billings County Commission Chairman Jim Arthaud says a timeline for the project has not yet been established. The next steps include meeting with private landowners to try to obtain right-of-way.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The last of five stops for a special exhibition for the 50th anniversary of the first moon landing will be in Cincinnati. Destination Moon: The Apollo 11 Mission will open at the Cincinnati Museum Center on Sept. 28 and run through Feb. 7, 2020. The exhibition features the Columbia command module and more than 20 objects flown on the Apollo 11 mission. There are also models and videos exploring the birth and development of the U.S. space program. Neil Armstrong, who lived in a Cincinnati suburb following his space career, and Buzz Aldrin set foot on the moon July 20, 1969, meeting President John F. Kennedy’s bold deadline for putting a man on the lunar surface by the end of the 1960s. Armstrong died in August 2012 at age 82.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The latest national report on the well-being of children by the Annie E. Casey Foundation shows Oklahoma has improved its economic, health, education and social factors for children, although the state remains in the bottom 20% of the rankings. The “Kids Count” report released Monday ranks Oklahoma 42nd among the 50 states, an improvement from 44th a year ago. The current ranking is based on data from 2017. The state showed improvement with lower percentages of children in poverty; low-birth weight babies; the childhood and teen death rate; the teen birth rate; and alcohol and drug abuse, as well as an increase in the percentage of children who have health insurance. The report also shows an increase in the percentage of children in single-parent families.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state is on the precipice of becoming the second, after California, to adopt a cap-and-trade program, a market-based approach to lowering the greenhouse gas emissions behind global warming. Supporters call it the United States’ most progressive climate policy, saying it not only cuts emissions but also invests in transitioning the state economy and infrastructure to better prepare for more intense weather events as climate change worsens. “We have an opportunity to invest a substantial amount into low-income communities off the backs of the 100 or so major polluters that caused this problem,” said Shilpa Joshi, with the lobbying group Renew Oregon, who has spent years working with dozens of organizations around the state to help shape the final legislation. Cap-and-trade has been a top priority this year for Oregon’s majority Democrats, and Gov. Kate Brown has said she would sign the measure.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Good fiscal times may not necessarily mean good fiscal condition for the state. The rage in the Capitol right now is the surplus that state government rolled up in the almost-ended fiscal year. But that surplus hasn’t necessarily changed outside views that Pennsylvania has tall fiscal challenges. The surplus is expected to ease the passage of an on-time budget and leave a substantial sum to deposit into a reserve fund. Such a deposit hits on a key criticism of credit rating agencies – that Pennsylvania lacks reserve cash. Still, Pennsylvania remains among the lowest-rated states by credit-rating agencies, which often criticize the state’s budget-management practices. In a research note last week, Moody’s said Pennsylvania has routinely shown little willingness to enact structural solutions to its budget challenges.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNewport: The state is identifying and marking sites that have historical ties to slavery. The Newport Daily News reports that the medallions to be used in the Rhode Island Slave History Medallions Project will be unveiled Wednesday at a lecture by Brown University history professor Joanne Pope Melish at the Colony House in Newport. Charles Roberts, the chairman of the project, will unveil the medallion. The first medallion installation is scheduled for Aug. 25 at Patriots Park in Portsmouth. The project’s focus is marking sites that have a “historical connection to the enslavement of indigenous people and Africans, either by their involvement in the slave trade and the economy of slavery, or by their association with the lives and labor of enslaved people themselves.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nAwendaw: A man has been charged with branding sharks like cattle off the state’s coast. News outlets cite South Carolina Natural Resources officials who say a 56-year-old Awendaw man was charged with illegal tagging of a saltwater fish last week. The misdemeanor can net a fine of up to $200. Officials say they were alerted about the brandings last month, as anglers off the South Carolina coast began catching sharks with a symbol that looked like a cursive letter burned just below their dorsal fins. Officials say they also saw photos of such sharks circulating on social media. The Post and Courier reports the brands could have been made with a propane torch or dry ice. The newspaper reports the suspect was “cooperative” with authorities.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A blogger is circulating petitions that seek to roll back changes that state lawmakers have made to the initiated measure process. Cory Heidelberger says his “People Power Petitions” would eliminate bureaucratic roadblocks that are being thrown up to make it harder for citizens to have a say in their laws. One petition is for a referendum on House Bill 1094, which created a state registry of petition circulators and requires them to wear badges. The other is for an initiated measure to eliminate restrictions, including one that requires circulators to file affidavits with the state. Heidelberg says the initiated measure process gives all South Dakotans an equal ability to propose laws. Supporters of House Bill 1094 say it brings transparency to the initiated measure process.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Red paint and the phrase “they were racists” were discovered on a Confederate monument in a city park. Police say they found the vandalism Monday at the Confederate Private Monument in Centennial Park. Red liquid was doused on the statue, and the phrase was scrawled on a plaque with the names of more than 500 Tennessee Confederate soldiers. News outlets report police are reviewing footage from cameras in the park. The Metro Nashville Police Department told news outlets there hasn’t been a vandalism incident like this in the park in nearly seven years. The Confederate monument is one of two in Davidson County, with about 70 more across the state.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Gov. Greg Abbott has approved a spending bill that includes a $1 million public safety campaign for firearm storage. The Republican signed a $250 billion two-year budget Saturday without any line-item vetoes. It includes money for the Texas Department of Public Safety to promote a safe gun storage campaign. The National Rifle Association and gun-rights activists had opposed similar legislation in Texas, where they’ve been a powerful force in a state with 1.3 million handgun license holders. An NRA lobbyist told lawmakers that a campaign designed by Texas state police could be corrupted by anti-gun rhetoric. The program follows a mass shooting at a high school near Houston last year. Authorities have said the then-17-year-old gunman took his father’s weapons before opening fire at Santa Fe High School.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Police at Dixie State University are offering people in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and others fingerprinting services – a required step to secure driving privileges in Utah. Police at the St. George campus decided to offer the service after the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah reached out to them. ACLU representative Sydni Makemo says the service should help hundreds of DACA recipients and immigrants living in southern Utah. A record of a person’s fingerprints is needed to obtain a driving privilege card. The card allows people to drive in Utah, but it cannot be used as a form of ID. Makemo says the service wasn’t previously offered in Washington County.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Biographer Willard Sterne Randall will be discussing one of the country’s founding fathers, Alexander Hamilton, and his connections to Vermont and Revolutionary War hero Ethan Allen at an event in the city this month. The talk entitled “Hamilton, the Man, the Musical – and his friend Ethan Allen” takes place June 23 at the Ethan Allen Homestead Museum. It will include excerpts from the hit Broadway musical “Hamilton.” Randall wrote a biography of Hamilton among other works. Organizers say the event is free, but donations are appreciated.\n\nVirginia\n\nWilliamsburg: The College of William & Mary says the masters of a wizardry school need to make a $70,000 debt disappear. The Virginian-Pilot reports the college says Learn Larp LLC hasn’t fully paid its $110,000 bill for hosting an adult role-playing event known as “New World Magischola.” A $695 ticket for the four-weekend camp in 2017 included meals, housing, and witch or wizard robes. Campers also competed for a house trophy, similar to that in the Harry Potter novel and film series. The organization says the event was first held at the college in Williamsburg. It has since been hosted in California, New Jersey and Rhode Island. The registered agent for Learn Larp LLC wasn’t immediately reached for comment.\n\nWashington\n\nPort Hadlock: At least one waterfront landowner has said yes to a request to allow dead gray whales to decompose on their property. So many gray whale carcasses have washed up this year that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries says it has run out of places to take them. In response, the agency has asked landowners to volunteer property as a disposal site for the carcasses. By doing so, landowners can support the natural process of the marine environment, and skeletons left behind can be used for educational purposes, officials said. But the carcasses can be up to 40 feet long. That’s a lot to decay, and it could take months. Landowner Mario Rivera of Port Hadlock told KING5-TV that the smell is intermittent and “isn’t that bad.” “It is really a unique opportunity to have this here on the beach and monitor it and see how fast it goes,” said his wife, Stefanie Worwag.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWheeling: A high school principal says she favors proposed curriculum charges that would no longer designate a valedictorian. The Intelligencer reports Wheeling Park High School Principal Amy Minch says administrators want to eliminate “the game” that forces students to compete for higher grade point averages, class standing and valedictorian status. She says that often results in students taking classes to boost their grade-point average instead of electives to help them in their career path or enrich them as a person. Under the proposal, the school would not rank students or give honors credits for electives. If approved, changes would begin with the class of 2024. The Ohio County Board of Education would have to approve the changes, and board member David Croft suggested gathering public opinion before voting.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A bipartisan group of lawmakers wants to expand eligibility for a forgivable loan program for trainee teachers after changes made four years ago led to a drop in loans awarded. The Minority Teacher Loan Program offers loans to African American, Latino, American Indian and some Southeast Asian populations to study teaching at a Wisconsin college. The Wisconsin State Journal reports that loan recipients must agree to teach in Milwaukee in a high-demand field and be rated proficient or distinguished in an evaluation. If those requirements are met, 25% of the interest and principal on loans is forgiven per year. Prior to the 2015 eligibility changes, the program awarded 212 loans in three years. It awarded only 11 loans in the three school years after, including just one in 2017-18.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Fodor’s Travel has rated Jackson Hole Airport as the best “tiny airport” in the United States. The airport, located within Grand Teton National Park, beat out second-place Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport in neighboring Montana. The Jackson Hole News & Guide reports that the travel site noted that airline passengers arriving at Jackson Hole Airport are greeted by breathtaking views of the Teton Range, and the terminal includes leather chairs and a roaring fireplace. Fodor’s did not specify what constitutes a “tiny airport.” Jackson Hole Airport officials this past week released plane traffic numbers for the month of May, showing a 58% increase in commercial activity over the same month a year before. Year to date, passenger numbers have increased 21% over record-breaking 2018.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/18"}]}

MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy or molly, has been long seen as a potential therapy for mental health disorders, despite being known for its illicit use.\n\nThe treatment, a capsule form of MDMA made by public-benefit corporation Lykos Therapeutics, was meant to be administered in combination with talk therapy sessions by a licensed mental health provider.\n\nOver 190 patients, who received doses of MDMA in addition to therapy, showed a significant reduction in PTSD scores compared to placebo. The FDA's staff reviewers on Friday raised concerns that patients in the trials were aware of whether they were given MDMA or a placebo due to its psychedelic effects, preventing an objective view of how well the drug worked.\n\nThe FDA, during the panel meeting, said there was a \"striking lack\" of documentation of abuse-related adverse events, which may limit the agency's ability to explain the effects of MDMA or determine its abuse liability.\n\nScrutiny into Lykos' drug has increased in recent months after an influential nonprofit, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), said there was \"insufficient\" evidence for the benefits of MDMA-based therapy. In a letter dated Monday, the American Psychological Association echoed those comments, saying its panel of experts could not determine the balance of benefits and potential harms.\n\nPTSD affects 13 million Americans and is especially common among war veterans. There is a large unmet need for new treatments for the disorder as existing drugs do not work on all patients.\n\nThe FDA's staff on Friday proposed restrictions around Lykos' drug and a need to monitor its usage in briefing documents.

Yet leading mycologist Paul Stamets believes it’s time for fans of psilocybin mushrooms to leave such childish slang behind.\n\nMycologist Paul Stamets touts the benefits of mushrooms for brain health. Courtesy Pamela Kryskow\n\n“Let’s be adults about this. These are no longer ‘shrooms.’ These are no longer party drugs for young people,” Stamets told CNN. “Psilocybin mushrooms are nonaddictive, life-changing substances.”\n\nSmall clinical trials have shown that one or two doses of psilocybin, given in a therapeutic setting, can make dramatic and long-lasting changes in people suffering from treatment-resistant major depressive disorder, which typically does not respond to traditional antidepressants.\n\nBased on this research, the US Food and Drug Administration has described psilocybin as a breakthrough medicine, “which is phenomenal,” Stamets said.\n\nPsilocybin, which the intestines convert into psilocin, a chemical with psychoactive properties, is also showing promise in combating cluster headaches, anxiety, anorexia, obsessive-compulsive disorder and various forms of substance abuse.\n\n“The data are strong from depression to PTSD to cluster headaches, which is one of the most painful conditions I’m aware of,” said neurologist Richard Isaacson, director of the Alzheimer’s Prevention Clinic in the Center for Brain Health at Florida Atlantic University.\n\n“I’m excited about the future of psychedelics because of the relatively good safety profile and because these agents can now be studied in rigorous double-blinded clinical trials,” Isaacson said. “Then we can move from anecdotal reports of ‘I tripped on this and felt better’ to ‘Try this and you will be statistically, significantly better.’ “\n\nBenefits of psychedelic mushrooms\n\nClassic psychedelics such as psilocybin and LSD enter the brain via the same receptors as serotonin, the body’s “feel good” hormone. Serotonin helps control body functions such as sleep, sexual desire and psychological states such as satisfaction, happiness and optimism.\n\nPeople with depression or anxiety often have low levels of serotonin, as do people with post-traumatic stress disorder, cluster headaches, anorexia, smoking addiction and substance abuse. Treatment typically involves selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, which boost levels of serotonin available to brain cells. Yet it can take weeks for improvement to occur, experts say, if the drugs even work at all.\n\nWith psychedelics such as psilocybin and LSD, however, scientists can see changes in brain neuron connectivity in the lab “within 30 minutes,” said pharmacologist Brian Roth, a professor of psychiatry and pharmacology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\n“One of the most interesting things we’ve learned about the classic psychedelics is that they have a dramatic effect on the way brain systems synchronize, or move and groove together,” said Matthew Johnson, a professor in psychedelics and consciousness at Johns Hopkins Medicine.\n\n“When someone’s on psilocybin, we see an overall increase in connectivity between areas of the brain that don’t normally communicate well,” Johnson said. “You also see the opposite of that – local networks in the brain that normally interact with each other quite a bit suddenly communicate less.”\n\nIt creates a “very, very disorganized brain,” ultimately breaking down normal boundaries between the auditory, visual, executive and sense-of-self sections of the mind – thus creating a state of “altered consciousness,” said David Nutt, director of the Neuropsychopharmacology Unit in the Division of Brain Sciences at Imperial College London.\n\nAnd it’s that disorganization that is ultimately therapeutic, according to Nutt: “Depressed people are continually self-critical, and they keep ruminating, going over and over the same negative, anxious or fearful thoughts.\n\n“Psychedelics disrupt that, which is why people can suddenly see a way out of their depression during the trip,” he added. “Critical thoughts are easier to control, and thinking is more flexible. That’s why the drug is an effective treatment for depression.”\n\nAre shrooms good for you?\n\nThere’s more. Researchers say psychedelic drugs help neurons in the brain sprout new dendrites, which look like branches on a tree, to increase communication between cells.\n\n“These drugs can increase neuronal outgrowth, they can increase this branching of neurons, they can increase synapses. That’s called neuroplasticity,” Nutt said.\n\nThat’s different from neurogenesis, which is the development of brand-new brain cells, typically from stem cells in the body. The growth of dendrites helps build and then solidify new circuits in the brain, allowing us to, for example, lay down more positive pathways as we practice gratitude.\n\n“Now our current thinking is this neuronal outgrowth probably doesn’t contribute to the increased connectivity in the brain, but it almost certainly helps people who have insights into their depression while on psilocybin maintain those insights,” Nutt said.\n\n“You shake up the brain, you see things in a more positive way, and then you lay down those positive circuits with the neuroplasticity,” he added. “It’s a double whammy.”\n\nInterestingly, SSRIs also increase neuroplasticity, a fact that science has known for some time. But in a 2022 double-blind phase 2 randomized controlled trial comparing psilocybin to escitalopram, a traditional SSRI, Nutt found the latter didn’t spark the same magic.\n\n“The SSRI did not increase brain connectivity, and it actually did not improve well-being as much as psilocybin,” Nutt said. “Now for the first time you’ve got the brain science lining up with what patients say after a trip: ‘I feel more connected. I can think more freely. I can escape from negative thoughts, and I don’t get trapped in them.’ “\n\nTaking a psychedelic doesn’t work for everyone, Johnson stressed, “but when it works really well it’s like, ‘Oh my god, it’s a cure for PTSD or for depression.’ If people really have changed the way their brain is automatically hardwired to respond to triggers for anxiety, depression, smoking — that’s a real thing.”\n\nHow long do results last? In studies where patients were given just one dose of a psychedelic “a couple of people were better eight years later, but for the majority of those with chronic depression it creeps back after four or five months,” Nutt said.\n\n“What we do with those people is unknown,” he added. “One possibility is to give another dose of the psychedelic — we don’t know if that would work or not, but it might. Or we could put them on an SSRI as soon as they’ve got their mood improved and see if that can hold the depression at bay.\n\n“There are all sorts of ways we could try to address that question,” Nutt said, “but we just don’t know the answer yet.”\n\nWhat about microdosing?\n\nThe mycelium, or rootlike structure, of Lion's mane mushroom is part of the \"Stamets Stack.\" Arterra/Universal Images Group/Getty Images\n\nStamets, who over the last 40 years has discovered four new species of psychedelic mushrooms and written seven books on the topic, said he believes microdosing is a solution. That’s the practice of taking tiny amounts of a psilocybin mushroom several times a week to maintain brain health and a creative perspective on life.\n\nA typical microdose is 0.1 to 0.3 grams of dried psilocybin mushrooms, as compared with the 25-milligram pill of psilocybin that creates the full-blown psychedelic experience.\n\nStamets practices microdosing and has focused on a process called “stacking” in which a microdose of mushrooms is taken with additional substances believed to boost the fungi’s benefits. His famous “Stamets Stack” includes niacin, or vitamin B3, and the mycelium, or rootlike structure, of an unusual mushroom called Lion’s mane.\n\nSurveys of microdosers obtained on his website have shown significantly positive benefits from the practice of taking small doses.\n\n“These are self-reported citizen scientists’ projects, and we have now around 14,000 people in our app where you register yourself and report your microdose,” Stamets told an audience at the 2022 Life Itself conference, a health and wellness event presented in partnership with CNN.\n\n“I’m going to say something provocative, but I believe it to my core: Psilocybin makes nicer people,” Stamets told the audience. “Psilocybin will make us more intelligent and better citizens.”\n\nScientific studies so far have failed to find any benefits from microdosing, leaving many researchers skeptical. “People like being on it, but that doesn’t validate the claims of microdosing,” Johnson said. “People like being on a little bit of cocaine, too.”\n\nExperimental psychologist Harriet de Wit, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral science at the University of Chicago, was excited to study microdosing because it solves a key problem of scientific research in the field – it’s hard to blind people to what they are taking if they begin to trip. Microdosing solves that problem because people don’t feel an effect from the tiny dose.\n\nDe Wit specializes in determining whether a drug’s impact is due to the drug or what scientists call the “placebo effect,” a positive expectation that can cause improvement without the drug.\n\nShe published a study in 2022 that mimicked real-world microdosing of LSD, except neither the participants nor researchers knew what was in the pills the subjects took.\n\n“We measured all kinds of different behavioral and psychological responses, and the only thing we saw is that LSD at very low doses produced some stimulant-like effects at first, which then faded,” de Wit said.\n\nThe placebo effect is powerful, she added, which might explain why the few additional studies done on it have also failed to find any positive results.\n\n“I suspect microdosing may have an effect on mood, and over time it might build up resilience or improve well-being,” Nutt said. “But I don’t think it will rapidly fragment depression like macrodosing and going on a trip.”\n\nMushroom side effects long term\n\nObviously, not all hallucinogenic experiences are positive, so nearly every study on psychedelic drugs has included therapists trained to intercede if a trip turns bad and to maximize the outcome if the trip is good.\n\n“This is about allowing someone access into deeper access into their own mental processes, with hopefully greater insight,” Johnson said. “While others might disagree, it does seem very clear that you need therapy to maximize the benefits.”\n\nThere are also side effects from psychedelics that go beyond a bad trip. LSD, mescaline and DMT, which is the active ingredient in ayahuasca tea, can increase blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Ayahuasca tea can also induce vomiting. LSD can cause tremors, numbness and weakness, while the use of mescaline can lead to uncoordinated movements. People hunting for psychedelic mushrooms can easily mistake a toxic species for one with psilocybin, “leading to unintentional, fatal poisoning.”\n\nAnother issue: Not everyone is a candidate for psychedelic treatment. It won’t work on people currently on SSRIs — the receptors in their brains are already flooded with serotonin. People diagnosed with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, or who have a family history of psychosis are always screened out of clinical trials, said Frederick Barrett, associate director of the Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research at Johns Hopkins.\n\n“If you have a vulnerability to psychosis, it could be that exposing you to a psychedelic could unmask that psychosis or could lead to a psychotic event,” Barnes said.\n\nThen there are the thousands of people with mental health concerns who will never agree to undergo a psychedelic trip. For those people, scientists such as Roth are attempting to find an alternative approach. He and his team recently identified the mechanisms by which psychedelics bond to the brain’s serotonin receptors and are using the knowledge to identify new compounds.\n\n“Our hope is that we can use this information to ultimately make drugs that mimic the benefits of psychedelic drugs without the psychedelic experience,” Roth said.\n\n“What if we could give people who are depressed or suffer from PTSD or anxiety or obsessive-compulsive disorder a medication, and they could wake up the next day and be fine without any side effects? That would be transformative.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/06/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2024/04/24/psychedelic-therapy-ketamine-elon-musk-drug-stigma/73299924007/", "title": "Psychedelics like psilocybin help people. Ketamine bros threaten that", "text": "Sylvia Benito\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nIn my work as a shaman, I once had the opportunity to help a woman who, barely into her 50s, was facing a painful death from bone cancer. Emaciated, her body wracked with pain, she told me she could not lie down in bed for fear of never getting back up. I accompanied her as she took a dose of psilocybin, a psychedelic compound found in magic mushrooms.\n\nOver the next five hours, she went on a profound journey, one that allowed her to accept the fact of her imminent death and locate meaning in her experience. Afterward, she found that all the physical pain she had been experiencing had left her. “Now I believe in magic,” her husband told me. She lived her final few days in peace.\n\nYears later, at a Miami dinner party hosted by a friend, I sat next to a woman who, after a short trip to the bathroom, returned and began laughing for no reason. She couldn’t string two sentences together. When I asked if anything was wrong, she said, “I’m so high on K (ketamine) right now, I can’t even think straight.”\n\nSuch is the confused state of psychedelics today.\n\nI’ve seen firsthand both the transformative effects of psychedelics in treating mental health disorders as well as their casual abuse by people who think of them as a party drug.\n\nI’ve become unnerved by this ketamine bro culture, which threatens to halt the exciting progress in psychedelic research over the past few decades.\n\nPsychedelics are finally being taken seriously in medicine and therapy\n\nPsychedelics herald a paradigm shift in the treatment of mood disorders. I’ve witnessed this as a trained and practicing shaman, providing personal guidance to hundreds of people – from cancer patients to veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder to people experiencing depression – as they come to terms with past instances of trauma or imminent death.\n\nBecoming a shaman was the culmination of a circuitous journey to discover who I was and where I belonged. Raised in a confusing mixture of Judaism and Catholicism, I explored by apprenticing with teachers in a wide variety of faiths and traditions. I eventually found a home in the Santo Daime tradition, under the tutelage of Baixinha in Brazil, which is known for its syncretic religion that utilizes ayahuasca.\n\nThrough my training there, I saw the transformative effects of psychedelics when taken in a safe, controlled, therapeutic setting. (Ayahuasca is legal in Brazil.)\n\nCountless studies over the past decade have highlighted the positive impact of substances like ketamine, psilocybin and other psychedelics.\n\nPsilocybin, for instance, has demonstrated efficacy in treating conditions such as depression and anxiety. A 2016 study found that just a dose of psilocybin led to substantial, sustained reductions in depression and anxiety symptoms among cancer patients. Ketamine, traditionally used in medical settings as a short-term anesthetic, was suggested to have a “robust and rapid effect on depression” by a 2019 study.\n\nThese clinical and empirical data have been so encouraging that research is being conducted on psychedelics’ ability to alleviate symptoms of PTSD, anorexia and alcoholism.\n\nIt’s no secret the medical community has reached a tipping point: While we are tantalizingly close to a series of breakthroughs that together could revolutionize behavioral health treatment, we’re also a couple of bad trips away from stopping this research in its tracks.\n\nThe unique value psychedelics offer to behavioral health treatments is that they induce deeper states of consciousness, which allows for the accelerated healing of trauma. They also may promote neuroplasticity, the process by which the neural networks in the brain evolve and change.\n\nIs it dangerous to smoke weed?What you need to know about using marijuana.\n\nRise of ketamine bro culture in Silicon Valley\n\nOf course, rewiring the brain is a delicate process. It requires humility, trust, a controlled environment and an experienced guide. That’s why psychedelics’ newfound popularity as a party drug among the Silicon Valley elite is cause for concern.\n\nThe rise of ketamine bro culture not only trivializes the incredible therapeutic potential of psychedelics, it also could lead to a public backlash that jeopardizes the medical community’s freedom to further explore the lifesaving potential of these drugs.\n\nPerhaps the poster child for this movement has been Elon Musk. His recreational use of LSD and mushrooms, among other illicit drugs, has been reported on in The Wall Street Journal, and he has publicly endorsed the benefits of ketamine, both in microdoses for his depression and full doses for fun.\n\nBecause Musk epitomizes the tech alpha male, it sends a concerning message about what psychedelics are all about. Silicon Valley leaders trumpet ketamine, shrooms and LSD as nonaddictive drugs that can disrupt one’s own habitual thinking, leading to new heights of inspiration both in the boardroom and after hours. Almost certainly, they’re taking them without the guidance of a professional.\n\nWhat is ketamine?Elon Musk discusses using the drug in interview with Don Lemon\n\nIt’s certainly true that psychedelics can help achieve these altered mental states. But they can also lead to severe consequences if used in this haphazard way.\n\nJust look around Silicon Valley and you can quickly see the consequences of psychedelic abuse. Zappos founder Tony Hsieh struggled with a ketamine addiction in the years before his drug-related death in 2020. Cash App founder Bob Lee died of stab wounds in 2023; his autopsy revealed evidence of alcohol, cocaine and ketamine consumption.\n\n\"Saturday Night Live\" alum Pete Davidson entered rehab last year after taking ketamine daily for four years, not long before \"Friends\" star Matthew Perry died of “acute effects of ketamine.”\n\nPsychedelics stigma starting to wane. Misuse shouldn't stop progress.\n\nIt’s difficult to find reliable population-wide data on psychedelic abuse. That’s because they haven’t been widely used until recently and aren’t generally regarded as having potential for addiction.\n\nOne indicator, though, comes from a recent study finding that hallucinogen-associated visits to the emergency room in California jumped 54% between 2016 and 2022, from just more than 2,200 visits to nearly 3,500 visits. Ketamine is of particular concern, given the rise in its use in recent years.\n\nThe history of MDMA in the United States serves as a warning. Lauded in the 1970s for its therapeutic benefits – psychiatrists believed it enhanced communication during patient sessions – MDMA, or ecstasy, as it has come to be known, was quickly absorbed into rave culture.\n\nThis led to the Drug Enforcement Administration declaring in 1985 an “emergency ban” on MDMA, placing it on its list of Schedule I drugs: substances with no currently accepted medical use. (After far too long, MDMA is under priority review by the FDA Food and Drug Administration for use in treating PTSD. A decision is expected in August.)\n\nSo while we must be mindful of the hazards of psychedelic abuse, we also must be careful not to only regard them as a public health threat – lest we lose sight of their promising benefits.\n\nTo remedy this, recreational users must acknowledge their responsibility to society. Being visibly zonked out in social situations only adds to the narrative that psychedelics are simply a fun toy. And if you’re in a position of power, the responsibility is even greater. Trivializing the effects of these drugs could encourage people to take them outside of therapeutic settings.\n\nAs for the news media, it’s important that reporting is not overly focused on misuse. Journalists must take a balanced approach, remembering to highlight psychedelics’ therapeutic applications as much as their harmful ones. Failing to provide adequate context perpetuates misconceptions that we can’t afford.\n\nThe good news is that the stigma around psychedelics has begun to diminish with each new study. As their potential to revolutionize behavioral health therapy becomes increasingly evident, countless people grappling with debilitating physical, mental and spiritual pain are feeling hope.\n\nLet’s not let the behavior of a small set of irresponsible users take that away from them.\n\nSylvia Benito is a family office portfolio manager and practicing shaman, and serves on the board of Beckley Retreats, one of the world’s first legal psychedelic retreat companies.

It’s synthesized in a purely chemical process to produce a crystalline form,” said Goodwin, who is the chief medical officer of COMPASS Pathways, the company that manufactures COMP360 and conducted the study.\n\nExperts in the field found the study findings promising.\n\n“They clearly found a dose effect and clinically meaningful improvement in just three weeks,” said Dr. Matthew Johnson, a professor in psychedelics and consciousness at Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore. He was not involved in the new study.\n\n“If you were in the 25-milligram group, you were nearly three times as likely to respond than if you were in the 1-milligram group,” said Johnson, who coauthored safety guidelines for psychedelic research in 2008.\n\nThe rapid response to treatment was notable as well.\n\n“The maximum effect (was) seen the day after receiving the treatment. This contrasts with standard antidepressants, which take several weeks to reach maximum effect,” said Dr. Anthony Cleare, a professor of psychopharmacology and affective disorders at King’s College London, in a statement. He was not involved in the study.\n\nHowever, there are a number of issues that need further study before this drug would be available for clinical use, experts said.\n\n“The effects did start to wear off by three months, and we need to know how best to prevent the depression returning,” Cleare said, adding that not enough is yet known about potential side effects.\n\n“While the safety profile seems encouraging overall, great care is obviously needed when using psychoactive substances such as psilocybin. Larger studies are on the way that we hope will help answer these issues,” he said.\n\nBenefits faded\n\nThe clinical trial occurred at 22 sites in the United States, Canada, the UK and seven countries in Europe. The study was designed to test the safety of different dosages of the proprietary version of psilocybin.\n\nThe 233 study participants had treatment-resistant depression, which can only be diagnosed after a person fails to respond to two courses of antidepressants. Of the 9 million people in the US with medically treated depression, 3 million patients are resistant to treatment, studies have estimated. Globally, some 100 million people have treatment-resistant depression, Goodwin said.\n\nPeople with the condition are at a high risk of physical illness, disability, hospitalization and suicide, the study said.\n\nAny study participants on antidepressants were required to wean themselves from those medications prior to the start of the trial. Psychedelic treatment doesn’t work on people who are actively taking antidepressants — the receptors where psychedelics attach in the brain are already flooded with serotonin from their current mood-altering drugs.\n\n“Participants were requested to remain off antidepressant treatment during the first 3 weeks after the trial-drug administration; however, these medications could be started at any time during the trial if deemed clinically necessary by a physician investigator,” the study said.\n\nDepression severity for each person was assessed the day before treatment using a psychological scale widely used by clinicians. Counselors trained to offer psychological support were present during the psychedelic trips, which lasted between six and eight hours. Participants were also given two more therapy sessions in the first week, the study said.\n\nDepression levels were documented the day after the “trip” and another five times over a 12-week period. About 37% of people who took the 25-milligram dose showed improvement. In fact, 29% were considered to be in remission at week three, the study found.\n\nBy week 12, however, the positive impact on depressive symptoms had waned and no longer reached a level of statistical significance, the study found.\n\n“The incidence of sustained response at week 12 was 20% in the 25-mg group, 5% in the 10-mg group, and 10% in the 1-mg group,” wrote psychobiologist Dr. Bertha Madras, director of the laboratory of addiction neurobiology at Harvard Medical School’s McLean Hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts, in an accompanying editorial. She did not participate in the study.\n\n“This is not a spectacular response rate for a psychiatric treatment … and we would only expect this to worsen over a longer follow-up period,” said Dr. Ravi Das, an associate professor of educational psychology research methods and statistics at University College London via email. He who was not involved with the study.\n\nIn addition, “there were an uneven number of severely depressed patients in each group; with significantly fewer severely depressed people in the apparent ‘effective’ (25mg) dose group,” Das said in a statement. “This does not appear to be acknowledged in the paper.”\n\nSafety profile\n\nHeadache, nausea, fatigue and dizziness plagued 77% of the study participants and occurred at all dosage levels, which experts say is a typical response on the day of psilocybin administration.\n\nA small number of people in all three dosage groups experienced suicidal thoughts or injured themselves over the 12-week follow-up period, the study found. Within the first three weeks alone, two people in the 25-milligram group thought about suicide and two intentionally injured themselves. Two people in the 10-milligram group were suicidal, one self-injured and one was hospitalized for severe depression, the study reported.\n\nThose behaviors are “common in treatment-resistant depression studies — most cases occurred more than a week after the COMP360 psilocybin session,” the company said.\n\n“Remember that this is in people who were assessed not to be at significant risk of suicide when they entered the trial. The numbers were fairly small, but this is something that will need to be taken carefully into account in any later-stage trials,” said Kevin McConway, professor emeritus of applied statistics at The Open University, a British public research university.\n\nThe study results are promising, but many questions remain and it’s unknown if this drug would be successful for different types of depression, said McConway, who was not involved in the study.\n\n“They can’t tell us how effective this psilocybin plus therapy treatment is in comparison with other existing drug or non-drug treatments for depression,” said McConway, noting that as a next step for follow-up trials.", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/11/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/05/23/veterans-affairs-medical-marijuana-ptsd/8611333/", "title": "Veterans face ultimatum: Pills or pot", "text": "Jolie Lee\n\nUSA TODAY Network\n\nMilitary veterans are increasingly able to turn legally to marijuana to treat pain and the symptoms of post-traumatic stress syndrome.\n\nBut disclosing their marijuana use to the Department of Veterans Affairs sometimes comes with a price.\n\nVeterans who tell the VA about participating in a state marijuana program say they have been forced to choose between their prescription narcotic painkillers — such as Vicodin, Oxycontin and Percocet — or marijuana, said Michael Krawitz, president of Veterans for Medical Marijuana Access.\n\nMarijuana alone \"certainly is not a replacement for somebody's narcotic pain medication,\" Krawitz said. \"Most veterans would see quite a dramatic difference.\"\n\nAlthough VA doctors cannot recommend marijuana as medicine to their patients, the VA does not explicitly ban patients from participating in state marijuana programs.\n\nPer VA's policy, a veteran who reports marijuana use to their doctor cannot have his or her VA benefits taken away. But patients can have their treatments \"modified.\"\n\nAt the VA, patients who get narcotic painkillers must sign what's called an opioid pain care agreement. As part of the agreement, the patient consents to a urine, saliva or blood test to \"make sure your opioids get into your body,\" according to a copy of the agreement provided by the VA.\n\nThese tests also ensure the patient is not abusing or overdosing on the drugs, as well as taking the right amount and not giving the pills to others, according to an e-mail from the VA.\n\nThese tests can also identify when a patient is using marijuana.\n\nThe VA declined to make someone available for an interview for this story. In e-mailed responses, VA spokeswoman Gina Jackson said decisions about marijuana and prescriptions are made on an individual basis.\n\nNationwide, 21 states and Washington, D.C., have legalized medical marijuana. It's unclear how many vets are using medicinal pot. The VA does not track the number of patients who have reported medical marijuana use, according to Jackson.\n\nAnd whatever numbers would be reported to VA do not count the many who simply don't tell their VA doctors, Krawitz said.\n\nVets choose marijuana over narcotics\n\nWhen given the choice between their prescription painkillers and marijuana, many vets choose marijuana, Krawitz said.\n\nOne such patient is Ryan Begin, a Marine who lives in Maine, where medical marijuana is legal.\n\n\"It was pills or pot, but I can't do both,\" Begin said he was told by VA.\n\nBegin suffered an arm injury during a 2004 deployment in Iraq. When he returned home, Begin said he was given a \"big bag of pills\" and told to go home and feel better.\n\nBut on the pills, Begin said he was jittery, unpredictable and reactive.\n\n\"People feared me when I was on the pills,\" he said.\n\nBegin said he went \"cold turkey\" off the pills and managed to transition to marijuana without too much trouble because he had a strong enough strain of the plant. He now grows his own marijuana plants. He also uses tinctures and edibles. He said the marijuana slows him down enough so he can think and get through the day.\n\nDoctors' varied views on pot\n\nThe medical community's stance on medical marijuana is widely varied.\n\nThe American Medical Association does not endorse state medical marijuana programs, but also is calling on more controlled studies of marijuana. AMA has also urged the federal government to review marijuana's categorization as a Schedule 1 drug, the most dangerous and addictive type of drug, considered to have no medical use.\n\nFor Dr. Jeff Goldsmith, incoming president of the American Society of Addiction Medicine, marijuana is not a medicine because it has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration and therefore has not met the standards of other approved drugs.\n\n\"It's just an illegal drug that people like to use,\" Goldsmith said.\n\nBut Dr. Dustin Sulak, whose patients include Begin and other veterans, said marijuana has been life-changing for his patients. In his opinion, marijuana is a safer option: People die from opiate overdoses, but they don't overdose from marijuana, he said.\n\n\"It's an herb,\" Sulak said. \"It should be next to St. Johns wort and kava in the health food store.\"\n\nBegin has become a champion for medical marijuana access for veterans. But he says it's tough to find vets who will speak publicly about marijuana. There's still a stigma around marijuana use.\n\n\"This is something I believe so strongly in that I know it works and I know other people can benefit from it,\" Begin said. \"I'll do just about anything if it means people will have access to the same things I do.\"\n\nFollow @JolieLeeDC on Twitter.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/05/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/24/health/hypermobile-ehlers-danlos-syndrome-health-hnk-spc-dst-intl/index.html", "title": "Ehlers-Danlos syndrome affects millions. Why isn't the medical ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nOne day in July 2021, my then 15-year-old daughter Poppy stumbled and fell while walking down some stairs, grazing her knee. It wasn’t a serious wound, but over the weeks it didn’t heal.\n\nAround the same time, her wrists and knees became sore; her ankles started rolling when she walked; her hands began shaking; her headaches and stomach aches became more frequent and intensely painful. She was always exhausted.\n\nBefore her health declined, Poppy had enjoyed horse riding and gymnastics, she’d competed in cross country races and been a fearless goalkeeper for the school hockey team.\n\nBut within a couple of months, as walking became increasingly difficult, she asked me for a walking stick. We found one that folds up and fits neatly in her school bag.\n\nI took Poppy to doctors who conducted tests, but they couldn’t find out what was wrong with her. Then, in October, a breakthrough.\n\nA podiatrist who was measuring Poppy for insoles to support her aching feet asked if Poppy could bend her thumb to reach her forearm. She could. Could she pull her little finger back to form a 90-degree angle with the back of her hand? She could do that, too.\n\n“Have you heard of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome?” the podiatrist asked me. I hadn’t – so as soon as I got home, I went looking on the internet.\n\nThere are 13 types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), according to research and advocacy organization The Ehlers-Danlos Society. Most types are very rare, and can be diagnosed using genetic tests. However, the genes that cause hypermobile EDS (hEDS) – the most common form, accounting for about 90% of cases – are unknown, so diagnosis is based on a checklist of symptoms. The list includes a hypermobility rating, known as the Beighton Score.\n\nPoppy had enough symptoms to qualify for hEDS, and the diagnosis was confirmed by a doctor one year ago, on Christmas Eve. He told us that although we can do our best to alleviate some symptoms, there is no cure.\n\nPoppy reacted to the news better than I did. She had known for some time that something was fundamentally wrong. The diagnosis was upsetting but identifying her illness also gave her a sense of relief. I felt shocked and overwhelmed, and I cried for weeks.\n\nReading about EDS was like a dreadful slow reveal.\n\nI learned that it’s a genetic disorder that causes the body to make faulty connective tissue, and connective tissue is everywhere – in the tendons, ligaments, skin, heart, digestive system, eyes and gums.\n\nWeak connective tissue leads to hypermobility, which may sound like a good thing, but some people with bendy bodies suffer a mind-boggling array of symptoms, including joint dislocations and subluxations (like a mini dislocation, when the joint partially slips out of place), soft stretchy skin, abnormal scarring, poor wound healing, gastrointestinal disorders, chronic pain and fatigue.\n\nThe severity of symptoms varies wildly. Patients with milder cases can lead relatively normal lives, while others become housebound, and some can’t digest food and must be fed through tubes.\n\nWhat’s more, people with hEDS are prone to other conditions, including POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, which makes you dizzy when you stand up) and MCAS (mast cell activation syndrome, which gives you allergy-type symptoms).\n\nI learned a lot of new acronyms and they all spelled bad news.\n\nZebras or horses?\n\nI initially thought hEDS was rare, because all forms of EDS are commonly referred to as rare. But within a few weeks, I felt like I was seeing references to hEDS everywhere. Actor, writer and director Lena Dunham; actor and presenter Jameela Jamil; and drag queen Yvie Oddly live with it. I deep dived into EDS Twitter and EDS Instagram, while Poppy found it comforting to watch TikTok videos made by teenagers with the condition.\n\nDrag queen Yvie Oddly, who has hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, crab walks down the pink carpet at RuPaul's DragCon LA in 2019. Rodin Eckenroth/Getty Images\n\nI discovered multiple patient groups on Facebook, each with tens of thousands of members, which turned out to be great sources of support. I asked questions (what kind of shoes are best for weak ankles? Which knee braces are easiest to pull on and off?) and kind strangers sent helpful advice. At the same time, scrolling through countless personal stories of pain, despair and shattered dreams made me feel terrified about what might lie ahead.\n\nI noticed common themes. Many EDS patients had spent years seeking the correct diagnosis; others felt they’d been neglected and gaslit by doctors.\n\nThere was also a lot of talk of zebras.\n\nLinda Bluestein, a Colorado-based physician who specializes in EDS and other hypermobility conditions, and has hEDS herself, explains why.\n\n“I was told in medical school, ‘when you hear hoofbeats think horses, not zebras,’” she says. Many trainee doctors receive the same advice – when a patient presents with symptoms, “look for the common thing.” That’s why EDS patients commonly refer to themselves as zebras – and also use the fabulous collective noun “dazzle.” The name represents rarity and evokes the stripy stretch marks that are a common feature on EDS skin.\n\nBut if people with hEDS are medical zebras, why am I encountering so many of them?\n\nBluestein says that for many years it was thought that one in 5,000 people had Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. But she says the limited research that’s been carried out into the prevalence of hEDS suggests the true number of cases is “much, much higher” than that.\n\nDr. Linda Bluestein has treated hEDS patients who have been searching for a diagnosis for decades. Linda Bluestein\n\nBluestein points me to a 2019 study carried out in Wales – a country of 3.1 million people. An examination of primary care and hospital records from 1990 to 2017 found that one in 500 people there has either hEDS or joint hypermobility syndrome (a similar condition with a slightly different set of symptoms). She says it’s “a good study” but believes it’s still an underestimate. The Ehlers-Danlos Society says more population studies need to be done to give a more accurate view of its incidence elsewhere.\n\nBut despite this possible prevalence, and how debilitating hypermobility disorders can be, the average time to diagnosis from the onset of symptoms is 10 to 12 years, according to The Ehlers-Danlos Society.\n\nBluestein has firsthand experience of this. Growing up, she wanted to become a ballet dancer and trained six days a week. When puberty hit, she started experiencing joint pain and migraines, and at 16 had her first orthopedic surgery. She realized she wouldn’t succeed in the ballet world and instead pursued her “back-up plan,” to become a doctor. But despite her career choice, Bluestein only received her hEDS diagnosis when she was 47 – more than 30 years later.\n\n“I told my doctor on numerous occasions, ‘there is something wrong with me, I don’t heal well, I get injured more easily than other people’,” she says. “And he just never, never listened.”\n\nWhy, for so many patients, does it take so long to get diagnosed?\n\n‘The worst possible model’\n\nIn 2014 a leading EDS expert, Professor Rodney Grahame, remarked at a conference that “no other disease in the history of modern medicine has been neglected in such a way as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.”\n\nFar more women than men are diagnosed with EDS, which could help to explain the neglect, because the medical profession has a long history of overlooking health complaints made by women.\n\nA 2009 study, conducted by the European Organisation for Rare Diseases, surveyed 414 families of EDS patients from five countries and found that the average delay to an EDS diagnosis was four years for men – but 16 years for women.\n\nThe report states that women with EDS tend to be “diagnosed later because their pain and hypotonia (poor muscle tone) aren’t considered as physical symptoms but rather as psychological symptoms or common complaints.”\n\n“We tend to get dismissed a lot more easily,” says Bluestein. “People jump to the conclusion that we’re histrionic females.”\n\nAnxiety is very common in patients with hypermobility issues, says Bluestein, which can cloud the picture. “When people with anxiety present to a physician, it can suck all the air out of the room, so that the physician almost can’t see anything else.”\n\nThis can ramp up the patient’s anxiety further “because people aren’t validating our symptoms, and then we start to doubt ourselves,” she says.\n\nWhat’s more, medicine is divided into silos which creates the “worst possible model” for EDS patients, says Bluestein.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'We're born with this and will never be free:' Hear stories from people with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome 05:02 - Source: CNN\n\nShe explains that undiagnosed patients might consult a neurologist for their migraines, a rheumatologist for joint pain, a cardiologist for palpitations, a gastroenterologist for digestive issues and a urologist for bladder symptoms. Each doctor focuses on the symptoms that fall within their specialty but doesn’t consider the other ailments. “Nowhere along the way does somebody realize that there are certain conditions that could tie all of these things together and explain everything,” says Bluestein.\n\nThe 2009 rare diseases study found that during the quest for a diagnosis, 58% of EDS patients consulted more than five doctors, and 20% consulted more than 20.\n\nThe consequences of not getting diagnosed for years can be devastating.\n\nMelissa Dickinson, a psychotherapist in Atlanta, Georgia, says she experienced symptoms of a “mystery illness” since childhood. Then in 2013, she “went on honeymoon to Mexico, relatively healthy, and came back disabled and with a dislocated neck.”\n\nWhile on vacation, Dickinson says she got food poisoning and was prescribed ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic that can pose a serious risk of aortic aneurysm to people with EDS. Instead, she says it triggered significant nerve damage, digestive issues that almost made her go blind because her body wasn’t absorbing nutrients, and put her in a wheelchair.\n\nDickinson, who finally received her hEDS diagnosis in 2014, says taking the wrong medication “wrecked me from head to toe.” Now that she’s receiving treatment, “I can walk with mobility aids, but most of my body has to have constant support to function.”\n\nLara Bloom, president and CEO of The Ehlers-Danlos Society, who herself has hEDS, says many patients have “medicalized PTSD.”\n\n“They have had to stop their careers, they’ve had to drop out of school, their relationships have broken down.” The delay inevitably results in worsening symptoms and a declining quality of life, she says. In worst-case scenarios, patients “are dying by suicide, they’re self-harming.”\n\nSometimes, the failure to diagnose EDS has led to children being taken away from their parents.\n\nIn 2010, Americans Rana Tyson and her husband Chad were falsely accused of harming their 4-week-old twin daughters, who had unexplained fractures in their legs.\n\nAlong with their older sister, the baby girls were taken by state authorities in Texas and sent to live with relatives. “It was the worst day of my life,” Tyson tells me in a phone call.\n\nFive months later, a geneticist identified the twins as having a connective tissue disorder, and they were subsequently diagnosed with EDS and a vitamin D deficiency. The family was reunited but “12 years later, it still hurts,” says Tyson.\n\nBloom says some other parents of children with EDS have been wrongly accused of “fabricated or induced illness (FII)” – a rare form of abuse, formerly known as Munchausen’s syndrome by proxy, in which a parent or care giver deliberately causes symptoms or tries to convince doctors that a healthy child is ill.\n\nEllie Pattison, who has hEDS, has been repeatedly misdiagnosed as having an eating disorder. Ellie Pattison\n\nEllie Pattison, a 19-year-old student who lives in County Durham, England, suffers from severe digestive issues linked to hEDS.\n\nThroughout her childhood, Ellie was repeatedly misdiagnosed as having an eating disorder, she says, while her mother Caroline was accused of FII on three separate occasions. Caroline successfully fought to keep her daughter at home, says Ellie, but the ordeal has left the whole family with “an unimaginable amount of trauma.” Ellie says she suffered from PTSD and endured years of horrific nightmares, triggered by living with the fear from a young age that she could be forcibly separated from her family.\n\nThis underlines why prompt diagnosis is so important, says Bloom. “Our hope and dream is for people to get diagnosed when their symptoms begin.”\n\nThe search for answers\n\nIn the case of hEDS, a crucial first step is to find out what causes it.\n\nCortney Gensemer, a biomedical scientist in the Norris Lab at the Medical University of South Carolina’s department of Regenerative Medicine and Cell Biology, is trying to solve this mystery. She and research mentor Russell Norris, head of the lab, have been studying a gene mutation they believe causes hEDS (the results of the study are currently under peer review).\n\nLike Poppy, Gensemer was diagnosed with hEDS as a teenager. She says the disease affects every aspect of her work. Looking down a microscope is particularly painful at times – her neck is unstable because of her hEDS, and she’s had metal screws put into some of her neck vertebrae to fuse them.\n\nCortney Gensemer working in the Norris Lab and recovering from neck surgery earlier this year. Cortney Gensemer\n\nNorris kitted the lab out with special equipment, including motion sensor doors (standard lab doors are very heavy), adjustable chairs and ergonomic pipettes that are gentle on the hands. “If I didn’t have all that stuff, I don’t think I’d be able to do it,” says Gensemer.\n\nTo find a hEDS-causing gene, Gensemer says she and Norris sampled DNA from a large family with cases spanning four generations and looked for a mutation that appears only in relatives who have the disease. They identified a “strong candidate gene” and inserted it into mice using gene editing tools.\n\nGensemer and Norris found that the hEDS mice had significantly more lax tissues, and floppier tails than regular rodents. “You can tie a loose knot into the mutant mouse tail. With a normal mouse tail, you can (only) bend it into a circle,” Gensemer says.\n\nThe gene that Gensemer and Norris found won’t account for all hEDS cases, she says. They believe that eventually multiple genes will be identified, and hEDS may be split into different subtypes. This would help to explain why different patients have different symptoms. Crucially, if genetic information sheds light on how the connective tissue is “messed up,” it could lead to effective treatments, says Gensemer.\n\nThe Ehlers-Danlos Society is also looking for genes as well as blood markers, working with a team of experts to sequence and analyze the DNA of 1,000 hEDS patients from around the world. And at the UK’s University of Warwick, Ph.D. candidate Sabeeha Malek, another scientist with hEDS, has proposed that EDS might be caused by a fault in the way that collagen binds to cell membranes in connective tissue. If she’s right, she hopes her work will lead to a skin biopsy test that could identify all forms of the disease.\n\nSabeeha Malek is working to identify biomarkers that could make EDS diagnosis easier. Sabeeha Malek\n\nProgress is being made but on a very small scale. “If you look at any major academic institution, there are multiple labs studying cancer, multiple labs studying heart disease. When you look at a disease that affects one in 500 people, and probably more than that, there should be a lab studying it at every single academic institution,” says Gensemer.\n\nGensemer hopes that as more discoveries are made and data is accumulated it will “change the way the medical community looks at the disease” – and that it will be taken more seriously.\n\nA giant kitten for my zebra\n\nA year has passed since Poppy’s diagnosis. The initial shock has subsided, and while I’m still grieving the loss of her health, we’ve both learned to accept our new reality and have adjusted to living with EDS.\n\nI’ve assembled a team of supportive doctors and therapists and acquired an arsenal of paraphernalia to fight pain and manage symptoms, including braces and kinesiology tape to hold her joints in place; ice packs, heat pads, tiger balm and arnica gel for sore muscles; and a cupboard full of medications and supplements.\n\nWith Poppy often stuck at home, I also got her a giant kitten that she calls Bagel, and he provides the best therapy.\n\nPoppy with Bagel. Tom Booth/CNN\n\nWriting this article has taught me a lot more about EDS: It’s been upsetting to report on the terrible experiences some have suffered, but I’ve been awestruck by the dedication of people, many with the condition themselves, who are working to find solutions.\n\nI don’t know what the future holds for Poppy. Some patients’ symptoms improve with age; others experience an increase in pain and a loss of mobility. I’ve learned there’s a limit to what we can control but there’s a lot we can do, to tackle symptoms and make life easier. And I believe that change is coming.\n\nWith a better understanding of the condition and diagnostic tools on the horizon, my biggest hope is that there will be a cure one day – and that it will come in time for Poppy.", "authors": ["Sarah Lazarus"], "publish_date": "2022/12/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/12/health/ketamine-infusions-help-depression-study-wellness/index.html", "title": "Ketamine infusions improve symptoms of depression, anxiety and ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPeople who got intravenous ketamine at three private ketamine infusion clinics had “significant improvement” in symptoms of depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation, a study says.\n\nThe study, published in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, adds to a growing body of research showing ketamine’s promise in treating these conditions.\n\nIt “gives some more real-world data, which is incredibly important” because it helps show its potential to work in a more general population, said Dr. Gerard Sanacora, a psychiatry professor at the Yale School of Medicine.\n\nBut the study leaves some critical gaps, including data on adverse effects and direct comparisons to other options, that make it difficult to conclude how it should be used, he said.\n\nKetamine is a powerful medication used in hospitals primarily as an anesthetic. It’s also used illegally as a club drug that creates an intense high and dissociative effects. Because it’s not approved to treat depression and thus is used for that purpose “off-label,” it is not covered by insurance, even when it’s recommended by a doctor.\n\nThe researchers looked at data on 424 people with treatment-resistant depression who were treated between November 2017 and May 2021 at three ketamine infusion clinics in Virginia that specialize in people with suicidal ideation, depression or anxiety. During each visit to the clinic, the patients filled out physical and mental health surveys. The patients were given six infusions within 21 days.\n\nWithin six weeks of beginning infusions, the researchers say, half of the participants responded to the treatment, and 20% had depressive symptoms in remission. After 10 infusions, response and remission rates were 72% and 38%, respectively.\n\nHalf of the patients who had suicidal ideation were in remission after six weeks, and there was a 30% reduction in anxiety symptoms over the course of treatment, according to the study.\n\nResponse rates in the initial phase of treatment were similar to those of oral medication and transcranial magnetic stimulation for treatment-resistant depression, the researchers say. Remission rates were on par with transcranial stimulation but weren’t quite as helpful as optimized trials of electroconvulsive therapy, both of which can be more expensive and carry added risk.\n\nLimitations of the research include that it was not a blind study with a control group. It didn’t look at people who declined to have infusions, and it relied on self-reported surveys.\n\nThe researchers also note that they didn’t systematically assess side effects or adverse events of the treatment, but previous studies have not found long-term or permanent side effects on memory or cognitive decline.\n\nThe lack of information about adverse effects is “disappointing,” Sanacora said. Ketamine comes with a “unique set of risks, both to the individual but also to society,” including the potential for drug abuse and unknown effects of frequent use, especially at higher levels.\n\nBut without the adverse effects data – and without comparing outcomes to a control group or otherwise – it’s hard to know how to weigh the benefits against the risks.\n\n“My point is, I think this is an incredibly important treatment to add to our armamentarium to fight severe mood disorders and psychiatric illnesses, but we have to use it responsibly and carefully,” he said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIn 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration approved a nasal spray that uses esketamine, a cousin of ketamine, for treatment-resistant depression. The researchers on the new study say that infusions of racemic ketamine (which uses two forms of ketamine molecules, in contrast with esketamine’s single form) are cheaper than esketamine and could result in savings if they were covered by insurance.", "authors": ["Katherine Dillinger Deidre Mcphillips", "Katherine Dillinger", "Deidre Mcphillips"], "publish_date": "2022/09/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2021/07/09/grant-provide-funding-treatment-opioid-addictions-inmates-collier/5322680001/", "title": "Some Naples jail inmates to get opioid addiction treatment", "text": "Collier County has taken a step forward in helping people with opioid addictions through the acceptance of a grant that will fund treatment for inmates at the Naples Jail Center.\n\n\"It is a game changer,” said Nancy Dauphinais, chief operating officer for the David Lawrence Center. “It's a significant step forward in providing access to life saving and life changing treatments for individuals that have opioid use disorders.”\n\nThe grant is a piece of the funding puzzle that will ensure inmates at the jail have access to their medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorders, Dauphinais said.\n\nMedication-assisted treatment is the use of Food and Drug Administration-approved medications to treat opioid use disorders.\n\nFrom 2019:After grant denial, many Collier inmates still lack medication-assisted treatment for opioid addictions\n\nMore:After heartbreak, Naples father offers surprise donation to help fight opioid addictions\n\nIn combination with counseling and recovery support, medication-assisted treatment is the gold standard for treating opioid use disorders, according to the U.S. Department of Justice’s Bureau of Justice Assistance.\n\nThe three-year grant is worth $1.2 million and comes from the Florida Department of Children and Families.\n\nThe county, Collier County Sheriff’s Office and David Lawrence Center partnered to apply for the grant and fund its $1.2 million match obligation. County commissioners approved acceptance of the grant at their June 22 meeting.\n\nThe grant and match will provide $2.4 million to purchase the medication and hire health care providers to provide treatment in the jail.\n\nIt will ensure that individuals who were already on medication-assisted treatment at the time of their arrest can continue with the treatment while incarcerated.\n\nIndividuals provided with the treatment while in jail will be connected with the David Lawrence Center upon release.\n\n\"Our piece is to be the bridge for when an inmate is released so they can continue with the treatment services and there is no interruption of care,” Dauphinais said.\n\nCommunity partners were initially denied a grant in 2019 to kick off efforts to provide inmates with medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorders.\n\nThe county, sheriff’s office, David Lawrence Center and Armor Correctional Health Services applied for the grant worth $15,730 from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Bureau of Justice Assistance and Arnold Ventures.\n\nAfter reading a story from the Naples Daily News about the grant denial, a Naples father whose son died of an opioid overdose donated the funds to the David Lawrence Center in place of the grant.\n\nThat allowed the community partners to send representatives to travel to Washington, D.C., to learn from experts and other communities about substance abuse medication-assisted treatment models.\n\nLast year, the county was approved for an $84,750 grant through the Institute for Intergovernmental Research that allowed the community partners to develop a plan for treatment of opioid use disorders.\n\nThe David Lawrence Center developed a medication-assisted treatment care team tasked with linking individuals leaving the jail with ongoing treatment and recovery support. The team was also tasked with providing public education about medication-assisted treatment.\n\n“This was the first grant that funds the cost of medications and health care providers in the jail,” Dauphinais said. “Because we didn't have those pieces, we have just kind of been in a planning phase so this was a big step forward.”\n\nMedication-assisted treatment uses methadone, buprenorphine or naltrexone with counseling and behavioral therapies to treat people struggling with addiction and can help sustain recovery, according to the David Lawrence Center.\n\n“The prescribed medications operate to normalize brain chemistry, block the euphoric effects of alcohol and opioids, relieve physiological cravings, and normalize body functions without the negative effects of the illicit drug,” according to the David Lawrence Center. “The goal is to reduce the painful symptoms of withdrawal, improve functioning, and increase the chances of successful outcomes.”\n\nIf funding allows in the future, community partners would expand the program to offer medication-assisted treatment, or MAT, to inmates not already on the treatment at the time of their arrest, Dauphinais said.\n\n“Priority one is to ensure people who are already taking MAT at the time of their intake would be able to continue that,” Dauphinais said. \"It would eventually be ideal to be able to start that in the jail for anybody who is interested regardless of their current status when they are arrested.\"\n\nMedication-assisted treatment for inmates prevents them from having to detox while in jail and can save lives, Dauphinais said.\n\n\"When an individual is detoxed their tolerance lowers. Then when they are released, they are at a much greater risk of overdose if they return to using drugs,” Dauphinais said.\n\nEnsuring individuals with addiction issues have proper treatment benefits the entire community by decreasing the drug overdose mortality rate and lessening strain on the health care system, she said.\n\nProper treatment of drug addictions decreases drug-related crime and referrals of children to the child welfare system, Dauphinais said.\n\nOnce individuals are treated properly for their addiction, they can hold a job, contribute to society and support the local economy, Dauphinais said.\n\n“It impacts all functions of the community from crime to health to the economy and industry,” Dauphinais said. “Medication-assisted treatment is definitely being proven effective across the country, and this is definitely supported by evidence.”\n\nPointing to increasing overdose rates across the country, Dauphinais said funding treatment for opioid use disorders is as important as ever.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in December 2020 “substantial increases” in drug overdose deaths across the country recorded before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMore news:'Big day' for Collier County: Major mental health treatment expansion approved\n\nPreviously:Major mental health expansion to address bed shortfall is up for vote in Collier\n\nThe most recent provisional data available indicates there were approximately 81,230 drug overdose deaths across the country from June 2019 to May 2020, according to the CDC.\n\n“This represents a worsening of the drug overdose epidemic in the United States and is the largest number of drug overdoses for a 12-month period ever recorded,” according to the CDC report.\n\nDrug overdose deaths across the country increased 18.2% from June 2019 to May 2020 compared to July 2018 to June 2019, according to the CDC.\n\nThe increases were primarily driven by rapid increases in overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids, according to the CDC.\n\nOpioid-caused deaths increased by 51% statewide during the first half of 2020 compared to the first half of 2019, according to the latest data from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.\n\nA total of 3,034 opioid-caused deaths were reported during the first half of 2020 in Florida, according to the FDLE.\n\nIn 2019, Collier County saw a 58% increase in opioid overdose deaths compared to the previous year, according to the Florida Department of Health.\n\nOpioid overdose deaths in the county increased from 48 in 2018 to 76 in 2019, according to the FDOH.\n\nCounty-level data for drug overdose deaths in 2020 is not yet available from the state of Florida.\n\nThe county provided about $11,000 for the grant match obligation. The David Lawrence Center and sheriff’s office provided about $260,000 and $929,000 each to match the state grant.\n\nKatina Bouza, director of the corrections support division for the Collier County Sheriff’s Office, said most of the funding from the grant will be used to hire staff to work in the jail and provide the treatment.\n\nHistorically, very few inmates at Collier County jails have been provided with medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorders, Bouza said.\n\n\"We don't provide any inmate with MAT unless it is a pregnant female who was on MAT at the time of her arrest,\" Bouza said. \"Then we will continue her Methadone treatment.\"\n\nInmates who are taking Vivitrol through the county's drug court are also given their medication while in jail, Bouza said.\n\nIn case you missed it:A 76-year-old Naples physician faces three counts of opioid prescribing charges\n\nFrom 2020:'Isolation is not an ideal state': Pandemic plays tough with recovery community and could trigger relapse\n\nExpanding access to medication-assisted treatment to inmates benefits the entire community and can reduce reincarceration, Bouza said.\n\n“If you have an opioid use disorder and you are trying through other forms of treatment to stop and you can't then your brain does not properly function,” Bouza said.\n\nBouza was a member of the group that attended the Bureau of Justice Assistance training to learn more about medication-assisted treatment in early 2020.\n\n“We really learned the science behind it,” Bouza said. “A lot of people think it's one drug replacing another but when you learn more about the science of it, it really does change your perspective.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/07/07/medical-marijuana-research-university-of-arizona/12127139/", "title": "Marijuana study backed by feds delayed after researcher's firing", "text": "Jolie Lee\n\nUSA TODAY Network\n\nAs legal marijuana expands in the USA, with recreational sales starting Tuesday in Washington state, a first-of-its-kind pot study approved by the federal government is hitting a snag.\n\nA researcher who received federal approval to study medical marijuana's effects on veterans with post-traumatic stress syndrome was terminated from her university position, further delaying the long-awaited research.\n\nDr. Suzanne Sisley's termination, effective Sept. 26, means her research could be postponed by at least 1-1/2 years until she is appointed at another university and passes another university's review process, Sisley said in an interview with USA TODAY Network.\n\nIt has already taken her four years to get the federal government to approve her study, she said.\n\n\"We were on the cusp of finally implementing this study and helping veterans answer the question of what role marijuana can play in treating PTSD,\" Sisley said.\n\nSisley said she thinks her dismissal from the University of Arizona was \"political retaliation\" -- a result of her pot-related work, Sisley said.\n\nSpecifically, Sisley said she had informal meetings with elected officials about the medical importance of marijuana research and the need to pass a state bill that would make some public funds available for marijuana research.\n\nThe University of Arizona declined to provide further information for Sisley's dismissal, saying it does not comment on personnel issues, according to George Humphrey, university spokesman, in an e-mail to USA TODAY Network.\n\nHumphrey said \"several individuals\" received non-renewal notices, not just Sisley.\n\n\"However, you should know that UA has not received political pressure to terminate any employee,\" Humphrey said in the e-mail.\n\nHe added that U of A \"championed\" other bill that passed the state legislature last year allowing medical marijuana research to be conducted at public universities.\n\nSisley had three part-time roles at the University of Arizona: assistant director at the Arizona Telemedicine Program, a special projects coordinator at the medical school and a non-tenured clinical assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry, the position that allowed her to do the marijuana research.\n\nIn notices sent to Sisley on June 27, the university said Sisley's three contracts would not be renewed. The decision was \"final\" and not subject to further review, according to the notices.\n\nMedical marijuana has been legal in Arizona since 2010. This year, a bill was introduced that would allow the state to use fees collected from the medical marijuana industry to go toward pot research.\n\nThis bill, which Sisley supported, cleared the House but was never brought up in a Senate committee.\n\nSisley said she received a phone call in April from the university's vice president questioning what she said the university described as \"political activity.\"\n\nUnder university policy, employees are allowed to participate in political activity outside the classroom but cannot allow that activity to affect their objectivity on the job. They also cannot use the university name or affiliation in supporting or opposing a political issue.\n\nIn an April e-mail to university administrators, Sisley said she never used university resources to participate in this activism and conducted her advocacy work outside of work hours.\n\nFirst study of its kind\n\nIn 2011, Sisley received approval from the Food and Drug Administration to be the principal investigator of a triple-blind, randomized trial of 70 veterans with PTSD.\n\nThe study cleared a major hurdle in March when the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services' Public Health Service also approved the study.\n\nStudy participants will receive marijuana grown by the federal government with five varying amounts of the active ingredient, THC — anywhere from the placebo of no THC to 12% THC. The study will also examine the differences between smoking the drug versus vaporizing it.\n\nIn May, the University of Arizona signed a contract with Sisley and the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, a non-profit research and educational organization sponsoring the $1 million research, that would allow Sisley to do her work at U of A, The Arizona Republic reports.\n\nHowever, in order for Sisley to begin, she still needed approval from a third federal agency, the Drug Enforcement Administration. The DEA approval hinged on the university providing her a research space, she said.\n\nTo date, the evidence that medical marijuana could help with PTSD symptoms has been on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\"I can tell you it's good for me until I'm blue in the face, but nobody's ever going to know that until the research is done,\" said Ricardo Pereyda, a combat veteran with PTSD. \"It's all anecdotal and rhetorical as far as anybody in a policy-making position is concerned.\"\n\nSisley said her hope is that she will be reinstated to her former positions at the university. If that doesn't happen, she said she worries that her marijuana research has made her so \"politically radioactive that no university wants to touch me.\"\n\nFollow @JolieLeeDC on Twitter.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/07/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/09/09/parents-adult-children-refuse-mental-illness-treatment-suicide/1549104001/", "title": "Parents face dilemma helping adult children who refuse treatment", "text": "Editor’s note: September is National Suicide Awareness Month and this story is part of Breaking the Silence, a joint effort by news organizations across Oregon and Lines for Life to change the way we talk about the public health crisis of death by suicide.

But he still didn't meet the criteria.\n\nSo what's a parent to do?\n\nNo standards for courts to follow\n\nDespite a clear need for intervention, providing treatment to persons with mental illnesses is seldom easy. Refusal of care is common because the same disorders that impair mood, thoughts and function also impair judgment.\n\nOregon is one of the few states that does not define criteria for civil commitment within its 1973 statute. The criteria are vague and subjective.\n\nChapter 426 of the Oregon Revised Statutes allows a judge to involuntarily commit someone if shown \"clear and convincing evidence\" that they are \"dangerous to self or others\" or \"unable to provide for basic personal needs\" due to a mental disorder.\n\nBut there are no standards for courts to follow.\n\nCoast vandalism:Did destruction of Duckbill Rock make Cape Kiwanda a safer place?\n\nLawmakers and judges have tweaked parts of the law over the years. In 2010, the State Court of Appeals ruled a person could be committed only if his or her mental disorder created an \"imminent\" threat, which is difficult to prove and interpreted differently by county and by judge.\n\nSenate Bill 763 would have amended the statute and lowered the bar, defining \"dangerous to self or others\" to mean likely to inflict serious physical harm upon self or another person within the next 30 days. It would also have allowed the court to consider a person's past behavior, including threats or attempts at suicide and harm to others.\n\n\"Based on what I heard as the (committee) chair and in the work group, there is a definite need,\" Sen.

Prozanski hopes it will be reintroduced during the 2020 legislative session.\n\nCivil liberties vs. public safety\n\nThe National Alliance on Mental Illness cautioned the Senate committee that the proposed legislation would have changed very little if reforms weren't also pursued in the broader behavioral health care system. The group insisted investments need to be made in resources and providers need to do better.\n\nIn Marion County, the health department collaborates with law enforcement and the legal system to reduce jail and state hospital admissions.

Oregon's sordid history of mistreating the mentally ill contributed to the 180-degree turn.\n\nThe statute protects the civil liberties of a person with a mental illness, even when families feel threatened and the person appears extremely ill. Experts argue someone suffering psychosis is not capable of deciding if they need medication or hospitalization.\n\n\"I personally believe the pendulum has swung too much to the individual,\" local psychiatrist Dr. Robert Wolf said. \"You and I and everyone in the field know they're not exercising their right because they’re not lucid.\"\n\nWolf is not consulting with the parents featured in this story. Their son is not his patient.\n\nBut he works with other parents and families who feel just helpless and hopeless.\n\n\"This is a common story,\" Wolf said. \"You could be talking about 5-6 families I've talked to the last 12 months who have to deal with that and manage that. They're watching a loved one disintegrate because of severe mental illness who refuses medication, and there's no easy legal recourse to impact treatment.\"\n\nThese parents have been trying to get their son help for nearly two years. What motivates them to keep trying are memories of a typical teenager who was a standout student-athlete in high school and went on to graduate from college.\n\nThey saw gradual changes in him in his early 20s, and he seemed to snap when denied entry to a post-education program.\n\nTheir son is in his 30s now. To outsiders, at least in short visits, he appears well. But he's unable to hold down a job and has isolated himself from family and friends.\n\nHis behavior is unpredictable, and he's short-tempered and verbally abusive. He suffers what his parents describe as delusions. He believes they're involved in criminal activity.\n\n\"When he's off the rails, he's scary,\" his dad says. \"He's not rational.\"\n\nAggravated murder:Will Oregon death row inmates stay there with changes to law?\n\nAlthough their son has not been diagnosed, they say the symptoms mirror bipolar disorder or paranoid schizophrenia. He has extended family members who are bipolar, so his parents have always been on the lookout for signs.\n\nHis dad describes “blood-chilling” phone conversations and bizarre text threads in which their son has threatened family members. Even documentation of those isn’t considered \"clear and convincing proof\" to support civil commitment.\n\nCourt system is not the answer\n\nThey've taken steps to protect themselves and the rest of the family.\n\nThey signed over the car he was driving for liability reasons and put a GPS tracker on it, so at least they'd always know where he was. They also changed their will.\n\nTheir son agreed to meet with a mediator, but that only made things worse. His parents explored filing for guardianship, but his condition wasn't bad enough to meet those requirements, either.\n\nThey convinced him to check in to a hospital at one point, but he refused to take the medication and was soon discharged. The hospital couldn't hold him against his will or force him to take the medication. He refused outpatient care, too.\n\nTheir friends can't believe after all they’ve done, they still can't get their son help. Some have even made comments like \"maybe he'll commit a crime or get in an accident.\"\n\nEven then it's more likely he would cycle in and out of the court system because of the vagueness of the statute and the high burden of proof necessary for civil commitment.\n\nMarion County District Attorney Paige Clarkson said during testimony in favor of SB 763 that it's a continued source of frustration for the deputy DAs who work for her and handle civil commitment proceedings.\n\n\"They see those same folks over and over and over, who everybody in the room can see needs help, but everybody in the room also gets to the conclusion that the statutory standard is not going to allow us to get there,\" Clarkson said.\n\n\"It’s very frustrating for us in the law enforcement process to have to tell their families, 'This isn't enough. You have to wait for them to really hurt somebody. You have to wait for them to really hurt themselves.'\"\n\nClarkson added that it's not a compassionate way to manage the behavioral health population and puts both the allegedly mentally ill person and the community at risk.\n\nHomelessness tied to mental illness\n\nThe parents' most recent strategy, at the advice of their psychiatrist, was to squeeze their son financially. But he's managed to adapt.\n\nTheir last resort will be to evict him and force him onto the streets, but they haven't quite reached that point yet. Left with limited options, they understand why families give up.\n\nOfficials estimate about 25 percent of the local homeless population has a serious mental illness.\n\n\"A lot of those people would be productive if they got help,\" this dad says. \"Some don't have access to medication and treatment. Here's a case where our son has access to all the care and his parents would pay anything.\"\n\nThey still worry whatever they do will trigger further suicidal thoughts.\n\nDr. Wolf offered them some comfort.\n\n\"I've been in the field 20 years, and I've never had a case in which a parent had to withdraw support and that led to a completed suicide,\" Wolf said. \"I have had cases where parents withdrew support and it led to homelessness.\n\n\"I've also seen it work, where a person in the situation facing homelessness says, 'OK, I'll take the medication.' \"\n\nIt's still a complicated issue\n\nBipolar disorder and schizophrenia are both biological disorders. They can be treated with medications, which are gentler today than they used to be.\n\nDuring a the last mental health conference Bandfield attended, a doctor said during a presentation that 20 percent of individuals with schizophrenia don't respond to medication. She's heard other reports where that number is as high as 25 percent.\n\nThe psychiatrist these parents are working with has told them he believes their son would do well on the right mood stabilizers.\n\nBut even with the right medication, such disorders often require long-term care.\n\n\"Sometimes it takes a year for a person to recover from a psychotic episode,\" Wolf said. \"We don't have places for people to get treatment for a year.\"\n\nIf civilly committed in Oregon, a person may receive involuntary treatment for up to 180 days.\n\nHousing:Upscale apartments going up at former Fairview Training Center in Salem\n\nWolf pointed out most psychotic episodes require at least 12 months of treatment and outpatient treatment is vital because the likelihood of relapse is high in the first year.\n\nFor those who can't remember to take daily pills or have a history of discontinuing medication, Wolf suggested court-ordered prescribed long-acting injectables as an alternative. He also suggested those who refuse treatment for mental illness be handled similarly to someone charged with driving under the influence of intoxicants.\n\n\"People who've had DUIIs can't get in their car and drive until they blow into a straw,\" Wolf said. \"Why not the same concept? You lose your freedom until you take your medications.\"\n\nUntil other options emerge, parents will continue to fight for their adult children. They will provide for them, offer them guidance, and wish there was more they could do.\n\n\"We're just seeing him get sicker,\" these parents say. \"We're just watching him die, basically.\"\n\nIt's heart wrenching to Bandfield and other experts when they hear stories like theirs.\n\n\"It's important that we communicate to the community that we know this is hard on families. We are not trying to make that burden harder,\" she said. \"We try everything we can to figure out ways to help preserve those relationships and create safety.\n\n\"I think it's a really complicated question ... what's the right thing to do?\"\n\nHow to get help\n\nThe Lines for Life Suicide Lifeline offers free, confidential and anonymous help.

All of the previous eruptions have “been novel in some way”, he added, but the current appears to be “sticking to a familiar pattern”, allowing researchers “to breathe a tentative sigh of relief”.\n\nAccording to the US Geological Survey, the eruption began at the volcano’s summit, before moving towards the rift zone – an area where “mountain rock is cracked and relatively weak”, said The Telegraph, “making it easier for magma to emerge”.\n\nField crews from the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory conduct checks at the summit of Mauna Lao (Image credit: United States Geological Survey)\n\nVolcanologist Dr Kenneth Rubin told The New York Times that eruptions from Mauna Loa “tend to be very dynamic in their earliest days”. He added that “conditions on the ground can change fairly quickly”.\n\nMauna Lao is a “particularly colossal” volcano, covering 2,000 square miles, said Andrews in National Geographic. It is also “hyperactive”, with 33 documented eruptions since written records began in 1843.\n\nAlmost all of the previous eruptions occurred before 1950, but the most recent prior to the 1984 eruption was in 1975.\n\nAn aerial shot of lava flowing from Mauna Lao during the 1984 eruption (Image credit: Historical / Contributor via Getty Images)\n\n“Warning signs” of the current eruption had “gradually increased since September”, after geologists tracked an “uptick” in earthquake activity that began in June, said Live Science’s Ben Turner.\n\nExperts have warned that the knock-on consequences of the eruption may include disruptions to communication and traffic.\n\n“Volcanic gas, fine ash and thin glass fibers known as Pele’s hair” that may be carried by wind gusts could also pose a threat to the public, said The New York Times.", "authors": ["Julia O'Driscoll", "The Week Uk", "Rafi Schwartz", "The Week Us", "Peter Weber", "Justin Klawans", "Devika Rao", "Sorcha Bradley", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/11/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/07/us/hawaii-volcano-eruptions-whats-next/index.html", "title": "Hawaii's Mauna Loa and Kilauea volcanoes keep spewing lava with ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe incessant lava shooting out of Hawaii’s Mauna Loa and Kilauea volcanoes has stirred memories of Kilauea’s devastating 2018 eruption, which swallowed hundreds of homes.\n\nBut the current eruptions are different. While it’s unclear how far the lava will travel from either volcano, experts say history and context can provide clues.\n\nWhy Mauna Loa’s lava is harder to predict\n\nMauna Loa is the world’s largest active volcano. It stretches 10.5 miles from base to summit and takes up half the entire surface area of Hawaii’s Big Island, the US Geological Survey says.\n\nBut compared to its smaller neighbor Kilauea, Mauna Loa doesn’t erupt as frequently. So there’s not as much historical data on its lava and where it travels, said Tracy Gregg, associate professor of geology at the University at Buffalo.\n\nAnd that makes the trajectory of its lava – which can change at any moment – harder to predict.\n\n“But the good news about lava is that – particularly on the island of Hawaii – it doesn’t really sneak up on people. Folks know when it’s coming,” Gregg said.\n\n“So in terms of loss of life, I’m not concerned.”\n\nLava from Mauna Loa was crawling forward Tuesday at about 21 yards per hour, said Mike Zoeller of the US Geological Survey’s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory.\n\nThe lava advance, which recently slowed after hitting flatter surfaces, was within 1.92 miles of the Daniel K. Inouye Highway – the major highway connecting the eastern and western halves of Big Island, he said.\n\nBut all “that could change in an hour,” Gregg said, making the task of guessing which – if any – infrastructure or buildings could be damaged by lava much more difficult.\n\nIt seems unlikely that Mauna Loa’s lava will wipe out homes; the closest major population center is Hilo, about 37 miles northeast.\n\n“In some cases, Mauna Loa flows have traveled as far as Hilo and South Kona, so there certainly might be exposure of communities to lava,” said Einat Lev, an associate research professor in seismology, geology and tectonophysics at Columbia University.\n\n“However, this is very unlikely judging by the length of historical lava flows,” Lev said.\n\nIndeed, “Mauna Loa lava flows have not inundated communities,” Gregg said.\n\n“There have been some scares. Hilo is one of the biggest cities on the island, and in the 1880s, Mauna Loa lava flow kind of crept up pretty close to Hilo – but even then didn’t quite make it.”\n\nRight now, there’s a “small chance that the flow would diverge and turn towards the west,” Lev said, where “it might interact with roads and structures in the Pōhakuloa Game Management Area.”\n\nThe US Army’s Pohakuloa Training Area is about 20 miles north of Mauna Loa. An unexploded ordnance was spotted this week in lava rocks near a Mauna Loa eruption viewing area, Hawaii News Now reported.\n\n“Unexploded ordnance may indeed be found in the area, given its long history as a training area” for the Army, Lev said.\n\nBut there are too many variables – such as how deep the military device is in the ground – to speculate what might happen if a lava reached it, Gregg said.\n\nWhy this Kilauea eruption probably won’t be as devastating\n\nJust 21 miles away from Mauna Loa, Kilauea has been exploding for the past year.\n\nBut unlike the 2018 Kilauea eruption that destroyed hundreds of homes in the Leilani Estates neighborhood, the current eruption is much different thanks to where the lava is shooting out from and how close the eruption is to people.\n\n“Lava from the 2021-present eruption has been confined to the summit crater,” Lev said.\n\nIn other words, lava isn’t gushing down the side of Kilauea right now. It’s staying near the top.\n\n“This is in contrast to the 2018 eruption, when the eruptive vents were located low on the southeastern flank of the volcano,” Lev said.\n\n“There is always a chance that there will be another eruption on the flank, closer to communities, but not from the current location of the Kilauea eruption.”\n\nGregg hopes Kilauea’s eruption stays put, with lava shooting up from and staying within the summit crater, she said.\n\n“If you think of the summit crater as like a bathtub, the bathtub is barely even beginning to be filled,” Gregg said.\n\n“Right now, the lava at Kilauea is behaving very nicely. And we hope that lasts.”\n\nWhy lava doesn’t like to follow orders\n\nHumans in the past have tried to divert or even stop lava from advancing. Workers have used bulldozers to build huge earthen walls to try to redirect lava after eruptions, such as that of Mount Etna in Sicily.\n\nBut “the history is not successful,” said Paul Segall, a professor of geophysics at Stanford University.\n\nIn 1935, the founder of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory asked the US Army Air Corps to bomb the source of lava flowing from Mauna Loa as it headed toward the Wailuku River, according to the US Geological Service.\n\nThe army dropped two 600-pound bombs, but they missed their target and had minimal effect on the lava flows.\n\nLava’s tendency to flow “is extremely temperature-sensitive,” Segall said. That makes it “somewhat unpredictable.”\n\nBut with neighboring volcanoes now erupting simultaneously, scientists are eager to study what will happen next.\n\n“It would be fascinating to see if the eruptions influence each other,” Lev said.\n\nNo matter what happens, Gregg said, residents and tourists should pay attention to warnings from local officials and heed any guidance from volcanologists.\n\n“I think the most important thing is that we really can’t predict what’s going to happen on an hour-by-hour or even day-by-day basis.”", "authors": ["Holly Yan"], "publish_date": "2022/12/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/01/world/gallery/photos-this-week-november-24-december-1/index.html", "title": "The week in 32 photos | CNN", "text": "Produced by CNN Digital's Photo Team\n\nThe world's largest active volcano, Mauna Loa, erupted in Hawaii this week for the first time in 38 years.\n\nThe eruption started late on Sunday, November 27, sending lava down one side of the volcano on Hawaii's Big Island.

He is among a handful of self-proclaimed “lava junkies” who are willing to put themselves at risk to witness volcanoes up close.\n\n“It’s kind of our fix,” he said. “It’s what gives us our excitement. It’s what gives us our adrenaline for the day.”\n\nAs a longtime lava chaser, he knows his threshold for what is possible has grown higher than most. “There’s definitely a range (of lava junkies) and my group of friends is definitely the far outer limits of that range. We push a little far, yeah, but I wouldn’t recommend pushing it far for everybody.”\n\nIn a photograph by Kale, lava can be seen flowing from Mauna Loa on November 29. Courtesy CJ Kale\n\nWhile no communities are currently at risk, scientists and island officials are keeping a careful eye on the eruption’s movements. For those who try to venture close to the lava flow, however, the situation can be unpredictable.\n\nAs the slow-moving flow is advancing, its edges can cool into a rough, spiny surface which may seem secure, but its core still contains molten lava, Cheryl Gansecki, a geologist at the University of Hawai’i at Hilo who is studying the eruption, told CNN.\n\n“It might just look like a big wall of hot rock and it doesn’t look like it’s moving much, but they can surge where all of a sudden the front breaks off and lava comes spewing out.”\n\nDue to the eruption hazards, including dangerous gases and volatile conditions, the Hawai’i Volcanoes National Park has closed the volcano’s summit and high elevation areas, as well as some nearby roads. Visitors are still able to see Mauna Loa – and its erupting sister volcano Kilauea – from several park overlooks and a viewing road that was opened along the Daniel K. Inouye Highway.\n\nPeople gather to observe the eruption of Mauna Loa on December 1. Go Nakamura/Reuters\n\nBut for Sherry and Curtis Grumbles, that’s nowhere near close enough.\n\nThe couple made a round-trip trek of four hours to see the towering head of Mauna Loa’s lava flow. They stood just yards from the crawling tidal wave, they said, describing the sound of bursting lava as like shattering glass.\n\n“You get a feeling of awesomeness, of how much power is coming,” Curtis Grumbles said. “There’s a two-story wall of lava just inching towards you, and you know there’s no way that anything’s going to stop it.”\n\nThe area technically is government property. It’s not only illegal to be there during closures, but dangerous because of unexploded military ordnance.\n\nDespite the known risks, the pair plans to hike the lava field again at night to see the “dramatic glow.”\n\n“You know, you can live caged up and have a pretty boring life or you can go see for yourself and take the chance and enjoy your life,” Sherry Grumbles said.\n\nScientists carefully study eruption’s movement\n\nMeanwhile, researchers with the US Geological Survey are making calculated visits to the eruption site. Clad in flame-resistant clothing, heavy boots and gloves, they carefully gather lava samples that may be key to learning what moves the eruption could take next.\n\nAfter “quenching” the lava samples in water, researchers bag them up and send them to the University of Hawai’i at Hilo where Gansecki and her colleagues are able to quickly extract valuable data that can help the agency model future behavior.\n\n“The composition of the lava can affect things like flow rates, so understanding rapidly what is in the rock can help predict how that flow is going to react in the real world,” said University of Hawai’i anthropologist Peter Mills.\n\nLava fissures flow from the north flank of the Mauna Loa volcano on December 7.

David Ige to sign an emergency proclamation Tuesday. This allows the state’s director and administrator of emergency management to handle actions such as issuing alerts and warnings as well as facilitating mandatory evacuations where necessary.\n\nAt just 21 miles apart, Mauna Loa and Kilauea have not erupted together since 1984, when Mauna Loa last erupted.\n\nNeither volcano is threatening homes or nearby infrastructure, the national park said. But state health officials warned air quality could be worsened by hazards such as vog, or volcanic smog.\n\nThe rare dual-eruption event is expected to attract an influx of visitors eager to see the molten flows, the national park said in a Facebook post.\n\nFountains of lava as tall as 200 feet burst from Mauna Loa on Monday, the geological survey said. The eruption was concentrated in Mauna Loa’s Northeast Rift Zone, where lava is flowing from at least one split in the volcano, the geological survey said.\n\nVolcanic gas, fine ash and Pele’s Hair (strands of volcanic glass) could be carried downwind, the agency said.\n\nOfficials are keeping a careful eye on the site to monitor any developments.\n\n“Based on past events, the early stages of a Mauna Loa rift zone eruption can be very dynamic, and the location and advance of lava flows can change rapidly,” the geological survey said in a Monday update.\n\nOnly one of three volcanic fissures that opened on Mauna Loa Monday was still emitting lava Tuesday morning, Hawaii emergency management said. A small, fourth fissure opened overnight and emitted a small amount of lava that cut both power and road access to the Mauna Loa Observatory facility, the agency said.\n\nThough there is no immediate risk to communities, Hawaii’s National Guard is on standby and the state Emergency Management Agency has activated its emergency operations center, Major General Ken Hara, adjutant general for the State of Hawaii Dept. of Defense said during a news conference.\n\nKilauea, a much smaller volcano sitting on Mauna Loa’s southeastern side, has been erupting since September 2021, though its lava is confined to its crater, according to the US Geological Survey. When the incredibly active volcano erupted for months in 2018, it spewed lava into the Leilani Estates neighborhood, destroying more than 700 homes and displacing residents.\n\nThe Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park remains open but cautions visitors hoping to witness the historic eruptions to be aware of the cultural significance the sites have for Native Hawaiians.\n\n“While an eruption is an exciting experience, keep in mind you are observing a sacred event.

MediaPunch/Shutterstock\n\nMauna Loa’s eruption and its subsequent lava flow are affecting the road used to access the Mauna Loa Observatory.\n\nIt has cut off power and access to the critical climate tool used to maintain the so-called “Keeling Curve,” which is the authoritative measurement of atmospheric carbon dioxide and vital scientific evidence for the climate crisis.\n\nThe Keeling Curve graph is comprised of daily carbon dioxide concentration measurements taken at Mauna Loa since 1958.\n\n“It’s a big deal. This is the central record of the present understanding of the climate problem,” said Ralph Keeling, a geoscientist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California in San Diego and son of the Keeling Curve creator.\n\nResearchers are now scrambling to find an alternative location for the equipment.\n\nThere have only been a few times when the readings from the tool have been unavailable, including in 1984, when they were interrupted by the last Mauna Loa eruption.

Sunday night’s eruption caused flight cancellations to and from Honolulu and sent lava flowing down the side of the volcano.\n\nIn erupting for the first time since 1984, Mauna Loa erupted for the first time in nearly 40 years, joining joined its neighboring volcano, Kilauea, which had been erupting for more than a year. The rare dual-eruption event is expected to attract an influx of visitors eager to see their molten flows, the national park said in a Facebook post.\n\nHere is some of the volcano vocabulary you should know to keep up with the eruptions.\n\nCaldera: A caldera is the large, basin-shaped volcanic depression that forms when a volcano erupts and releases magma stored beneath the surface, causing the overlying rocks to collapse. A caldera is different from a crater, which is a smaller depression formed when a volcano erupts and sends rock exploding outward. Yellowstone National Park is home to a famous caldera, measuring 43 by 28 miles.\n\nLava: Lava is what scientists call magma that breaks through the Earth’s surface – like during a volcano eruption. Lava moves as a fluid or viscous mass, says the US Geological Survey.\n\nLava fountains: A lava fountain is just what it sounds like: a jet of lava sprayed into the air “by the rapid formation and expansion of gas bubbles in the molten rock,” says the USGS. The fountains can reach more than 500 meters (1,640 feet) high.\n\nLava flows: Lava flows describe both the moving masses of lava that spew onto the earth’s surface during an eruption and the solidified deposit they leave behind once they cool down.\n\nMagma: Magma describes the super-hot, molten rock beneath the surface of the Earth, according to the USGS. Stores of magma lie in magma reservoirs or magma chambers underneath volcanoes.\n\nPele’s hair: This term describes long, thin strands of volcanic glass that form from lava fountains and fast lava flows, the USGS says. The strands are named after Pele, the Hawaiian goddess of fire. Swaths of Pele’s hair can remain for years and even decades, according to the service, although the wind will eventually strip them from most surfaces.\n\nTephra: Tephra is a catch-all term for all the fragments of rock that are ejected into the air by an erupting volcano, the geological survey says.\n\nVolcanic ash: Volcanic ash isn’t the same as the ash produced after burning a piece of paper. Volcanic ash, a finer form of tephra, consists of tiny, sharp pieces of rock and glass. It’s hard and abrasive and doesn’t dissolve in water, according to the USGS. Clouds of volcanic ash pose a danger to air traffic because they reduce visibility, can damage flight controls and can even cause jet engines to fail.\n\nVog: Vog, a portmanteau of “volcanic” and “smog,” describes the “hazy air pollution” produced by volcanic emissions, according to the Interagency Vog Dashboard.\n\nThe pollution mostly consists of water vapor, carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide. Vog can pose environmental and health risks, says the USGS.", "authors": ["Zoe Sottile"], "publish_date": "2022/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2023/09/12/kilauea-eruption-hawaii-tourism/70836457007/", "title": "'Dramatic' Kilauea eruption draws crowds on Hawaii Island", "text": "Thousands of visitors are making the trek to Hawaii Island to witness Kilauea’s “dramatic” eruption, according to the National Park Service.\n\nThe volcano, considered to be one of the most active in the world, began erupting Sunday afternoon “in its summit crater with multiple lava fountains feeding a lake of molten rock,” a press release by NPS said.\n\nAlthough recent eruptions also occurred in the Halemaumau Crater, “this is the first eruption to also occur from an area east of the crater, called the down-dropped block (and also still within the summit caldera),” a spokesperson for the United States Geological Survey Hawaiian Volcano Observatory told USA TODAY in an email. This area is part of the caldera floor that lowered during a collapse in 2018.\n\nThe eruption follows a period of unrest at the volcano’s summit starting in mid-July. Increased earthquake activity signaled that pressure was building and Kilauea was going to erupt soon, according to the U.S.G.S.\n\nThe lava is currently confined to the summit crater and there is no threat to any structures or the community.\n\nLearn more: Best travel insurance\n\nAs usual, the park has seen an uptick in visitors following the eruption. \"Hawaii Volcanoes National Park staff and volunteers are working extra hours to serve the influx of visitors with safety being our top priority,\" said NPS spokesperson Jessica Ferracane.\n\nMore:'We need responsible tourism': Maui businesses plead tourists to help economy after fires\n\nThe park estimates around 5,000 people per day have come by to see the lava, she added, and many of those are local residents.\n\nThe park is asking for people to “stay safe and be respectful of the hazards and sacredness of Kilauea.” Visitors should stay on marked trails and overlooks because the earth can be unstable and dangerous.\n\nSome parts of the park have been closed due to unsafe air quality, such as 100,000 tonnes of surfor dioxide emissions and shards of volcanic glass. These areas include the Keanakakoi viewing area and a section of old Crater Rim Drive.\n\nThe best viewing areas are Uekahuna, Kilauea Overlook and areas along Crater Rim Trail. Entry to the park starts at $30 per vehicle.\n\nPeople wanting to check out the lava should expect long lines for parking at popular vantage points such as Kīlauea Overlook. Going at night can help you avoid crowds and experience the glowing lava in the dark.\n\nRepresenting the home of Pele, the erupting volcano is also culturally significant to many Native Hawaiians. The park is asking visitors to give cultural practitioners space and respect as they enjoy the natural wonder.\n\nThis is the volcano’s fifth eruption since 2020 and third eruption just this year. The volcano erupted for about 12 days back in June, and over 10,000 people visited the park within the first 24 hours of erupting.\n\nKathleen Wong is a travel reporter for USA TODAY based in Hawaii.

As residents and tourists rush to witness and honor the rare dual eruptions, officials have enlisted the help of the National Guard.\n\n“Gov. David Ige and Maj. General Kenneth Hara activated 20 Hawai’i National Guard service members on Monday and placed them on active duty to assist Hawai’i County with traffic control and other roles in the Mauna Loa eruption,” Hawaii’s Emergency Management Agency said Monday.\n\nOfficials also created a safe viewing spot on a one-way route accessible through the Daniel K. Inouye Highway, the Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency said.\n\nThe lava flow’s pace isn’t steady, so it’s challenging to predict exactly when lava might hit the major highway, also known as Saddle Road.\n\n“There are many variables at play and both the direction and timing of flow advances are expected to change over periods of hours to days, making it difficult to estimate when or if the flow will impact Daniel K. Inouye Highway,” the US Geological Survey said.\n\nThe last time Mauna Loa erupted was in 1984, when its lava reached about 4.5 miles from Hilo, the largest population center on the Big Island.\n\nIf or when lava from the current eruption reaches the critical highway largely depends on how long Mauna Loa erupts, a volcano expert said.\n\n“We don’t know how long this eruption is going to last, and that will dictate whether or not the highway becomes more threatened,” said Natalia Deligne, a volcanologist with the US Geological Survey at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory.\n\nMauna Loa and Kilauea are in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, which remains open as it urges spectators to view the dual eruptions safely.\n\n“Stepping into week two of the Mauna Loa eruption,” the park posted Monday on Facebook. “Two volcanoes, two eruptions, one park. It was another ‘glowrious’ morning today!”\n\nLava fountains and flows illuminate the sky Monday near Mauna Loa. Go Nakamura/Reuters\n\nHonoring the volcanoes’ spiritual power\n\nWhile some see the Big Island’s eruptions as a threat, for many Native Hawaiians, the eruptions have incredible spiritual significance.\n\nKu’ulei Vickery, a Native Hawaiian and a teacher at a nearby public school, was among those who witnessed the glowing orange molten rock flow Friday. She performed a traditional Hawaiian chant and left rosemary grown in her backyard as an offering.\n\n“As a native, I’m acknowledging the space that I am in. I’m acknowledging the goddess Pele, and the people who have come before me, my ancestors,” she said. “You don’t go to anyone’s house empty-handed. So this is what I brought.”\n\nOfficials urged anyone who wants to watch the dual eruptions to be aware of the possible health hazards in the air.\n\nVolcanic emissions include sulfur dioxide, which reacts with other elements in the atmosphere and can begin to form fine particles which cause vog, a type of volcanic air pollution known as volcanic smog.\n\n“Vog creates the potential for airborne health hazards to residents and visitors, damages agricultural crops and other plants, and affects livestock operations,” the USGS said.\n\nLava shoots up Monday from a fissure of the Mauna Loa volcano. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nThe National Park Service says vulnerable groups, typically including the elderly and children, to be careful when viewing the dual eruptions.\n\n“People with pre-existing respiratory conditions are especially sensitive to poor air quality and should check the air quality alert before visiting,” the park service said.", "authors": ["Aya Elamroussi Holly Yan", "Aya Elamroussi", "Holly Yan"], "publish_date": "2022/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/09/11/kilauea-eruption-hawaiian-volcano/70820513007/", "title": "Kilauea eruption: Hawaiian volcano releases gases after months ...", "text": "Associated Press\n\nHONOLULU – Kilauea, one of the most active volcanoes in the world, began erupting Sunday after a two-month pause, displaying glowing lava that is a safe distance from people and structures in a national park on the Big Island.\n\nThe Hawaii Volcano Observatory said the eruption was observed in the afternoon at the summit of Kilauea.\n\nThe observatory said gases released by the eruption will cause volcanic smog downwind of Kilauea.

Jorge Álvarez Máynez is the third candidate.\n\n\"So many things that happen in Mexico don’t stay in Mexico; they influence the United States,\" said Shannon O'Neil, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. \"Who the next president of Mexico is really matters.\"\n\nPolitical rhetoric north of the border may leave some Americans thinking of Mexico in stereotypes and caricatures: former President Donald Trump's \"bad hombres,\" or spring breakers. But Mexico’s stamp on the U.S. is everywhere.\n\nIt’s in the Mexico-made car parts that keep U.S. autoworkers employed in Detroit, in the windmill blades exported to U.S. clean energy plants, in the pacemakers saving the lives of American patients with heart failure and in the $15 avocado toast on restaurant menus nationwide.\n\nThe country became the United States’ largest trading partner last year, pushing China to the No. 2 spot, and the two neighbors now do nearly $800 billion in trade annually, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nBut it’s a fraught relationship. Mexico is also the transit country for hundreds of thousands of U.S.-bound migrants, provoking repeated humanitarian crises at the U.S. border. And it’s the source country for the fentanyl that kills tens of thousands of Americans each year.\n\n\"If you have a president that is open to the United States and cooperating on the shared challenges and doubling down on the opportunities,\" O'Neil said, \"that is better for the United States. If you have a president who is more suspicious and doesn’t want to work with the United States, then it’s much harder.\"\n\nFrontrunner Claudia Sheinbaum calls out racism, 'machismo'\n\nSheinbaum, who has been leading in polls by double-digits, is seen as more of a left-leaning idealist than a savvy deal-maker like López Obrador. But she has promised to continue his agenda.\n\nIn a campaign rally outside Mexico's colonial-era Palacio Nacional on Wednesday, Sheinbaum, 61, lauded López Obrador as the \"best president Mexico has ever had,\" railed against \"neoliberalism\" and promised to carry on López Obrador's measures to combat inequality.\n\nThose measures include cash transfers to some 25 million Mexicans, O'Neil said, including elderly people, students and others.\n\n\"Humanism means reclaiming rights and eradicating classism, racism, machismo and discrimination – which all belong to right-wing thinking,\" Sheinbaum said.\n\nU.S.-Mexico cooperation suffered under López Obrador in some areas and held strong in others, and experts predict more of the same if Sheinbaum wins.\n\nLópez Obrador scaled back security cooperation by quitting an agreement called the Mérida Initiative, under which the U.S. had committed $1.5 billion to help Mexico battle criminal organizations. But he renegotiated the key free trade agreement between the U.S., Canada and Mexico and has continued partnering with the U.S. on one of its current top priorities: slowing migration to the U.S. border.\n\nMexican voters concerned with economy, public safety\n\nBut the issues most important to the United States – trade, immigration, border security, drug trafficking – aren't the ones that Mexicans care about most.\n\nIn regions from the industrial north to the Caribbean coast and all-important capital city of 22 million people, Mexican voters are worried about inflation, economic opportunities and public safety in their own communities.\n\nIt's the biggest election the country has ever had, with 20,708 offices up for grabs, according to the National Electoral Institute. Campaigns across Mexico have been marred by violence; a mayoral candidate in southern Guerrero state was shot to death Wednesday.\n\n\"Whoever wins will be dealing with huge issues in terms of security,\" said Jennifer Apperti, director of the Texas-Mexico Center at Southern Methodist University.\n\nIn Mexico, the next administration's focus is likely to be domestic policy, not foreign policy, she said. \"Two of the biggest domestic issues are: What are we doing about crime and also jobs?\"\n\nOfficial corruption in Mexico and insatiable demand for drugs in the U.S. have helped criminal organizations flourish across many regions in Mexico. They've amassed power to control not only the drug trade but legitimate export industries including avocados and limes. Where rival organizations fight for territory, Mexicans live under a heavy cloud of extreme violence.\n\nGálvez, the candidate trailing second in the polls, is trying to capitalize on that discontent. In her final campaign rally in the northern city of Monterrey, she called out the \"136,000 killed and 50,000 disappeared\" in Mexico during López Obrador's six-year term.\n\n\"This is the result of a security strategy in which the 'hugs' have been for criminals and the 'bullets' for citizens,\" she said, referring to López Obrador's signature \"hugs not bullets\" strategy of not tackling criminal organizations head-on.\n\nFaced with the realities of violence and weak economic growth in Mexico, in a recent poll by the El Paso, Texas-based Puente Collaborative, more than a third of Mexican respondents said they would consider migrating to the U.S. to improve their working or living conditions.\n\nA path for prosperity in U.S.-Mexico relationship\n\nBut more often Mexicans are staying put. They're finding jobs in the hundreds of assembly plants that send car parts, pacemakers, respirators, computers and Christmas lights to the U.S., or they're working in the booming tourist ports from Puerto Vallarta to Cancun.\n\nIn Mexico, the hundreds of thousands of migrants pushing north to the U.S. border are increasingly from somewhere else.\n\nIn Mexico City's enormous Zócalo public square on Wednesday, Lorenzo Pacheco held a sign for Sheinbaum. Pacheco has never worked in the U.S., he said. But with the peso gaining strength against the U.S. dollar, he recently took a four-day trip to visit the casinos of Las Vegas.\n\nHe wore the maroon color of Sheinbaum's political party, MORENA, and said he'd vote for her on Sunday. But even a militant \"morenista\" like him said the government hasn't done enough to fight organized crime.\n\n\"It's a problem the current government should handle with a tougher hand,\" he said. \"Because really they haven't solved the problem.\"\n\nLike many Mexicans, Pacheco sees a path for Mexican prosperity in its relationship with the U.S. The Puente poll found that 42% of Mexicans view the current relationship with the U.S. favorably and 60% hold a favorable opinion of U.S. citizens.\n\n\"The United States depends on Mexico as much as Mexico depends on the United States,\" Pacheco said. \"There should be more openness in trade and tourism and everything that benefits both countries. As one grows, so grows the other.\"\n\nOmar Ornelas reported from Mexico City.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/06/03/claudia-sheinbaum-becomes-mexicos-first-female-president/73952358007/", "title": "Claudia Sheinbaum becomes Mexico's first female president", "text": "Mexicans have elected their first woman president.\n\nClaudia Sheinbaum won between 58.3% and 60.7% of the vote on a historic election day, according to preliminary results announced by Mexico's National Electoral Institute Monday in an election that saw voters bear long lines to cast ballots from Mexico City to New York, Montreal and Madrid.\n\nOn Oct. 1, she'll take the reins of a country that is the United States' top trading partner and the second-largest economy in Latin America.

I'm Taylor Wilson, and today is Monday, June 3rd, 2024. This is The Excerpt.\n\nToday, Mexico has elected a new president. Plus, we take a look at Hunter Biden's gun trial which is set to begin today. And is corporate America keeping promises it made to Black Americans?\n\n♦\n\nMexicans have elected their first woman president. Claudia Sheinbaum received between 58.3 and 60.7% of the vote according to preliminary results announced by Mexico's National Electoral Institute earlier today. On October 1st, she'll become the leader of a country that is the top trade partner of the US and the second-largest economy of Latin America. She'll also be overseeing a country slammed by violence tied to organized crime. With Sheinbaum's win, Mexico beat the United States in electing a female head of state. Sheinbaum is a scientist, engineer, and former mayor of Mexico City who shares the populist ideology of her political mentor, outgoing President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. For more on what's next across the border, check out our Saturday episode of The Excerpt when I spoke with USA TODAY national reporter Lauren Villagran who put the election in context for us. You can find a link to that episode in today's show notes.\n\n♦\n\nHunter Biden's felony gun trial is set to begin today following the collapse of a deal with federal investigators last year. I spoke with USA TODAY Justice Department correspondent Bart Jansen for a look ahead. Bart, thanks for hopping on.\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nThanks for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Bart, the build-up to this trial has really been kind of start, stop, start, stop for months. What's that issue here and what's happened leading up to this week?\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nThe government had tried to reach a plea agreement with Hunter Biden last July to resolve its multi-year investigation of tax and gun complaints, and it envisioned him pleading guilty to a couple of misdemeanors for tax charges and then getting put into a pretrial diversion program over gun charges so that if he completed the program, which meant two years of sobriety and no other crimes committed, that he could have those charges wiped out entirely. So it looked like last July, he was going to be able to walk away without any jail time and resolve this lengthy investigation. Well, the plea negotiations fell apart and so the prosecutor David Weiss, who is the US Attorney in Delaware and he was later appointed to special counsel to pursue this investigation further, he indicted Hunter Biden on three felony gun charges in September. And those are the charges that are coming to trial today finally in Delaware. A second set of nine tax charges are scheduled for trial in California on September 5th.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo what can we actually expect today and the rest of this week?\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nJury selection starts today. The trial overall is expected to last a couple of weeks. The charges against Hunter Biden focus on a form that he filled out where he was asked, \"Are you the unlawful user or addicted to marijuana, depressant, stimulants, or a narcotic drug or other controlled substance?\" And he marked an X on that page. But his lawyer, Abbe Lowell, has suggested that he didn't know what the term addict or user meant at that time, and he had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and he was living with a sober companion so that he didn't view himself as a current user or addict.\n\nNow, that will be something for the jury to decide. Prosecutors have said that they want to use federal definitions of what is a user or an addict. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms says that a user or an addict is somebody who used a controlled substance within the past year or had multiple arrests during the past five years. So they take a much more expansive view. Hunter Biden's lawyers have tried to rule out that view and disputed whether the jury will be instructed to consider the charges in that way. And so that's one of the key points that we're going to be seeing in this trial.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nBart, the timing here is interesting coming just days after former President Donald Trump was found guilty on all counts in his hush money trial, and half of Americans say they believe Hunter Biden received favorable treatment from prosecutors because he's the president's son. That's according to a Reuters Ipsos poll last summer. Bart, how are Americans viewing this trial in the wake of being so focused on the former president in recent weeks?\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nWell, there's definitely a lot of skepticism about how Hunter Biden's investigation was handled because he is the son of the president. When the plea agreement was announced and the prospect of no jail time was revealed, House Republicans just blasted as a sweetheart deal. They said clearly he was giving favored treatment because he is the son of the president. Attorney General Merrick Garland has forcefully denied that. He said the investigation was carried out independently. They followed the facts and the law. And then as the plea agreement fell apart over basically a dispute between defense lawyers and prosecutors over whether Hunter Biden would be protected from potential future charges, ones that we don't even know about yet, when that deal fell apart, Garland named David Weiss, the US Attorney in Delaware, as a special counsel so he would have even more independence to pursue charges. And Weiss then came back two separate indictments, one dealing with gun charges and one dealing with tax charges.\n\nBut so then on the flip side, Democrats are now criticizing the investigation, saying that it has now become too harsh that the gun charges at stake about lying on the federal form about whether you are an addict are rarely prosecuted and that basically Hunter Biden is being prosecuted just because he is the president's son. And so it is almost flipped to the other side, the accusations that the trial is too harsh. So it is absolutely viewed through a political lens from both sides, and there'll be a lot of attention paid to how the trial goes because of the implications for potentially having the first presidential child convicted of a crime while the president is in office. That would be a first.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right. Bart Jansen covers the Justice Department for USA TODAY. Thanks, Bart.\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nThanks for having me.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAs Pride Month begins this week, LGBTQ+ communities and allies around the country are taking steps to promote safety at Pride events. In Colorado, organizers at the Pikes Peak Pride Festival are making plans to mark the event's 34th anniversary in Colorado Springs where a gunman killed five and injured 25 at the LGBTQ+ nightclub, Club Q, in 2022. Pikes Peak Pride board member Justin Burns said, \"The importance of Pride and celebrating our identity is more important than any fear.\" At a time of continuing anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric and a spate of legislative measures targeting the trans community, LGBTQ+ groups and their advocates say it's more important than ever to maintain a proud sense of identity while remaining vigilant in the face of unknown threats.\n\nLast month, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security issued a public service announcement to raise awareness of the potential targeting of LGBTQIA+ events like Pride by foreign terrorist organizations or their supporters. One national group hopes to provide the community a sense of security by training faith leaders and congregants to play a protective and calming role at Pride events around the country. Interfaith Alliance, an organization that promotes LGBTQ+ rights and inclusive faith communities, teamed with the Southern Poverty Law Center to offer the training as part of its third annual Faith for Pride initiative. You can read more about steps being taken to keep Pride safe this month with a link in today's show notes.\n\n♦\n\nAn estimated 5.4 million children provided care to parents, grandparents, or siblings with chronic medical conditions or functional decline in 2019. That was up from just over a million in 2005 according to reports from the National Alliance for Caregiving and others. An aging population, more drug and alcohol use, mental health issues, shorter hospital stays, and long COVID have likely boosted the need for kids to help in the home according to experts. And in-home care and nursing homes are hard to find and unaffordable for most, especially if you're still relatively young.\n\nPresident Joe Biden took executive action last year to expand care and raise wages, but none of them help youth caregivers. Other countries, including the UK and Australia, recognize young carers through legislation and policy and offer stipends. In the US, Medicare does not pay family members to provide care, and low income families on Medicaid can only get reimbursement for adults. Experts say help for now is left to nonprofits.\n\n♦\n\nAmid an anti-DEI backlash, is corporate America keeping the promises it made to Black Americans after George Floyd's murder? I spoke with USA TODAY senior reporter Jessica Guynn for more. Jessica, thanks for hopping on.\n\nJessica Guynn:\n\nThanks so much for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Jessica, what did companies promise when it comes to diversity in the wake of George Floyd's murder?\n\nJessica Guynn:\n\nWell, four years ago as a business journalist, I couldn't go a few minutes without a press release or a tweet from companies declaring that they were all in the fight against racial injustice and vowing to do their part after George Floyd's murder. And in these missives, they ponied up billions in financial commitments and they outlined pretty ambitious goals to make their workforces look more like America.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo are companies keeping those pledges?\n\nJessica Guynn:\n\nFor the last 10 years at USA TODAY, I've been documenting the deep racial disparities in the nation's largest and most powerful companies. And these companies were certainly signaling that they were really ready to do something about it, but then they ran headlong into a conservative-led backlash that is hellbent on vilifying just the kind of diversity efforts that they were undertaking.\n\nThis what they call anti-woke movement gain momentum last year with the Supreme Court ruling that ended affirmative action in college admissions, and activists claim that DEI in the corporate world is handing women and people of color jobs and promotions at the expense of more qualified candidates. They also argue that corporate programs that exclude white people like a fellowship or an internship geared to racial minorities is just as illegal as a program that excludes Black people. What's more, there are now questions about the legality as some of these initiatives in the wake of that ruling, and that's put the business world on the defensive. They've began to scrutinize and walk back some policies and programs they adopted after Floyd was killed, such as hiring targets for Black executives. Critics say those hiring goals are illegal quotas in disguise.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo have Black workers made any gains since Floyd's murder?\n\nJessica Guynn:\n\nBlack Americans are making headway, and we've established that in our own data investigations here at USA TODAY. For example, we reported last year that the nation's 100 largest companies had four Black CEOs and a growing number of top executives who were Black. But of course, that's just a small dent. Of the 533 top executive officers across these companies, white men were 7 in 10. And of those companies, about 1 in 7 had executive teams that were made up only of white men.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nJessica, DEI refers to diversity, equity, and inclusion. But what are some companies saying about shifting this conversation to refer to just the word inclusion instead?\n\nJessica Guynn:\n\nWell, no one wants to be caught referring to DEI anymore. Companies are dropping that language from their shareholder reports and in earnings calls. Some companies are even listing DEI as a risk factor. Instead, increasingly we're seeing talk of inclusion, and that's an attempt to sidestep some of the controversy that's been created around DEI. The idea being that creating inclusive workplaces is less likely to get you in hot water with critics since you're stressing company initiatives that are for everyone, not just certain demographic groups.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nJessica Guynn is a senior reporter with USA TODAY. Thank you, Jessica.\n\nJessica Guynn:\n\nThanks so much.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd a happy first week of June, listeners, the unofficial start to summer for many.

He called her to the altar, and she pleaded with the congregation to help her and other mothers find their missing girls.\n\nBecause Mexico's government never has.\n\nIn this city notorious for murders of women, in a country where violence against women often goes unpunished, Mexican voters on Sunday elected a woman to lead the country. Now the eyes of women are upon Claudia Sheinbaum, who makes history as the first woman to lead this country that is known for a ''macho'' culture, where women did not win the right to vote until 1953.\n\nCan she make them safer?\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nMore:Mexico has a new president, Claudia Sheinbaum. What does it mean for the United States?\n\n“I want to remind her she is a woman and a mother,” Hernández Díaz said. “And to please empathize with us, the mothers who have missing sons or daughters, and to help us find them. That’s all we want: that she not forget about us.”\n\nMore:Mexico elects first female president, Claudia Sheinbaum declared winner in historic election\n\nEmergency declaration for violence against women\n\nA month before the election, a journalist for a Mexican television program told Sheinbaum there were “high expectations” for a female president on the question of gender violence.\n\n“Despite the statistics and what they tell us,” reporter Danielle Dithurbide told her, “many times we are afraid of leaving the house and not coming home.”\n\nSheinbaum is a trained physicist who shares a Nobel prize and holds a doctorate in energy engineering. As mayor of Mexico City, she was better known as a technocrat concerned with results than a glad-handing politician like her political mentor, current President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.\n\nLópez Obrador marketed a strategy he called “Hugs Not Bullets,” which did little to reduce Mexico’s substantial problems with homicides tied to organized crime. And although he campaigned six years ago with a promise to address gender-based violence, one of his first budget cuts eliminated financial support for nonprofits working to address it.\n\n“The resources were important to educate women on recognizing the types of violence and providing psychological and legal services,” said Yadira Cortés, an activist with the Ciudad Juárez-based Red Mesa de Mujeres, which works to prevent violence against women and provide services to victims. “The cuts were his first move. After that everything changed.”\n\nWhile López Obrador was cutting budgets and sparring with feminist groups, Sheinbaum declared an emergency for violence against women in the capital. She invested in policing, investigations, prosecutions and victim services.\n\n“Most of the violence against women is family violence, and that’s where we have to start,” Sheinbaum told Dithurbide during the April interview.\n\nBut even as homicides dropped, the number of murders classified as femicides in the capital climbed by more than a third over the same period.\n\nWriting the names of 'the disappeared' on ballots\n\nThe night before the election, Sheinbaum reminded voters that she is also a mother and a grandmother.\n\nShe posted a photo with her baby grandson in her arms to X, formerly Twitter, and said, “It’s always a great happiness to spend time with family.”\n\nSocial media users pointed out that the mothers and grandmothers of the more than 100,000 disappeared persons in Mexico would say the same but with little hope of ever finding their loved ones, despite digging for their bones on their own.\n\n“The perspective of us mothers is that there isn’t much hope,” said Norma Esther Andrade, whose 17-year-old daughter was kidnapped, disappeared, and brutally murdered in 2001. Andrade’s longtime activism was a catalyst for Mexico recognizing femicide in its criminal code.\n\nBeing women “doesn’t guarantee they are feminists and it also doesn’t mean they’ll use their agenda to solve problemas,” she said.\n\nBut Cortés – whose own mother survived an attempted femicide – said she is hopeful Sheinbaum will chart her own, new path in office. Sheinbaum has brought advisors into her circle who have worked on issues of gender-based violence, she said.\n\nAndrade joined a different sort of national campaign on Sunday, she said: a movement to write in the names of the disappeared in the slot for “other candidate.”\n\nAndrade went to vote. But across the colorful pages stamped with party affiliations, she scrawled the name of her daughter in black pencil: Lilia Alejandra García Andrade, 1983-2001.\n\nVoting in Ciudad Juárez, the city with highest femicides\n\nAfter the Mass on Sunday, Hernández Díaz headed home to vote in her local polling station in a neighborhood on the city’s outskirts.\n\nThirteen years after her daughter's disappearance, Ciudad Juárez is still unsafe for women. The city ranked at the top of any Mexican city for gender-based murders of women, registering 26 femicides 2022, according statistics from the country's security and protection agency.\n\nThe last time she saw her daughter – a fan of electronic music who had just finished her first semester in college – it was April 2011.

Her term will begin on Oct. 1, 2024.\n\nWho is Claudia Sheinbaum?\n\nBorn in Mexico City to a chemical engineer, Carlos Sheinbaum Yoselevitz, and a teacher and biology doctor, Annie Pardo Cemo, Sheinbaum's childhood was shaped by the student-led social movement calling for greater democracy and the ensuing massacre at the hands of the federal government that marked a milestone in the political history of Mexico in 1968.\n\nSheinbaum first met the current president in 1991, during her participation in the Exodus for Democracy, a march led by Andrés Manuel López Obrador from the southern state of Tabasco — which sits on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico — to Mexico City to protest fraud during the Tabasco gubernatorial elections.\n\nEight years later, Sheinbaum joined his team when he became Mexico City's head of government, or mayor, and as his environment secretary in 2000. Since then, she has remained in line with his politics.\n\nHer path as a presidential candidate began with the creation of the MORENA party after López Obrador's second defeat in 2012. Under this banner, Sheinbaum ran as a local candidate in Mexico City's elections in 2015, thus solidifying the legitimacy of the party and paving the way for López Obrador's third successful presidential run in 2018.\n\nThat same year, Sheinbaum made history by becoming the first woman elected as head of government of Mexico City. She also became the first person of Jewish descent elected to that position.\n\nIn 2023, she resigned to run for president and in September of that year, López Obrador officially handed the party's nomination to Sheinbaum.\n\nHas Mexico ever had a woman president?\n\nNo, Mexico has never had a female president, although women have run for office in the past. Since 1824 with the arrival of the first Mexican president, Guadalupe Victoria, the country has only seen male leaders.\n\nWho is Mexico's current president?\n\nMexico’s current president is Andrés Manuel López Obrador. He was elected in 2018 after a third attempt at running for office.\n\nDoes Mexico have a directly elected president?\n\nYes, Mexico’s president is elected by its citizens through direct voting and the candidate who obtains the majority of votes becomes the country's leader.\n\nWhen was the president of Mexico elected?\n\nLast time Mexico had a presidential election was July 1, 2018, in which López Obrador became head of the nation. His six-year term ends on Oct. 1.\n\nHow long is the president of Mexico elected for?\n\nMexican presidents serve for a six-year term, also known as a “sexenio” and they cannot be reelected.\n\nReach La Voz reporter Paula Soria at psoriaaguilar@gannett.com.\n\nOpinions:Claudia Sheinbaum and Mexico just taught us a few things about elections", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/04/24/who-is-claudia-sheinbaum-mexico-presidential-election/73437799007/", "title": "Mexican presidential candidate would be country's first woman ...", "text": "Mexico is holding their biggest election yet in June, including selecting a new president who is likely to make history.\n\nMexico's President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has reached his term limit, and when the two leading political parties put forward women as their candidates, it became all but certain the winner of the June 2 presidential election will be the country's first female leader.\n\nFormer Mexico City mayor and ruling party candidate Claudia Sheinbaum, also known as Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo, is the favorite to win the race, and as Reuters reported, she shows an increasing lead in local polls.\n\nNot only would she be the first woman president of Mexico, she would also be the first president with a Jewish background.\n\nHere is what else to know about the front runner in Mexico's presidential race:\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nInternational politics at home:Ukraine, Israel aid package heads to Biden as Congress caps months-long struggle\n\nWho is Claudia Sheinbaum?\n\nSheinbaum is the presidential candidate for the leftist National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) party. Morena is the current ruling party with President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.\n\nSheinbaum, 61, was the mayor of Mexico City from December 2018, until stepping down to pursue the presidential candidacy.\n\nShe has a Jewish background in her four grandparents who immigrated from Lithuania and Bulgaria, according to the Associated Press, but calls herself a woman of faith who does not adhere to any religion. Mexico's population is 78% Roman Catholic, according to 2020 census data.\n\nSheinbaum is tailed at a distance by candidates Xóchitl Gálvez and Jorge Álvarez Máynez in the polls. If elected, she would serve a six-year term until 2030.\n\nLeftist candidate Claudia Sheinbaum wants to focus on renewable energy\n\nSheinbaum is scientist specializing in energy with a Ph.D from National Autonomous University of Mexico. She has served on the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as part of a team that won a 2007 Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nShe recently unveiled an ambitious plan to pledge $13.6 billion in wind and solar power generation projects, according to Reuters. It would be a break from the current president's policies which invested in the state oil company Pemex, though Sheinbaum generally wants to continue with President López Obrador's legacy if elected.\n\n\"We are working on the national energy plan not only through 2030, but to 2050,\" Sheinbaum said, according to Reuters.\n\nMexico and US to navigate new relationships after 2024 elections\n\nMexico's next president will have to contend with the elections happening next door as the U.S. is likely headed for a rematch between former President Donald Trump and current President Joe Biden. But Mexican voters choice could also play a role in some key aspects of the U.S. elections.\n\nImmigration is a big issue for many voters in the 2024 presidential election, not to mention responses to climate change and conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza require international coordination.\n\nA rematch between Biden and Trump, both who have been president while current Mexico President López Obrador has been in office, offers insight into how the relationship might continue if Morena remains the governing party through the Mexican presidential election.\n\nAP called López Obrador's relationship with Trump \"strangely warm,\" considering Trump's rhetoric about building a wall on their shared border. AP also said López Obrador had fewer public disagreements with Trump than Biden.\n\nBut Bloomberg reported Sheinbaum says that, if elected, she would maintain a \"good relationship\" with the next U.S. president, given the close economic ties.\n\nContributing: Corrie Boudreaux, El Paso Times; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2024/06/01/mexican-general-election-mexico-president-cartels/73911514007/", "title": "Cartels run parts of Mexico.

Sheinbaum uses the hashtag #EsTiempodeMujeres, meaning “this is women’s time”, and told Gatopardo that “girls see an example in me”. Gálvez says she rebelled against her abusive father to pursue education, and when a man tried to rape her when she was 17 she fought back with a soldering iron.\n\nViolence against women has been rising. “In Mexico, some 10 women and girls are killed every day by intimate partners or other family members,” according to the UN. Women have been “dying at a frightening pace”, The Associated Press reported, a result of “cultural machismo, systemic gender inequality and latent domestic violence”. Even when crimes are punished, many view sentences as too lenient.\n\nThe current president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has faced criticism for his inability to stop Mexico becoming a “femicide nation”, The Guardian reported last year.\n\nAnd in August he “sparked ridicule and outrage” when he responded to more questions on the subject by suggesting that he too could be the victim of gender-based violence. “Everything they say to me, isn’t that gender-based violence?” López Obrador said. “Or is gender only female?”\n\nSheinbaum and Gálvez have put women’s rights at the forefront of their respective agendas. And the feminist movement has already brought about change. Last week the Supreme Court, which in January elected its first female president, legalised abortion, stating the “denial of the possibility of a termination violated the human rights of women”. The majority of senators are now women and the central bank governor is female.\n\n“It’s not quite Barbie Land,” said The Washington Post, “but the progress is remarkable in a country where women couldn’t even vote until 1953.”\n\nNext June’s election is “a feminist’s dream”, Mexican women’s rights activist Maricruz Ocampo told the newspaper. It “is going to signify a turn in the way that we see women in politics”.\n\nMany women in Mexico, who make up 52% of the population, “hope the government that takes office in October 2024 will empower them as never before”, said Reuters.\n\nOthers are more cautiously optimistic. “They’re not magical unicorns; they don’t have magic wands,” Jennifer Piscopo, professor of gender and politics at the University of London, told The Washington Post. “They’re not going to fix centuries of discrimination against women overnight.”", "authors": ["Rebekah Evans", "The Week Uk", "The Week Staff", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Sorcha Bradley", "Peter Weber", "The Week Us", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/09/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/09/07/mexico-woman-president-election-candidates-claudia-sheinbaum-xochitl-galvez/70785828007/", "title": "Mexico likely to get its first woman president in 2024 election", "text": "Maria Verza\n\nAssociated Press\n\nMEXICO CITY (AP) — With the selection of former Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum as the candidate of the country's ruling party in next June's election, Mexico will for the first time have time two women from its main political movements competing for the presidency.\n\nSheinbaum, as well as the opposition candidate Xóchitl Gálvez, have insisted that Mexico is ready to be led by a woman, but it will not be an easy path.\n\nBorderland:Mexican army special forces soldiers sent to Juárez as murders surge\n\nOn Wednesday night, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador's Morena party announced that Sheinbaum had defeated five internal party rivals – all men. López Obrador has put women in important positions in his Cabinet and been a mentor for Sheinbaum, even while being accused at times of male chauvinism.\n\nMexico still has famously intense \"machismo\" or male chauvinism, expressed in its most extreme form in a high rate of femicides, but also daily in hundreds of more subtle ways.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nMexico has a strong \"macho vote,\" said Gloria Alcocer Olmos, director of the electoral magazine \"Voice and Vote,\" adding that it is not exclusive to male voters.\n\nAlcocer Olmos noted that in June's gubernatorial election in the state of Mexico – the country's most populous jurisdiction – the race was between two female candidates \"and turnout was the lowest in history.\" The same thing occurred in the state election in Aguascalientes in 2021, she said.\n\n\"What does that tell us?\" she asked. \"That the people are voting for women? The reality is that no, and the saddest thing is that women themselves are not voting for women.\"\n\nImmigration:U.S. State Department officials say 'full court press' underway to address mass migration\n\nSuch low turnout in the June 2 presidential election is less likely because so much is at stake, Alcocer Olmos said. There is also the possibility that the Citizen Movement party, which controls Nuevo Leon and Jalisco – two of the most economically important states – could nominate a male candidate who would attract that macho vote, she said.\n\nAnother question mark is what former Foreign Affairs Secretary Marcelo Ebrard will do. As Sheinbaum's closest rival in Morena he did not accept the results of the internal party selection process, claiming there were irregularities.\n\nMorena controls 22 of Mexico's 32 states and López Obrador remains highly popular, giving Sheinbaum a strong advantage. But Gálvez emerged from virtual obscurity, helped largely by daily public criticism from López Obrador, to become the consensus candidate of the largely directionless opposition.\n\nAurora Pedroche, a Morena activist who supports Sheinbaum, suggested another problem should one of the female candidates win the presidency. Given the greatly increased power and responsibility that López Obrador has given the military during his administration \"how are they going to accept a woman as commander in chief?\"\n\n\"That scares me,\" Pedroche said.\n\nMore:In Mexico, accusations of 'communism' and 'fascism' mark school textbook debate\n\nWhile Mexican women have advanced to positions of political power in public life – in part because of required representation quotas for public office -- women suffer from high levels of gender violence. Femicides – cases of women killed because of their gender – have been a persistent problem for decades.\n\nSheinbaum represents continuation of López Obrador's social agenda, but without his charisma to take on an opponent in Gálvez who has an ease of connecting with people that is more reminiscent of the outgoing president.\n\nThe independent Gálvez is representing the Broad Front for Mexico, a coalition of the conservative National Action Party, the small progressive Democratic Revolution Party, and the old-guard Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, that held Mexico's presidency without interruption between 1929 and 2000.\n\nGálvez caucuses with the National Action Party in the Senate but is not a member.\n\nStrategist Antonio Sola, who worked on the 2006 campaign of former President Felipe Calderón and later with one of the parties that helped López Obrador win, thinks Gálvez's outsider image could help her.\n\nWith much of the world experiencing the end of a political era dominated by traditional candidates, the emerging figures are those who are \"kicking the system,\" he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/07"}]}

It is hardly the scene where one would expect to find the climate’s salvation.\n\nAnd yet as Luis Guedes Pinto climbed his sky-high perch above a reclaimed swath of Brazil’s Atlantic Forest, he explained you don’t have to go to the Arctic or even the Amazon to learn how to nurse Earth’s forests back to health.\n\n“This project doesn’t change a big landscape, but it shows it’s possible to bring back life, to bring back water, to bring back biodiversity, to the center of the state of Sao Paulo,” said Pinto, the CEO at SOS Mata Atlântica, as he pointed down to two square miles of forest restoration.\n\nPinto’s organization is a non-profit devoted to rehabilitating the swath of forest on Brazil’s Atlantic coast. The forest itself is home to more than 145 million Brazilians, and — just as the Amazon rainforest has been ravaged by deforestation in the past several years — around three-quarters of it has already been wiped out by urban and infrastructure development and aggressive agribusiness practices.\n\n“We need to plant and replant, but we cannot lose another acre,” Pinto said as he guided CNN through a nursery with more than 50 species of carefully cultivated trees and plants in what was once degraded, drought-prone pasture. “A forest we replant is not going to be the same as a forest we cut down. Some of the forests we’re losing have trees in them that are hundreds of years old.”\n\nThese are the seedlings of a forest’s revival. In just 15 years, it has become a thriving eco-lab with a healthy water table, trees, plants and animals. It is a completely different landscape to the pasture land on its borders, where drought-stricken grass overtakes acres of what was previously forest.\n\nThe SOS Mata Atlantica was able to recover this patch of pasture and restore it into a wild habitat.

Data from Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research show the rate of deforestation under Bolsonaro’s presidency climbed by more than 70% from 2018 to 2021.\n\nAlready the Amazon rainforest is emitting more carbon dioxide than it absorbs in some locations — a shift that could have an enormous negative impact on global warming trends. And scientists warn the precious rainforest is nearing a point of irreversible decline and is less capable of recovering from disturbances like drought, logging and wildfires.\n\nLuiz Inácio Lula da Silva speaks during a campaign rally in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on July 7, 2022.

And his new promise goes even further: to reach zero deforestation in Brazil. This would be substantially more ambitious than his previous government’s goal to eliminate illegal deforestation, not deforestation of all kinds.\n\nSpeaking at the UN’s COP27 climate summit on Wednesday in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, Lula told a jam-packed conference room that “Brazil is back to resume its ties with the world,” and there is “no climate security for the world without a protected Amazon, and we will do whatever it takes to have a different vision in the degradation.”\n\nHe also promised to punish those who are responsible for the deforestation in Amazon, and announced a new ministry for indigenous people “so that the indigenous people themselves can present and propose to the government about policies that can derive their survival with dignity and security, peace and sustainability.”\n\nHis remarks were met with huge applause that trickled out of the conference room into the hallway, where people who were not able to get into the crowded room, but eager to hear Lula speak on the climate crisis, watched from their phones.\n\nBut Bolsonaro allies, who continue to control congress, could make climate action much more difficult over the next four years. One of those allies is Ricardo Salles, Bolsonaro’s former environment minister and now a newly elected lawmaker in Brazil’s conservative-leaning congress.\n\nFormer environment minister and Brazilian lawmaker Ricardo Salles argues the best way to protect the Amazon is to make it economically viable for the populations living in and around it. Vasco Cotovio/CNN\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Salles said he and others are willing to work with Lula’s incoming administration on climate goals, but cautioned it should not come at the expense of economic development.\n\n“I was the only guy as minister of environment in the entire history of the ministry who brought these economic questions to the table,” said Salles. During his time as environment minister, the Bolsonaro government often described development and economic activity in the Amazon as vital to longterm sustainability – an approach decried by many environmental activists in the country.\n\nSalles says Brazil will have to work closely now with international allies into order to tap the billions of dollars in climate funds and carbon credits now on offer both by governments and businesses worldwide.\n\nBut climate advocates argue neither Brazil nor the planet can afford the kind of compromises now being advocated by Bolsonaro allies.\n\nIndigenous activist Txai Surui supported Lula da Silva during his latest presidential campaign, but vows to oppose him should his policies go against the environment. Vasco Cotovio/CNN\n\n“We don’t need to destroy to develop. We can do that in harmony with nature. And it’s the indigenous peoples who teach that,” Brazilian indigenous leader Txai Suruí told CNN.\n\nSuruí said she is optimistic Lula’s government will make good on promises to act quickly, despite the economic pressure from not only Bolsonaro allies, but millions in the Amazon whose livelihoods depend on its commercial development.\n\n“Because that agenda — of the Amazon, of climate change, of the environment — it’s a global agenda,” she said. “If Lula does not address it, it won’t just be us, indigenous people, that will be knocking on his door, it’ll be the entire world.”\n\nThe urgency to commit to those goals is not lost on Pinto who says it’s not just Brazil’s future that is at stake.\n\n“We need to understand as a nation that is key for the planet and that decisions we will make will be important for us but also for others,” he says.\n\nThe SOS Mata Atlântica nursery, where hundreds of saplings are grown before being replanted in the wilderness.

That prompted a whistleblower to accuse Trump of asking a foreign government to interfere in the 2020 presidential election, which is now the subject of an impeachment inquiry.\n\nTrump's assertion contradicted\n\nThe actions at the center of Trump's allegation occurred in late 2015 and early 2016, when U.S. aid was critical to Ukraine. Russia had seized control of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and was supporting separatists who were fighting Ukrainian forces in the eastern part of the country.\n\nBiden took an interest in Ukraine, said Steven Pifer, a William J. Perry fellow at Stanford University and former ambassador to Ukraine under President Bill Clinton.\n\n\"You saw the vice president begin to emerge as really sort of the senior policy lead on Ukraine,\" Pifer said. \"It's good to have attention at that level.\"\n\nAt one point, Biden withheld $1 billion in aid to Ukraine to pressure the government to remove Shokin from the Prosecutor General's Office.\n\nTrump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani claim Biden did this to quash Shokin's investigation into Ukraine's largest gas company, Burisma Holdings, and its owner, oligarch Mykola Zlochevsky.\n\nThey say this benefited Biden's son, Hunter Biden, who served on Burisma's board of directors – for which he was paid $50,000 a month.\n\nTheir assertion is contradicted by former diplomatic officials who were following the issue at the time.\n\nBurisma Holdings was not under scrutiny at the time Joe Biden called for Shokin's ouster, according to the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine, an independent agency set up in 2014 that has worked closely with the FBI.\n\nShokin's office had investigated Burisma, but the probe focused on a period before Hunter Biden joined the company, according to the anti-corruption bureau.\n\nThe investigation dealt with the Ministry of Ecology, which allegedly granted special permits to Burisma between 2010 and 2012, the agency said. Hunter Biden did not join the company until 2014.\n\nRead it yourself: The full declassified text of the Trump whistleblower complaint\n\nCritics of Hunter Biden have questioned how he landed such a lucrative role with no experience in Ukraine or the gas industry.\n\nBut it's not unusual for Ukrainian companies to bring on high-profile people from the West in an effort to burnish their image and gain influence, Pifer said.\n\nCofer Black, who served as Bush's CIA counterterrorism chief, joined Burisma's board in 2017.\n\nThere is no evidence Hunter Biden did anything wrong, said Yuri Lutsenko, the prosecutor general who succeeded Shokin.\n\nHowever, Lutsenko, who's also faced criticism for his actions as prosecutor, supported Trump's claim before changing his story. He resigned as prosecutor in August.\n\nThe Burisma investigation ended with a settlement and a fine paid by one of the firm's accountants, according to Sergii Leshchenko, a former Ukrainian lawmaker who spearheaded anti-corruption efforts under former President Petro Poroshenko.\n\nHow Biden leveraged U.S. aid to oust prosecutor\n\nIn the wake of the 2014 ouster of pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych, European and U.S. officials stepped up their efforts to deal with corruption in Ukraine.\n\n\"A big part of our diplomacy was pushing the Ukrainian government to clean up the corruption, partly because it was that corruption that allowed Russia to manipulate the country politically and economically,\" said Charlie Kupchan, who served as a special assistant to President Barack Obama and a senior director for European Affairs on the National Security Council.\n\nBiden used U.S. aid as \"a stick to move Ukraine forward,\" Kupchan said. \"He was acting alongside our European allies. Everybody was of a single mind that this prosecutor was not the right guy for the job.\"\n\nBiden has boasted about his role in getting Shokin fired. During a 2018 speech at the Council on Foreign Relations, he said he withheld $1 billion in loan guarantees for Ukraine in order to force the government to address the problem with its top prosecutor.\n\n\"I looked at them and said: 'I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money. Well, son of a bitch. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time,\" he said.\n\nPifer, who also oversaw diplomacy with Russia and Ukraine under President George W. Bush, said it was appropriate for Biden to use U.S. aid as leverage. He said he used similar methods to pressure Ukraine.\n\nEven without any credible evidence that Joe Biden sought to benefit his son, Pifer said Hunter Biden showed poor judgment in getting involved with Ukraine.\n\n\"At that point, it was pretty clear that his father was already the lead American policy person on Ukraine,\" he said. \"And even if there's no conflict of interest, I think that he should have been more mindful of how that appears.\"\n\nInternational effort to fight corruption in Ukraine\n\nThe international effort to remove Shokin, who became prosecutor general in February 2015, began months before Biden stepped into the spotlight, said Mike Carpenter, who served as a foreign policy adviser to Biden and a deputy assistant secretary of defense, with a focus on Ukraine, Russia, Eurasia, the Balkans, and conventional arms control.\n\nAs European and U.S. officials pressed Ukraine to clean up Ukraine's corruption, they focused on Shokin's leadership of the Prosecutor General's Office.\n\n\"Shokin played the role of protecting the vested interest in the Ukrainian system,\" said Carpenter, who traveled with Biden to Ukraine in 2015. \"He never went after any corrupt individuals at all, never prosecuted any high-profile cases of corruption.\"\n\nThat demonstrated that Poroshenko's administration was not sincere about tackling corruption and building strong, independent law enforcement agencies, said Heather Conley, director of the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based foreign policy think tank.\n\nIn July 2015, Shokin's office became mired in scandal after authorities raided homes belonging to two high-ranking prosecutors. Police seized millions of dollars worth of diamonds and cash, suggesting the pair had been taking bribes.\n\nIt became known as the \"diamond prosecutors\" case. Deputy General Prosecutor Vitaliy Kasko, who said he tried to investigate it, resigned months later, calling the prosecutor's office a \"hotbed of corruption\" and an \"instrument of political pressure.\"\n\nShokin's office also stepped in to help Zlochevsky, the head of Burisma.\n\nBritish authorities had frozen $23 million in a money-laundering probe, but Shokin's office failed to send documents British authorities needed to prosecute Zlochevsky. The case eventually unraveled and the assets were unfrozen.\n\nIn October 2015, Ukrainians staged a protest outside Poroshenko's home calling for Shokin's removal.\n\nPressure mounts to remove Shokin\n\nIn late 2015, U.S. officials stepped up the pressure.\n\nDuring a September 2015 speech at a financial forum in Odessa, U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt decried the inability of Shokin's office to root out corruption.\n\nBiden and Ukraine: Will Trump's efforts to discredit the former VP hurt him?\n\n\"Rather than supporting Ukraine's reforms and working to root out corruption,\" Pyatt said, \"corrupt actors within the Prosecutor General’s Office are making things worse by openly and aggressively undermining reform.\"\n\nIn October 2015, then-Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland told the Senate Foreign Relations committee the Prosecutor General's Office must lock up \"dirty personnel\" in its own office.\n\nIn December 2015, Biden railed against the \"cancer of corruption\" in a speech before the country's parliament and called out Shokin's office.\n\nBesides Biden's threat over the $1 billion in aid, the International Monetary Fund threatened to delay $40 billion in aid for similar reasons.\n\nShokin was eventually removed from his position in the spring of 2016.\n\nThe decision to remove Shokin \"creates an opportunity to make a fresh start in the Prosecutor General's Office,\" said Jan Tombinski, the EU's ambassador to Ukraine, in a written statement.\n\n\"I hope,\" Tombinski said, \"that the new Prosecutor General will ensure that the Office of the Prosecutor General becomes independent from political influence and pressure and enjoys public trust.\"\n\nContributing: Kim Hjelmgaard", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/03"}]}

Bettmann/Bettmann/Bettmann Archive\n\nThat a Gandhi is not going to be the face of India’s oldest political unit is almost unthinkable to many – a member of the family has been in charge of it for 40 out of its 75 years of independence, and involved in the leadership for much of the other 35 years.\n\nBut analysts say as the country shifts into a new era, riding on a wave of right-wing, nationalist politics, the family and the Congress has little significance in the country’s political present, driven in part by numerous corruption scandals and mismanagement within the party.\n\n“The Gandhis today are completely dwarfed and overshadowed by Narendra Modi,” said New Delhi-based political commentator Arati R. Jerath.\n\n“It’s hard to predict the future, but for a family that ruled much of independent India, it is unlikely we will see a Gandhi leader of the country again.”\n\nThe Nehru-Gandhi legacy\n\nAs a powerful political dynasty, some have likened the Gandhis to the Kennedys, having for decades carefully navigated a series of personal tragedies alongside a tough power balancing act.\n\nThe family doesn’t take its name from Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, the country’s famed independence leader.\n\nInstead, they are the descendants of Jawaharlal Nehru, who was instrumental in the country’s independence movement from British rule and in 1947 became its first prime minister. Nehru’s daughter Indira adopted the Gandhi name through her marriage to Feroze Gandhi, another party member unrelated to its leader.\n\nIndira would later succeed her father, before handing the leadership to her son, Rajiv. Later, his wife, Sonia Gandhi, and son, Rahul, would take over.\n\nNehru ruled for 17 years after independence from British rule, ushering India into a new era after its bloody partition, that led to the creation of Pakistan, caused the deaths of 2 million people and uprooted an estimated 15 million more.\n\nNehru united the impoverished nation by planting the seeds for decades of economic, social and political development.\n\n“He was part of the freedom struggle, and so he wanted to ensure that India reach her potential and grow,” Jerath said. “He wanted to lead his people into a brave new world.”\n\nThroughout his time in power Nehru promoted democracy and secularism, invested in science and technology, built leading educational institutes, and promoted gender equality in the deeply patriarchal country.\n\nWhen he died while in office on May 28, 1964, tributes poured in from all over the world. Two years later, his daughter, Indira Gandhi (who adopted her husband’s last name), would fill his shoes as the country’s first – and so far only – female prime minister.\n\nGroomed for the position from an early age, Indira Gandhi was considered an astute, strong-willed, and to some, autocratic leader.\n\nFormer Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi at Delhi's historic Red Fort. Bettmann Archive/Getty images\n\nShe was elected prime minister from 1966 to 1977, and again in 1980. But her years in office were marked with both personal tragedy – her son Sanjay died shortly into her second stint – and turbulence, owing, in part, to a war with Pakistan, droughts, famine and an economic crisis.\n\nFaced with growing discontent, Indira Gandhi proclaimed a controversial state of emergency in India for 21 months in 1975 – suspending basic liberties, imposing press censorship and imprisoning opposition members.\n\nHer years in power came to a tragic climax when, on October 31, 1984, she was shot dead at her home in New Delhi by her Sikh bodyguards, four months after she ordered Indian troops to storm the Golden Temple – one of Sikhism’s holiest shrines – to flush out separatists.\n\n“The mood of the nation changed following the assassination,” said Rasheed Kidwai, author of “Sonia, A Biography” and visiting Fellow with the Observer Research Foundation. “But the tragic part of it is, it has a law of diminishing returns. These days, not a lot of our young children know of the sacrifices and tough decisions that were made by her.”\n\nIndira Gandhi’s son, Rajiv, took over from her after her death.\n\nRajiv Gandhi and his Italian-born wife, Sonia, during a campaign trip. Alain Nogues/Sygma/Getty Images\n\nKnown as the “unwilling” prime minister who never wanted the job, Rajiv Gandhi became the youngest leader at the age of 40. But he served less than a decade, losing the 1989 general election following a corruption scandal, and was assassinated two years later by the Sri Lankan separatist group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.\n\nDuring his tenure, he signed peace accords with insurgent groups in states where religious tensions were high, and is credited for developing India’s science and technology sectors, giving him the moniker “Father of Information and Technology.”\n\nWith no Gandhi at the helm, and the emergence of the BJP in the 1990s, the Congress struggled. In the years that followed, India’s leadership swung between parties.\n\nIt wasn’t until Rajiv’s Italian-born widow, Sonia, took over as leader of the Congress in 1998 that they made a political comeback.\n\nSix years later, she led the party to victory in the general election – but stopped short of taking the top position and instead appointed economist Manmohan Singh as prime minister.\n\nBut with the ascendance of a new wave of right-wing politics, their party now lurks in the political wilderness, analysts say. In 2014, Modi was elected prime minister with a roaring majority.\n\n“(The Gandhis) exude the tragic glamor of the Kennedys,” said Jerath, the political commentator. “This was a family that built India’s education, health care and technology institutions. Their legacy is still felt today.”\n\nRise of the right-wing\n\nOn July 3, 2019, following a humiliating and crushing defeat in the Indian general election, Rahul Gandhi publicly resigned as leader of the Congress.\n\nModi’s BJP had just won a historic majority in the lower house of parliament, cementing the antithesis to Gandhi’s Congress as the most formidable political force in Indian politics in decades.\n\n“Modi has perfected the narrative that the Gandhis are the liberal elite, the dynasty that shouldn’t be in power,” said Kidwai, the author. “And as the country shifts towards the right, his politics are proving tremendously popular.”\n\nThe BJP has its roots in Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right wing-Hindu group that are adherents of Hindutva ideology – to make India the land of the Hindus.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi gives a victory speech after winning India's general election, in New Delhi on May 23, 2019. Prakash Singh/AFP/Getty Images\n\nNearly 80% of the country’s 1.3 billion people are Hindus, and analysts say Modi’s populist politics appeal to the masses.\n\n“India is changing. As democracy has deepened, we have seen the rise of a new class of people – and this class really is not schooled in the Nehruvian principles of democracy,” Jerath said. “They are willing to buy into Hindutva politics of the Modi-led BJP. And this is something that this generation of the Gandhis have not been able to counter.”\n\nMoreover, analysts point to decades of infighting and mismanagement within the Congress party, that have weakened its position in the country. Rahul and Sonia Gandhi have also been accused of corruption – allegations they deny.\n\nThe second term of the last Congress prime minister to govern India was riddled with allegations of corruption and bribery scandals running into tens of millions of dollars.\n\nModi’s humble beginnings as the son of a tea seller, versus the Gandhis’ privileged and Western-influenced upbringing, also makes him more relatable to an emerging middle-class population, Jerath said. Nehru, like Rajiv and Rahul, was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge. His daughter, Indira, at Oxford University.\n\n“Rahul Gandhi kept looking for success but it was rather elusive,” Kidwai said. “That’s why he’s taken on a different role and gone on this campaign across the country.”\n\nAs Rahul Gandhi continues on his journey to unite the country, he may succeed in rebuilding the image of the Congress. But it seems unlikely he will ever become prime minister of the country, like his father, grandmother and great-grandfather before him. He never married and has no children. His sister, Priyanka, also a member of the party, has two young children – but it is unclear if they will ever foray into political life.\n\nAll eyes will be on the next leader, as he attempts to get enough votes to unseat Modi in 2024.\n\n“Modi certainly has a grip on power,” Jerath said. “But if the Congress can get their act together, then we may just see a comeback.”", "authors": ["Rhea Mogul"], "publish_date": "2022/10/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/05/23/indie-election-results-narendra-modis-party-has-commanding-lead/1202744001/", "title": "India election results: Narendra Modi's party has commanding lead", "text": "Emily Schmall\n\nAssociated Press\n\nNEW DELHI – Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his party had a commanding lead as votes were counted Thursday after a six-week general election, sending the stock market soaring in anticipation of another five-year term for the Hindu nationalist leader.\n\nElection Commission data by late morning showed the Bharatiya Janata Party leading in contests for 300 out of 542 seats in the lower house of Parliament, with its main rival, the Indian National Congress, ahead in 50 contests.\n\nThe data didn’t indicate what percentage of the estimated 600 million votes had been counted.

A party or coalition needs a simple majority of 272 seats, or just over half the seats in Parliament’s lower house, to govern.\n\nIf BJP’s lead holds, it won’t need a coalition partner to stay in power.\n\n“Mr. Modi’s going to be the next prime minister, we are very assured of that,” said Meenakshi Lekhi, a member of Parliament running for re-election in New Delhi.\n\nBy midmorning, India’s Sensex had jumped 2.3% to an all-time high over 40,000.\n\nMore:After Trump and Brexit, the EU Parliament vote could further a populist wave\n\nOutside BJP headquarters in New Delhi, hundreds of people cheered and shouted party slogans, lifting cardboard cut-outs of Modi and BJP President Amit Shah into the air as other people played drums and set off fireworks.\n\nMohit Sharma, a 29-year-old who runs a bathroom fittings business, said India had never had a prime minister like Modi.\n\n“In the past, when leaders after they won elections, they sat in air-conditioned rooms and they never reached out to people, but Modi was never like that. He was always connected to the people through social media,” Sharma said.\n\nFashion designer Sandeep Verma, 39, said he wasn’t a BJP supporter but had voted for the party in the elections.\n\n“A country like India needs a decisive leader and the people did not find that in Rahul Gandhi. There was no alternative to Modi,” Verma said.\n\nThe BJP harnessed social media, including Twitter, where Modi has 47.4 million followers, and WhatsApp to reach out to millions of supporters.\n\nMeanwhile, at Congress headquarters, only a few party workers stood outside looking dejected.\n\nJagdish Sharma, 50, blamed the counting method, using electronic voting machines, saying “Rahul Gandhi is the crowd’s favorite, but has always lost only due to EVMs. While EVMs exist even Lord Vishnu can’t defeat Modi,” he said, referring to a powerful Hindu god.\n\nVoters cast ballots on some 40 million electronic voting machines, a method India began using 15 years ago after complaints that the manual count of paper ballots was tainted by fraud and abuse. But losing candidates and political parties have raised doubts about the accuracy and reliability of the electronic method, doing so again this week.\n\nTop opposition leaders met with Election Commission officials on Tuesday after videos appeared on social media showing some electronic voting machines being moved. The party officials alleged that the machines were going to be altered, but the commission said the images showed unused machines being moved into storage.\n\nThe machines print a paper slip each time a vote is cast that is locked inside a box. A random sampling of a small percentage of paper printouts will be checked against the computerized results. The time it takes to compare the paper and digital ballots is expected to delay the results by several hours.\n\n–––\n\nAssociated Press journalists Rishabh R.

Uttar Pradesh votes for the largest chunk of legislators in the national parliament, and the BJP’s presence in the state is likely to bolster support for Modi when he stands for election for a third time in 2024.\n\nModi has fiercely backed Adityanath during his campaign in Uttar Pradesh, and Thursday’s win means controversial Adityanath is set to be reinstalled as the state’s chief minister.\n\nThursday’s result is a slip on the 2017 result, when the BJP soared to victory, winning 312 out of 403 legislative assembly seats.\n\n“Today is a day to celebrate India’s democracy. I congratulate all voters who took part in this election,” Modi said Thursday as he addressed a massive, cheering crowd at the BJP headquarters in Delhi.\n\nThe BJP also won elections in the states of Manipur, Uttarakhand and Goa, while in the northern state of Punjab, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s party, the Aam Aadmi Party, toppled India’s main opposition, the Congress Party, which had previously held the state.\n\nWhy the win is significant\n\nDuring his five years as chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, Adityanath became known for his provocative rhetoric against Muslims. In a 2019 speech, he said the Muslim vote was a “green virus” trying to take over the country. In February, he used a derogatory word when referring to Muslim men in an interview with a local television channel.\n\nAnd in the past five years, the state has passed legislation that critics say is deeply rooted in Hindutva ideology – which seeks to make Hindu values culturally dominant.\n\nIt has made the transport and sale of cows – an animal considered sacred to Hindus – more difficult, and aggressively campaigned to shut down slaughterhouses. In 2020, the state introduced a controversial anti-conversion bill, which makes it harder for interfaith couples to marry or for people to convert to Islam or Christianity. Some cities named after historic Muslim figures have had their names changed to reflect India’s Hindu history.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Students spark protests in India over hijab row 02:11 - Source: CNN\n\nBut ahead of the election, the BJP faced two of its toughest political obstacles in the state in recent years: a devastating second wave of Covid infections last year, and a year-long protest by farmers, some of whom traveled from Uttar Pradesh and occupied roads on the outskirts of India’s capital Delhi for months.\n\nLast year, Uttar Pradesh faced an unprecedented health crisis as coronavirus cases surged throughout India, leading to overwhelmed hospitals and overcrowded crematoriums. Since the start of the pandemic, the state has recorded more than 23,000 deaths – but the number is considered to be a gross underestimation by experts.\n\nThe BJP has faced allegations of underreporting its cases and deaths, with families accusing the government of not being well-prepared.\n\nThe opposing left-leaning Samajwadi Party, led by the 48-year-old former chief minister, Akhilesh Yadav, attempted to play on these accusations.\n\nBut it wasn’t enough to wrestle control of the state back from the BJP, where the population is 80% Hindu.\n\nAccording to Sharat Pradhan, an independent journalist from Uttar Pradesh, issues like “unemployment and inflation are overshadowed” by caste and religion.\n\nAnalysts now worry that the scale of this latest win may solidify the idea that the BJP’s Hindu nationalist rhetoric is more valued than infrastructure and development.\n\n“With Adityanath winning back-to-back elections, he will be unstoppable,” said Niranajan Sahoo, a senior fellow at the Observer Research Foundation.", "authors": ["Rhea Mogul Swati Gupta Vedika Sud Esha Mitra", "Rhea Mogul", "Swati Gupta", "Vedika Sud", "Esha Mitra"], "publish_date": "2022/03/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/04/07/india-election-voting/7447359/", "title": "India starts voting in world's largest election", "text": "AP\n\nGAUHATI, India (AP) — Voters in India's remote northeast cast ballots on the first day of the world's biggest election Monday, with the opposition heading into the polls with strong momentum on promises of a surge in economic growth.\n\nWith 814 million eligible voters, India will vote in stages over the next five weeks in a staggered approach made necessary by the country's vast size. Voters will choose representatives for the 543-seat lower house of parliament.\n\nResults from all 935,000 polling stations are expected on May 16. The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party and its candidate for prime minister, Narendra Modi, are seen as the biggest threats to the now-governing Congress party.\n\nBJP is expected to do well but to fall short of a 272-seat majority, making a coalition government a likely outcome, observers say.\n\n\"I've made it a point to vote this time because we want change,\" said 36-year-old housewife Rumi Nath, waiting to vote in the rural town of Lakhimpur on the Brahmaputra River. \"Our area remains backward and underdeveloped 67 years after independence.\"\n\nPolls suggest Congress could face a drubbing due to corruption scandals and recent years of economic slowdown. The BJP's Modi has been credited with ushering in strong industrial growth in the western state of Gujarat, where he has been chief minister for 11 years.\n\nThe election will be key to the future of the family dynasty that has ruled India for much of its post-independence history.\n\nThe Nehru-Gandhi family is facing its biggest political threat in over a decade, with Rahul Gandhi, the 43-year-old family scion, leading the Congress's struggling campaign. While Gandhi has been presented to voters as a youthful leader who can rejuvenate India's faltering economy, many see him as privileged, aloof and out of touch with everyday Indians.\n\nThe party has not even formally declared Gandhi as its candidate for prime minister, political maneuvering aimed at protecting him from being scapegoated if the party — and the family — is forced from power.\n\nBut even as Congress faces a backlash, critics of Modi question whether the Hindu nationalist candidate can be a truly secular leader, noting he has failed to take responsibility or apologize for communal rioting that left more than 1,000 dead in his state in 2002. He is accused of doing little to stop the anti-Muslim rampage, though he denies any wrongdoing and has never been charged with a crime.\n\nThe BJP was the last major party on Monday to release its campaign manifesto, which envisions India's path toward full development through futuristic infrastructure projects such as high-speed trains, 100 new modern cities and wireless Internet facilities in public places.\n\nBut such ambitious plans hold little appeal for most voters in rural Assam, where voting took place Monday in five constituencies as well as in one in neighboring Tripura state.\n\nHere, people are more concerned about basic needs like guarding against the dangers of flooding, soil erosion and heavy rains washing away homes, or building more roads and bridges to connect far-away towns and villages to the main cities.\n\n\"As monsoon sets in, we get worried about our daily meals,\" said Pulok Nath, a voter in Lakhimpur. \"We have been living on a mud embankment for years now after floods washed away our home and large part of our village.\"\n\nSeveral of the 8,000 polling stations were temporarily closed while faulty voting machines were fixed or replaced. Nevertheless, voter turnout was unprecedentedly high — at 85 percent for the Tripura West constituency, and 78 percent for polling stations in Assam.\n\nBoth Congress and BJP were hoping for a strong showing in the seven northeast states nicknamed the \"Seven Sisters\" — occupying a remote region nestled between China, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Burma and made up of diverse ethnicities. Gains for Congress among the 25 northeast seats would help offset expected losses elsewhere in India, while the BJP wants to seize one of Congress' traditional strongholds.\n\nAssam's highest elected official, Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi of the Congress Party, said he was confident of winning re-election.\n\n\"There is no Narendra Modi magic in Assam. The Congress has been winning every form of elections since 2001 in Assam, and we are going to repeat the performance this time,\" Gogoi said.\n\nIn the last general elections in 2009, Congress won seven of Assam's 14 parliamentary seats to the BJP's four, while regional parties won the rest.\n\nAuthorities said there were no violent incidents at the polls, thanks to the deployment of 25,000 police and paramilitary troops to guard polling stations. Helicopters were put on standby, and borders with Bangladesh and Bhutan were sealed.\n\nKeywords:\n\nBC-AS--India-Election,6th Ld-Writethru\n\nCategory:\n\nNews/World\n\nPublisher:\n\nAPATOM.G\n\nUrgency:\n\nRegular\n\nCategory (wire):\n\ni\n\nSupplementary category (wire):\n\npol--\n\nTransmission reference:\n\nG0889\n\nEdit status:\n\n6th Ld-Writethru\n\nUsed in (by):\n\nNo usages\n\nCopied by:\n\nNo copies", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/04/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/22/opinions/bjp-hindu-muslim-democracy-modi-arundhati-roy/index.html", "title": "Arundhati Roy: 'The damage to Indian democracy is not reversible ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Arundhati Roy is the author of “The God of Small Things,” which won the Booker Prize in 1997 and “The Ministry of Utmost Happiness,” which was long-listed for the Man Booker Prize in 2017.

View more opinion at CNN.\n\nNew Delhi CNN —\n\nWhen two spokespeople from India’s ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) made derogatory comments about the Prophet Mohammed last month, it prompted an international firestorm.\n\nThe incident led to protests among India’s Muslim minority in several states. Some Muslim-majority nations summoned their India ambassadors. India’s foreign ministry said the comments did not reflect the views of the government, and the officials involved – one of whom later withdrew her remarks – faced disciplinary action.\n\nBut for India’s 200 million Muslims, these comments were not an isolated incident.\n\nRather, they were the culmination of the BJP’s “engineering hatred of a common enemy,” says bestselling Indian author Arundhati Roy.\n\n“India’s tragedy is not that it’s the worst place in the world – it’s that we are on our way there. We’re burning down our house. India is an experiment that is failing dangerously,” she told CNN.\n\n“Many, many of my beloved friends – poets, writers, professors, lawyers, human rights activists and journalists – are in prison, most of them charged under a dreaded law called the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, all of them for speaking up for minorities, Dalits and forest-dwellers facing displacement and state terror.\n\n“Among them are people I consider to be India’s most important minds. It makes one wonder what living as a free person in the time of fascism means. What does it mean to be a bestselling author when the world is breaking?” writes Roy.\n\nIn this email interview with CNN Opinion, Roy says Indian politics has something in common with the US Capitol riots, that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is stoking hatred, and talks about who the real power in India lies with.\n\nCNN: What does this incident involving BJP officials’ comments about the Prophet Mohammed reveal about Indian politics today?\n\nRoy: It reveals how successfully the clear and present existential threat posed by Hindu nationalism in India has been masked by the face it presents to the outside world. You know the people in strange clothes, the man in furs and antlers who stormed the US Capitol? We’re being ruled by their equivalent here. The difference is that they are not a collection of random lunatics. They are members of the most powerful organization in India – the RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh), whose founding ideologues openly admired Hitler and likened the Muslims of India to the Jews of Germany. RSS is the real power in India.\n\nCNN: What is the connection between the BJP and RSS?\n\nRoy: The ruling party, the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party), considered to be one of the richest political parties in the world, is only the front office of the RSS. Founded in 1925, the RSS, traditionally controlled by a handful of Brahmins, now has millions of members including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has been a member since his teenage years, and most of his cabinet ministers.\n\nIt has its own vast militia, its own schools, labor unions and women’s organizations. It’s not a political party, it’s something of a shape-shifter, a master of double-speak, its sources of funding are amorphous and leave no legal trail, it works through an array of affiliates, but it’s a nation within a nation.\n\nThe RSS believes that India should be declared a Hindu nation, just as Pakistan, Iran and several countries in the Persian Gulf are Islamic nations, just as Israel is legally the “nation-state of the Jewish people.”\n\nA demonstration against the state government demolition of the house of a local Muslim leader in Prayagraj on June 13. The demolition followed clashes after controversial remarks made by two BJP officials about the Prophet Mohammed. Amarjeet Kumar Singh/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nIn fact, the RSS believes in what it calls “Akhand Bharat,” a sort of fantasy that is futuristic and ancient all at once – a future Ancient India which includes Pakistan and Bangladesh which will be conquered and subject to Hindu rule. To flatten India’s mind-boggling religious, socialand subnational identities, more diverse than all of Europe, into the strict hierarchy of a moribund, caste-bound Hindu nation is an unimaginably violent process. It means setting aside the constitution and undoing the very idea of India.\n\nFirst in the line of fire is the Muslim community. Close behind are Christians – a tiny minority that is also being brutalized. Last year alone there were more than 400 attacks on Christians. Churches have been vandalized, priests and nuns beaten up, their congregations threatened and humiliated.\n\nIn the last two national elections, in 2014 and 2019, the BJP has shown that it can win a solid majority in the national parliament without the votes of India’s 200-million-strong Muslim community. That has effectively resulted in a sort of disenfranchisement and political isolation of Muslims, which is extremely dangerous.\n\nThere is also a new anti-Muslim citizenship law, a sort of refugee-manufacturing policy in which those who cannot produce a mandated set of “legacy papers,” which few people have, can find themselves deprived of citizenship. Nearly 2 million people in the state of Assam have already been struck off the National Register of Citizens. Massive detention centers for those who have been stripped of citizenship are being constructed all over the country.\n\nBut isolating Muslims is not enough. Creating an artificial majority out of a very diverse Hindu community that consists of thousands of castes and ethnicities is equally important if the BJP is to remain in power. The cement for that is engineering hatred of a common enemy. This requires an incremental ratcheting up of bigotry.\n\nApart from the mass killings and lynching of Muslims by Hindu vigilantes in recent years, we have the steady drumbeat of hatred and outlandish disinformation beamed into peoples’ homes by approximately 400 TV channels and countless newspapers. On social media handles viewed by millions of people there are open calls for the genocide of Muslims – and videos demonstrating how it should be done.\n\nWe regularly see provocative demonstrations by thousands of sword-wielding Hindu men marching through areas in which Muslims live. The deeply disrespectful comments about Prophet Mohammed made by a BJP spokeswoman on national TV this May was a part of this constituency-building exercise. As was the unconscionable bulldozing by municipal authorities of the homes of Muslims who dared to come out in protest.\n\nTo flatten India’s mind-boggling religious, social, and subnational identities… into the strict hierarchy of a moribund, caste-bound Hindu nation is an unimaginably violent process Arundhati Roy\n\nSome of the protestors publicly called for beheadings and hanging and asking for a blasphemy law which the BJP would probably be more than happy to pass and use to silence its critics in swifter and more deadly ways. These individuals helped to confirm every deeply held prejudice about Muslims that the Hindu Right works so hard to perpetuate.\n\nAs a concession to international outrage, the BJP has suspended its spokeswoman, Nupur Sharma, but she has been openly embraced by its cadre. The polarization has worked in the BJP’s favor.\n\nCNN: And what does Prime Minister Narendra Modi have to do with it?\n\nRoy: Modi has made no comment whatsoever about the spokeswoman or the protests. A standard tactic of his. In situations like this, his followers, correctly I believe, read his silence as support. Although he increasingly positions himself as a messiah, he is an RSS man, and he knows that the organization is grooming other leaders who are waiting in the wings. But for now, he is the uncontested figurehead.\n\nModi made his political debut in October 2001. He was appointed, not elected, chief minister of the state of Gujarat. It was just weeks after the 9/11 attacks in the United States. The world was convulsed by Islamophobia. It was the perfect political climate for the RSS.\n\nIndia's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, pictured here on June 6, has not publicly commented on the recent BJP officials' comments about the Prophet Mohammed. T. Narayan/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nA few months later, in February 2002, following an act of arson in which a railway carriage carrying Hindu pilgrims was burnt, there was a brutal pogrom against Muslims in the villages and towns of Gujarat. It lasted for weeks. While the police watched, more than a thousand people were slaughtered in broad daylight, women were gang-raped and burnt alive, and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes. Subsequently the murderers were caught on camera boasting of their deeds. Many spoke of how they were inspired and protected by Modi.\n\nModi was unapologetic and came to be known as “Hindu Hriday Samrat” – the Emperor of Hindu Hearts. Soon after the 2002 massacre, he called for state elections and won with a massive majority. He has never looked back since – he was elected Chief Minister of Gujarat for three terms and in 2014 was elected prime minister. And we in India have begun to look at massacres and hatefulness against Muslims as an integral part of election campaigns. During Modi’s tenure as Gujarat Chief Minster, Hitler made it into a school textbook published by the Gujarat State Board of School Textbooks as an inspirational leader.\n\nCNN: Over the years, Modi’s popularity and his brand of politics has not waned. Why is that?\n\nRoy: For the same reasons that studies of the algorithms of Facebook and Twitter show that hatefulness gets far more traction than decency. Miserable people, oppressed people, unemployed people, people living in crushing poverty are voting themselves into further hellishness, their sunken eyes fixed on the object of their hate.\n\nAfter Modi’s shocking display of callous incompetence during the pandemic – the sudden lockdown in the first wave that led to millions of stranded workers many of who had to walk thousands of miles home to their villages, the millions of deaths in the second wave – some still shake their heads in sorrowful awe and say, “Without Modi, it would have been worse.”\n\nThey’ve swallowed the story they’ve been fed about themselves, about their own lives. Meanwhile Modi has zero accountability. He has never addressed a single press conference in all his years as prime minister. All we get are staged performances and photo ops.\n\nCNN: What has contributed to this situation where the Modi government feels immune from any international reaction or action?\n\nRoy: I don’t think it is immune at all. On the contrary, our globe-trotting, head-of-state-hugging prime minister cares deeply about international opinion. None of us have ever seen him hug a fellow Indian. The optics of his foreign trips are carefully curated. His millions of followers refer to him as “Vishwa-Guru,” the Guru of the Whole World.\n\nBarack Obama, Donald Trump, Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron, Boris Johnson have all indulged him. International action and reaction is only a game of pragmatism and expediency. It has to do with trade and geopolitics, race, religion and ethnicity, and very little with values and morality.\n\nIf India is buying a fleet of fighter planes from, say, France, it knows that lynching and a little mass murder will, at most, get a delicate finger-wag. A big market is excellent insurance against moral censure.\n\nRight now, foreign relations are a little tricky for India because of the Ukraine war and India’s proximity to Russia. So, India’s crimes in Kashmir and this very violent form of Hindu nationalism is coming under a little scrutiny. But these are all just bargaining chips in the Great Game. Sorry to sound so cynical, but I am.\n\nCNN: How should India’s international Muslim trading partners respond? (And the world, for that matter?)\n\nRoy: Most of the countries that you refer to as India’s “Muslim trading partners” have long ago given up any pretense of democracy or diversity. They are already at the destination that Modi and the BJP are trying to drag India toward. The destination that we dread to arrive at, the theocratic state.\n\nIndia’s tragedy is not that it’s the worst place in the world – it’s that we are on our way there. We’re burning down our house. India is an experiment that is failing dangerously. Failing because our elected leaders are blinded by hate – and crippled by a severe lack of intelligence, which is the more dangerous thing. The consequences will be unimaginable.\n\nAs for what the rest of the world can do, all one can hope for is that people pay attention and form an informed opinion. And realize that their profits from this immense “market” will dry up if the market ceases to exist. The Indian economy is in a lot of trouble. Wealthy people, businesses big and small, have begun to flee. They are good and accurate weather vanes.\n\nCNN: Is India truly the world’s largest democracy?\n\nRoy: A democracy doesn’t just mean having regular elections. You cannot be a democracy when 200 million people who constitute a religious minority are expected to live without rights. When you can lynch them, kill them, incarcerate them, economically and socially boycott them, bulldoze their homes with complete immunity and threaten to strip them of citizenship. When the murderers and lynchers can aspire to move swiftly up the political ladder.\n\nCNN: The damage done to Indian democracy – is it reversible?\n\nRoy: The systematic indoctrination of people on the scale on which it has taken place over decades is hard to reverse. Every institution that is supposed to make up the system of checks and balances has been hollowed out, repurposed and deployed against people as a weapon of Hindu nationalism. In terms of political opposition, there are political parties that have successfully opposed the BJP at the state level in Tamil Nadu, Bengal, Kerala, Maharashtra, Punjab, but opposition is virtually non-existent at the national level.\n\nMuslim demonstrators at a protest demanding the arrest of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) official Nupur Sharma following her comments about the Prophet Mohammed, in Kolkata on June 10. Rupak De Chowdhuri/Reuters\n\nThe whole system of elections has been gamed. You can win a huge majority of seats even without anything close to a majority of actual votes. In India, we have a first-past-the-post, multi-party democracy. This means that even if you get say only 20% of the vote in a constituency, as long as its higher than your closest rival, you win. A rich party can put up spurious candidates to split the votes. But that’s just one trick in a whole bag of tricks.\n\nAnd, anyway, how do you woo an indoctrinated population? By proving that you are a better, prouder Hindu? Nobody can beat the BJP at that game. And right now, that’s the only game in town. As far as mainstream politics goes.\n\nSo, no, I don’t believe the damage is reversible. I believe we will be broken and then reborn. Change will only come when and if at all an accepting, gullible, fatalistic people realize what’s being done to them. And then it will come suddenly, and from the street. Not from the system. Until then… God help us.\n\nCNN: What changes have you personally experienced that echo the changes taking place in India at large?\n\nRoy: To begin with, many, many of my beloved friends – poets, writers, professors, lawyers, human rights activists and journalists – are in prison. Among them are people I consider to be India’s most important minds. It makes one wonder what living as a free person in the time of fascism means.\n\nWhat does it mean to be a bestselling author when the world is breaking? What does it mean to be considered a ‘success’ when the world is failing and everything you care about is being decimated? What is the moral way to be? The moral thing to do?\n\nI am one of those unfortunate people who saw this coming decades ago. I said so. I wrote so. At the time that made me something of a crazy outlier – one of those people who sets off a fire alarm right when the party’s going really well and everyone’s happy. In some ways it un-homed (not un-housed) me in all sorts of ways, literally and metaphorically – which is not a bad thing for a writer, actually.\n\nWhat does it mean to be a bestselling author when the world is breaking? Arundhati Roy\n\nThe idea of patriotism has been fused with the idea of Hindu nationalism, so people like myself are on the A-list of “anti-nationals.” Of course it helps their cause that I am not Hindu. My mother who raised me is Christian. My estranged father who I never really knew came from a Hindu family and converted to Christianity as did his father and his father’s father. But this doesn’t enrage them as much as the things I write and say. Particularly about Kashmir. A Bollywood actor and BJP member of parliament suggested that I be tied to an army jeep and used as a human shield by the Indian Army in Kashmir. They really should try that.\n\nSadly, the BJP’s macro-radicalization has resulted in micro-versions of the same thing. It is mirrored by its allies, its doorkeepers, concierges and maintenance staff, as well as its victims. As everybody turns inward, bitter and doctrinaire, as every form of solidarity crumbles, as the garbage mountains grow and the rivers shrink, as stock characters locked into their own little ideological bubbles shout at each other on TV, I feel my own skin tightening around me, containing me, too. I struggle against that every day. The only home one has is in literature and poetry. That sentence that makes you gasp – or smile out loud.

Vijay Bedi/CNN\n\nVoters will decide if the state’s controversial monk-turned-chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, remains the leader of Uttar Pradesh, a state with a population of more than 200 million. But more importantly, the election result will be a pulse check on support for the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who faces his own test in the national elections in 2024 – the first since the pandemic killed more than half a million Indians.\n\nDespite the Covid crisis, experts say Adityanath has religion on his side – he’s pushing a Hindu-first agenda in a state with an 80% Hindu population. And that appeals to people like Mishra.\n\nThe social worker doesn’t hold the government responsible for Covid deaths – he blames lower-level officials who he says didn’t follow government policy. He says he’s voting for Adiyanath in this election for a very simple reason.\n\n“They’re constructing the Ram Temple in Ayodhya,” he said, referring to a temple planned on land long contested between Hindus and Muslims, in a city believed to be the birthplace of Lord Ram, one of the most revered deities in Hinduism.\n\n“That was their main goal.”\n\nAn unforgiving wave of infections\n\nOn April 17, 2021, as India’s Covid cases were surging, a maskless Modi boasted to a sea of cheering supporters ahead of elections in the state of West Bengal: “I’ve never ever seen such huge crowds at a rally.”\n\nThe same day, hundreds of miles away in the city of Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh, Harshit Srivastava, 32, was experiencing “the worst day of my life.”\n\nIn truth, it started days before when his 65-year-old father Vinay started showing Covid symptoms. Fighting back tears, Harshit recalls how he drove to dozens of hospitals, begging for a spare bed, oxygen and medical care for his father.\n\nAs his oxygen levels dropped dangerously low, Vinay tweeted for help, tagging the Chief Minister Adityanath and other state officials. Citizens and journalists amplified his tweet, imploring officials to provide assistance. But none came.\n\nMy oxygen is 31 when some will help me — Vinay Srivastava (@VinaySr18286715) April 17, 2021\n\nVinay died on April 17 in his family home, one of more than 23,000 deaths in the state during the pandemic – though that number is considered to be a gross underestimation, according to witness testimony and images showing overwhelmed hospitals and overcrowded crematoriums.\n\n“As a son, I had hoped we’d find a way to get help. But my father had no faith (in the government). He was sure nothing would happen,” Harshit, a stock trader, said.\n\nVinay Srivastava photographed with his wife. Courtesy Harshit Srivastava\n\nIn the last election in 2017, the BJP won a landslide victory in Uttar Pradesh, securing the biggest majority for any party in the state since 1980. The BJP installed Adityanath as leader, a move experts say signaled its intention to push a stronger Hindu agenda.\n\nFive years later, the BJP faces a strong challenge from the opposing Samajwadi Party led by the 48-year-old former chief minister, Akhilesh Yadav.\n\nYadav’s promise of free electricity to all households and interest free loans to farmers has gained some support – especially among farmers angered by Modi’s controversial farm laws. And some experts say that, coupled with the devastation from the pandemic, could be enough for Yadav to win over some loyal BJP voters.\n\n“This election is very close,” said Rahul Verma from India’s Centre for Policy Research. “The BJP, owing to its massive 2017 victory, has some advantages. But the Samajwadi Party has managed to mount up a very effective campaign against the BJP (with its) mismanagement during Covid.”\n\nOnce a staunch supporter of the BJP, Srivastava says he’s no longer interested in casting a vote.\n\n“I will not vote for anyone in this election,” he told CNN last month. “They tell lies. They make temples for promotion, and give the poor money sometimes. They took everything I had from me.”\n\nA bastion of the Hindu-right\n\nThe appointment of Adityanath, a Hindu priest, indicated to some experts that the BJP’s Hindutva ideology – which strives to make secular India the land of the Hindus – far outweighed the party’s commitment to economic development in the state.\n\nZoya Hasan, a political scientist and fellow at the Indian Council of Social Science Research, said Adityanath’s appointment “was a very deliberate choice to signal the BJP’s Hindutva agenda.”\n\nSince Adityanath took office, the state has already passed legislation that, critics say, is rooted in Hindutva ideology. It has protected cows, an animal considered sacred to Hindus, from slaughter, and made it increasingly difficult to transport cattle. It also introduced a controversial anti-conversion bill, which makes it harder for interfaith couples to marry or for people to convert to Islam or Christianity. Some cities named after historic Muslim figures have also been renamed to reflect India’s Hindu history.\n\n“Uttar Pradesh is very important for the BJP, not just because of its sheer size, but because it is a principal Hindutva laboratory,” said Hasan. “Let’s not forget that the three most important Hindu shrines are located here. Yogi (Adityanath) is trying his best to promote Hindu and Muslim polarization.”\n\nA street vendor seels saffron flags ahead of Uttar Pradesh's state election. Vijay Bedi/CNN\n\nAdityanath is known for his provocative rhetoric against Muslims.\n\nHe once praised former US President Donald Trump’s travel ban barring citizens of several Muslim-majority countries and called for India to take similar measures, according to local channel NDTV. And in February, he used a derogatory word when referring to Muslim men in an interview with a local television channel.\n\nAdityanath’s cabinet members have denied allegations they are promoting Hindu nationalism, and that they mishandled the pandemic, saying they have brought millions out of poverty through economic reform.\n\nWhile the state’s unemployment rate is unclear due to millions working in the informal sector, government statistics show it has grown since 2017.\n\n“BJP’s poll agenda was, is and will always be development,” Dinesh Sharma, the state’s Deputy Chief Minister, told CNN. “We will ensure law and order across the state. We will ensure the poor have water, food and electricity. And we promise the welfare of farmers.”\n\nA promise for Hindu temples\n\nIn August 2020, eight months before Uttar Pradesh was devastated by India’s second Covid wave, Modi laid a foundation stone for the construction of a Hindu temple in the holy city of Ayodhya.\n\nFor decades, Hindu groups have campaigned for a temple to Lord Ram be built at the site, where a 16th century mosque – the Babri Masjid – once stood.\n\nAfter Hindu extremists destroyed the Babri Masjid in 1992, more than 2,000 people – mostly Muslims – were killed in nationwide rioting, some of the worst violence seen in India since independence.\n\nThirty years later, the people of Ayodhya are pushing for more temples to be built, and local priest Seer Pawan Kumar Sad Shastri says he knows which way the city’s population of nearly 2.5 million will vote.\n\n“The people in Ayodhya will only vote for (devout Hindus),” he said.\n\nSeer Pawan Kumar Sad Shastri says he will vote for the BJP because they are in favor of Lord Ram. Vijay Bedi/CNN\n\nWhether it’s enough to give the BJP and Adityanath another term in office remains to be seen.\n\nAccording to Verma, from India’s Centre for Policy Research, the BJP is counting on a “mixed strategy” of economic reform – attracting investment, supporting small businesses and creating new jobs – and religious polarization.\n\n“They are pivoting more to their ideological beliefs,” Verma said, adding this rhetoric energizes Adityanath’s “core base” of right-wing Hindu voters.\n\nIn recent years, there have been numerous reports of extrajudicial killings and violent reprisals from state law enforcement. But Shastri says Adityanath has done a good job in maintaining law and order.\n\nIn December 2019 the state imposed a colonial-era law banning public gatherings following clashes during a protest against India’s Citizenship Amendment Act that would give immigrants from three neighboring countries a pathway to citizenship – except for Muslims.\n\n“Our next mission is constructing grand temples for our Gods in other holy cities,” Shastri said.\n\nBut Srivastava, who lost his father in the second wave, says no amount of temples could ever bring back his father – he wants the government to acknowledge its failure to reduce Covid deaths.\n\n“I want to ask Yogi to put his hand on his heart and ask himself if he has done the right thing,” he said.\n\n“Lord Ram doesn’t need a temple as much as the country needs a proper government.”", "authors": ["Rhea Mogul Vedika Sud Arpit Goel Vijay Bedi", "Rhea Mogul", "Vedika Sud", "Arpit Goel", "Vijay Bedi"], "publish_date": "2022/03/09"}]}

Sign up here.\n\nAbu Dhabi, UAE CNN —\n\nOil has added trillions of dollars to Saudi Arabia’s coffers over the decades, but it’s a resource that will someday run out or lose value as the world turns to alternative energy.\n\nDespite current high oil prices, the kingdom knows this, and it has embarked on an ambitious project to diversify its sources of revenue for a post-oil future. One of those sources is the pilgrimage, an eternal monopoly that has a potential market of almost two billion Muslims.\n\nSoon after King Salman bin Abdulaziz took power in 2015, Saudi Arabia launched a $21 billion project to expand the Grand Mosque in Mecca to accommodate 300,000 additional worshippers. A year later, then Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman identified the pilgrimage as a key component of a plan to diversify the Saudi economy by 2030.\n\n“Unlike [the energy sector], where Saudi Arabia always has to worry about future competitors, in the area of Hajj and Umrah, they are guaranteed to have zero competition in perpetuity,” said Omar Al-Ubaydli, director of research at the Bahrain-based Derasat think tank.\n\nMuslims from the world over return to Saudi Arabia this week to perform the annual Hajj pilgrimage after a two-year hiatus caused by Covid-19 restrictions. It’s an opportunity for Muslims to fulfill a once-in-a-lifetime religious obligation, but also a chance for the economy of Saudi Arabia’s holy cities to get a jump start.\n\nThe pandemic caused the number of Hajj pilgrims to dwindle to 1,000 in 2020, but it rose to about 60,000 in 2021, when the Hajj was opened only to residents of Saudi Arabia. This year, the kingdom authorized one million Muslims to perform the rites.\n\nExperts say that with crude oil prices hovering around $100 a barrel, generating billions of dollars a day, the pilgrimage’s economic benefit is marginal by comparison. But its great, untapped potential could bring significant riches to the kingdom in the long term.\n\n“Religious tourism in Saudi Arabia may not have the current revenue-generating capacity of the oil and gas sector, but the religious significance of Mecca and Medina will never run dry,” said Robert Mogielnicki, a senior scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. “It serves as a crucial foundation to build out the broader Saudi tourism sector and market it to local, regional, and international audiences.”\n\nThe potential for expansion is significant, says Steffen Hertog, an associate professor at the London School of Economics. Pilgrims could, for example, be incentivized to extend their trips in the country to visit other religious sites or engage in recreation, particularly during the year-round minor pilgrimage, the Umrah, where Hajj-related bottlenecks can be avoided, he said.\n\nAccording to Mastercard’s latest Global Destination Cities Index, Mecca attracted $20 billion in tourist dollars in 2018, second only to Dubai.\n\nBefore the pandemic, pilgrimage revenues were forecast to average about $30 billion a year and create 100,000 jobs for Saudis by 2022. That was when the kingdom attracted around 21 million worshippers annually during the 10-day Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages, according to official data cited by Reuters.\n\nThe number of pilgrims has shrunk significantly during the pandemic but the government is targeting 30 million pilgrims by 2030, which some analysts have said is an ambitious figure.\n\nThe pilgrimage has been a drain on the government’s finances due to the cost of infrastructure, maintenance, and security, according to Hertog, but it has made big money for the private sector.\n\nMecca’s skyline around the millennia-old pilgrimage site is crowded with swanky skyscrapers housing Western hotel chains overlooking the Kaaba, the cube-shaped structure Muslims turn to in prayer five times a day. A night at the iconic Fairmont Makkah Clock Royal Tower, which overlooks the Kaaba, costs up to $4,000 for its most opulent suites for this year’s Hajj season.\n\nBut the government has been trying to get a slice of that cake. In two years, the state-owned Public Investment Fund plans to open the Rou’a Al Haram Al Makki project just under a mile from the Kaaba, with 70,000 new hotel rooms and 9,000 residential units. It is expected to contribute 8 billion riyals ($2.1 billion) to the Saudi economy.\n\nIn a blow to private travel agencies abroad that organize pilgrimages for Muslims in the West, the Saudi government this year announced a new booking platform that obliges foreign pilgrims to register and pay for the process directly through the new government-run system called “Motawif.”\n\nThe system is designed to streamline the application process, but it has put travel agencies abroad out of business. In the United Kingdom alone, the sector is worth approximately $240 million, and many Hajj operators there are now facing liquidation, according to the Independent newspaper.\n\nSaudi authorities did not respond to CNN’s request for a comment.\n\nThe only threat to Saudi Arabia’s ambitions to capitalize on the pilgrimage “is decreasing religiosity across the world,” said Al-Ubaydli. “But as long as Muslims continue to want to visit these sites, they will represent massive economic opportunities to Saudi Arabia.”\n\nCNN’s Nadeen Ebrahim contributed to this report\n\nThe digest\n\nIran is adding demands to nuclear talks, US says\n\nIran added “unrelated” demands to the discussion table during the last round of talks on its nuclear program, US Special Envoy for Iran Robert Malley said on Tuesday in an interview with National Public Radio, adding that and it has made “alarming” progress in its uranium enrichment field that would allow it to make a nuclear weapon “in a matter of weeks.”\n\nBackground: The last round of indirect negotiations between Iran and the US took place in Doha, Qatar last week, and were mediated by the European Union. The talks were the latest hope at getting both sides to an agreement that would revive a 2015 nuclear deal aimed at curbing Tehran’s nuclear weapon abilities. The two-day talks came to a standstill, however, with Malley describing them as “a wasted occasion.”\n\nWhy it matters: Iran is inching closer to the amount of enrichment necessary to make a nuclear bomb, with Malley saying it would only take them “a matter of weeks” to reach one. “They are going to have to decide sooner or later,” said Malley, “Because at some point the deal will be a thing of the past.”\n\nBen & Jerry’s sues Unilever to block sale of Israeli business\n\nBen & Jerry’s is suing its parent company in an attempt to cancel the sale of its business in Israel to a local partner that would continue to distribute its products in the West Bank.\n\nBackground: The Vermont-based ice cream maker filed a complaint Tuesday in the US District Court in New York, where it sought an injunction against Unilever “to protect the brand and social integrity Ben & Jerry’s has spent decades building.” Last week, Unilever announced that it had sold Ben & Jerry’s Israeli business for an undisclosed amount to American Quality Products (AQP), which distributes the ice cream in Israel.\n\nWhy it matters: Since 2021, Ben & Jerry’s has been fiercely opposed to the sale of its products in the West Bank, saying that it would be “inconsistent with” the brand. Ben & Jerry’s has been doing business in Israel since 1987, but in recent years it had come under pressure for selling in West Bank settlements, considered illegal under international law.\n\nNazi war criminal Eichmann heard boasting of role in Holocaust in audio recordings\n\nAudio recordings have emerged of Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann boasting about his role in the Holocaust. The recordings, carried out in 1957, have Eichmann hailing his part in the Nazi attempt to exterminate the Jewish people.\n\nBackground: Eichmann was captured by Israeli secret agents in Argentina in 1960 and brought to Israel where he was put on trial for crimes against humanity. In his defense he argued that he was only following orders, and that the key decisions were taken by other, more senior, Nazi leaders. Eichmann was convicted at his trial and put to death in 1962.\n\nWhy it matters: The recordings, which have been lying in a German archive for decades, have been aired for the first time as part of a new documentary about Eichmann called “The Devil’s Confession.” He can be heard saying that it would defy his innermost beliefs to deny that the Nazis did something wrong. “If we had killed 10.3 million Jews, I would say with satisfaction, ‘Good, we destroyed an enemy.’ Then we would have fulfilled our mission,” he said.\n\nAround the region\n\nTunisian tennis player Ons Jabeur made history on the grass courts of Wimbledon Tuesday as she became the first Arab woman to reach the semifinals of a grand slam.\n\nThe world No. 3 overcame a nervy start to rally from a set down and beat Marie Bouzková 3-6 6-1 6-1 on Centre Court.\n\nAfter reaching the final four, she said it had been a long time coming for her personally.\n\n“I was hoping that I could get to this stage for a long time already. I struggled a few times in the quarterfinal,” Jabeur told the media afterwards.\n\n“I was talking a little bit to (former world No. 22) Hicham Arazi, and he told me: ‘Arabs always lose in the quarterfinals and we are sick of it.

Dominique Berretty/Gamma-Rapho/Getty Images\n\nAlgeria this week marked 60 years since its independence from France following a bloody war of independence whose wounds are yet to heal.\n\nFrance began its rule of Algeria in 1830. The city of Algiers was originally taken by the French as a military measure, but as more settlers began arriving with French protection, France’s boundaries continued to advance.\n\nIn 1954, the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN) was formed as a guerilla group to liberate the country from its colonizer. It started an uprising that took the next seven years, known as the Algerian War, which led to Tunisia and Morocco being granted independence by France in return for militarizing their borders with Algeria.\n\nOn March 16, 1962, an agreement was signed in France promising Algeria independence pending a national referendum and on July 5, Algeria celebrated its independence from France.\n\nFollowing its independence, most of the one million Europeans returned to their countries. More than 100,000 Muslims were killed in the seven-year Algerian war. Algeria says that over 5.6 million were killed over 130 years of colonization. French President Emanuel Macron last year accused Algeria of “rewriting history,” prompting the North African nation to recall its ambassador in Paris. To this day, France has not apologized for its role in Algeria’s colonization. There will be “no repentance nor apologies,” Macron’s office said last year.\n\nBy Mohammed Abdelbary", "authors": ["Abbas Al Lawati"], "publish_date": "2022/07/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/28/middleeast/iran-hair-cutting-mime-intl/index.html", "title": "Why Iranian women are cutting their hair | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this story first appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories.

Her relatives wail for justice as she tosses strands onto the coffin.\n\nThey were grieving for 36-year-old Javad Heydari, who was fatally shot last week at one of the anti-government protests that have gripped Iran.\n\nImages like these have galvanized women across the world to join Iranian women protesting the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini. She died in hospital on September 16, three days after being pulled off the streets of Tehran by morality police and taken to a “re-education center” for lessons in modesty.\n\nFrom the Middle East, Europe and across the United States, women around the globe have shown solidarity with Iranian women’s plight in rallies and demonstrations. Some have also cut or shaved their hair in public or while being filmed.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback These protests are different, says celebrated Iranian author 11:07 - Source: CNN\n\nNow in their 12th day, protests have swept through more than 40 Iranian cities, including the capital Tehran. Iranian security forces have been cracking down on protesters, with hundreds arrested and at least 41 killed, according to state media. Some human rights organizations say the death toll is as high as 76. CNN cannot independently verify these figures.\n\nSo, why are women cutting their hair?\n\nFor many Iranian women, cutting off hair – a sign of beauty that is decreed to be hidden in the Islamic Republic – is a poignant form of protest.\n\n“We want to show them that we don’t care about their standards, their definition of beauty or what they think that we should look like,” said 36-year-old Faezeh Afshan, an Iranian chemical engineer living in Bologna, Italy, who was filmed shaving off her hair. “It is to show that we are angry.”\n\nAfshan attributes the practice of cutting off hair to historical cultural practices. “In our literature, cutting the hair is a symbol of mourning, and sometimes a symbol of protesting,” she told CNN. “If we can cut our hair to show that we are angry… we will do it.”\n\nThe practice is cited in Shahnameh, a 1,000-year-old Persian epic and a cultural mainstay in Iran written by Ferdowsi. Made of nearly 60,000 verses, the poem tells the stories of the kings of Persia and is one of the most important works of literature in the Persian language. In more than one instance through the epic work, hair is plucked in an act of mourning.\n\n“Women cutting their hair is an ancient Persian tradition… when the fury is stronger than the power of the oppressor,” tweeted Wales-based writer and translator Shara Atashi. “The moment we have been waiting for has come. Politics fueled by poetry.”\n\nIn the Shahnameh, after the hero Siyavash is killed, his wife Farangis and the girls accompanying her cut their hair to protest injustice, Atashi told CNN.\n\nThe characters portrayed in the poem “are in everyday use as symbols and archetypes,” she said, adding that the poem has helped shape the identities of Iranians, Afghans and Tajiks for 1,000 years.\n\n“But there is haircutting in the poetry of Hafez and Khaqani too, always about mourning and protests against injustice,” she said, referring to other Persian poets.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Women burn their hijabs after woman's death in police custody 02:55 - Source: CNN\n\nThe practice is also common in other ancient cultures. The Epic of Gilgamesh, a 3,500-year-old poem from ancient Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq) covers themes of grief and despair, where cutting or pulling out one’s hair is used to express anguish. The poem is considered to be one of the world’s oldest works of literature and is said to have influenced neighboring cultures.\n\nShima Babaei, an Iranian activist residing in Belgium who said she was arrested by Iran’s notorious morality police in 2018 for publicly removing her hijab as a sign of protest, told CNN that hair cutting had “historical meaning” for Iranians. Women who lose a direct relative would sometimes cut their hair as a sign of mourning and anger, she said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Iranian women open up about hijab law and morality police 01:13 - Source: CNN\n\n“For us, Mahsa was our sister,” she said. “And so, in this way, we are protesting.”\n\nCutting hair, said Atashi, “is itself a ceremony of mourning to better expose the depth of suffering at the loss of a loved one.” And in today’s context, she adds, it is a sign of “protest against the killing of our people.”\n\nThe digest\n\nSaudi king names MBS as prime minister\n\nSaudi Arabia’s King Salman bin Abdulaziz has named his son Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (known as MBS) as the kingdom’s prime minister and another son Prince Khalid as defense minister, according to Saudi state media.\n\nBackground: The crown prince was promoted from defense minister and has been the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia for several years. Khalid previously served as deputy defense minister. MBS said the kingdom has increased its self-sufficiency in military industries to 15% from 2% and plans to reach 50% under the newly appointed defense minister, state-run Saudi Press Agency reported. King Salman will still preside over the cabinet meetings he attends, the decree showed.\n\nWhy it matters: MBS has changed Saudi Arabia radically since rising to power in 2017, leading efforts to diversify the economy from its dependence on oil, allowing women to drive and curbing clerics’ powers. His reforms, however, have come with a crackdown on dissent, with activists, royals, women rights’ activists and businessmen jailed.\n\nTurkey summons German envoy after politician likens Erdogan to ‘sewer rat’\n\nTurkey’s foreign ministry summoned the German ambassador to Ankara on Tuesday to protest comments made by a senior German politician who likened President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to a “little sewer rat,” Reuters reported. “We condemn in the strongest terms the insulting statements made by Wolfgang Kubicki, the vice-speaker of the German Federal Parliament, about our president in a speech during the Lower Saxony state election campaign,” Turkish foreign ministry spokesman Tanju Bilgic said in a statement.\n\nBackground: Kubicki confirmed to Reuters that he made the comment during an election campaign rally while trying to draw attention to a rise in the number of illegal migrants moving from Turkey along the so-called Balkan route towards Germany. “A sewer rat is a small, cute, but at the same time clever and crafty creature that also appears in children’s stories,” Kubicki said, citing the popular animated movie “Ratatouille” as an example.\n\nWhy it matters: Turkey is a candidate for EU membership but negotiations have long been stalled amid disagreements on a number of issues including Ankara’s human rights record, migration and geopolitics. Insulting the president is a criminal offense in Turkey, where Erdogan and his ruling AK Party have held power for two decades.\n\nAt least 4 Palestinians killed, dozens wounded in one of this year’s deadliest Israeli West Bank raids\n\nAt least four Palestinian men were killed and 50 wounded during an Israeli military raid in Jenin Wednesday morning, Palestinian officials said, making it one of the deadliest Israeli raids in the occupied West Bank this year, which has already seen over 100 Palestinians killed by Israeli soldiers. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the raid was related to an attack in Tel Aviv in April which left three people dead, and that the suspects Wednesday fought back with explosives and gunfire.\n\nBackground: For months, Israel has been regularly raiding cities in the West Bank, focusing especially on Jenin and Nablus, saying it is targeting militants and their weapons caches before they have the chance to cross into Israel and carry out attacks. The operation, dubbed “Breaking the Wave” by the IDF, was launched after a series of attacks on Israelis. At least 20 Israelis and foreigners have been killed in attacks targeting civilians and soldiers in Israel and the West Bank so far this year.\n\nWhy it matters: This is already the deadliest year for Palestinians in the West Bank since 2015, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. More than 35 of those killed have been in Jenin. Israel says most killed were engaging violently with soldiers during military operations, but dozens of unarmed civilians have been killed as well, human rights groups including B’Tselem have said.\n\nAround the region\n\nMuhammed Semih Ugurlu/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nHenna, a reddish-brown dye famously used for body art in many parts of the Middle East, may be making its way to joining the UNESCO list of intangible cultural heritage.\n\nIn the process of being nominated by the UAE and the Arab League, henna has long been part of Middle Eastern, North African and South Asian heritage and identity.\n\nDating back thousands of years, the temporary dye is used to create elaborate designs mainly on one’s hands, often for religious festivals and celebrations.\n\nRepresentatives from 16 Arab countries met this month to discuss the nomination, according to the Abu Dhabi government media office, stressing that henna plays an important role in Arab and Gulf culture and identity.\n\nUNESCO’s list of intangible cultural heritage includes both inherited as well as modern traditions, and is meant to promote practices that contribute to “social cohesion” and encourage a shared sense of identity.\n\nThe list includes practices such as falconry, yoga, and Arabic calligraphy.\n\nBy Nadeen Ebrahim\n\nPhoto of the day", "authors": ["Celine Alkhaldi Nadeen Ebrahim", "Celine Alkhaldi", "Nadeen Ebrahim"], "publish_date": "2022/09/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/10/25/new-orleans-revelry-overwhelming-stink-right-food-news-around-states/119081162/", "title": "New Orleans revelry, overwhelming stink: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuscaloosa: Plagued by a shortage of stadium workers and complaints about long concession lines at home football games during the pandemic, the University of Alabama has contracted with an online app. It also made other changes in hopes of speeding up service during Saturday’s homecoming game against Tennessee. With a capacity crowd of more than 101,000 expected, Alabama said fans could use the Waitr phone system to order food and drinks in Bryant-Denny Stadium. Fans using the system are notified when an order is ready and can then pick up items at windows in the stadium. The Alabama deal is Waitr’s first for a football stadium, although baseball fans have used the app in Louisiana and Mississippi, company spokesman Dean Turcol said. Alabama received complaints about long concession lines after its home game against the University of Mississippi on Oct. 2. Athletics director Greg Byrne said part of the problem was the difficulty finding workers amid the COVID-19 pandemic. “Similar to staffing issues at the gates, an average of 40% of people who were supposed to work concessions on game days end up not showing up leaving them short-handed,” he wrote in a weekly email to supporters at the time. The athletic department said it is also streamlining menus and adding ordering technology to speed up sales.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A woman known for 37 years only as Horseshoe Harriet, one of a dozen or so victims of a notorious Alaska serial killer, has been identified through genetic genealogy and a DNA match, authorities said Friday. The victim was identified Friday as Robin Pelkey, who was 19 and living on the streets of Anchorage when she was killed by Robert Hansen in the early 1980s, the Alaska Bureau of Investigation’s Cold Case Investigation Unit said. “I would like to thank all of the troopers, investigators, and analysts that have diligently worked on this case over the last 37 years. Without their hard work and tenacity, the identity of Ms. Pelkey may have never been known,” Alaska Department of Public Safety Commissioner James Cockrell said in a statement. Hansen, who owned a bakery, gained the nickname “Butcher Baker” for abducting and hunting down women – many of them sex workers – in the wilderness just north of Anchorage through the early 1980s, when the state’s largest city was booming because of construction of the trans-Alaska pipeline. Construction of the 800-mile pipeline offered well-paying jobs for workers, but it also attracted those looking for fast money and left as quickly as they came. Exotic dancers traveled a circuit along West Coast cities, making sudden disappearances commonplace.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: An attorney for members of the San Carlos Apache tribe on Friday asked the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco to back a nonprofit group’s efforts to keep a copper mining company from gaining federal Arizona land that the Apaches consider sacred. “We are talking about the survival of the Apache people,” attorney Luke Goodrich told the panel, arguing that an end to religious activities on the land known as Oak Flat would help spell an end to the tribe. Joan Pepin, an attorney for the U.S. government, argued the land transfer must go ahead because it was part of legislation approved by Congress. The land has been set to be transferred to Resolution Copper, as part of a provision in a must-pass 2014 defense bill, once the final environmental impact statement is published. The three-member panel did not immediately release a ruling. The judges will now confer in private and write a decision that may not be issued for as long as three months. Goodrich said the group could take the case to the Supreme Court if the appeals court sides with the U.S. Forest Service, the agency that has planned the land transfer. Apache Stronghold, a nonprofit organization representing tribe members, sued the federal government in Phoenix federal court in January to block the pending transfer of the land near the community of Superior.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A prison transport driver convicted last year of sexually assaulting two female inmates was sentenced Thursday to life in prison plus five years. U.S. District Judge D.P. Marshall handed down the sentence to Eric Scott Kindley, 53, for the assaults and knowingly possessing a firearm to further a violent crime. Kindley sexually assaulted the women in 2014 and 2017 while transporting them between lockups on warrants. Kindley operated his own private prisoner transport company that contracted with local jails throughout the country to transport individuals arrested on out-of-state warrants. The federal investigation into Kindley began when two women, housed together at a small jail in Arizona, reported that he sexually assaulted them during two separate trips.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Levels of wretched-smelling hydrogen sulfide gas that have plagued south Los Angeles County communities for weeks are declining as authorities use various mitigation methods in a flood control channel emitting the gross odors, authorities said Friday in an online news conference. The problem was reported Oct. 7 and traced to the 15-mile-long Dominguez Channel, which flows into the Los Angeles harbor. The smell has chiefly affected the city of Carson and several other Los Angeles suburbs. The gas is being created by a natural phenomenon called anaerobic digestion, which occurs when bacteria break down vegetation when there’s a lack of oxygen in the water, said Mark Pestrella, the county’s public works director and chief engineer of the flood control district. In addition, the investigation revealed the presence of chemicals that are contributing to the problem. Pestrella did not identify those chemicals and said he could not comment further because it may involve criminal or civil actions. Public works is spraying the channel with a biodegradable odor neutralizer called Epoleon, which converts hydrogen sulfide to a salt. Daily tides are being relied on to spread the neutralizer, and Pestrella said drones are being considered to help that process. A system of bubblers is being installed in the channel to oxygenate the water, he said.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: A day care owner convicted of keeping 26 children hidden in the basement of her business two years ago has been sentenced to six years in prison after parents said some of the children still suffer trauma including sleeping problems and anxiety. A judge issued the sentence to Carla Faith on Thursday following her August conviction of more than two dozen misdemeanor child abuse charges and other crimes. Faith was only licensed to care for up to six children at her private day care, and only two were allowed to be under age 2. But police who went to her Mountain Play Place day care in November 2019 found 25 kids in the basement, including 12 under 2 years old, prosecutors said. There were two adult employees supervising them in the basement, and one accepted a plea deal and testified at Faith’s trial, KRDO-TV reports. A 26th child was picked up by a parent while police were on site, authorities said. Many of the children had soiled or wet diapers and were sweaty and thirsty, according to an arrest affidavit. When police arrived, Faith repeatedly told an officer that no children were there and that the home did not have a basement, but the officer heard children’s music and a child’s cry from the basement, the affidavit said. Another officer discovered a false wall and moved it to reveal the basement staircase, the affidavit said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Employees in the state’s prison system make up more than 32% of state workers who have failed to comply with Gov. Ned Lamont’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate, according to figures released Friday by the governor’s office. Of Connecticut’s 30,623 state workers 1,482 – about 5% – have not been vaccinated or submitted to weekly coronavirus testing as required by the mandate, according to the report. Those include 483 workers at the state Department of Correction, which has about 5,400 employees. The governor’s office had given workers until Oct. 4 to comply with the order. But the state has so far fired just 22 workers and placed an additional 29 on unpaid leave. Officials are in the process of suspending or terminating an additional 70 workers, the governor’s office said. “The majority of employees who are currently out of compliance are working with the state to come into compliance and anticipate coming into compliance in the coming days,” Lamont spokesperson David Bednarz said. The department confirmed Friday that it has seen a recent uptick in COVID-19 cases in several prisons, including the Hartford Correctional Center, the New Haven Correctional Center and the Carl Robinson Correctional Center. Spokesperson Andrius Banevicius said most of those are asymptomatic cases among inmates.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: Nearly every beach town along the state’s coast made more money from parking permits and meters this past summer than in 2020, and most also beat pre-pandemic revenue in 2019. In Lewes, the total parking revenue in 2021, including fees collected from parking tickets, reached just over $1 million – a 17% increase from 2019 and about a 27% jump from 2020. In Dewey Beach and Bethany Beach, this summer’s total parking revenues increased by just over 20% each compared to summer 2019. Their recovery from 2020 revenue was even greater. Dewey Beach’s accounting clerk clarified that the collections from parking fines during a given year may not perfectly reflect how many tickets were issued that year. But even without the revenue from parking citations, Dewey made a huge comeback: Revenue from parking permits and meters alone increased by about a third since 2019. Even as crowds returned to the boardwalks and beaches, though, some signs of the pandemic remained. Rehoboth Beach, for example, maintained its Meterless Mondays – free parking from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. every Monday – and several parking spots were taken up by outdoor dining and reserved spaces for carryout orders. Even so, Rehoboth Beach only fell below its pre-pandemic revenue by $80,000.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Area commuters will face longer waits for Metro trains through at least the end of the month and probably longer, as more than half the fleet of train cars will remain out of service over safety issues. Metro General Manager Paul Wiedefeld told reporters Friday that there was no timeline for the return of the transit authority’s 7000-series train cars, which were abruptly pulled from service last week after a derailing revealed a chronic problem with the wheels and axles. Those 748 cars are the newest and constitute more than 60% of the fleet. The derailing is under investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board, and Wiedefeld said he couldn’t comment on it while the investigation was ongoing. In the meantime, Wiedefeld said Metro engineers were working to bring older retired cars back into service. But he said the older cars were undergoing rigorous inspections, and he didn’t expect them back in service until early November. Until then, riders can expect longer delays between trains across the system, whose six lines crisscross the city and stretch deep into the Maryland and Virginia suburbs. The transit authority currently has 268 rail cars in service. There are 180 cars from the older 6000-series trains that may be brought back if they pass inspections. Currently only 22 of them are available for service.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: The state’s top health official was asked to leave a meeting after refusing to wear a mask at the office of a state senator who told him she had a serious medical condition, officials have confirmed. Florida Senate leader Wilton Simpson, a Republican, sent a memo to senators Saturday regarding the incident at the office of Democratic state Sen. Tina Polsky, asking visitors at the building to be respectful with social interactions. Polsky, who represents parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties, had not yet made public her breast cancer diagnosis. Polsky told the Associated Press about the tense exchange with state Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo that was first reported by news site Florida Politics. She said Ladapo and two aides were offered masks and were asked to wear them when they arrived for the Wednesday meeting. She did not tell him she had breast cancer but said she had a serious condition. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says cancer patients are at a higher risk to get severely ill from COVID-19 and may not build the same immunity to vaccines. Ladapo had asked to meet her in Tallahassee as he seeks confirmation in the Senate after being named to the post by Gov. Ron DeSantis last month. Polsky said she asked whether there was a reason why he couldn’t wear a mask, but he wouldn’t answer.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A judge is throwing out ethics charges against former Georgia Insurance Commissioner John Oxendine, saying state officials waited too long to pursue action. Oxendine was accused of illegally using campaign funds from his failed 2010 gubernatorial campaign to buy a house and lease cars. He was also accused of accepting campaign contributions 10 times above the legal limit from insurance companies. Local news outlets report administrative law judge Ronit Walker ruled last week that the statute of limitations on misconduct had passed when ethics officials began to pursue Oxendine in 2015. Walker also ruled that the Georgia Government Transparency and Campaign Finance Commission can’t pursue Oxendine for accepting $120,000 in bundled contributions from two insurance companies. “No matter how patently obvious it may be that corporations are ‘affiliated,’ the legislature has chosen only to penalize the donor,” Walker wrote in dismissing the illegal contributions case against Oxendine, citing state law. The ethics complaint against the insurers was dismissed in 2014 because commission staff had made little progress. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported in 2016 that Oxendine kept $500,000 in leftover funds from his gubernatorial campaign and kept contributions for a runoff and general election he never saw.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The number of students enrolled at the University of Hawaii’s 10 campuses increased this fall for the first time in a decade. The school’s flagship Manoa campus led the way with a 6% increase, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The university’s first-year class is its largest ever. Overall, the institution’s enrollment is the highest it’s been since 2014. Enrollment at the Hilo campus is up 2.5%. Leeward Community College and Windward Community College posted gains of 0.8% and 3.8%, respectively. Overall enrollment at UH’s seven community colleges, however, is down 3.2%. Manoa enrollment, officials said, was up in nearly every category, including resident, continental U.S, transfer and international students. UH-Manoa Provost Michael Bruno credited the university for spreading the word about the benefits of a Manoa education. The perception that Hawaii and the Manoa campus in particular have managed the coronavirus pandemic better than most places may have played a role, he said. Hawaii Pacific University had been expecting an enrollment boost before the fall semester began. It was expecting to have 4,000 students this fall, its most ever. Its first-year class was expected to climb from about 500 to more than 800.\n\nIdaho\n\nHailey: The city is asking a federal judge to throw out a lawsuit brought by an anti-mask group, arguing the group’s members can’t show they’ve actually been harmed by a local face-covering mandate. Hailey and other central Idaho towns surrounding the popular Sun Valley ski resort were at the epicenter of the state’s first major coronavirus outbreak in March 2020. The city enacted its mask mandate – requiring most people to wear masks in public when indoors or outside when social distancing is impossible – in July 2020, and a version of the order has remained in place ever since. Idaho remains one of the least-vaccinated states in the nation, and unvaccinated COVID-19 patients have overwhelmed hospitals. A month ago, state public health leaders enacted “crisis standards of care,” allowing hospitals to ration health care as needed to deal with the flood of patients. About a week after the state entered crisis standards of care, an anti-mask organization based hundreds of miles away in the northern Idaho city of Sandpoint sued Hailey on behalf of its members who live in and near the central Idaho town. In the lawsuit, the group said the mask mandate amounted to a “mandatory human experiment” that violates their fundamental human rights.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The mayor has helped launch the installation of new signs renaming the city’s picturesque Lake Shore Drive after a Black man recognized as a key settler of the city. Mayor Lori Lightfoot gathered Thursday with political and community leaders at Buckingham Fountain to kick off the installation of 12 large highway signs declaring the thoroughfare “Jean Baptiste Pointe DuSable Lake Shore Drive.” More than 80 smaller street signs that will mark the roadway along the city’s Lake Michigan shoreline read simply: “DuSable Lake Shore Drive,” the Chicago Sun-Times reports. Lightfoot, who had initially opposed renaming Lake Shore Drive, said the $500,000 cost is “worth it” to honor a man who was “forgotten in the annals” of Chicago history. “We needed to find a way to honor our founder,” Lightfoot said. Chicago’s City Council approved the name change in June. DuSable, a native of Haiti, is considered Chicago’s first permanent, non-Indigenous settler. He had a successful trading post in the late 1700s. He died in 1818. Chicago was incorporated as a town in 1833 and as a city four years later. Alderman Donald Moore initially proposed changing the name of the ribbon of concrete along Lake Michigan to DuSable Drive two years ago after a riverboat tour of the city in which he said DuSable’s name wasn’t mentioned.\n\nIndiana\n\nFort Wayne: Twitter suspended a congressman’s official account after removing a post about a transgender woman over violation of the social media company’s rules. Twitter’s action Saturday came after Republican U.S. Rep. Jim Banks posted tweets last week regarding Dr. Rachel Levine becoming the first openly transgender four-star officer in the U.S. uniformed services. Banks had responded to the U.S. surgeon general congratulating Levine on her promotion in the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps by writing: “The title of first female four-star officer gets taken by a man.” Now-retired Army Gen. Ann Dunwoody was the first woman in the U.S. military to attain a four-star rank. Banks’ post was removed with a reference to Twitter rules that include a ban on “targeted misgendering” of transgender people. Banks’ official Twitter account remained online Sunday, but he wasn’t allowed to add new posts. His personal account with fewer followers remained active. Banks, whose district covers Fort Wayne and surrounding northeastern Indiana, has frequently drawn attention with right-wing social media comments. He stood by his post about Levine. “My tweet was a statement of fact,” Banks said in a statement. “Big Tech doesn’t have to agree with me, but they shouldn’t be able to cancel me.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Doctors accused of doing something dangerous or inappropriate could keep the allegations private until a regulatory board makes a final determination and issues a report under a state Supreme Court decision issued Friday. In its unanimous decision, the court said the Iowa Board of Medicine should not have publicly disclosed information about a doctor under investigation, as was standard for the agency. Its ruling likely will lead to changes in how dozens of other boards handle complaints. “Read in its entirety, we do not believe the statute is ambiguous. Investigative information cannot be released to the public prior to a final decision in a disciplinary proceeding,” Justice Edward Mansfield wrote. Iowa Freedom of Information Council Executive Director Randy Evans called the decision disappointing and said he hopes the Legislature revises the statute. “Those facts and circumstances need full and timely disclosure to patients and consumers so they can make an informed selection of a treating physician,” he said. The court ruled in the case of Dr. Domenico Calcaterra, a cardiothoracic surgeon who formerly practiced in Iowa City but now practices in another state. He has long denied allegations of disruptive behavior and unethical or unprofessional misconduct.\n\nKansas\n\nOverland Park: The Overland Park Police Department plans to expand its team that responds to calls involving mental health crises, with a goal of defusing the situations while keeping everyone safe. The new Overland Park Crisis Action Team will have 12 members and six co-responders, though most of the positions haven’t started yet. Currently, it has two crisis intervention specialists and three co-responders, The Kansas City Star reports. When the team responds to a mental health call, it will be accompanied by a clinician from Johnson County Mental Health. A therapy dog will also join the team. “Our whole goal is to bring them in and let them do their job, and (officers are) there to make sure everybody’s safe,” said police Sgt. Stewart Brought. In September, the Overland Park City Council raised property taxes to create the expanded unit. OPCAT also received a nearly $250,000 grant from the Department of Justice. “This OPCAT unit, it will save lives,” said Sheila Albers, who has fought for police reforms since her 17-year-old son, John Albers, was killed by an Overland Park officer during a welfare check in January 2018.\n\nKentucky\n\nBardstown: Striking workers at one of the world’s largest bourbon producers voted to ratify a new contract Saturday, a day after announcing a tentative agreement with Heaven Hill. About 420 members of United Food and Commercial Workers Local 23D went on strike about six weeks ago, forming picket lines at the company’s operations in Bardstown after rejecting a previous contract proposal. The tentative agreement came just days after the company signaled it intended to start hiring permanent replacement employees for bottling and warehouse operations. The workers then voted to ratify the five-year agreement Saturday, according to a statement from Heaven Hill. “We look forward to welcoming our team members as we transition back to normal operations,” company spokesperson Josh Hafer said in the statement. The dispute revolved around health care and scheduling, the latter a sign of the bourbon industry’s growing pains as it tries to keep up with global demand. Family-owned and operated Heaven Hill produces Evan Williams, one of the world’s top-selling bourbons. The spirits company’s other brands include Elijah Craig, Henry McKenna, Old Fitzgerald, Larceny and Parker’s Heritage Collection.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The high school bands played, the costumed marching groups danced, and float riders threw Moon Pies and beads to the thousands of people who turned out Saturday for the city’s first big parade since the onslaught of the coronavirus pandemic put the brakes on New Orleans’ signature brand of frivolity. The streets were lined with thousands of residents and tourists who came to watch the Krewe of Boo parade – the first float parade since Mardi Gras 2020. The Halloween-themed parade stretches from the city’s Marigny neighborhood through the French Quarter and into the Warehouse District. Riders on the floats dress up in Halloween-themed outfits and throw ghoulish and fun trinkets and beads to crowds that pack the streets. “This is one of the best feelings in a very long time,” said Jordan Philebar, a New Orleans resident who was dressed as Wednesday Addams from “The Addams Family” as she rode a float along with four members of her family. “It’s lovely to feel slightly normal again.” Mardi Gras 2020 was largely credited with contributing to the city becoming an early hot spot for the coronavirus. As the extent and seriousness of the pandemic became apparent, parades and music festivals were canceled.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A proposed “right to food” constitutional amendment is on the ballot for the state’s voters in the Nov. 2 election. Some say it would simply put people in charge of how and what they eat, while others worry it would endanger animals and food supplies and turn urban neighborhoods into cattle pastures. For supporters, the language is short and to the point, ensuring the right to grow vegetables and raise livestock in an era when corporatization threatens local ownership of the food supply – a constitutional experiment that has never been tried in any state. For opponents and skeptics, it’s deceptively vague, representing a threat to food safety and animal welfare, and could embolden residents to raise cows in their backyards in cities like Portland and Bangor. Voters will be asked if they favor an amendment to the Maine Constitution “to declare that all individuals have a natural, inherent and unalienable right to grow, raise, harvest, produce and consume the food of their own choosing for their own nourishment, sustenance, bodily health and well-being.” The proposal is an outgrowth of the right-to-food movement, sometimes called the food sovereignty movement. Maine enacted the nation’s first food sovereignty law in 2017, allowing local governments to OK small food producers selling directly to customers on site. The law was especially popular with sellers of raw milk, which can be legally sold in Maine but is more restricted in many other states.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state’s highest court has disbarred retired Harford County State’s Attorney Joseph Cassilly for withholding exculpatory evidence that surfaced in a 1981 double-murder case and lying about it over the years. The Baltimore Sun reports Cassilly learned of the court’s decision Friday in a phone call from the newspaper. “Oh, whatever. I’m retired anyway,” he reportedly told the Sun. The Maryland Court of Appeals found the former prosecutor lied about documents that undermined the credibility of an FBI agent on the case. The judges noted Cassilly, a Republican, served 36 years as Harford County’s top prosecutor and retired in 2019. The judges wrote that disbarring him would prevent his possible return to the courtroom and send a message. Cassilly maintains that he did nothing wrong but rather “fell into the whole anti-criminal justice movement, where the cops are the bad guys and the prosecutors are the bad guys.” “I’m disappointed, but the real answer is: Do I care? I don’t give a damn,” he said. “I wouldn’t do anything to engage in the practice of law right now because it’s such a screwed-up obscenity.” John Norman Huffington, who was released from prison in 2008 after serving 27 years of a life sentence, has said he would have won his freedom years earlier had Cassilly disclosed key records.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: State lawmakers are considering whether to begin allowing electric bicycles in bike lanes. Currently, electric bikes are prohibited on bike paths because they’re categorized as mopeds, though advocates for bicyclists say the law is largely unenforced. The Boston Globe reports some state lawmakers are now pushing a bill to bring Massachusetts in line with 46 other states and Washington, D.C., in regulating electric bikes as bikes. “What’s abundantly clear, whatever the law, is people are riding e-bikes in bike lanes and bike paths, as they should – they are bikes,” said state Rep. Dylan Fernandes, D-Democrat, who is sponsoring the bill in the House. A similar bill is pending in the state Senate. The House chairman of the Legislature’s Transportation Committee, however, questioned whether it’s safe to allow bikes traveling at 20 mph or more on the paths. “These are pretty fast speeds,” said Rep. William Straus, D-Mattapoisett. “I want to be really cautious in terms of the safety issues.”\n\nMichigan\n\nHamtramck: Another Michigan city is giving filters to residents as a result of high lead results in some drinking water samples. Hamtramck, in the Detroit area, is a 2-square-mile city with 28,000 residents, many of them immigrants from Bangladesh, Yemen and other countries. Seven hundred filters were passed out Thursday, and another 900 will be distributed this week, said City Manager Kathleen Angerer. “The water itself is fine. The issue is the outdated lead services lines that in some cases are leaching lead into the water into individual homes,” Mayor Karen Majewski said. She said not every home is affected. “People don’t need to panic,” Angerer said. LaTonya Hatcher, 49, was in line Thursday. “I want to get a filter for the sink,” she said. “I live in a newer neighborhood, and the pipes might be fine, but I was walking by and saw they were giving out filters, so I thought I should ask if I need one.” Across the state in Benton Harbor, residents have been urged to use only bottled water for cooking and drinking due to elevated lead levels. The problem in both communities, according to officials, is old lines that need to be replaced. Majewski said Hamtramck has replaced 260 lead lines over the past year but needs money to remove more.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Native Americans have contracted COVID-19 at two to three times the rate of white Minnesotans over the past month, according to state health officials. There are large pockets of unvaccinated people in the 18-to-49 age range in Minnesota’s tribal communities and across the country, according to Mary Owen, director of the Center for American Indian and Minority Health at the University of Minnesota medical school. “We have some folks who are not getting vaccinated, whether it’s because they’re resisting it or because they’re not able to get access. Not quite sure. It’s probably a combination of those. But that’s impacting us again, significantly,” said Owen, who is also president of the Association of American Indian Physicians. Owen said that’s especially concerning because Native Americans have high rates of health disparities, such as diabetes, that put them at higher risk for serious COVID-19 illness, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. “We have some very frail people in our communities that cannot afford to get infected. We have to protect them,” Owen said. “So please, do what’s right for our communities, not just for us as individuals.” The Leech Lake reservation has recorded its highest numbers of positive COVID-19 cases over the past month since the pandemic began.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Prison employees will conduct once-a-week rehearsals as the state prepares for its first execution since 2012, according to Corrections Commissioner Burl Cain. He said Friday that the rehearsals for a lethal injection are usually done once a month at the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman, following a protocol that’s about 20 pages long. “Very, very detailed,” Cain said. The Mississippi Supreme on Thursday set a Nov. 17 execution date for David Neal Cox, who pleaded guilty in 2012 to killing his wife, Kim, in 2010 in the northern Mississippi town of Shannon. Cox withdrew his appeals and once filed court papers calling himself “worthy of death.” Mississippi has not had an execution since 2012, and it had six that year. Cain confirmed Mississippi has obtained lethal injection drugs, but he declined to say how. “I’m not supposed to talk about the drugs too much,” Cain said. Mississippi is still facing a lawsuit filed in 2015 by the Roderick & Solange MacArthur Justice Center on behalf of two inmates. The suit argues Mississippi’s lethal injection protocol is inhumane.\n\nMissouri\n\nBates City: A small-town mayor resigned ahead of a scheduled impeachment hearing called after he was allegedly recorded uttering a racial slur. Shawn Fox offered his resignation last Monday to the Bates City Board of Aldermen, ahead of an impeachment hearing scheduled Wednesday, television station WDAF reports. Instead of the hearing, the board accepted Fox’s resignation Wednesday. Mayor Pro-Tem Roy Trussell said Fox’s resignation came after the city had concluded its investigation, which included a leaked recording of someone believed to be Fox uttering a racial slur, as well as allegations of sexual harassment. It was unclear when or where the recording was made or who had leaked it. Fox’s resignation was the latest in a recent exodus of city government officials amid mounting allegations of a hostile work environment. Alderman Donnie Hammond resigned Tuesday, and the city’s collector and a court clerk both recently stepped down. Bates City is a town of nearly 220 about 28 miles east of Kansas City.\n\nMontana\n\nBrowning: The Blackfeet Nation honored Chief Earl Old Person with a weeklong memorial, ending with a funeral service Friday in the Browning High School gym. The gym smelled of sage, many women wore ribbon skirts, and some men wore headdresses as they remembered the life of Old Person, who was the tribe’s chief for 43 years. He died of cancer Oct. 13 in Browning. He was 92. Hundreds of people gathered in the gym as Old Person was remembered for his tireless advocacy for Native Americans and their culture, his strength of character, and his humility. He served on the tribal council for more than 60 years and was chairman of the tribal business council for over 50 years. He traveled the world, meeting Queen Elizabeth, the shah of Iran, and every U.S. president from Harry Truman to Barack Obama in advocating for the Blackfeet Tribe. He also worked to preserve the Blackfeet language, songs and culture. But tribal members remember his constant presence on the reservation and his care and concern for the Blackfeet people. He would attend basketball games, community events and graduations. He served as a mentor and even a father figure to tribal members. “We’re putting one of our last chiefs to rest,” Jay St. Goddard said. “It’s not just a private event; it’s not just a Montana event – this is a national event.”\n\nNebraska\n\nSuperior: An employee who returned fire after a gunman killed two people at a grain elevator likely prevented more deaths, a Nebraska State Patrol official said Friday. The employee, who was not named, retrieved a weapon and shot Max Hoskinson, 61, after Hoskinson began shooting at the Agrex Elevator in Superior on Thursday. Hoskinson, of Superior, was pronounced dead at a hospital. Authorities said he had been fired earlier Thursday and returned that afternoon with a gun and began shooting in an office area. The victims were identified as Sandra Nelson, 60, of Formoso, Kansas, and 53-year-old Darin Koepke, of Hadar, Nebraska. The third person shot by Hoskinson was treated at a hospital and released. Patrol Sgt. Jeff Roby said during the news conference that authorities do not anticipate filing any charges against the employee who shot Hoskinson. “In fact, it’s likely that the employee’s actions may have prevented much further loss of life in this tragedy,” Roby said. He said he could not comment on whether Hoskinson targeted the victims, who were all Agrex employees. He said several other employees were on site when the shooting occurred.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Lawmakers have decided motorists who want refunds of a $1-per-transaction surcharge that courts decided was unconstitutionally authorized in 2020 will have to go in person to state Department of Motor Vehicles offices. The Legislature’s Interim Finance Committee signed off Thursday on the refund program, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. The move aims to comply with a Nevada Supreme Court ruling last May that said the surcharge was unconstitutionally authorized by the Legislature because the state constitution requires revenue measures to be approved by two-thirds majorities in both chambers. Senate Republicans opposed extending the DMV fee along with a tax on businesses in 2019 and filed suit after Democrats approved them. The DMV said it was collecting about $7 million per year from the fee but would provide refunds after the court ruling. The Review-Journal reports five other refund options were dismissed as more complex and costly than the amount collected, including mailing checks to all DMV customers. The rule that lawmakers adopted says people will have to present receipts in person at a DMV office for refunds. Business customers, with a larger volume of transactions, can receive checks.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A legislative committee on Friday approved a proposal from the state Department of Health and Human Services to use $4.7 million in federal American Rescue Plan funds to boost COVID-19 vaccination efforts. The last-minute proposal from Gov. Chris Sununu and Health and Human Services Commissioner Lori Shibinette came last week after she withdrew the requests for the acceptance of $27 million in federal COVID-19 vaccination funding that was rejected by the Executive Council the week prior. Approval for the $27 million was needed by both the council and the Joint Legislative Fiscal Committee, which tabled the funds last month. Republican members expressed deep concern that accepting the funds would have bound the state to follow federal directives and mandates related to COVID-19, including “quarantine and isolation.” Attorney General John Formella said that wasn’t the case. Sununu thanked the committee for its vote, saying that “we are committed to finding alternative sources of funds to ensure our vaccine distribution can move full steam ahead, and today’s vote allows us to do so.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: Bucking a practice used by most law enforcement agencies in the state, the Newark Police Department, New Jersey’s largest municipal force, will stop posting the mug shots of people arrested for minor offenses. The city’s public safety department announced the change in a Facebook post Wednesday. The reason, public safety director Brian O’Hara said, is to help “safeguard individuals from marginalized communities from abuse.” In the post, O’Hara cited a spike in negative comments on a 2017 social media post regarding a prostitution arrest. “The incendiary comments fundamentally indicate that members of marginalized communities – including the transgender community – can become targets of cyber-bullying, which can lead to hate crimes and violence, simply because their photos were published online,” O’Hara said. After the spike in comments, he had the post taken down and changed the department’s policy on mug shots. From now on, the department will only publish mug shots that serve “a specific law enforcement purpose, such as locating a wanted or missing person.” Publishing mug shots can have detrimental consequences to people arrested, said Sarah E. Lageson, an associate professor at the Rutgers-Newark School of Criminal Justice who has a doctorate in sociology.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Federal water managers warned Wednesday that like other basins across the western U.S., the Pecos River Basin is likely to experience growing water shortages as temperatures continue to rise over the next century. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation discussed the findings of a recently completed study on the basin during a virtual briefing, saying the goal of the work was to better understand the threats to water supplies in the region due to climate change. Officials also looked at what tools could be used to stretch resources to help sustain viable agriculture over the coming century as challenges grow. Reclamation Study Manager Dagmar Llewellyn said those challenges are significant. She described the Pecos basin as arid with a limited and highly variable water supply. “Drought and climate change-induced aridification is ongoing already in the basin,” she said. “We’ve been seeing less snowfall in the headwaters and more winter precipitation falling as rain. We’ve also been seeing higher consumption rates within the agricultural system.” The peak flow of snowmelt runoff into Santa Rosa Reservoir, located at the top of the system, amounted to only a trickle of about 5 cubic feet per second this year. Total volume during the runoff period was about 700 acre-feet, or 56 times less than the historical average. That meant less water for downstream users.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and two other U.S. lawmakers reintroduced a bill in the House on Friday to put immigrants who cleared debris after the Sept. 11 attacks on a fast track to legal immigration status in the United States. The 9/11 Immigrant Worker Freedom Act is a revised version of a bill that former Rep. Joseph Crowley of New York introduced in 2017 that did not advance in the House. Ocasio-Cortez defeated Crowley in a 2018 Democratic primary, winning the seat representing parts of the Bronx and Queens. Immigrants in New York, many of whom are Spanish-speaking cleanup workers, have long asked to obtain legal immigration status in the U.S. as compensation for their work and the subsequent health problems they suffered after the attacks. Hired informally by cleaning companies, the workers cleared debris, asbestos and dust inside lower Manhattan buildings for months without adequate protective gear. But 20 years after 9/11, only several dozen are still participating in protests and making the request, while others have abandoned that fight. Rep. Adriano Espaillat and Rep. Grace Meng, both from New York, are lead co-sponsors of the bill.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The soon-to-be successor to a state House member who died this month said Friday that he was outside the U.S. Capitol in January as an insurrection occurred. Donnie Loftis, who was chosen by Gaston County Republican activists last week to succeed the late Rep. Dana Bumgardner, confirmed his attendance at the Jan. 6 event to WRAL-TV. Loftis, a former Gaston County commissioner, said his involvement in what turned into a riot was strictly peaceful. On Jan. 6, “while I peacefully exercised my first amendment rights in front of the US Capitol, I was surprised and disappointed to watch others storm the entrance as violence ensued,” he wrote by text message to the station. “I had absolutely zero involvement in the rioting and categorically condemn the storming of our Capitol building that day.” Hundreds of Donald Trump’s supporters battered their way past police, injured dozens of officers and interrupted the electoral count inside the Capitol certifying President Joe Biden’s victory. In January, Loftis had posted a picture of himself to Facebook before the rally saying he was on a bus headed to Washington, according to WRAL. “I got gassed three times and was at the entrance when they breached the door,” Loftis, an Army veteran, posted at the time, according to a screenshot. “I spoke to many service members, and we all agreed that we didn’t want to be there, but we had no other choice. They don’t get it that they work for us. And I mean that in a respectful way.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state is working to extend its contract with Hollywood actor Josh Duhamel to promote tourism in his home state. The top tourism official in one of the least-visited states in the nation said the 48-year-old star of several “Transformers” movies has been effective in attracting visitors to North Dakota, better known for its brutal cold weather than as a vacation destination. “He has helped expand our image and awareness of our state,” said Sara Otte Coleman, who heads the state’s tourism agency. Duhamel, a native of Minot, has been the face of North Dakota and its pitchman since 2013. He has been paid more than $1 million from the state since then. “He’s a great ambassador for our state and cares about where he comes from,” Otte Coleman said. Duhamel was the honorary chairman of a fund that raised millions of dollars for victims of a 2011 flood in his hometown that swamped more than 4,000 homes and businesses. About 11,000 people were forced to evacuate. The home where Duhamel grew up and his sister’s family’s home were both severely damaged. He appealed to his fans on social media and on TV appearances to help the victims of the flood. His current two-year tourism deal expires in December. Otte Coleman said she expects Duhamel to sign an extension.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state’s debut of its new license plate failed to take off because a banner depicted on the plate was attached to the wrong end of the Wright Brothers’ historic first plane, the Wright Flyer. The new license plate illustrates rays of sunlight beaming into the sky, with a banner that reads “Birthplace of Aviation” draped across the horizon. But the banner, which should have been trailing behind the plane, was attached to its front. After the unveiling, Ohio officials said in a statement that they were aware of the mishap and that it would be corrected to show the banner trailing the plane before Ohioans upgrade their plates. Ohio isn’t the only entity to make this flighty error. The front of the Wright Flyer can easily be mistaken for its back because the plane’s propellers were located at the back, instead of the front. The plates are expected to land on the market Dec. 29.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: State Health Commissioner Dr. Lance Frye unexpectedly resigned from the post Friday, effective immediately, the state health department said. Department spokesperson Rachel Klein said Frye “felt it was time to move on” from leading the agency. His departure came a day after state Republican leaders, including Gov. Kevin Stitt, expressed outrage upon learning the health department in May issued a birth certificate with a nonbinary gender designation. The birth certificate was issued as part of a settlement with an Oklahoma-born Oregon resident. The settlement was reached under the administration of former state Attorney General Mike Hunter, Frye said. In a statement released by the department Friday, Frye lauded “the dedication, resilience and tenacity of the OSDH team.” “They have worked tirelessly over the last two years to ensure Oklahomans had access to not only COVID-19 testing, vaccinations and critical information, but to other life-saving services,” he said in the statement. Deputy Health Commissioner Keith Reed has been named interim commissioner of health, according to Kevin Corbett, state Secretary of Health and Mental Health.\n\nOregon\n\nThe Dalles: The massive Google data centers on the edge of this Columbia River town are triggering concerns about water usage. Now a critical part of modern computing, data centers help people stream movies, conduct transactions, post updates on social media, store trillions of photos and more. But a single facility can also churn through millions of gallons of water per day to keep hot-running equipment cool. Google wants to build at least two more data centers in The Dalles, worrying some residents who fear there eventually won’t be enough water for everyone – including for area farms and fruit orchards, which are by far the biggest users. The Dalles is the seat of Wasco County, which is suffering extreme and exceptional drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. The region last summer endured its hottest days on record, reaching 118 degrees Fahrenheit in The Dalles. The new data centers wouldn’t be able to use Columbia River water and instead would take it from rivers and groundwater that has gone through the city’s water treatment plant. However, the snowpack in the nearby Cascade Range that feeds the aquifers varies wildly year-to-year, and glaciers are melting. Adding to the unease: The 15,000 town residents don’t know how much water the proposed data centers will use because Google calls it a trade secret.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The School District of Philadelphia is working to repatriate Native American skeletal remains found in a high school classroom closet this summer. A letter sent to parents of Central High School students Friday said the “human skeletal item” was previously used as a teaching aid and dated back to the 1850s. The district consulted with the Department of Interior, Temple University and other experts about how to handle the remains, Evelyn Nunez, the district’s chief of schools, wrote in the letter to parents. “The District is also working with these partners to return this person, who has been identified as a male Native American, to his home tribe,” she said. Central High School, founded in 1836, is the second-oldest continuously operating public high school in the country, but it is not alone in its history of using skeletal remains as learning tools. In a statement Friday, the district said the remains were likely used in teaching through the mid-1900s at the latest, but the district’s schools have not used skeletal remains in classrooms for more than a decade. The district has launched a search of inventories at all of its schools to make sure any other skeletal remains are identified, treated with respect and also repatriated if possible.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Legislature has created a website to post the proposals it’s receiving for spending federal funds to help the state recover from the coronavirus pandemic. Rhode Island was allocated $1.1 billion in American Rescue Plan funds. Democratic Gov. Dan McKee is urging the Legislature to start spending, saying Rhode Island is the only state in the Northeast that has not used any of its federal pandemic relief funding yet. The General Assembly created a section on its website for residents to see all of the ideas that are being suggested. The goal is to increase transparency. “With such a large infusion of federal funding, it is critical that the process of allocating these funds is done in a transparent manner that allows the public to access the information being shared with legislators,” House Speaker Joe Shekarchi, a Warwick Democrat, said in a statement. “We encourage the public to be engaged so we use this money to its maximum benefit for Rhode Islanders.” Submitting a recommendation to the portal should not be viewed as a formal request for funding, and it does not guarantee a response, public hearing or appropriation from the General Assembly, the Legislature said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nMount Pleasant: A widow is suing Charleston County two years after her husband died following a ketamine injection he received during an arrest. The complaint filed by Tabitha Eileen Britt earlier this month says the two paramedics who injected her husband, James Britt, with the sedative drug after he was handcuffed by Mount Pleasant police in 2019 weren’t authorized to do so under state law. The Post and Courier reports Tabitha Britt wants a judge to stop county paramedics from using ketamine to aid law enforcement without a medical reason. A police report says Mount Pleasant officers were dispatched Sept. 30, 2019, for a man urinating on the roadway. According to the lawsuit, one officer initially stopped to help James Britt change a car tire before she said she would arrest him for public intoxication. According to the complaint, police forced James Britt to the ground in a prone position, where he repeatedly said he couldn’t breathe. One paramedic who arrived at the scene then injected James Britt with 500 mg of ketamine, the maximum dose under county guidelines. The suit says James Britt stopped breathing minutes later; although he was resuscitated in the ambulance, he never regained consciousness and died less than three weeks later in the hospital.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nLead: A study that focuses on ways to cool streams during the hottest times of the year in an effort to preserve the trout population is yielding positive results, officials from the South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks say. Jeremy Kientz, a fisheries biologist with the agency, has been working to discover ways to cool the waters, in a study that specifically focuses on French Creek in Custer State Park. He said it’s one of a few trout streams in the Black Hills that can reach temperatures up to 80 degrees for several hours a day, increasing the chances of trout mortality. “We’ve had a couple instances here in the Black Hills where we’ve had trout fish kills because of temperatures that are too high in the summertime,” Kientz said. “When the water temperature hits 80 degrees, and it stays there for a little while, the trout will die. Even at 75 degrees, trout shut down, and they don’t eat. So now you not only have a survival issue but a growth issue.” But working on ways to cool the streams is not easy, Kientz said. Building shade takes time, and dams have become unpopular, not to mention expensive. So Kientz said he has been working with mechanical engineers from North Dakota State University to build small pockets of cooled water where trout can seek refuge when temperatures rise, the Black Hills Pioneer reports.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: An area school district can continue requiring students to wear masks in school after a federal judge on Friday extended a ruling blocking an opt-out provision. The ruling comes in a lawsuit brought by the families of two children with disabilities who attend Williamson County schools. They claim Gov. Bill Lee’s executive order allowing parents to opt their children out of school mask mandates puts their children at risk and violates their educational rights. In the Friday opinion, U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw found that “disabled students are at a significantly higher risk for severe infection and are exposed at a higher rate following” following Lee’s executive order. He called that “an irreparable harm” that justifies continuing to block the order. “The record before the Court establishes that temporary universal mask mandates adopted by the Williamson County and Franklin school systems have been, and likely would continue to be, effective in curbing the spread of COVID-19,” Crenshaw wrote. “Executive Order No. 84 violates federal law and must yield.” The ruling mirrors those by federal judges in Memphis and Knoxville, where Lee’s order is also blocked. As a result, school districts in Shelby, Williamson and Knox counties can continue to enforce universal mask policies.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The U.S. Supreme Court is allowing the state law that bans most abortions to remain in place but has agreed to hear arguments in the case in early November. The justices said Friday that they will decide whether the Justice Department and abortion providers can sue in federal court over a law that Justice Sonia Sotomayor said was “enacted in open disregard of the constitutional rights of women seeking abortion care in Texas.” Answering that question will help determine whether the law should be blocked while legal challenges continue. The court is moving at an unusually fast pace that suggests it plans to make a decision quickly. Arguments are set for Nov. 1. The court’s action leaves in place for the time being a law that clinics say has led to an 80% reduction in abortions in the nation’s second-largest state. The justices said in their order that they were deferring action on a request from the Justice Department to put the law on hold. Sotomayor wrote that she would have blocked the law now. “The promise of future adjudication offers cold comfort, however, for Texas women seeking abortion care, who are entitled to relief now,” Sotomayor wrote. It takes just four justices to decide to hear a case.\n\nUtah\n\nFarmington: A federal civil rights investigation released Thursday found widespread racial harassment of Black and Asian American students at a school district, including hundreds of documented uses of the N-word and other racial epithets over the past five years. The probe also found physical assaults, derogatory racial comments and harsher discipline for students of color at Davis School District, the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division said in a statement. The district has agreed to take several steps as part of a settlement agreement, including a new department to handle complaints, more training and data collection. Black students throughout the district told investigators about similar experiences of white and non-Black students calling them the N-word, referring to them as monkeys or apes, and saying their skin was dirty or looked like feces, according to the department’s findings. Students also made monkey noises at their Black peers, repeatedly referenced slavery and lynching, and told Black students to “go pick cotton,” and “you are my slave.” The investigation found Black students were also disciplined more harshly than their white peers for similar behavior and were denied the ability to form student groups while supporting similar requests by other students.\n\nVermont\n\nGuilford: The state has erected a historical marker recognizing the life of Lucy Terry Prince, an African American poet who wrote what is thought to be the oldest known poem by an African American. The marker was unveiled this week at the Interstate 91 welcome center in Guilford. Prince and her husband lived in Guilford in the late 1700s. As a child, Lucy Terry was stolen from Africa and enslaved in Deerfield, Massachusetts, the marker says. Her poem “Bars Fight” tells the story of the 1746 attack on Deerfield settlers. The poem “endured in oral tradition for over 100 years before appearing on the front page of the Springfield Daily Republican in 1854,” the marker says. She became free after marrying Abijah Prince in 1756, and the couple settled on 100 acres in Guilford in 1769, according to the marker.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The city’s schools will close for the entire first week of November, including two days “in the interest” of workers’ mental health, the superintendent announced. Richmond Public Schools Superintendent Jason Kamras announced the change Wednesday, noting the stress schools employees are under, The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports. “Over the last couple of weeks, I’ve heard directly from dozens of teachers, principals, and support staff about how stressful this year has been,” Kamras said in a letter. “Many have shared that they’re on the brink of burning out – even leaving – and it’s only October.” Richmond schools were already set to be closed three days that week, for Election Day, Diwali and parent-teacher conferences. Kamras also announced changes to address three major stressors: doing too much, not enough time, and students “exhibiting significant trauma from the past 20 months.” There will be no new programs, initiatives or curricula, and the system is adding 100 lunch monitors to help free up teachers at lunch time, Kamras said. He also authorized principles to make changes needed to “hold independent teacher planning time more sacred.” Kamras said he aims to reallocate $3 million of federal relief funding to boost student mental health support.\n\nWashington\n\nPort Angeles: About 40 shipping containers tumbled into the Pacific Ocean in rough seas west of the Strait of Juan de Fuca entrance Friday, authorities said. The ship then caught fire Saturday as a result of powdered chemicals that had been spilled, The Seattle Times reports. The U.S. Coast Guard Pacific Northwest said on Twitter on Friday afternoon that the ship lost the containers when it listed to its side. A Coast Guard helicopter from Port Angeles was sent to the area, and the crew was monitoring 35 floating containers as they moved north. The ship was headed to Canada when the incident happened, officials said. Photos from the helicopter captured containers, with one group of three linked together, floating in the water, a Coast Guard Twitter post showed. The Strait of Juan de Fuca is located northwest of Seattle. “The ship is on fire and expelling toxic gas,” a navigation warning sent to area ships said, according to the Times. “Two fallen containers are floating in the vicinity of the vessel.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Top state officials on Friday said they would welcome three Maryland counties that inquired about becoming part of the Mountain State, even though the likelihood of the union is almost nonexistent. “We’re absolutely standing here with open arms,” West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice said during a news conference that included state Senate President Craig Blair and House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, who also offered their support. Justice offered to call state lawmakers back for a special session to vote on a resolution that would add about 250,000 people in Garrett, Allegany and Washington counties in Maryland to West Virginia. Maryland officials representing the counties wrote letters dated Oct. 14 to Blair and Hanshaw expressing interest in joining West Virginia, news outlets report. The letters were signed by Maryland state Sen. George Edwards and Dels. Wendell Beitzel, Jason Buckel, Mike McKay and William Wivell. “The western areas of the state feel they’re being shortchanged in a lot of respects, and we had a lot of constituents approaching us … saying, ‘Why can’t we just join West Virginia?’ It’s just that simple,” Beitzel told the Parkersburg News and Sentinel.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A judge on Friday halted the state’s fall wolf season two weeks before hunters were set to take to the woods, siding with wildlife advocacy groups who argued that holding the hunt would be unconstitutional. Dane County Circuit Judge Jacob Frost issued a temporary injunction halting the season, which was set to begin Nov. 6. The order comes as part of a lawsuit that a coalition of wildlife advocacy groups filed in August seeking to stop the hunt and invalidate a state law authorizing annual seasons. Among other things, the coalition argued that the season is illegal because the Department of Natural Resources hasn’t updated its regulations setting up season parameters and has been relying on an emergency rule put in place shortly after then-Gov. Scott Walker signed a law in 2012 authorizing annual seasons and a wolf management plan that hasn’t been updated since 2007. Frost said the law creating the wolf season is constitutional on its face, but the DNR failed to create permanent regulations enacting it. The law gives the DNR great leeway in setting kill limits, hunting zone hours and the number of licenses, making it all the more important that the agency follow the regulatory process to ensure it doesn’t violate the separation of powers between the legislative and executive branches, he said.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: COVID-19 has hospitalized more residents than at any point in the COVID-19 pandemic, with one public health officer saying the situation is “like a war zone” at one of the state’s biggest hospitals. Wyoming hospitals had 249 COVID-19 patients Thursday, topping the previous high of 247 in November. The vast majority weren’t vaccinated. Unvaccinated people have accounted for 98% of all new cases in Wyoming since May 1, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Wyoming’s surge coincides with one of the lowest vaccination rates in the U.S., currently about 43%. Only West Virginia ranks lower for COVID-19 inoculation. The strain on Wyoming hospitals, meanwhile, has been more prolonged than previously. Last fall and winter, hospitalizations stayed above 200 for about three weeks. This year, they have hovered around 200 since early September. Wyoming Medical Center in Casper has been treating about 30% of Wyoming’s COVID-19 patients but lately has been denying transfer requests. “It’s like a war zone,” the Casper area’s health officer, Dr. Mark Dowell, told a county health board Thursday. “The ICU is overrun, and there are a lot of patients being admitted.” Five Wyoming hospitals have at some point gone into crisis standards of care during the current surge.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/07/26/sandy-hook-memorial-rabid-bats-tour-de-turtles-news-around-states/117661940/", "title": "Sandy Hook memorial, rabid bats, Tour de Turtles: News from ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nDothan: Police searching the home of a man suspected of attacking a woman in her home found more than 400 pairs of women’s panties, authorities said. Investigators also found dozens of photos of John Thomas Uda’s co-workers taken without their permission from the neck down, leading to 50 counts of voyeurism, Dothan police told news outlets. Uda, 27, also is charged with attempted rape, three counts of burglary, aggravated criminal surveillance and two counts of illegal possession of a credit card. Police are trying to figure out how many of those 400 paris of women’s underwear, which had been worn, might have been stolen. Investigators said worn panties can also be bought on the internet. Uda was accused in 2019 of stealing women’s underwear from laundromats, authorities said. Jail records did not indicate if Uda had an attorney.\n\nAlaska\n\nNome: A miner who said he was harassed by a bear for seven straight nights in the tundra near Nome was rescued when a passing Coast Guard helicopter spotted an SOS, the internationally recognized sign for help, on top of his cabin. The man, who was not identified by the Coast Guard in a statement, was taken to waiting rescue personnel in Nome. The helicopter crew was flying from Kotzebue to Kodiak on July 16 when it saw the SOS on top of the building. The crew circled back over the mining camp and saw a man waving his arms, another recognized sign of distress, the Coast Guard statement said. The man requested medical assistance after the helicopter landed, saying he had been attacked by a bear a few days earlier. The man appeared to have a leg injury and bruising on his torso, the Coast Guard said. The man said the bear had returned to his camp and harassed him every night for the previous week, according to the statement. Friends the same day the man was found had reported him overdue when he hadn’t returned to Nome. The Coast Guard statement didn’t specify what type of bear was involved.\n\nArizona\n\nPage:Lake Powell, the second-largest reservoir on the Colorado River, is about to hit the lowest water level since it was filled in 1963, the Bureau of Reclamation said. As of Friday afternoon, agency data showed the elevation at 3,555.35 feet above sea level. Despite the recent rain, officials anticipated the levels to decline to 3,555.1 feet by last weekend. The last time the reservoir dropped that low was in 2005, during the early days of a prolonged drought that continues to linger to this day. Once it falls below that level, it will mark a new low in the reservoir’s history. “The fact that we’ve reached this new record underscores the difficult situation that we’re in,” said Wayne Pullan, regional director for the Upper Colorado Basin at the Bureau of Reclamation, which manages Glen Canyon Dam, during a press call to discuss the milestone. Because of the low water levels, the bureau plans to release water from three upper basin reservoirs downstream into Lake Powell ahead of schedule. The emergency measure is intended to help ensure the water level remains high enough to keep the hydropower turbines spinning and generating electricity.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Arkansas’ coronavirus cases rose by nearly 2,000 on Friday as the state’s COVID-19 surge prompted the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences to scale back its hospital visitor policy. The Department of Health said the state’s virus cases rose by 1,987 to 372,313 total since the pandemic began. The state’s COVID-19 hospitalizations rose by 22 to 871, with 328 in intensive care and 159 on ventilators. UAMS announced that beginning Monday it will change its visitation policy to limit patients to one visitor per day. Previously, patients could have multiple visitors a day as long as only one visitor was in the patient’s room at a time. UAMS said it will continue to allow additional visitors for end-of-life situations. UAMS will continue to require visitors to pass a daily health screening and wear a photo ID badge and a face mask. Hospital visitors will also be required to stay in the patient’s room at all times.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: An unvaccinated snow leopard at the San Diego Zoo has contracted COVID-19. Caretakers noticed that Ramil, a 9-year-old male snow leopard, had a cough and runny nose on Thursday. Later, two separate tests of his stool confirmed the presence of the coronavirus, the zoo said in a statement Friday. Ramil is not showing additional symptoms, the zoo said, but because he shares an enclosure with a female snow leopard and two Amur leopards, the staff assumes they have been exposed. As a result, the animals were quarantined and their exhibit was closed. It’s unknown how Ramil got infected. In January, a troop of eight gorillas at the zoo’s sister facility, San Diego Zoo Safari Park, contracted COVID-19 from a keeper who had the virus but showed no symptoms. The gorilla troop, which has since recovered, became the first known example of the virus infecting apes. The case prompted the zoo to request an experimental COVID-19 vaccine for animals for emergency use. The vaccine from Zoetis, animal health company that was once part of Pfizer, was administered to species most at risk of contracting COVID-19, including several primates and big cats.\n\nColorado\n\nWindsor:The city closed Windsor Lake on Friday afternoon and shifted planned activities this week because of the detection of blue-green algae in the water. The lake, swim beach and dog park are closed to the public until further notice while the city works with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment to monitor bacteria levels. Permitted boats are allowed on the lake “to assist in agitating the water,” but tubing, water skiing and other water activities are not allowed. The algae was detected in a precautionary water test July 19. On July 20, the town put out an algae advisory and put signs around the lake, but staff had not yet identified any toxins. Blue-green algae are known to spread rapidly and can be a result of hot weather, stagnant water and stormwater runoff. CDPHE said that the algae, while common in Colorado, can sometimes produce toxins that can harm people and be fatal to dogs and other animals.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNewtown: After nearly eight years of discussion and planning, a memorial to the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting is nearing construction with the goal of offering a peaceful place for reflection. A groundbreaking ceremony is planned next month at the site down the street where the shooting occurred that killed 20 first graders and six educators in Newtown on Dec. 14, 2012. Construction will be finished before the 10th anniversary next year, officials said. The State Bond Commission approved $2.5 million for the project on Friday, which the town will use to defray much of the $3.7 million local voters approved in April for the total cost of the memorial. The key area of the memorial will be a water feature with a sycamore tree in the middle and the victims’ names engraved on the top of the surrounding supporting wall. The water flow has been designed so floatable candles, flowers and other objects will move toward the tree and circle around it. Pathways will take visitors through a variety of plantings, including flower gardens.\n\nDelaware\n\nDagsboro: A historic chapel that predates the Revolutionary War has reopened to the public following a 16-month closure because of the pandemic. Prince George’s Chapel in Dagsboro welcomed the public for monthly tours Sunday, the Delaware State News reported. “It wasn’t worth even trying to open it up with all the restrictions and everything. So we’ve had it shut down,” Brian Baull, president of the nonprofit organization that serves as caretaker for the chapel, told the newspaper. Tours, which will take place the fourth Sunday of each month, are free. Construction on the chapel began in 1755 and was completed two years later. It was deeded to the state of Delaware in 1967, restored and reopened as a museum. In 1971, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Its most prominent feature is a vaulted ceiling made of heart-of-pine planks, the newspaper reported.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Mayor Muriel Bowser has activated the District's Heat Emergency Plan for the first half of this week, WUSA-TV reported. The plan goes into effect when the forecast of the temperature or heat index in the District is 95 degrees or higher. That causes the city to open cooling centers for residents seeking relief from the heat. A list of District cooling centers can be found here. In addition, the city recommends that residents stay indoors, find places in the shade or with air conditioning to seek relief from the heat; check on neighbors – children, the elderly and those with access and functional needs are the most vulnerable in the community; dink plenty of water and wear lightweight, loose-fitting clothing; do not leave children or pets in vehicles; pet owners should keep pets indoors, walk pets early in the morning and give pets plenty of water.\n\nFlorida\n\nMarathon: A juvenile green sea turtle rehabilitated at the Keys-based Turtle Hospital has been fitted with a satellite-tracking transmitter and released from a Keys beach to join the 14th Tour de Turtles, a marathon-like race that follows long-distance migration of sea turtles over three months. The educational outreach program organized by the Sea Turtle Conservancy raises awareness about sea turtles and threats to their survival. “The Tour de Turtles is an online educational program where, starting August 1, we’re tracking 19 turtles from Florida, Panama, Costa Rica and Nevis,” said Dan Evans, a senior research biologist with the Sea Turtle Conservancy. “It’s the idea that we’re tracking which turtle swims the furthest distance over three months.” Dubbed “Lucky Pulse” by her rescuers for a pulse-like marking on her head, the Keys turtle was released Friday to raise awareness about her own affliction. She was found off the Keys on March 17, entangled in fishing trap line and covered with fibropapilloma, debilitating tumors that develop from a herpes-like virus that affects sea turtles around the world. After the tumors’ removal, Lucky Pulse’s recovery included blood transfusions, breathing treatments, a broad spectrum of antibiotics, fluids, vitamins and a diet of seafood and greens.\n\nGeorgia\n\nColumbus: Residents at a mobile home park said they have had almost no water service for the past three weeks. So little water comes out of the pipes that it is almost impossible to flush toilets, wash dishes or take a bath at the Sea Breeze Mobile Home Park in Columbus, WRBL-TV reported. The water also isn’t safe to drink. “I had to spend three days in the hotel, me and my 8-year-old and my wife. That was money coming out of our pocket,” resident Jeffery Williams said. Water has been restored to some areas of the mobile home park and a citation has been issued to owner Fountain Bleau Capital LLC, said Columbus Inspection and Code Enforcement Director Ryan Pruett. The Massachusetts owner of the park said the maintenance staff was infected with COVID-19 and that delayed fixing the water problems.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: A lawsuit challenging using police forces from other islands to respond to protests over a giant telescope planned for Hawaii’s tallest mountain is headed to the state Supreme Court. Police officers from Oahu and Maui flew to the Big Island in 2019 to help control protesters who blocked the mountain’s access road. Opponents of the Thirty Meter Telescope said it will desecrate land held sacred by Native Hawaiians. Big Island resident E. Kalani Flores’ lawsuit against police chiefs of the Hawaii County, Maui County and Honolulu forces argued his rights to observe Native Hawaiian cultural practices on Mauna Kea were violated by the police presence. The state Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in the case next month, Hawaii Tribune-Herald reported. The lawsuit said police violated a state statute that a police chief can operate on a neighboring island if doing so is required in the pursuit of an investigation that started in that chief’s jurisdiction. The lawsuit was initially dismissed because of a technicality and later went before the state Intermediate Court of Appeals, which ruled in favor of the police chiefs.\n\nIdaho\n\nKetchum: A multiyear project to improve forest health in and around one of the nation’s top ski destinations has begun in central Idaho. The 10-year Bald Mountain Stewardship Project is intended in part to reduce the chances of a wildfire at Sun Valley Resort’s Bald Mountain ski area that operates on U.S. Forest Service land. The Idaho Mountain Express reported that work has started on the Forest Service’s plan to reduce fuel, restore forest health and enhance recreation opportunities. The ski area is a huge economic driver. But pine beetles, dwarf mistletoe and white pine blister rust are killing trees on the ski-run-carved mountain that forms a scenic and much-photographed backdrop for the resort towns of Ketchum and Sun Valley. Experts said the aging forest long protected from wildfires is at risk, leading to the project that also will clear debris within the ski area. The 9-square-mile project includes Sun Valley Resort’s nearly 5-square-mile ski area, of which about 4 square miles is skiable terrain. Officials said wildfires in 2007 and 2013 surrounded 9,150-foot Bald Mountain with burned forest, creating an island of green trees and increasing bark beetle attacks.\n\nIllinois\n\nRockton:Officials have found elevated levels of harmful metals in groundwater monitoring wells at a Rockton Superfund toxic waste site. But the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency noted that the substances were not found in the municipal water system for the Village of Rockton. Its water was tested June 21. Testing of private wells near the site will begin soon. The metals discovered include antimony, cadmium, chromium and nickel. Some metals are essential nutrients, but others can cause health problems. The results came from wells that check groundwater on the site of the former Beloit Corp. toxic waste investigations at the former manufacturer of paper-making products have been underway since 1992. Elevated metal levels were found in 16 of 20 monitoring wells. All are contained on the Superfund site. The samples were collected following the June 14 explosion and devastating fire at Chemtool Inc., located on the Superfund site. Metals were not previously a concern on the Beloit Corp. property. State officials are investigating their source. Officials said that until testing is completed, those with private wells living in the Blackhawk neighborhood adjacent to Chemtool should use bottled water for drinking and cooking.\n\nIndiana\n\nBurns Harbor: Indiana’s Lake Michigan port has seen a big increase in shipments this year as the global economy rebounds from the coronavirus pandemic. In June, the port handled a 52% spike in cargo. So far this year, the Port of Indiana-Burns Harbor has had more than a 36% increase in maritime tonnage compared with the same period last year, said Vanta E. Coda II, chief executive of the Indianapolis-based Ports of Indiana port authority. “Steel is up more than 100% and limestone has climbed nearly 90%, too. We look forward to additional growth in the second half of the year,” Coda said. Through the end of June, international cargos shipped through the St. Lawrence Seaway to Great Lakes ports are up by 8.37% to 12.9 million tons, The (Northwest Indiana) Times reported. Great Lakes shipping officials attributed the boost to increased domestic construction, manufacturing activity and global export demand. Shipments of cement are up 36%, gypsum 79% and general cargo 61%. Iron ore volumes are up 14%, partly because of exports to Asia and Europe. Coke, another steelmaking input, is up 125%, partly because of exports to France, the Netherlands and other European countries.\n\nIowa\n\nCedar Rapids: Forty Iowans, including some from the Cedar Rapids area, had to undergo treatment for rabies after they were potentially in contact with a rabid bat at the zoo in Omaha, Nebraska. More than 180 individuals were advised to receive the rabies post-exposure prophylaxis, which contains the rabies vaccine, after a wild bat was found near a person attending one of the Henry Doorly Zoo’s multiple overnight campouts at the aquarium earlier this month. A total of 186 overnight campers, including youth and adult groups, were contacted by the Nebraska public health department, the Omaha World-Herald reported. Among those were dozens of Iowans, mostly adolescents and their parents, according to the Iowa Department of Public Health. Linn County Public Health said anyone locally who has been impacted has been contacted and the appropriate follow-up has been conducted. Public health officials in Nebraska recommended all campers who stayed at the zoo overnight June 29, June 30, July 2 and July 3 receive prophylaxis. The recommendation came after a camper staying in the aquarium the night of July 3 woke up to a wild bat near her head. A team found seven bats in the building, one of which tested positive for rabies, a news release from the zoo stated.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka:Union members at the Frito-Lay plant in Topeka have approved a new contract and will return to work Monday, ending a nearly three-week strike at the plant, union officials said. Members of Local 218 of the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers union approved the contract Friday. It gives all union members a 4% pay raise over two years and guarantees workers at least one day off each week, The Topeka Capital-Journal reported. More than 500 of the 850 employees represented by the union went on strike on July 5, complaining of a toxic work environment, forced overtime and a lack of pay raises. Workers said the shifts were caused by a severe staffing shortage at the plant. Carolyn Fisher, spokeswoman for PepsiCo., Frito-Lay’s parent company, said the contract allows the company to rebid its entire facility, or parts of it, once during the two-year contract. Labor-management committees will be formed to make recommendations on staffing and overtime and shape the rebid process.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Two members of Kentucky State University’s governing board resigned days before the abrupt departure of the campus president, adding to the upheaval in the highest ranks of the school as it faces an independent investigation into its finances. Soon after M. Christopher Brown II’s resignation as school president last week, Gov. Andy Beshear called for an independent accounting of KSU’s finances and signed an order empowering the Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education to provide guidance and oversight during the review. The development came as Kentucky’s sole public historically Black university contended with concerns about its financial health and lawsuits alleging misconduct by campus officials. In the days before Brown’s departure, Candace McGraw submitted her resignation from the school’s Board of Regents. In her resignation letter, McGraw said she was “not fully aware of the time needed to engage fully in order to ensure the ongoing success of the university.” McGraw, a recent board appointee, is CEO of Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. Paul Harnice also resigned from the school’s board before Brown left, The State Journal reported. Harnice’s resignation letter did not provide an apparent reason for his resignation, The State Journal reported.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: With more than 1,000 people hospitalized with COVID-19 across Louisiana, Gov. John Bel Edwards encouraged everyone, whether vaccinated or not, to wear masks indoors if they can’t stay distanced from others. But the Democratic governor stopped short of issuing a statewide face covering mandate or new restrictions on activities and businesses amid the state’s fourth spike of COVID-19, driven by the highly contagious delta variant. Louisiana – which has among the nation’s lowest COVID-19 vaccination rates – is seeing thousands of new confirmed cases of the coronavirus illness each day, and its hospitalizations have surged in recent weeks. Edwards said Louisiana has the highest rate of new COVID-19 cases per capita in the nation and has been labeled a “state of concern” by the White House. Edwards placed the blame squarely on people refusing to get immunized against the coronavirus in a state where only about 48% of those eligible for the vaccines have gotten at least one shot.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Maine is home to the last wild Atlantic salmon populations in the U.S., but a new push to protect the fish at the state level is unlikely to land them on the endangered list. Atlantic salmon once teemed in U.S. rivers, but now return from the sea to only a handful of rivers in eastern and central Maine. The fish are protected at the federal level under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, but a coalition of environmental groups and scientists said the fish could be afforded more protections if they were added to Maine’s own list of endangered and threatened species. State law allows Maine Department of Marine Resources Commissioner Patrick Keliher to make that recommendation, but his office told the Associated Press he does not intend to do it. The department has done extensive work to conserve and restore the fish, and Keliher “does not believe a listing at the state level would afford additional conservation benefits or protections,” said Jeff Nichols, a department spokesperson. The environmentalists who want to see the fish on the state list said they’re going to keep pushing for it and other protections. Adding the fish to the state endangered list would mean conservation of salmon would be treated as a bigger concern in state permitting processes, said John Burrows, executive director for U.S. operations for the Atlantic Salmon Federation.\n\nMaryland\n\nOakland: A state police helicopter hoisted an injured swimmer to safety in western Maryland. The helicopter was dispatched shortly after 5 p.m. Friday to rescue a swimmer who sustained a head injury after slipping on a rock at Swallow Falls along the Youghiogheny River in Garrett County, state police said in a news release Saturday. The helicopter was requested partly because of the steep terrain and nature of the victim’s injuries, police said. The helicopter hovered 275 feet above the river as a trooper with medical equipment was lowered to the scene to prepare the patient for an aerial extraction, the news release said. Once the patient was secured inside the AW-139 helicopter, the crew provided medical care during the trip to a hospital in Morgantown, West Virginia. The patient wasn’t identified, and the person’s condition wasn’t immediately known.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A rare first-place medal from the first modern Olympic Games has sold for more than $180,000. Boston-based RR Auction said Friday that the winning bidder for the silver medal from the 1896 games in Athens, Greece, was a collector based on the East Coast. The company estimated before the auction that the first place medal could fetch about $75,000. At the inaugural Olympiad, first-place winners were awarded silver medals and second-place finishers earned bronze, the auction house said. There was no award for placing third. Unlike today’s games where thousands of athletes compete, just 250 were featured at the first modern games, the company said. Other notable items sold include a gold medal bestowed on the Argentine men’s soccer team during the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics that went for more than $97,000. A gold medal for the U.S. men’s basketball team during the 1984 Los Angeles Summer Olympics also sold for more than $83,000 and a gold medal awarded to Swedish wrestler Ivar Johansson during the 1932 Los Angeles Summer Olympics sold for more than $45,000.\n\nMichigan\n\nCorunna: Elected officials in Shiawassee County who gave themselves bonuses of $65,000 with federal COVID-19 relief aid said they will return the money following days of criticism. County commissioners acted after the county prosecutor said the payments were illegal, The Argus-Press reported. The Michigan Constitution bars additional compensation for elected officials “after services had already been rendered,” prosecutor Scott Koerner said Friday. The commissioners, all Republicans, voted on July 15 to award themselves $65,000 as part of a plan to give $557,000 to 250 county employees as “hazard pay” for dealing with the coronavirus pandemic. The smallest amounts for recipients were $1,000 to $2,000. But County Board Chairman Jeremy Root got $25,000. Two more commissioners received $10,000 each, and four others received $5,000 each. The commissioners awarded money to other elected officials, including the prosecutor, the sheriff and the county clerk, all Republicans. They, too, said they would give it back. Two Michigan congressmen, a Democrat and a Republican, said federal virus aid wasn’t intended to reward elected officials.\n\nMinnesota\n\nBlaine: A crane fell over at a construction site in the Minneapolis suburb of Lexington on Friday, causing a power outage for nearly 900 customers in the area as temperatures climbed into the mid-90s. There were no injuries reported. A dispatch supervisor with the Centennial Lakes Police Department said the call came in shortly before 12:30 p.m. The crane fell into power lines and onto the partially constructed building. Dispatch supervisor Donnelle Lawrence said the building was evacuated. The collapse also caused a small grass fire, which was quickly extinguished, Lawrence said. Xcel Energy reported reported nearly 900 customers in the areas of Blaine, Circle Pines and Lexington were without power after the collapse according to its online outage map. Temperatures were in the mid-90s on Friday afternoon and the area was under a heat advisory, as forecasters said the combination of heat and humidity made the temperature feel like it was 100 degrees.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Even as COVID-19 cases have increased rapidly in Mississippi in recent days, some school districts are saying masks will be optional for students, teachers and staff. Among the districts taking that approach is the state’s largest one, DeSoto County School District. “Right now, there are no state mandates or local mandates requiring masks,” Superintendent Cory Uselton told WMC-TV. “Last year, we were under a mask mandate because of the governor’s executive order. There’s no executive order in place right now, so that will be a parental decision.” As part of its guidance for K-12 school settings, the State Department of Health recommends masks for anyone not fully vaccinated. It also recommends people 12 and older get vaccinated. Instead of encouraging either of those things, the DeSoto District will give families information from the health department, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and American Academy of Pediatrics, Uselton said.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: St. Louis city and county officials said they will require masks in some public places starting Monday, citing a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases spurred by the delta variant. Masks will be mandatory in indoor public places and on public transportation for everyone age 5 or older, even for those who are vaccinated, officials said in a news release Friday. Masking outdoors “will be strongly encouraged,” especially in group settings. The decision comes as both of Missouri’s urban areas are seeing a big uptick in cases in hospitalizations that began in rural areas of the state, especially in southwestern Missouri. The Kansas City Star reported Friday that medical leaders in that region appear to be on the verge of calling for a new mask mandate there, as well.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Five firefighters were injured when a thunderstorm and swirling winds in central Montana blew a lightning-caused wildfire back on them, federal officials said. All five remained in medical facilities and were still being evaluated and treated Saturday, a day after they were injured, Bureau of Land Management spokesperson Mark Jacobsen said. He declined to release the extent of the firefighters’ injuries or specify where they were being treated. They had joined other crews working on the 1,300-acre fire burning in rough, steep terrain about 36 miles northwest of the town of Jordan. They were building a defensive fire line Thursday when the weather shifted, Jacobsen said. “Numerous wind shifts and rapid rates of spread resulted in erratic fire behavior as thunderstorms and associated cells were passing over the area when the incident occurred,” he said. Other firefighters in the area were able to call for help and the injured firefighters – three U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service crew members from North Dakota and two USDA Forest Service firefighters from New Mexico – were evacuated, Jacobsen said. Meanwhile, Gov. Greg Gianforte announced Friday that crews from Utah and California were coming to Montana on Saturday to help fight fires. Utah will send two task forces with a total of seven engines and 25 personnel, and California is sending a strike team with five engines and 20 personnel, Gianforte said. The teams will be in Montana for two weeks, and Montana will pay their costs, the governor said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Nearly 50 Nebraska school boards have objected to proposed state health education standards that include lessons for young children on gender identity and gender expression. State Sen. Joni Albrecht said 47 school boards across the state have either adopted resolutions or sent letters opposing the first draft of the standards that the Nebraska Department of Education is considering. Albrecht was part of a group of 30 state senators who signed a statement urging school districts to object to the standards. The standards would be optional if they’re approved, according to the Omaha World-Herald. Under the proposed standards, kindergartners would learn about different kinds of family structures, including same-gender families. First-graders would be taught about gender identity and gender stereotypes. Sixth-graders would learn about a range of identities related to sexual orientation, including heterosexual, bisexual, lesbian, gay, queer, two-spirit, asexual and pansexual. They would be taught the differences between cisgender, transgender, gender nonbinary, gender expansive and gender identity. The proposal has faced strong opposition from Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts, who has no direct influence over the state board, and large crowds have attended state education board meetings. State Education Commissioner Matt Blomstedt told school districts in a letter earlier this month that there would be changes in the second draft of the standards. He said that next draft will remove many of the explicit examples and make clear that discussions of sensitive health-related topics should be “thoughtfully conducted with parental input at a local level.”\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Coronavirus numbers remained high in Nevada as the state reported more than 1,000 newly confirmed COVID-19 cases, at least 20 deaths and hospitalizations climbing past the 1,000 plateau for the first time in more than five months, state health officials said. The 1,003 new cases reported by the state Department of Health and Human Services nearly matched the 1,004 new cases reported on Tuesday. It was the highest since 1,070 cases were recorded Jan. 30, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. The updated figures pushed totals to 349,043 COVID-19 cases and 5,817 deaths statewide since the pandemic began in March 2020.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: New Hampshire residents can’t be required to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in order to access public facilities, benefits or services under a bill signed into law by Gov. Chris Sununu. Supporters said the bill signed this week establishes “medical freedom” by specifying that all residents have the “natural, essential and inherent right to bodily integrity, free from any threat or compulsion by government to accept an immunization.” It does not, however, supersede the state law regarding vaccinations as a prerequisite for admission to school. That law lists seven required vaccinations but does not include the COVID-19 vaccine. The new law also does not apply to county nursing homes, the state psychiatric hospital or other medical facilities operated by the state or other governmental bodies. And it allows mandatory immunizations in prisons and jails when there is a significant health threat.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nSecaucus: New Jersey on Friday took the first step to rid the lower Hackensack River of heavily contaminated sediment dating from the state’s industrial past. State Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Shawn LaTourette announced the commitment of Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration to seek placement of the 23-mile stretch of river on the federal government’s list of Superfund toxic sites. Approval would mean access to federal funding and would enable the Environmental Protection Agency to seek the parties responsible for polluting the waters to help fund the remediation, once identified. “Designating the lower Hackensack River as a federal Superfund site will provide the tools we need to remove decades of contamination that have polluted river sediments and restore the natural resources that have been impaired for far too long,” LaTourette said. A previous EPA study found elevated levels of cancer-causing dioxin, cadmium, lead, mercury and PCBs in sediment sampled from the river’s mouth at Newark Bay to the Oradell Reservoir. Achieving Superfund status could take years to complete. “I realize that this is one step in the process and that cleanup will take time,” said Hackensack Riverkeeper Bill Sheehan. He said he has been working to get the designation since 2015.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: New Mexico schools plan to spend the bulk of the federal coronavirus relief money they have received on technology and building upgrades rather than student learning loss. A report this week before the New Mexico Legislature’s budget committee showed school districts and charters plan to spend 38% of the $490 million they received thus far on technology and HVAC systems. T he Santa Fe New Mexican reported that schools plan to spend 9% of the funds on learning loss programs and 8% on interventions for at-risk students. The budget committee’s program evaluation manager Micaela Fischer told lawmakers those numbers were surprising because students likely missed out on learning because of the shift to remote classrooms during the pandemic. Los Alamos Public Schools is an exception to the trend and plans to spend all of the money it received from a December coronavirus relief package to address learning loss with summer and after-school programs.\n\nNew York\n\nYonkers: Police and bystanders lifted a car to free a trapped baby after a suspected drunken driver struck the girl and her mother and then plowed through a storefront with the pair on the hood. The crash and rescue were recorded on video released by Yonkers Police. It showed a Hyundai Elantra striking a curb and parked car Friday before driving into a woman as she crossed the street with a child in her arms. With the woman and child on the hood of the car, it accelerates through the storefront of a barber shop. Police body camera footage from inside the building showed Yonkers Officers Rocco Fusco and Paul Samoyedny, who had been having breakfast nearby, frantically working with bystanders to lift the heavily damaged car and pull the crying 8-month-old girl from beneath it. “Luckily, two veteran officers of Yonkers’ finest just happened to be getting breakfast next door and quickly took action along with members of the community to rescue a child trapped under the vehicle and render aid to her mother,” Police Commissioner John Mueller said in a news release. “The actions taken are nothing short of heroic.” The baby sustained a skull fracture and burns to her back and foot. Her 36-year-old mother broke a leg, the news release said. The 43-year-old male driver and a female passenger were not injured. The driver, from Yonkers, was charged with driving while intoxicated, vehicular assault and aggravated unlicensed operation.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nOcracoke: Transportation officials said successful drone flights this week to Ocracoke have them hopeful that it might soon get easier to deliver vital supplies to the remote Outer Banks island amid bad weather. The Department of Transportation’s Division of Aviation and U.S.-based drone logistics company Volansi completed two successful trial flights of a delivery drone from a ferry dock in Hatteras to Ocracoke Island, the department said in a news release. “This is a tremendous first step in better connecting Ocracoke Island to potentially life-saving supplies and equipment,” Secretary of Transportation Eric Boyette said in a statement. “Today, Ocracoke Island is accessible only by plane or by boat. What we’re working on here is an entirely new, third method of serving the needs of Ocracoke’s people.” The tests involved an 8-mile round-trip flight averaging 18 minutes in flight time. The first delivered a small survival kit, space blankets and a chocolate muffin to Ocracoke, and the second delivered bottles of water, according to the news release. The next test, at a time to be determined, will involve a longer flight, the department said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The federal government has denied a request by North Dakota leaders to allow ranchers struggling with drought to hay idled grassland while it’s still of good quality. The Bismarck Tribune reported the state Agriculture Department is looking into the reasons why the request was denied. The federal government is allowing limited emergency grazing of Conservation Reserve Program land, which typically is idled under a government program that pays farmers to protect erodible land and create wildlife habitat. North Dakota ranchers all summer have been seeking federal government permission to also hay that land. The CRP typically doesn’t open until after nesting season ends, to protect wildlife populations. The season in North Dakota ends Aug. 1. Ranchers said that after that day, grass might not be of good enough quality to make it worthwhile to hay. State officials and members of North Dakota’s congressional delegation this summer have pushed the U.S. Department of Agriculture for earlier CRP haying. State Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring earlier this week made another plea. His department has received hundreds of calls from ranchers in recent weeks about the issue.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati:The Cincinnati Black Music Walk of Fame is officially scheduled to open next summer. Plans for the interactive park and star-studded path were unveiled Saturday during an induction ceremony. The crowd was lively while the P. Ann Everson-Price & The All-Star Band played tributes to the walk's first inductees as well as other famous Black musicians and funk artists. The first four inductees to receive stars on the Walk of Fame will be Rock & Roll Hall of Famer Bootsy Collins, King Records icon Otis Williams, and Grammy Winners The Isley Brothers and the late Gospel great Dr. Charles Fold. The Cincinnati Black Music Walk of Fame is intended to stand toe-to-toe with The National Museum of African American Music in Nashville, Tennessee; Atlanta’s Black Music & Entertainment Walk of Fame; and Beale Street in Memphis, Tennessee. Like the Hollywood Walk of Fame, each inductee will have their name placed on a star on the walkway. The funding for the park and walkway will come from the $159 million stimulus fund that was awarded to the county. The Hamilton County Commission unanimously voted in favor of the park while deciding on how to spend the county's stimulus money. The park was awarded $9 million. Procter and Gamble has also partnered with the project and will pay for the new inductee stars for the next several years.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City:The owner of a dilapidated Oklahoma Panhandle wind farm has presented plans to clean up the most dangerous of the wind turbine towers. The plans are to address dangerously broken-down towers and turbines of the 60-tower KODE Novus I and II wind farm near Guymon, The Oklahoman reported. Owner Olympia Renewable Platform LLC has hired a contractor to remove broken blades from seven towers and topple a couple of others topped with burned-out generator nacelles. The company assured the repair work could begin next month and take 20 to 30 days to complete, depending on wind conditions. Dozens of wind turbines in the complex have been locked down and aren’t part of the cleanup plan. Oklahoma Corporation Commission officials have determined that the dilapidated wind towers are dangerous to the public, which had easy access to the scene until Olympia erected temporary fencing around it. The complex was developed and owned by a subsidiary of a South Korean company until it went bankrupt.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Low oxygen levels measured off the coast of Oregon and Washington are raising concerns of large “dead zones” that could decimate crabs and bottom-dwelling fish within them. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said this week that researchers have detected unseasonably low oxygen levels in a large area off the Pacific coast, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported. Year after year of low oxygen levels beginning in the early 2000s led researchers to determine Oregon now has a “hypoxia season” – just as it has a fire season – and this year’s hypoxia season has arrived far earlier than usual. The start of the hypoxia season is marked by the upwelling of cold bottom water. Winds initiated that upwelling this year around March. Chan said that’s the earliest Oregon ocean-watchers have seen in 35 years. That could have major implications for coastal economies, particularly related to the Dungeness crab. Dead zones happen as winds pick up, driving cold water from the bottom of the ocean toward the surface, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That contributes to blooms of phytoplankton, which once they die, sink to the ocean floor. Bacteria consume oxygen while decomposing the plankton.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: President Joe Biden will head to the Allentown area Wednesday as he fights for passage in the Senate of a nearly $1 trillion infrastructure measure that a bipartisan group of senators brokered with him. The White House is billing Biden’s visit to Macungie as a stop to “emphasize the importance of American manufacturing, buying products made in America, and supporting good-paying jobs for American workers.” It gave no other details of the visit – Biden’s second to Pennsylvania so far this month after he went to Philadelphia last week to speak on voting rights. In the Senate, Republicans rejected an effort this week to begin debate on the infrastructure deal. Supporters said they need more time before another vote, possibly next week. Macungie is near the home of Republican U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey, who voted against opening debate. In a statement after the vote, Toomey echoed other Republicans in pointing out that crucial details about the deal are not completed. Should an agreement be reached on those, Toomey said he will consider the measure “based on its substance.” Pennsylvania’s other U.S. senator, Democrat Bob Casey, voted with other Democrats to start debate.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Environmental officials in Rhode Island have extended their ban on shellfish harvesting in certain areas of the state. The state Department of Environmental Management said a ban that was set to expire Sunday will be extended until further notice. The announcement covers what it refers to as the “Lower Providence River Conditional Area E” and “Upper Bay Conditional Area A.” The closures were enacted after recent heavy rainfall and are being extended because test samples showed continued high bacteria levels in the water. At least one other shellfish area in Greenwich Bay reopened to harvesting Sunday, and two others in Mt. Hope Bay and the Kickemuit River are open, the agency said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nNichols: A utility is building walls around an electric substation to prevent it from being overrun by floodwaters in the first-of-its-kind project in South Carolina. Duke Energy is spending $1.6 million on the Nichols project to protect a substation that has flooded twice in the past five years, utility spokesperson Ryan Mosier told the Morning News of Florence. The substation was flooded in 2016 in Hurricane Matthew and 2018 in Hurricane Florence. In 2018, the substation, which takes high voltage power from plants and converts it to lower voltage electricity for homes, was out for five weeks, Mosier said. The substation is surrounded by reinforced fiberglass walls. Crews put up aluminum gates when flooding is threatened, which keep water out but allow crews access inside. The walls are 6-to-8 feet tall with access gates. The gates are installed when the company forecasts potential flooding. Crews can also quickly access the substation for maintenance. Duke Energy has already installed the walls at facilities in Lumberton and Wallace in North Carolina and plans four more projects, Mosier said, Other nearby substations to Nichols are on higher ground and didn’t need the walls, said Davy Gregg, a Duke Energy supervisor for the Marion County area.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:A replica of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier came to Sioux Falls over the weekend as part of a honorary tour to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the monument. The half-scale replica was at the South Dakota Military Heritage Alliance and crowds came to view it and learn more about its history. The original Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is in Arlington Cemetery in Virginia, across the Delaware River from the nation’s capital.. The replica is part of a traveling exhibition called A Call to Honor: Tomb of The Unknown Soldier. The Americanism Committee of the Exchange Club in Rome, Georgia, is responsible for the exhibition and brings the replica to all parts of the United States.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville:The bust of Confederate general and early Ku Klux Klan leader Nathan Bedford Forrest that had been prominently displayed inside the state Capitol for decades – over objections from Black lawmakers and activists – was removed from its pedestal Friday. The image of Forrest has sparked protests since its installation in 1978 as defenders sought to tout his legacy while critics objected to honoring a historical figure who supported the South’s secession. Over the years, some suggested adding historical context next to the bust. Yet many others, including Republican Gov. Bill Lee, successfully argued for moving it to the Tennessee State Museum, just north of the Capitol. Forrest was a Confederate cavalry general who amassed a fortune before the Civil War as a Memphis slave trader and plantation owner. Later, he was a leader of the Klan as it terrorized Black people. The busts of Union Navy Adm. David Farragut and U.S. Navy Adm. Albert Gleaves also were moved to the museum on Friday, part of an agreement used to win over the votes needed on key panels that military leaders shouldn’t be displayed in the Capitol.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: The Dallas area was the country’s top market for commercial property investments in the first half of 2021. Dallas retained the top real estate spot it gained last year during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a new report by Real Capital Analytics. Through the first six months of this year, Dallas saw almost $13.4 billion in commercial property deals – 43% more than in the same period a year ago. Last year, more than $19.7 billion in commercial real estate deals were recorded in the local market. Sales of dozens of local apartment communities and warehouses, plus the $700 million purchase of Uptown Dallas’ Crescent complex, all contributed to the huge volume of property investments in the area this year. The Crescent was ranked as the second-largest commercial property deal in the country in the first six months of 2021.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City:People in Utah gathered to celebrate the state’s history and recognize early Mormon pioneers who trekked west in search of religious freedom. Pioneer Day is a beloved only-in-Utah holiday every July 24 that features parades, rodeos, fireworks and more. The festivities were canceled last year because of the pandemic. Hundreds of people on Friday camped and staked out spots along the parade route in downtown Salt Lake City. Pioneer Day marks the date in 1847 when Brigham Young and other Mormon pioneers, many pulling handcarts, ended their treacherous journey across the country from Illinois to the Salt Lake Valley. Many businesses and government offices close for the state holiday.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Signs will be posted near eight Vermont ponds where the use of baitfish is prohibited to protect native brook trout, the Fish and Wildlife Department said. 1/ 2 “Wild native brook trout thrive in ponds where there are simple fish communities with no or few other fish species,” department fisheries biologist Jud Kratzer said in a statement earlier this week. “Adding new fish species, even minnows, disrupts a long-established food chain. Trout populations suffer as a result.” Brook trout are native to the eastern United States but no longer exist in much of their original range, the department said. Signs will be posted at public access points near Beaver Pond in Holland; Blake Pond in Sutton; Cow Mountain Pond in Granby; Jobs Pond in Westmore; Lewis Pond in Lewis; North Pond in Chittenden; Unknown Pond in Avery’s Gore; and Noyes Pond in Groton.\n\nVirginia\n\nCulpeper: Virginia’s government watchdog said the commonwealth’s land conservation easement program that offers participants tax breaks needs improvement. Auditors with the Office of the State Inspector General found items such as trash, old tires, inoperable vehicles and a manure storage area containing dead cattle parts on properties with easements it inspected, the Culpeper Star-Exponent reported. “Virginia provides tax credits up to $75 million per year for conservation easements and land donations,” Inspector General Michael Westfall said in a statement. “In effect, Virginia is paying for natural resource preservation through these tax credits.” There’s a $1 million tax credit value threshold for a Department of Conservation and Recreation quality review of an easement. Among the watchdog’s recommendations was lowering that threshold. But Dan Holmes, director of state policy for the Piedmont Environmental Council, told the newspaper the tax credit was a valuable tool and questioned the audit’s conclusions and methodology.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Mayor Jenny Durkan and other city officials plan to add a response unit for 911 calls that don’t require typical, armed police officers. Officials said they are still working out details, and it won’t launch until at least next year, The Seattle Times reported. Durkan said the idea is to provide 911 dispatchers with a new option for certain calls, such as wellness checks, that are associated with neither criminal nor medical emergencies. The mayor said it could be similar to the city’s Health One program, which sends firefighters and social workers to nonemergency medical calls. It will likely be staffed by civilian city employees, possibly partnered with certain officers, she said. The responders will know deescalation techniques and how to guide people to social services, she said, adding that it might be called “Triage One.” Durkan said she intends to include funding for the new option in her 2022 budget proposal, which is due in September. She hasn’t said what it might cost but said it would start as a pilot program, with limited capacity.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state treasurer’s office raised nearly $140,000 for law enforcement agencies through its unclaimed property firearms auction. This year’s event had record inventory – more than 500 firearms lots – because the pandemic prevented the treasurer’s office from holding an auction last year, Treasurer Riley Moore’s office said in a news release. The treasurer’s office raised $139,790 during the auction. Under state law, state and local law enforcement agencies can turn over unclaimed, seized or outdated firearms in their possession to the treasurer’s office for auction, and the proceeds can be returned to the law enforcement agency. This year’s auction attracted more than 60 federally licensed firearms dealers. Bidders must be a valid, licensed federal firearms dealer. The event isn’t open to the general public.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The University of Wisconsin System plans to offer nearly $500,000 in scholarships this fall to students who have been vaccinated against the coronavirus. System President Tommy Thompson said all vaccinated students at regional four- and two-year campuses that get at least 70% of their students vaccinated by Oct. 15 will be eligible for a drawing for a $7,000 scholarship. Seventy students will win, with more winners coming from campuses with larger enrollments. UW-Madison students won’t be eligible, Thompson said, because Chancellor Rebecca Blank is working on her own vaccination incentive programs. Asked for details on Blank’s plans, UW-Madison spokesman John Lucas said the flagship university is “on a path” to reach 80% vaccination among students and is “considering incentives” but had nothing to announce. Thompson has called for campuses to offer at least three-quarters of their courses in-person this fall. He said he set the vaccination threshold at 70% for the scholarship drawing because that’s generally considered the minimum for herd immunity.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Officials expect moderate to extreme drought to persist and spread throughout Wyoming. The multiyear drought is the state’s worst since 2013. Last year was Wyoming’s fifth-driest and 16th-warmest since 1895, the Casper Star-Tribune reported. Even parts of the state with average or above-average precipitation got it earlier in the year than usual, leaving those areas just as susceptible to drought now, Wyoming Game and Fish Department terrestrial habitat supervisor Ian Tator told the state Game and Fish Commission last week. “On a statewide basis, there’s nowhere that’s doing fantastic,” Tator said. Fishing spots also face strain as water levels fall and temperatures rise, state fisheries management coordinator Dave Zafft told the commission.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/29/europe/volodymyr-zelensky-fast-facts/index.html", "title": "Volodymyr Zelensky Fast Facts | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nHere’s some background information about the life of Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine.\n\nPersonal:\n\nBirth date: January 25, 1978\n\nBirth place: Kryvyi Rih, Ukraine\n\nBirth name: Volodymyr Oleksandrovych Zelensky\n\nFather: Oleksandr Zelensky, computer science professor\n\nMother: Rimma Zelenska, engineer\n\nMarriage: Olena (Kiyashko) Zelenska (2003-present)\n\nChildren: Oleksandra and Kyrylo\n\nEducation: Kyiv National Economic University, law, 2000\n\nReligion: Jewish\n\nOther Facts:\n\nFormer comedian, actor, writer and producer.\n\nHis best known role was in the television series “Servant of the People.” He played a destitute schoolteacher who unexpectedly becomes president of Ukraine after video of his anti-corruption rant goes viral.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Zelensky's unorthodox path to leading and inspiring Ukraine 03:05 - Source: CNN\n\nTimeline:\n\n1990s - Forms a comedy troupe with college friends called Kvartal 95.

(Eight) of them were in response to segregation protests, 2 were riots over police violence, and 1 to stop riots in the aftermath of MLK's assassination. They're almost exclusively called against Black citizens,\" read the tweet.\n\nThe user amaiahorian said the tweet was muted because of its popularity.\n\nUSA TODAY could not reach the poster for comment.\n\nInstagram user Mikah, who posts under the name theonepersonwhonoonegets also posted this claim, where it picked up attention. In the caption, Mikah questioned the effectiveness of peaceful protest.\n\n\"... what should the protesters do instead? Taking a knee in a silent protest didn’t work, going through the system didn’t work, just marching made the police decide to start shooting,\" Mikah wrote.\n\nMikah did not respond to a request for comment from USA TODAY.\n\nWhat is the National Guard's purpose?\n\nFounded in 1636, the National Guard predates the Army as the oldest organized militia in North America, according to its website.\n\nThe Armed Forces Reserve Act of 1952 established a military reserve force — including the National Guard and Air National Guard, Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force and Coast Guard reserves — at the federal and state levels, according to The Library of Congress. The National Guard is part of a \"ready\" reserve category that can be activated by the president in a national emergency with or without the authority of state governors, as stated in H.R. 5426 (82nd).\n\nThe president also has the ability to dispatch the military or federalize the National Guard in states that either defy federal law or cannot control insurrections under the Insurrection Act of 1807, according to USA TODAY. Earlier this month, USA TODAY reported that President Donald Trump considered invoking the Insurrection Act during recent protests over the killing of George Floyd. Floyd was a Black man who suffocated after a Minneapolis police officer pinned him to the ground. The now-former officer, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with second-degree murder, USA TODAY reported.\n\nThe Insurrection Act was last used by President George H.W. Bush in 1992, when the acquittal of the LAPD officers who beat Rodney King sparked the Los Angeles riots.\n\nWhen and why has the Guard been activated on U.S. soil?\n\nThe National Guard has been activated at least 16 times at the federal level, according Dr. Richard Clark, historian for the National Guard Bureau.\n\nIncluded in Clark's timeline are:\n\nWhiskey Rebellion in 1792\n\nCivil War from 1861-65\n\nAgainst the Ku Klux Klan from 1866-1977\n\nGreat Railroad Strike in 1877\n\nDesegregation of Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas from 1957-58\n\nDesegregation of the University of Mississippi in Oxford, Mississippi in 1962\n\nDesegregation of the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, Alabama in 1963\n\nIntegration of Alabama Public Schools in 1963\n\nMarch from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, in 1965\n\nDetroit Riots in 1967\n\n1968 King assassination riots in Chicago, Baltimore and Washington, D.C.\n\nNew York City Postal Strike in 1970\n\n1980 Cuban Refugee Crisis\n\nHurricane Hugo in 1989\n\n1992 LA Riots\n\nGeorge Floyd protests in multiple locations nationwide in 2020\n\nThe list was emailed to USA TODAY by Maj. Robert Perino of the National Guard Bureau of Public Affairs.\n\nAt least nine of the deployments pertain to riots, protests and enforced integration during tense periods for race relations. This is one more than on the social media list.\n\nThe 1967 riots in Detroit and the 1992 Los Angeles riots are the two riots \"over police violence\" when the Guard was called in.\n\n\"The writer of the statement assumes all segregation-related call-ups were 'against Black citizens.' In fact, most segregation-related call-ups in 1957, 1962, 1963, 1963, and 1965 were to protect African-Americans,\" Perino said of the claim.\n\nThere have also been innumerable state-level call-ups by governors for protests or unrest, according to a statement from the National Guard Bureau.\n\nWas the National Guard ever \"called against Black citizens\"?\n\nRobert J.S. Ross, research professor of sociology at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts, said the activation of the Guard to protect Black citizens began in 1957, with forced school integration in Little Rock, Arkansas, and ended with the 1965 Selma, Alabama, march.\n\nKnown as \"Bloody Sunday,\" peaceful protesters were tear-gassed and beaten while crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge during the march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, to protest voting discrimination, USA TODAY reported.\n\nHowever, deployments to \"'contain' Black 'rioters'\" started with the 1965 Watts riots in Los Angeles and continued in 1968 after MLK's assassination, Ross said.\n\nThe Watts riots began with the violent arrest of Marquette Frye, a 21-year-old Black man who was pulled over for drunken driving in the Los Angeles' Watts that neighborhood, according to The Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute at Stanford University.\n\n\"I was involved in two Chicago periods of protest when ... troops were in the city,\" Ross told USA TODAY in an email. Ross was witness to the city's reaction to the King assassination and the anti-Vietnam War demonstrations at the 1968 Democratic National Convention.\n\n\"Federal and national guard troops were way more disciplined and less dangerous than Chicago police,” he said.\n\nEric Fleury, assistant professor of government and international relations at Connecticut College, also said the Guard's involvement in racial conflicts is complex.\n\n\"In the grand scheme of things, it’s relatively rare,\" Fleury said of federal National Guard deployments that centered on race. \"It peaks in the civil rights period. Afterwards, they were most often used to put down riots, such as during the Vietnam War.\"\n\nFleury noted the use of Guard troops in 1992's Rodney King riots.\n\n\"(National Guard troops were) supplemented with the use of regular armed forces. In that instance, you had Army corps and Marines patrolling the streets of L.A. They didn’t have the right to arrest, but they engaged in fire fights, resulting in fatalities on both sides.\"\n\n\"You really did have a combat situation on the streets of Los Angeles,\" Fleury said.\n\n\"The National Guard has played a dual role with respect to the civil rights of African Americans. Federal intervention famously helped to break resistance to integration in states such as Arkansas, Mississippi, and Alabama. However, it has also been used to quell riots such as those following the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. and the acquittal of the LAPD officers who beat Rodney King.\"\n\nOur rating: False\n\nWe rate this claim FALSE because it was not supported by our research. Most of the 16 incidents in which the National Guard was activated at the federal level happened during the Civil Rights Era in the '50s and '60s. However, the Guard was not activated against Black citizens.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

With a $7.93 million grant from the National Institutes of Health, the university will build a new biomedical annex to its Carver Research Center to focus on cancer research and health disparities in underrepresented populations. “This award is recognition for the dedicated effort of the faculty, staff and students within the Center for Biomedical Research to eradicate health disparities, particularly in Alabama Black Belt,” Center for Biomedical Research director Dr. Clayton Yates said in a statement. “Students, particularly African-Americans and other underrepresented minorities, will receive training to become excellent biomedical research scientists, significantly benefitting from this state-of-the-art enhancement.” Booker T. Washington founded the historically Black university in 1881 with the purpose of educating Black teachers. Since then, the school has expanded its mission to include educating students for careers in the sciences, architecture, business and engineering. It also forged a path in bioethics for HBCUs. Tuskegee formed its National Center for Bioethics in Research and Health Care in response to the violations committed during the Tuskegee Syphilis Study.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A lawsuit filed in state court is challenging the eligibility of a legislative candidate to hold the seat. The lawsuit filed Monday alleges Democrat Jennifer “Jennie” Armstrong did not meet residency requirements on the date she filed to run for office. The complaint seeks an injunction barring state elections officials from certifying Armstrong as the winner of her Anchorage House race should she garner the most votes. Armstrong faces Republican Liz Vazquez in next week’s election. The case, brought by Chris Duke, Randy Eledge, Steve Strait and Kathryn Werdahl, names the state Division of Elections and its director as defendants. The plaintiffs are described as “public interest litigants.” Patty Sullivan, a spokesperson with the state Department of Law, said Tuesday morning that the department had not yet been served an official copy of the complaint and could not comment on the specific allegations. But she said that Armstrong has been certified for the ballot based on information she provided in her declaration of candidacy and that the time for any challenge to her eligibility under a state law and regulation has expired. “There is no process for the Division to find a candidate disqualified based on residency at this point in the process,” Sullivan said by email.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Crowds gathered at Steele Indian School Park on Sunday to honor the Indigenous roots of Día de los Muertos at the annual Mikiztil festival. “The Mikiztil is the painted decorated skull that you see, and it represents not death but transcendence,” said Zarco Guerrero, president, chair and co-founder of Cultural Coalition, the host organization of the event. Día de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead, an ancient Mexican celebration with Indigenous Aztec roots, is typically observed Nov. 1-2 during the Catholic holidays of All Saints Day and All Souls Day. During this time, people honor their deceased relatives and invite their spirits back from beyond to join their families in the celebration. The Día de los Muertos celebration well-known today in the U.S. is a medley of Indigenous origins of the tradition mixed with forced Spanish and Catholic influence from the Europeans who conquered the lands of Indigenous people, according to Carmen Guerrero, executive director and co-founder of Cultural Coalition. The Mikiztli festival aims to revive and celebrate its Indigenous origins. “We’re trying to go back to the ancestral understanding of what this event really means. ... It was never about death. It was always about transcending to the next life,” Zarco Guerrero said. Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego acknowledged the city’s support and welcomed the crowd to the event. Shortly after began the Danza Mexica, a form of ancestral worship to what the Aztecs described as the four sacred directions: north, south, east and west.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: The FBI is investigating after several people in the city told police someone called and said their children had been kidnapped and then demanded a ransom. The calls’ claims have been fake but are being investigated by local and federal law officers. Since Thursday, police took reports of a series of calls from across the city about kidnappings. The caller used the same phone number to claim that the targets’ children had been kidnapped and that they would only give the children back if a ransom were paid, police said. “These calls have been investigated and are confirmed to be scams,” according to a Fort Smith news release. In one of the calls, the victim’s child was confirmed safe. In another, the victim did not even have any children. “When the caller is pressed, their knowledge of the victims and the area appears to be limited and superficial,” police said. Anyone who gets a kidnapping call or any other suspicious call can report it to Fort Smith police or the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center at fbi.gov/tips.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The Hoopa Valley Tribe alleged in a lawsuit Monday that the federal government is violating its sovereignty and failing to collect money from California farms that rely on federally supplied water to pay for damages to tribal fisheries. The tribe, which has a reservation in northwest California, says in its lawsuit against the Biden administration that the Trinity River that it relies on for food and cultural purposes has been decimated by decades of the federal government diverting water. The suit alleges the U.S. Department of the Interior has failed to follow laws that require the contractors who use that water to pay money for habitat restoration projects. It says those contractors owe $340 million for environmental restoration work along the Trinity River and other places damaged by water diversions. “The river has become a place that is no longer a healing place, but a place that is a sick place,” said Jill Sherman-Warne, a member of the Hoopa tribal council. The suit also alleges that the federal government has failed to appropriately consult with the tribe on matters related to the river. The Interior Department declined to comment through spokesman Tyler Cherry.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A man has been sentenced to more than 23 years in federal prison after pleading guilty to shooting a ranger at Rocky Mountain National Park last year. The ranger was wearing a bulletproof vest and wasn’t seriously injured. Daron Ellis, 29, of Aurora, was sentenced Monday in federal court in Denver after pleading guilty to attempted murder of a federal officer and brandishing a firearm during a crime of violence, The Denver Post reports. The Dec. 8 shooting occurred after a Colorado State Patrol officer tried to stop Ellis outside the park for speeding. The trooper learned the car was stolen and ordered Ellis to leave the car, but Ellis sped off, authorities said. A National Park Service Law Enforcement ranger spotted the car at the Fall River entrance to the national park in Colorado and ordered Ellis to show his hands. Ellis shot the ranger in the chest with a semi-automatic handgun; the ranger returned fire, wounding Ellis, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Colorado. The ranger’s identity hasn’t been released. Rocky Mountain National Park is about 50 miles northwest of Denver.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A former state representative pleaded guilty Tuesday in connection with the theft of more than $1.2 million in federal coronavirus relief funds from the city of West Haven, using some of the money for gambling at a casino, according to prosecutors. Michael DiMassa, a West Haven Democrat, appeared in federal court in Hartford and pleaded guilty to three counts of wire fraud conspiracy. DiMassa’s wife and his former business partner also pleaded guilty earlier this year, while a fourth person charged in the scheme awaits trial. At the time of the theft, DiMassa was both a state representative and an aide to the West Haven City Council. Prosecutors alleged he used his city position, which had authority to approve the reimbursement of COVID-19 expenditures, to steal the funds – some of which he used for gambling at the Mohegan Sun Casino in eastern Connecticut. DiMassa resigned from both positions after his arrest last year. No sentencing date was set for DiMassa. The sentencing guideline range for the charges to which he pleaded guilty is 41 to 51 months.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: After years of hovering slightly under 1 million residents, the First State has surpassed that milestone − but just barely, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates. The government estimated this summer that in July 2021, Delaware had 1,003,384 residents. Census Bureau data lags by about a year. While Delaware’s overall population growth has remained steady at an average of 1% per year since 2010, adults 65 and older have seen the fastest-growing numbers, with that population increasing 55% in the 11-year period. In contrast, the 35-to-49 age group declined the most, dropping 4.2% in the same time frame. Currently, the 50-to-64 age group makes up the largest share of Delaware’s population, at 20.5%. The 65-and-up age group comes in close second, however, making up 20.1% of the state’s population. Though adults ages 50 to 64 still account for the largest percentage of the state’s population, the rapid growth of the 65-plus age group comes as no surprise given the trend is also being seen nationally, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Administration for Community Living found.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: After decades of planning and years of delays, the D.C. region’s Metrorail system will open a long-awaited extension to Dulles International Airport in about two weeks. The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority announced Monday that the second phase of its Silver Line extension into Loudoun County and the northern Virginia airport will open to passengers Nov. 15. The $3 billion extension adds more than 11 miles of track and six new stations. It has been plagued by cost overruns and criminal charges against contractors who falsified records to try to hide faulty concrete. It was originally scheduled to open in 2018 but faced numerous delays. The opening comes at a time where the Metrorail system continues to face a significant drop in ridership from its pre-pandemic levels, as well as an anticipated budget gap. In recent weeks, Metro officials had said they could not open the new line until safety regulators allowed the system’s 7000 series rail cars to return to use. They had been pulled from service after a derailment. Regulators approved a plan last week to return enough of the cars to service ahead of Thanksgiving to allow the Silver Line extension to open.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Myers: Hurricane Ian ravaged southwest Florida on land but was destructive underwater as well. It destroyed human-made reefs and brought along red tide, the harmful algae blooms that kill fish and birds, according to marine researchers who returned last week from a six-day cruise organized by the Florida Institute of Oceanography. Researchers who used the cruise to study marine life in the Gulf of Mexico following the hurricane say it left in its wake red tide and destroyed artificial reefs from as far away as 30 miles from the coast of southwest Florida. “The onetime vibrant reefs are now underwater disaster sites themselves,” said Calli Johnson, safety dive officer for the research cruise. “Where there used to be a complete ecosystem, there are now only fish that were able to return after swimming away.” Before the Category 4 storm made landfall a month ago, southwest Florida had a reputation for being one of the best saltwater fishing destinations in the U.S. Saltwater and freshwater fishing in Florida has an economic impact of about $13.8 billion, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. “Time will tell how this affects our greater economy because changes in the fishing industry and tourism will come from changes in our underwater world,” Johnson said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A federal judge on Monday declined to dismiss a defamation lawsuit filed against former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani by two women who served as election workers in Georgia in November 2020. In the lawsuit filed last December, Ruby Freeman and Wandrea “Shaye” Moss accused Giuliani of defaming them by falsely stating that the pair had engaged in election fraud while counting ballots at State Farm Arena in Atlanta. The lawsuit says Giuliani repeatedly pushed debunked claims that the mother-and-daughter pair pulled out suitcases of illegal ballots and committed other acts of fraud to try to alter the outcome of the presidential election in Georgia. In an opinion accompanying Monday’s order, U.S. District Court Chief Judge Beryl Howell in Washington described the situation that followed the November 2020 election, when the vote totals in several key states were so close that the results were not immediately clear. “As election workers across the state worked long hours carefully ensuring the accuracy of the election, the Trump Campaign and its allies, including Giuliani, engaged in a media offensive that at best questioned, and at worse condemned, their work,” Howell wrote. Moss had worked for the Fulton County elections department since 2012 and supervised the absentee ballot operation during the 2020 election. Freeman, her mother, was a temporary election worker, verifying signatures on absentee ballots and preparing them to be counted and processed.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The pilot of a helicopter that crashed on a remote lava field during a sunset tour in June told investigators that the engine had been swapped out but three earlier flights that day were normal. The National Transportation Safety Board on Monday released various documents related to the crash that injured all six people on board, but the agency has yet to release a probable cause for why the helicopter suddenly made “violent and uncommanded yaw and pitch changes.” The morning of the crash, the pilot and a mechanic took the helicopter on a operation control flight after its engine had been changed and there were no issues with the flight, according to the pilot’s accident report. The documents did not specify exactly when the engine was changed. The pilot then took the helicopter on two tours, which were also normal and uneventful. The helicopter crashed during a third tour and was found lying on its left side with significant damage to the cockpit, and the tail boom was nearly 800 feet from the main wreckage, according to one of the reports. A large piece of lava rock penetrated about 13 inches into the cockpit area. In a passenger statement, a 48-year-old man on the tour with his two 18-year-old daughters told investigators the helicopter suddenly felt upside down about 30 minutes into the flight.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A former longshot Idaho gubernatorial candidate was convicted Monday of kidnapping and killing a 12-year-old Colorado girl who went missing nearly 40 years ago. Jurors found Steve Pankey, 71, guilty of felony murder, second-degree kidnapping and false reporting in the disappearance and death of Jonelle Matthews in 1984, the office of district attorney Michael Rourke said. A judge then sentenced him to life prison with the possibility of parole, the Greeley Tribune reports. It was Pankey’s second trial in the case. Last year, jurors were unable to reach verdicts on the kidnapping and murder charges, and prosecutors decided to put him on trial again. Pankey was a neighbor of Jonelle and her family when she vanished after being dropped off at her empty home by a family friend after performing at a Christmas concert in Greeley, Colorado, a city about 50 miles north of Denver. He emerged as a person of interest in the case three decades later – shortly before Jonelle’s body was found in 2019 – after claiming to have information about what happened to her and asking for immunity from prosecution. Prosecutors said Pankey kept up to date on the case throughout the years even as he moved his family to several states before settling in Idaho, where he ran unsuccessfully as a Constitution Party candidate for Idaho governor in 2014 and in the Republican gubernatorial primary in 2018, the year authorities said he was named as a person of interest in the girl’s death.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The owner of a North Side senior housing facility where three women earlier this year died amid a brief May heat wave that caused temperatures in the building to soar into the low 90s has been fined $1,500 by the city’s buildings department. Citing city records, the Chicago Sun-Times reports that the fine was levied after an inspection by the buildings department found 11 code violations – two of which were the result of a rooftop air conditioning “chiller” that did not appear to be suitable for use on the exterior of the building. Records show, according to the newspaper, that the department determined that issues noted in the city’s first inspection had been addressed and that a second inspection determined there were “no dangerous and hazardous conditions.” By that time, the Hispanic Housing Development Corporation – a nonprofit organization that owns and manages the James Sneider Apartment – had, among other things, provided individual air conditioning units to every tenant. Mike Puccinelli, a buildings department spokesman, said the fine was levied before city officials had access to autopsy records that showed the deaths of the three women whose bodies were discovered May 14 were linked to the heat. He said the fine was based completely on the violations found during the inspection.\n\nIndiana\n\nCarmel: After years of overcoming legal challenges and governmental hurdles, more than 200 people gathered excitedly Saturday to break ground on the Islamic Life Center in Carmel. “My heart is pounding so fast with no fear or sadness but truly with a feeling of joy and pleasure,” Nadeem Ikhlaque, Al Salam’s founding president, said from a podium at the site of the future center. “In my 54 years of life, I never had this feeling, but today I have – standing in front of you.” Carmel leaders, the Al Salam Foundation, Muslim members, and those from other faith communities and the public broke ground on the city’s first mosque. The center will be under the umbrella of the foundation, which is an Islamic nonprofit organization. “We are practicing our faith rituals – daily and weekly prayers, nightly prayers, fasting through the month of Ramadan,” Ashhar Madni, president of the Al Salam Foundation, told the crowd. “The other half of our faith is to do good deeds. ... While we worship our creator, we need to serve his creation as well.” The road to this point was not a straight line and showed the clash that can occur as cities become more diverse. While city, community and religious leaders largely supported the project, many Carmel residents of different cultural and religious backgrounds in nearby upscale neighborhoods protested against it, saying they were largely concerned with property values. Center members said Saturday that they looked forward to being a good and inviting neighbor.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Agriculture officials said Monday that another commercial egg farm in the state has been infected with bird flu – the first commercial farm case identified since April, when a turkey farm was infected. The latest case is in Wright County in north central Iowa, about 80 miles north of Des Moines, housing about 1.1 million chickens. Iowa has had 15 commercial farms infected this year, including turkeys, egg-laying hens and other chickens. In addition, five backyard flocks have been infected. Because the virus is highly contagious, all birds on an infected farm are killed and disposed of to avoid the spread of the disease. Iowa has been hardest hit with bird losses at more than 13.3 million this year before the latest farm was found infected. Nationally more than 47.7 million birds have been affected in 43 states that includes 251 commercial flocks and 328 backyard flocks, U.S. Department of Agriculture figures show. Most of the Iowa cases were during the spring migration of wild birds in March and April with one reported in early May. The virus hadn’t been detected again until a backyard flock was infected Oct. 20, and then the latest infection was confirmed Monday.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state’s top elections official warned voters Monday that text messages from outside the state were giving them incorrect information about where to vote, but groups involved in the texting said they weren’t trying to confuse or mislead people. Several Democrats said they began hearing about the texts Sunday or had received them. Each message said it was from a representative of Voting Futures, Voto Latino or Black Voters Matter and provided the address of a voting site, with a picture of a building. In some cases, the person already had voted; in others, people couldn’t vote in advance at the listed site, and in some, people could vote in advance there, but not on Election Day, Nov. 8. Movement Labs, a vendor headquartered in Oakland, California, working for both Voto Latino and Black Voters Matter, tweeted that texts also went to voters in Illinois, New Jersey, North Carolina and Virginia. Kansas Democrats who learned of the texts worried that a disinformation campaign had targeted their voters in hopes of preventing their ballots from counting or discouraging them from voting. And Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab, a Republican, said voters should be on “high alert” about potential election misinformation from such texts.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Former U.S. Rep. Romano L. Mazzoli, D-Ky., whose tenacity and personal integrity formed the foundation of a long career in politics and public service, died Tuesday at his home in Louisville. He was one day shy of his 90th birthday. Charlie Mattingly, his former chief of staff, said Mazzoli’s mental acuity never waned, although his health declined, particularly in recent months. Throughout his 24 years in the House, Mazzoli defied the usual stereotypical descriptions applied to political figures. His unpredictable voting patterns occasionally prompted the casual observer describe him as a maverick, a term Mazzoli disliked. “I don’t like labels,” he said in 1988. “I don’t consider myself anything but thoughtful.” Mazzoli’s nature frequently put him in conflict with his party on issues of substance and matters of conscience. Although he pledged in his first House speech to support the Equal Rights Amendment, he alienated women’s groups that were trying to keep the amendment alive in 1983 by voting to defeat an ERA resolution. He said Democratic leaders had not provided enough time to discuss its impact on abortion and women in the draft. A devout Catholic, Mazzoli strongly opposed abortion, putting him at odds with members of his party’s liberal Washington establishment. He frequently angered organized labor by refusing to support protectionist legislation and voted once to support the veto of a Democratic bill to raise the minimum wage.\n\nLouisiana\n\nFerriday: The family of legendary rock ’n’ roll pioneer Jerry Lee Lewis has announced details of memorial services planned this weekend for his birthplace. Lewis, known for hits such as “Great Balls of Fire” and many others, died Friday at age 87. The funeral service is set for 11 a.m. Central Daylight Time on Saturday at Young’s Funeral Home in Ferriday, family members said. There will be very limited public availability, but the ceremony will be livestreamed, with details to be announced later on Lewis’ Facebook page. A private burial will follow. A celebration of life is also planned for 1 p.m. that day at the Arcade Theater in Ferriday, Lewis’ representatives said. Lewis was the last survivor of a generation of artists that rewrote music history, a group that included Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry and Little Richard.\n\nMaine\n\nEtna: A 74-year-old man who spent nearly 30 hours lost in the woods was hypothermic and unable to move when he was found by a game warden using a tracking dog, officials said. Joseph Nolin knew his ordeal was over when he heard a bell attached to the Labrador retriever’s collar, and then the dog bounded up and started licking him Monday afternoon, his son told wardens. Nolin walked until he couldn’t move and told wardens he wouldn’t have survived another night in the woods. He was found a mile from his house deep in the woods at the edge of the Etna Bog, officials said. A Maine Forest Service helicopter was used to retrieve Nolin, and he was released after being hydrated and warmed up, officials said. Nolen had been last seen Sunday morning, when he departed to check on game cameras in the woods. He son reported him missing Sunday evening.\n\nMaryland\n\nBowie: A representative for the company staging a Halloween magic performance at Six Flags America says an emergency call that medics described as a serious injury caused by sword swallowing was caused by an “unrelated medical condition,” WUSA-TV reports. The call for help came from Six Flags in Bowie between 9:30 and 10 p.m. Saturday evening. “It was not for an accident during the show but rather for other unrelated health conditions,” said Josh Bowren, production manager for Aaron Radatz Productionz, which staged the show, according to Six Flags officials. Bowren did not name the actor, whom he described as “our sword swallower,” and authorities have not released the name of the injured person. The performer was a 59-year-old man who was in serious but not life-threatening condition when he was transported to Capital Region Health Hospital in Largo on Saturday night, rescuers said. Rescuers described the weapon to medical workers as “a haunted house sword” and said it occurred during a “Halloween show.” A spokesperson for Six Flags said the company’s “thoughts and prayers are with the performer and his family.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: A retired state trooper who was killed in what authorities described as a shooting motivated by racism and an officer who drowned while trying to save the life of a teenager were honored Tuesday with awards for exemplary acts of bravery. A total of 32 Massachusetts law enforcement personnel were named recipients of the annual George L. Hanna Memorial Award for Bravery by Gov. Charlie Baker during a ceremony at Mechanics Hall in Worcester. Hanna was a state trooper shot and killed during a traffic stop in Auburn in 1983. Two of his children participated in Tuesday’s ceremony. “Like Trooper George Hanna, the dedicated women and men in law enforcement perform exceptional work guided by their deeply rooted commitment to helping others, no matter the risk to themselves,” Baker said in a statement. Retired state Trooper David L. Green, 68, left his Winthrop home in June 2021 to investigate a truck crash and was shot multiple times by a white man who authorities say had expressed antisemitic and anti-Black views. Green and Ramona Cooper, a 60-year-old Air Force veteran, were killed. Both were Black.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The family of Porter Burks, a Black man fatally shot during an early morning confrontation with Detroit police, is suing the city for $50 million, their lawyer announced Tuesday. Five unnamed officers also are named in the wrongful death lawsuit filed Tuesday by attorney Geoffrey Fieger. It claims gross negligence and assault and battery, among other things. Burks’ Oct. 2 death was recorded by police body cameras as officers pleaded with him to drop a knife he was carrying. They initially were called to a home on the west side about a knife-wielding man who was having a mental health crisis and spoke to a man who identified himself as Burks’ brother. The man said Burks had slashed the tires on his car. “Drop the knife for me, man. Come here real quick. You’re OK,” a member of the Detroit Police Department’s crisis intervention team can be heard telling Burks. “You’re not in any trouble. Can you just talk to me and drop the knife?” “You’re not in any trouble, OK?” the officer continued. “I just want to help you. I just want to help you, man. OK? Can you just drop the knife for me please? Please? Whatever you’re going through, I can help you.” Burks – who police say had schizophrenia – was shot as he sprinted toward officers from the middle of the street.\n\nMinnesota\n\nBrainerd: A man is accused of fatally shooting his daughter’s boyfriend who he suspected was abusing her. The 45-year-old Brainerd father is charged with second-degree murder in the death of 23-year-old Bryce Brogle, who was reported missing after going to the man’s storage unit Oct. 26. According to a criminal complaint, the father shot Brogle in the back of the head from a distance and then buried his body in Crow Wing County. The defendant’s daughter reported her boyfriend missing Oct. 28, telling police he hadn’t been seen since he went to the storage unit with her father. Investigators executed a search warrant Oct. 29 at the storage unit and said they found the presence of blood and bleach on the concrete floor and signs something had been dragged across the floor. The following day, law enforcement officers searched land in Crow Wing County on foot and found a grave site. The complaint said that after it was excavated, they found a body with a gunshot wound to the back of the head. An autopsy confirmed it was Brogle. According to the charges, the landlord for Brogle and his girlfriend called the sheriff’s office, saying the father has asked if Brogle had hurt his daughter. The landlord said his daughter had been seen with two black eyes. The complaint said the father then told the landlord he was going to kill Brogle, and he’d already dug a hole.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency confirmed Monday that the city’s water is safe to drink, after months of sampling at a treatment plant overwhelmed by August flooding that caused wide supply disruptions. The beleaguered O.B. Curtis water treatment plant fell into crisis after the late summer flooding left 150,000 people without running water for several days. People waited in lines for water to drink, bathe, cook and flush toilets. The crisis also added to the rising costs for business owners already saddled with a labor shortage and high inflation. The city had already been under a boil-water notice since late July because the state health department found cloudy water that could make people ill. But current water samples pass muster for safe consumption, the EPA said. “Current sampling confirms water delivered from J.H. Fewell Water and O.B. Curtis Water Treatment is safe to drink,” said Maria Michalos, a spokesperson for the EPA, referring to the city’s two water treatment plants. The agency encouraged Jackson residents to stay vigilant about updates and follow all future boil water advisories, as “localized issues” may resurface. It is not yet certain whether Jackson has too much lead and copper in its water. Sampling has been completed, and results are expected in mid-November.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: The state’s health department is investigating whether a hospital violated federal health care rules in denying a woman an emergency abortion, an agency spokeswoman confirmed Monday. Missouri Health and Senior Services spokeswoman Lisa Cox in a statement said the agency launched an investigation into southern Missouri’s Freeman Health System’s treatment of Mylissa Farmer. Farmer, who is from Joplin, told the Associated Press she went to the system’s local emergency room when her water broke months early Aug. 2. She said tests showed she had lost all of her amniotic fluid because of a pregnancy complication, and doctors told her the fetus was not expected to survive. Doctors also told Farmer that “awaiting a medical emergency may put her at further risk for maternal mortality” or the removal of her uterus, medical records show. But because her fetus still had a heartbeat, and her condition wasn’t considered a life-threatening medical emergency at that moment, they couldn’t terminate the pregnancy in Missouri, they told her. She eventually got an abortion in Illinois. Records from that visit say doctors told Farmer that the law supersedes their medical judgment, and “contrary to the most appropriate management based (on) my medical opinion, due to the legal language of MO law, we are unable to offer induction of labor at this time.” “They were telling me to basically get out of the state to get the care that I needed,” the 41-year-old told AP.\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: A woman was cited for animal cruelty Thursday for shooting and skinning a 6-month-old husky and posting pictures of herself with the animal online bragging that she had shot a young wolf, officials said. The husky was among a group of 18 dogs and puppies, including German shepherd mixes, that had been abandoned on national forest land in northwestern Montana in mid-September, the Flathead County Sheriff’s Office has said. The investigation led the woman to be cited with a misdemeanor and not charged with a felony because officers believe they can prove negligence but not intent, the Sheriff’s Office told NBC Montana. The citation gives the woman two weeks to appear in Justice Court, Officer Paul Charbonneau said. The Flathead County Animal Shelter cared for the dogs, some of which had parvo, a viral infection that causes vomiting and diarrhea. Charbonneau said he believed all the dogs had been adopted.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A Halloween celebration turned frantic after a man drove through a barricaded area and was shot by a police officer Monday night, police said. The Omaha World-Herald reports that the shooting occurred during the popular annual “Halloween on the Boulevard” block party in the Minne Lusa neighborhood in Omaha. Children and adults were out in the neighborhood trick-or-treating when a car drove recklessly through a blocked-off area shortly after 7 p.m., Omaha Police Lt. Neal Bonacci said. The driver of the vehicle was shot by an Omaha police officer and taken to Nebraska Medical Center with serious injuries. The name of the driver has not yet been released. Police say no one else was injured. Chrissy Lopez, a resident of the neighborhood, told the Omaha World-Herald that the vehicle initially drove slowly through the crowd as people yelled at the driver to stop. “He would stop and then drive a little more,” she said. “I heard his engine rev, and people started screaming, and I thought, ‘Oh no.’ And then I heard the gunshots, and everybody just started screaming and running and crying.” Police and firefighters were already on the scene for the block party, which is put on by the Miller Park Minne Lusa Neighborhood Association and draws thousands of people to the area each year.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The Republican National Committee is asking a judge to order election officials in Las Vegas to hire more GOP poll workers to correct what a legal filing calls a disproportionate imbalance favoring Democrats. A Clark County District Court judge is scheduled Wednesday to consider accusations that county elections chief Joe Gloria “stacked” a key ballot signature verification board with 23 Democrats, 33 nonpartisans and “a mere” eight Republicans. Dan Kulin, spokesman for Gloria, declined Monday to comment on a matter pending before a judge. “The registrar’s lopsided staffing of the signature verification board is not remotely ‘as equal as possible’ ” under state law, attorneys representing the RNC alleged in a document filed Friday. “He created a signature verification board with a partisan makeup that tilts sharply against Republicans.” Judge Timothy Williams had signed off Oct. 5 on a pact between the two sides after the county agreed to provide to the RNC a roster showing job titles and political party affiliations of poll workers. The RNC dropped a demand to obtain workers’ names. Voter registration leans Democratic in Clark County, the most populous area of Nevada and home to nearly 1.3 million, or more than 71%, of the state’s 1.8 million active registered voters.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: A U.S. House candidate on the ballot in next week’s election would be the youngest woman ever in Congress if she wins. Karoline Leavitt recalls being in her college dining hall in 2018, filling out an application for a White House intern job while her friends were tailgating at a football game. “I remember thinking, ‘If I made this opportunity, it’s worth missing any football game in the world,’ ” she told the Associated Press in an interview She got the job. That eventually led to a position in President Donald Trump’s White House press office, then another as communications director for Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y. Inspired by Stefanik, the youngest woman elected to Congress when she won in 2014 at age 30, Leavitt is now running for a House seat of her own. At age 25, she could make history on Election Day: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., won at 29 in 2018. Leavitt, an unabashed pro-Trump Republican, would also be the youngest person in the next session of Congress if she were to defeat two-term Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas in one of the most competitive races this year. Leavitt is seven months younger then fellow Gen Z candidate Maxwell Alejandro Frost, a Florida Democrat favored in his race. Leavitt won her 10-way Republican primary in September in part by going to the right of the other candidates. “I consistently continue to be the only candidate in this race who says that I believe the 2020 election was undoubtedly stolen from President Trump,” she said during a debate.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAsbury Park: While COVID-19 has been at the forefront of health concerns for more than two years, another group of infections has continued to spread among New Jersey residents. Chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis have become more prevalent among adults and teens over the past decade, according to data from the New Jersey Health Department. Incidences of the three infections rose 40% between 2012 and 2019, according to state data. While it caused a small drop-off in disease rates, the COVID-19 pandemic failed to significantly slow down the spread of sexually transmitted infections across the state, said Dr. Edward Liu, the infectious disease section chief at Jersey Shore University Medical Center in Neptune. “Even during the pandemic … their behaviors didn’t change that much,” he said. “Or maybe they were so cooped up that they had to have some type of outlet.” While rates of infection for chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis did drop during 2020, the rate still exceeded the rate for 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015. Although all three infections are treatable with certain antibiotics, experts worry that they may soon run out of medications capable of treating gonorrhea. Greta Anschuetz, the assistant acting commissioner at the New Jersey Department of Health who leads the division of HIV, STD and TB Services, said her office is concerned about the infection. “Gonorrhea has figured out how to be resistant to every drug, and we’re on the last of the (known, effective) drugs,” she said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A sheriff’s department has submitted its investigative findings to prosecutors in the death of a cinematographer shot and killed by Alec Baldwin on a film set in New Mexico in October 2021. Santa Fe Sheriff’s Office spokesman Juan Ríos said Thursday that two binders of information were turned over to the Santa Fe-based district attorney’s office, without setting forth any recommendations about possible criminal charges. He said the case file outlines all the evidence collected, including investigative interviews and forensic analysis of physical evidence by the FBI. District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies said through a spokeswoman that investigators and prosecutors will now begin a thorough review to make a timely decision about whether to bring charges, without mention of specific deadlines. Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins died shortly after being wounded by a gunshot during setup for a scene in the western movie “Rust” at a filmset ranch on the outskirts of Santa Fe on Oct. 21, 2021. Baldwin was pointing a pistol at Hutchins when the gun went off went off, killing her and wounding the director, Joel Souza.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The debut of a giant “Bluey” balloon, Lea Michele and the Broadway cast of “Funny Girl,” and the legendary Dionne Warwick are some of the highlights slated for this year’s Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade. This year’s parade – the 96th annual – will feature 16 giant character balloons, 28 floats, 40 novelty and heritage inflatables, 12 marching bands, 700 clowns, 10 performance groups and, of course, Santa Claus. New balloon giants joining the line-up Nov. 24 include Stuart the one-eyed Minion from “Despicable Me 2”; a new green dinosaur, an Apatosaurus; the debut of the animated sensation “Bluey”; and a new “Diary of a Wimpy Kid” balloon. Other celebrities slated to be on hand include Paula Abdul, making her parade debut; Fitz and the Tantrums; Big Time Rush; “Blue’s Clues & You!” host Josh Dela Cruz; Gloria Estefan along with her daughter, Emily, and grandson, Sasha; Kirk Franklin; Mario Lopez; Ziggy Marley; and Miss America 2022 Emma Broyles. The singers Joss Stone, Jordin Sparks and Betty Who will all be part of the festivities, as will the stars of Peacock’s “Pitch Perfect: Bumper in Berlin” – Adam Devine, Sarah Hyland and Flula Borg. Jimmy Fallon & The Roots will be on a float celebrating Central Park.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper on Tuesday announced a new commission tasked with making recommendations on changing how the boards guiding the University of North Carolina system and its 17 member schools are chosen, bidding to broaden their membership by political leanings, race and gender. The Democratic governor essentially blamed the Republican-controlled Legislature for contributing to problems within the governing structure of one of the country’s leading public university systems – with 240,000 students and UNC-Chapel Hill and N.C. State University as its flagship campuses. “The UNC system is the envy of the nation for what we have built here,” Cooper said at an Executive Mansion news conference. “But there are signs of trouble that come when all of the appointed leaders are chosen by too few … we have an appointed university leadership that doesn’t come close to reflecting our diversity.” As a reminder of partisanship he blames for the system’s stumbling, Cooper stood beside commission co-chairs Tom Ross and Margaret Spellings, two recent UNC system presidents. Both got pushed out in different ways by previous editions of the UNC Board of Governors that were controlled by GOP-approved members.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A judge ruled Monday that he will keep the state’s ban on abortion from taking effect, saying there’s a “substantial probability” that a constitutional challenge to the law will succeed. Judge Bruce Romanick’s ruling means abortion is still legal in North Dakota, though the state’s only clinic – the Red River Women’s Clinic of Fargo – shut down as it challenged the ban and has moved across the border to neighboring Minnesota. Romanick last month rejected a request from North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley to let the law take effect while the Red River clinic’s lawsuit went forward. Romanick based his earlier decision on several factors, but Wrigley argued he had not sufficiently considered the clinic’s chances of prevailing in court. The North Dakota Supreme Court agreed and told Romanick to take another look. In his earlier ruling, Romanick noted the clinic’s uphill battle. But in his ruling Monday, he said the clinic has a “substantial probability” of succeeding, though he noted that the question of whether abortion is a constitutional right in North Dakota has been contentious and has not been decided by the state’s highest court.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A man was arrested Saturday at the Hamilton County Board of Elections after officials say he yelled through a megaphone on the premises and refused to leave. Stephan Pryor, 43, of Over-the-Rhine, is charged with criminal trespassing after the weekend incident at the Norwood facility. Officers engaged with Pryor about 1:30 p.m., while early in-person voting was underway for the day. According to board of elections director Sherry Poland, the board implemented a policy in March banning the use of bullhorns on the premises because they can be heard inside. Ohio law prohibits campaigning inside a polling location. Pryor was reportedly asked to stop using the bullhorn and to leave the property. He refused, Poland said, and Norwood police responded to ask him to leave. He was arrested after refusing again, an incident report says. In an interview Monday evening, Pryor said after he cast a ballot, he went to advertise candidates as he often does for elections. It is not the first time he’s used a megaphone at the facility, he said. He said he was standing the proper distance from the building and didn’t break laws regarding polling place advertisements. He cited that the board’s recent rule regarding megaphones is not protected directly by Ohio Revised Code. “They did me wrong. They arrested me in front of everybody – that was wrong,” Pryor said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nRamona: A ranch with a history of exorcisms is being revamped into a resort. When Amber Stewart found out that Tri County Technology Center was selling a 114-acre property just off Highway 75, she leapt at the opportunity to own the land despite its history. “My husband (David) and I had wanted to buy it for years and years and years,” Amber Stewart said. “It was something that we had talked about, dreamed about and didn’t really think would come to fruition. But when we found out the property was for sale, we were feeling like this is the Lord’s will for us.” Jarrett Farm Resort, 24 miles north of Tulsa, has a history as a commercial property tracing back to the 1940s. It’s been a commercial farm, a conference and retreat center and, for a few years, home to an order of Catholic priests known for performing exorcisms. The Stewarts hope to restore its reputation as a vacation getaway, but it has been an immense challenge. “There were dead mice and large spiders ... there was a raccoon living in the attic,” Amber Stewart said. The Stewarts actually spent the first night of their honeymoon 20 years ago during its previous iteration as a resort. The Catholic Diocese of Tulsa then purchased Jarrett Farm and used it from 2014 to 2018 as a home for an order of priests known for performing exorcisms, according to county records and reports from the diocese. The Stewarts have faced a mix of curiosity and resistance from some residents in Ramona’s small community, but they intend to “honor the story” of Jarrett Farm.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state’s pioneering motor voter program, in which residents who interact with the motor vehicle division are automatically registered to vote, hit a minor software speed bump, but Oregon’s secretary of state said Monday that it’s being resolved. Secretary of State Shemia Fagan said the Oregon Elections Division on Friday discovered the software error, which for the past six years has failed to preregister some 16- and 17-year-olds to vote. “As a result, 7,767 eligible voters in Oregon … were not given the opportunity to become automatically registered voters for the 2022 election. The issue has impacted voters during the last three election cycles,” Fagan’s office said in a statement. Fagan will direct Oregon’s 36 county clerks to issue ballots to affected voters – those who will be 18 or older Nov. 8. “Eligible voters not receiving their ballots in Oregon is unacceptable,” Fagan’s statement said. “As long as I am Oregon’s Secretary of State, I will do everything in my power to ensure that no eligible voters are disenfranchised.” The Oregon Elections Division was alerted to the issue by a voter who didn’t receive a ballot. Fagan said her technical staff worked through the weekend to resolve the software error.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nStroudsburg: Prosecutors say they have found no evidence of criminal negligence in a gas main rupture under an eastern Pennsylvania roadway and a subsequent fatal single-vehicle crash early on Christmas Day almost two years ago. The Monroe County district attorney’s office said Monday that all parties involved were cooperative in the investigation into the Pocono Township rupture and crash on Route 314 that killed 33-year-old Ana Abreu, of New York City. Township police said Abreu, her husband, their 2-month-old child and another family member were in a sport utility vehicle heading north toward the intersection with Route 611 about 1:30 a.m. on Christmas morning in 2020. Police said a natural gas main beneath the roadway ruptured, flipping the SUV over onto its roof and killing Abreu. The rupture left a large hole in the road, exposing the gas main underneath and a fracture in the pipeline, prosecutors said. A UGI Utilities spokesperson told LehighValleyLive.com that the company was “encouraged” by the decision but declined additional comment.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Bus drivers have reached a tentative settlement with their employer, First Student, avoiding a strike that was scheduled to begin Wednesday. The bus drivers, monitors and aides are members of Local 1199 of the Service Employees International Union. The strike would have affected bus drivers in Lincoln, West Warwick and the state bus yard in Cranston, who transport students with special needs, among others. The settlement includes a four-year contract that provides a fair wage increase and an increase in guaranteed hours, the union said. The 275 members of the union are expected to ratify the contract, at which time more details will be provided. “I’ve been a school bus driver for 13 years, and many of the kids I transport have special physical and behavioral needs that require special accommodations and increased attention,” said Mike McDermott, a bus driver at the metro yard in Cranston. “We are happy that First Student was finally willing to come to the table with proposals that will help us better take care of our families and do our jobs. Even before the pandemic, First Student could not recruit bus drivers, monitors to do this work, and we are hopeful that better hours and pay will go a long way in attracting more workers to the field. At the end of the day, it’s our students who benefit most.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGrenville: Voters in Greenville County will be allowed to wear “Black Lives Matter” and “Make America Great Again” paraphernalia to the polls this Election Day, according to a notice sent to poll workers by county Elections Director Conway Belangia. He said the county’s decision is the result of a court ruling in Minnesota allowing the same practice. He said the American Civil Liberties Union alerted the county to the ruling. The county attorney was brought in to review the situation, and he determined the Minnesota court ruling, which found BLM and MAGA gear should not be considered prohibited campaign materials, applied to Greenville County. Belangia said the change of interpretation applies only to voters in Greenville County, but the state election commission had previously ruled in a similar manner. The county was a “Johnny-come-lately” in its determination to allow BLM and MAGA gear, Belangia said. Voters are still prohibited from wearing gear for any specific candidate inside polling places.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A federal appeals court on Tuesday upheld a lower court’s decision to block parts of a South Dakota law that would have required ballot petition workers to publicly disclose their personal identification information. The Republican-controlled Legislature in 2020 passed a law that would have required paid ballot measure circulators to list their personal information, including phone number, residential address, email address and driver’s license information, in a directory. The law was just one attempt by lawmakers in recent years to add barriers to ballot measures, which have given progressive causes a chance at enactment in the politically red state. Circuit Judge Steven Grasz wrote in an opinion for a three-judge panel of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals that being forced to disclose the information would be “chilling in today’s world” and the law would violate the First Amendment. United States District Judge Lawrence Piersol issued a temporary injunction against the law last year. Dakotans for Health, an organization that was formed around a ballot measure to expand Medicaid eligibility, sued to have the law overturned. The organization is now focused on placing a proposed constitutional amendment on the 2024 ballot to codify abortion rights.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A man accused of intentionally setting fire to a Planned Parenthood clinic and of firing shots later at a federal courthouse died months ago, officials announced Monday in disclosing both the man’s death and the allegations. Federal court documents indicate that the man, Mark Thomas Reno, 64, died Aug. 15. Yet many of the documents in his case were sealed until this week, including records showing he had been arrested in connection with the Planned Parenthood arson fire. “The government’s investigation has revealed that (Reno) engaged in a series of violent acts of property destruction in Knoxville since early 2021,” a newly unsealed complaint said. The complaint said Reno fired a shotgun at the clinic’s doors in early 2021, shattering glass and leaving holes in the reception area. Reno then set the clinic ablaze in December 2021, the document said. The building was unoccupied during the fire but had to be closed for months to undergo an $2.2 million renovation. Other court documents show that the FBI began surveillance of Reno in April of this year after he told an undercover agent he belonged to a group with a mission to resist actions opposed to Catholic orthodoxy. The agent was secretly recording Reno, who said that his group had “plenty of targets,” according to the documents.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: The leaders of a group that promotes election conspiracy theories were jailed Monday for not complying with a court order to provide information in a defamation lawsuit over some of their claims. Catherine Engelbrecht and Gregg Phillips, who run True the Vote, were ordered detained by U.S. marshals, according to an order signed by U.S. District Judge Kenneth Hoyt in Houston. They will be held for at least one day or “until they fully comply with the Court’s Order,” Hoyt wrote. Houston-based True the Vote provided research for a debunked documentary that alleged widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election. Engelbrecht, Phillips and their nonprofit organization are being sued by Michigan-based election software provider Konnech Inc. over True the Vote’s claims of a Chinese-related conspiracy involving U.S. poll workers’ information. Alfredo Perez, a spokesman for the U.S. Marshals Service in Houston, said Monday that Engelbrecht and Phillips were in the law enforcement agency’s custody. True the Vote said in a statement read during a video livestream Monday that its attorneys would appeal Hoyt’s ruling.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: For years, water conservation advocates have urged the state to offer money to residents to incentivize them to remove their lawns. For some, at least, that proposal came closer to reality Friday, with water officials set to start taking applications for a pilot program that could pay up to $1 per square foot to Utahns who want to replace their water-guzzling grass with drought-resistant landscaping. The Legislature earlier this year approved a $5 million expenditure to fund a statewide grass removal rebate program. State water officials plan a full launch of the program next spring via a new website, UtahWaterSavers.com, but in the meantime, residents can apply for the pilot program on the Utah Division of Water Resources website, conservewater.utah.gov/grass-removal-rebates, with a limited number of spaces available. Applicants who are approved get a year to complete their landscaping project as long as they meet the criteria, which include requirements for the type of replacement landscaping allowed in each part of the state. Turf removal programs have proven successful in desert cities like Las Vegas, dropping per-capita use, but have been slow to develop in Utah, with water managers often citing a lack of funding.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: In a national assessment of learning, Vermont student performance in math and reading was about average compared to the nation but continued a downward trend the state has seen on national standardized tests since before COVID-19. Vermont students predictably performed below 2019 levels – the last time the test was administered – in math and reading on the National Assessment of Educational Progress test and in most cases aligned with the average U.S. score. The test was administered to fourth and eighth graders in math and reading. The test is usually given every two years as a way to measure national and statewide progress over time but was postponed in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In Vermont, 202 schools participated in 2022. For the second time in a row, Vermont’s fourth grade math scores dipped below the national average, albeit by one point. Vermont fourth graders’ math scores fell five points overall compared to 2019. This year’s score was 234 on a scale of 500. Math proficiency for both fourth and eighth graders in Vermont had been increasing from the mid-1990s until about 2013, when the scores turned the other direction, and have been in a gradual decline ever since. In 2022, about 35% of fourth grade students were proficient in math.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: In the past four years, the state has seen opioid overdose deaths among Black residents more than triple – the highest death rate, by far, of any demographic. The numbers underscore the lethality of a fentanyl-polluted drug supply, as well as structural barriers to entering recovery, a critical first step in preventing fatal overdose, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reports. The numbers – made publicly available by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention death certificate database – tell the story of a striking rise, particularly in the Richmond metropolitan area. Chesterfield County had 34 deaths in 2021, up from 11 in 2018. Henrico County spiked similarly, up to 44 deaths from 14, and Richmond accounted for 135 deaths, up from 41 deaths in 2018. The spike was more acute in Richmond than in any other county in the state. “It desensitizes you to death,” said Darryl Cousins, whocounts three friends who have died of an overdose in the past two months. Cousins, a Black man, works for Starfish Recovery and Wellness, a Richmond-based recovery residence for people with addiction. He’s been sober for 15 years, he said, and shares a long view on how the city has changed in that time. Most frightening is the drug that seems to be everywhere these days. “All of a sudden it’s in every drug being sold,” Cousins said. “Fentanyl has taken over the drug world.”\n\nWashington\n\nBremerton: A flatbed truck carrying 500 gallons of liquid detergent hit the median on Highway 3 on Monday evening near Gorst, spilling the fluid onto the road and then into the Puget Sound. The crash near milepost 35 was reported at 5:40 p.m. and cleared about 7 p.m., blocking traffic in each direction for the duration, according to Washington State Patrol Trooper Katherine Weatherwax. The driver told investigators he fell asleep, Weatherwax said. The state Department of Ecology was notified. The detergent that spilled is designed to clean trucks.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: State transportation officials say construction has begun on a full-service Division of Motor Vehicles regional office in Morgan County. The new office being built in Berkeley Springs will bring additional driver’s licensing and vehicle services to the citizens of the Eastern Panhandle, officials said in a news release Thursday. It is expected to open in the spring of 2023. “We know how busy our Martinsburg and Charles Town Regional Offices are on a daily basis,” said Everett Frazier, commissioner of the state’s Division Of Motor Vehicles. “Population continues to grow in that location, and opening an office in Morgan County will help us to provide accessible, more efficient and convenient customer service to that area.” A staff of a dozen people or more could be employed at the Morgan County office, and hiring will begin soon, Frazier said. Full-service DMV regional offices offer driver’s license skills testing, written knowledge tests, vehicle registration renewals, title work and other services. A motorcycle course will also be built at the new office.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A judge on Monday scheduled a two-day sentencing hearing for a man who killed six people when he drove his SUV through a Christmas parade in suburban Milwaukee last year. Waukesha County Circuit Judge Jennifer Dorow set Darrell Brooks’ sentencing for Nov. 15-16 to accommodate dozens of people who want to speak at the proceeding. Prosecutors told the judge they expect at least 36 people will speak. Brooks said he anticipates about 20 people will speak on his behalf. A jury last Wednesday convicted Brooks of 76 counts in connection with the Nov. 21, 2021, incident in Waukesha. The charges include six counts of first-degree intentional homicide and 61 counts of recklessly endangering safety. Each homicide count carries a mandatory life sentence, although Dorow can decide whether Brooks could be released on extended supervision at some point. Each endangerment count carries a maximum sentence of 171/ 2 years.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: A contentious “glamping” development is in question again, with Teton County officials saying they might force a pause to construction underway near Teton Village, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reports. County commissioners warned the companies involved might be told to obtain county permits in the wake of opposition from neighbors and advocates worried about the effects on the land and water supplies, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/09/13/new-water-crisis-drag-show-threats-nurses-strike-news-around-states/50730699/", "title": "New water crisis, drag show threats: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Toforest Johnson, 49, has spent half his life on death row for the murder of a sheriff’s deputy, a killing he says he did not commit. Johnson’s attorneys asked the Alabama Supreme Court on Friday to “right a grievous wrong” and grant him a new trial. The filing is the latest effort in a case that has seen former judges, prosecutors and the local district attorney join in calls to reexamine the 1998 conviction and death sentence. Johnson’s attorneys are asking the justices to review a lower court decision denying the new trial request. They argued that the conviction rested on the testimony of a single witness who was paid a reward and that her testimony “was at odds with the physical evidence and directly contradicted by the state’s theory of the case in other proceedings.” Johnson was convicted and sentenced to death for the killing of Jefferson County Deputy Sheriff William Hardy, who was shot twice in the head while working off-duty security at a hotel in 1995. The conviction came after Johnson’s first trial ended with a hung jury. A co-defendant in the case was acquitted. Former Alabama Attorney General Bill Baxley, former Chief Justice Drayton Nabers, and several former judges and prosecutors submitted briefs to the circuit court or wrote editorials supporting a new trial for Johnson. Danny Carr, the district attorney in the county where Johnson was convicted, also called for a new trial.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Lance Mackey, one of mushing’s most colorful and accomplished champions, has died. The four-time Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race winner died Wednesday from cancer, his father and kennel announced on Facebook. He was 52. Officials with the world’s most famous sled dog race said Iditarod Nation was in mourning. “Lance embodied the spirit of the race, the tenacity of an Alaskan musher, displayed the ultimate show of perseverance and was loved by his fans,” officials said in a statement. The son of 1978 Iditarod champion Dick Mackey and brother of 1983 champion Rick Mackey, Lance Mackey overcame throat cancer in 2001 to win an unprecedented four straight Iditarod championships, from 2007 through 2010. It wasn’t just the 1,000-mile race across Alaska where he excelled. During his Iditarod run, twice he also won the 1,000-mile Yukon Quest International Sled Dog Race between Canada and Alaska with only two weeks’ rest between races. But after the string of wins, he was beset by personal problems, health scares and drug issues that prevented him from ever again reaching the top of the sport. The treatment for his throat cancer cost him his saliva glands and ultimately disintegrated his teeth. He was then diagnosed with Raynaud’s syndrome, which limits circulation to the hands and feet and is exacerbated by the cold weather with which every musher must contend in the wilds of Alaska.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Democrat Katie Hobbs’ campaign announced Sunday that she would not debate Republican Kari Lake as the two battle for the governor’s office, calling off any negotiations with Lake and the state commission overseeing debates. The decision came after more than a week of efforts by Hobbs, currently secretary of state, to change the debate into separate half-hour interviews with the moderator. The Citizens Clean Elections Commission, which has held debates for two decades featuring candidates for statewide and legislative offices, flatly rejected that proposal Thursday. Instead, the commission urged its staff to work with Hobbs to come up with minor changes to the debate and gave her a week to come to an agreement. Hobbs’ campaign manager’s statements to the commissioners made it seem unlikely that a deal could be reached. Nicole DeMont instead repeated the campaign’s concerns that debating Lake would “just create another spectacle, like we saw in the GOP primary debate. But on top of that, I would just add, you can’t debate a conspiracy theorist, and at the last debate, she brought the conversation back to the 2020 election no less than a dozen times.” The GOP primary debate featured four candidates who almost immediately devolved into a free-for-all of talking over and constantly interrupting each other.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: The University of Arkansas-Fort Smith plans to use the donation of $18.7million, the largest in the school’s history, to improve both its nursing and art and design programs. The Windgate Foundation awarded UAFS the money after much discussion and a grant proposal requesting money to draw more students to those two fields. The $9.9 million reserved for nursing will bring in new students and faculty. After speaking with the Fort Smith medical community, Paula Julian, the executive director of nursing, said the area needs double the number of nurses it has. “This is the greatest nursing shortage of our lifetime,” Julian said. For nursing, officials have divided the money into two phases. In the first, Julian expects to hire more than 20 nursing educators. The second phase creates two new degrees, the associate degree of nursing and the RN-to-BSN pathway. Julian said that along with these new degrees, the school will offer classes at nontraditional hours such as evenings and weekends. The other $8.8 million of the gift is dedicated to art and design. Construction will begin next year on an expansion to the Windgate Building, with the new square footage to be partly used as studio space for faculty and students. The department will also expand the number of classes it offers, such as adding ceramics.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: An arson investigation is underway after fire destroyed a historic church in South Los Angeles early Sunday, authorities said. The blaze at Victory Baptist Church broke out shortly before 2:30 a.m. and quickly grew to major emergency status, said Nicholas Prange, a spokesperson with the Los Angeles Fire Department. Two firefighters were hospitalized with mild to moderate injuries after battling the flames, Prange said. One became trapped by a collapsing ceiling before being rescued, he said. The Los Angeles Times said Victory Baptist has played a major role in the spiritual and political history of South LA. Founded in a local storefront on Easter Sunday in 1943, the church moved into its current building on McKinley Avenue a year later. In the 1950s, its Sunday night services were broadcast on television nationally. The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke at the church in 1964. An arson team with the House of Worship Task Force was part of the investigation, officials said.\n\nColorado\n\nArvada: Authorities have arrested a suburban Denver man on suspicion of first-degree murder and other charges in the death of a 27-year-old police officer who was fatally shot while trying to break up a large family disturbance over the weekend. Sonny Thomas Almanza, 31, of Arvada, was arrested by police late Sunday in connection with the shooting death of Arvada Officer Dillon Vakoff, police said in a statement released Monday. Vakoff died at a hospital Sunday after being shot while he and another officer responded to the disturbance that spilled into a street outside a housing complex. He was the second Arvada police officer to be killed in the line of duty in two years. Almanza was taken into custody at a hospital, where he is recuperating from injuries sustained while exchanging gunfire with Vakoff and another officer early Sunday. He will be transferred to Jefferson County Jail when he is released from the hospital, the Arvada department said. Vakoff and his fellow officer had been dispatched to check on the well-being of two minor children when they encountered the disturbance, police said. A suspect opened fire, wounding a woman, at which point the officers returned fire, Police Chief Link Strate said at a news conference Sunday. The suspect then fired at Vakoff, Strate said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Sports fans won’t be able to place bets at Hartford’s XL Center until next spring. Officials told the Hartford Courant that delays in receiving crucial construction components due to global supply chain issues are to blame and that the project isn’t expected to be completed until at least March. It had been hoped the 4,000-square-foot sportsbook, featuring a bar and restaurant, would be open in time for the start of the NFL season this weekend. A main component delaying the project is a large glass wall that will overlook a major intersection and is expected to transform the building’s bunker-like appearance. “We’re groping along, frankly, because the window system is frustrating us,” Michael W. Freimuth, executive director of the Capital Region Development Authority, which oversees arena operations, told the newspaper. “We’re trying to keep going, but the wall system is going to delay us.” The state-financed, $4 million project was approved after lawmakers passed legislation legalizing sports gambling last year. The legislation called for the creation of sports betting venues at 15 locations. The XL Center hosts University of Connecticut men’s and women’s basketball as well as minor league hockey and concerts.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A report released Thursday once again underscored the need for the state to streamline its delivery of substance use services, expand collaboration of treatment within emergency departments and increase reimbursement rates for those treatments. Those were just some of the nearly 60 recommendations detailed in the study conducted by HMA Institute on Addiction, which was commissioned by New Castle County along with Kent and Sussex county officials to evaluate the landscape of addiction treatment in Delaware and target areas for improvement. The First State is not alone in its struggle to combat addiction and reduce overdose deaths, which skyrocketed amid the COVID-19 pandemic and have continued to plague communities across the country. There were 515 overdose deaths in the state last year – a 15% increase from 2020, which saw 447 deaths in Delaware, according to the report. There were 437 overdose deaths in 2019, state Department of Health and Social Services figures show.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Several Metro stations are operating under new names as of this week, WUSA-TV reports. The name changes, which will be reflected on signage and maps across the system, were approved by the Metro Board of Directors in December 2021. Travelers will see the changes immediately on digital maps throughout all rail stations and on bus displays, as well at the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority website and Trip Planner. The station previously known as White Flint is now North Bethesda. Largo Town Center has become Downtown Largo. Tysons Corner is now simply called Tysons. Prince George’s Plaza changed to Hyattsville Crossing, and West Falls Church’s secondary name, VT/UVA, is now VT only.\n\nFlorida\n\nDaytona Beach: A shooting scare at a central Florida high school was a “cruel prank” carried out by two groups of students who now face criminal charges and possible expulsion, police said. Rumors, lies and conspiracy theories have been “floating around” on social media since Friday’s lockdown at Mainland High School, Daytona Beach police said Sunday in a lengthy Facebook post. “This entire incident appears to have been a cruel prank by several students that has now gotten out of control due to internet trolls, misinformed people and in some cases, people that are not even in Florida,” police said. Investigators said officials at the school became aware of a threat written on a bathroom stall Thursday. School officials and law enforcement reviewed video and interviewed two students who had entered the bathroom around the time the graffiti was discovered. The students denied involvement, and it was determined that no threat existed, police said. On Friday, two groups of students in the cafeteria “decided to capitalize on the threat” and “appear to collaborate with each other to create a panic,” police said. They were seen on video “getting into specific positions and locations within the cafeteria, timing their actions,” and several female students told an administrator someone had a gun.\n\nGeorgia\n\nBrunswick: Fishermen, shrimpers and business owners dependent on coastal tourism have filed lawsuits over pollution caused when a cargo ship capsized off the Georgia coast in 2019. The two federal lawsuits filed last week say the pollutants released by the capsize of the Golden Ray and the harm caused by the subsequent salvage operation have damaged the area’s sensitive marine ecosystem – and the plaintiffs’ livelihoods. The South Korean-owned Golden Ray capsized with more than 4,200 automobiles in its cargo decks shortly after departing the Port of Brunswick on Sept. 8, 2019. The wreck occurred in the sound between St. Simons and Jekyll Islands. Removal dragged on for more than two years. The lawsuits accuse the companies connected to the shipwreck of negligence and of violating the federal Clean Water Act and the federal Oil Pollution Act, which was enacted in 1990 following the Exxon Valdez disaster. Plaintiffs are asking the court to order the companies to pay civil penalties, remediate the sound and award compensatory damages. “The Golden Ray was grounded near environmentally sensitive areas that serve as a unique habitat for a variety of species, including, but not limited to, shrimp, fish, migratory birds, crabs, and food sources for all marine life, including, but not limited to, fiddler crabs,” the lawsuits said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A new program at the University of Hawaii aims to offer more mental health services to Indigenous students. The COVID-19 pandemic hit Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander students particularly hard, HawaiiNewsNow reports, and a dearth of counselors with similar backgrounds and culturally relevant treatments has compounded the situation. Under the Ka Malu a Waʻahila program, the John A. Burns School of Medicine offers therapy, monthly group support and self-help tools at no charge, according to the news outlet.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A “Drag Kids” program slated for this year’s Boise Pride Festival prompted a wave of political pressure and anonymous threats. Festival organizers said they envisioned a short performance where kids could put on sparkly dresses and lip-sync to songs like Kelly Clarkson’s “People Like Us” on stage. But others, including Idaho Republican Party Chairwoman Dorothy Moon, expected a lurid scene where children would “engage in sexual performances with adult entertainers.” The event garnered national attention from far-right websites and podcasts, and by last Tuesday, organizers realized this wasn’t the “normal” amount of opposition, said the festival’s president, Michael Dale. Moon and the Idaho GOP sent out statements directing constituents to ask the festival’s corporate sponsors to pull support for this past weekend’s three-day event. The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare announced it was pulling $38,000 in funding and resources. A conservative pastor from California began rallying like-minded congregations, asking members to tell the Ada County Sheriff to arrest any festival organizer who “contributes to the delinquency of minors.” A group known for armed protests told followers to show up Sunday. On Thursday afternoon, festival organizers made the decision to postpone the kids’ performance. “We wanted to ask these kids first and foremost because it affects them and their confidence and their lives. And they still wanted to do it,” Dale said, fighting back tears. “But it came to be an issue of their health, their well-being, and that of the festivalgoers.”\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Democrats who run state government celebrated Monday while announcing that tax-rebate checks totaling more than $1.2 billion had begun heading to 6 million taxpayers. Rebates on income and property taxes are part of a $1.83 billion inflation-relief package built into this year’s budget. “Everyone knows inflation is a global problem with local consequences,” Gov. J.B. Pritzker said at a Chicago news conference. “Prices at the pump and at the supermarket have taken Illinois families on a roller-coaster ride over the past months. It’s exactly the kind of thing that responsible government should help our residents with and we have, starting today.” With eight weeks remaining before the November election, the timing is perfect for Pritzker, Comptroller Susana Mendoza, who shared Monday’s spotlight, and virtually every member of the General Assembly. Rebates will arrive by mail or direct deposit in the closing days of the campaign season, when voters make up their minds. Individual taxpayers making less than $200,000 will receive a $50 rebate, with $100 to couples filing jointly earning less than $400,000, Revenue Director David Harris said. Taxpayers will also receive $100 for claimed dependents, up to three. Property tax rebates will be equal to the amount a homeowner claimed as a credit on income tax returns last year, up to $300, Harris said.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Five women and a religious abortion-rights group filed a new lawsuit in Marion County on Thursday challenging the state’s near-total abortion ban on the grounds of religious freedom. Hoosier Jews for Choice and the five women – residents of Marion, Monroe and Allen counties – claim the ban violates the state’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The 2015 measure, signed into effect by then-Gov. Mike Pence, prevents the government from impeding someone’s religious exercise unless there’s a strong argument in favor of the state’s interest. The defendants in the case include members of the Medical Licensing Board of Indiana and prosecutors in five counties. The lawsuit says the belief that life begins at conception, which is widely shared by Christian anti-abortion advocates, “is not a theological opinion shared by all religions or all religious persons.” “For example, under Jewish law, a fetus attains the status of a living person only at birth,” the lawsuit says. “Jewish law recognizes that abortions may occur, and should occur as a religious matter, under circumstances not allowed by (the near-total abortion ban) or existing Indiana law.” That would include when an abortion could prevent a “mother’s mental anguish” from severe physical or mental health issues.\n\nIowa\n\nAltoona: The former owners and operators of Adventureland Resort have told a court that the family of the 11-year-old boy who drowned there in 2021 may have contributed to the deadly accident and its aftermath. That argument was part of a court filing last week by Adventure Lands of America Inc. in response to a lawsuit blaming the theme park for the death of Michael Jaramillo and injuries to members of his family. A raft carrying the family on the park’s Raging River ride overturned July 3, 2021, resulting in the drowning of Michael and severe injuries to his brother, who were trapped underwater for an extended period. Attorney Guy Cook represents the then-owners of the park, who have since sold the property to another operator. His filing denies key allegations of the family’s lawsuit alleging the accident was the result of mismanagement, neglect and safety violations under CEO Michael Krantz. In addition to saying the Jaramillos themselves may have been negligent or failed to appropriately “mitigate” the accident’s results, Cook’s response argues that the park complied with government regulations and that others – possibly including “government entities” – may have been the “sole proximate cause” of the tragedy. The response does not say what the Jaramillos allegedly may or may not have done to contribute to the accident.\n\nKansas\n\nOverland Park: A suburban Kansas City police officer who shot and killed a 17-year-old four years ago will not face civil rights charges, federal prosecutors announced Friday. John Albers was shot by officer Clayton Jenison after he backed a minivan out of his family’s garage in Overland Park in January 2018. Officers went to the home to check reports that Albers was posting threats to harm himself on social media. Albers’ parents were not home at the time. The Justice Department said its two-year investigation into the shooting found no evidence to contradict an earlier finding in a civil court that Jenison used unreasonable force in shooting Albers. However, federal law requires that investigators prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the officer “willfully” used unreasonable force, federal prosecutors said. Evidence gathered during the investigation “does not clear the high bar that the Supreme Court has set for meeting this standard, and the department has therefore closed its investigation into this matter,” federal prosecutors said in a news release. Jenison shot twice at Albers as he backed the van past him and out of the driveway, investigators said. When the van spun around to face the street and began slowly backing toward the house, Jenison fired 11 more shots. Albers was hit by six bullets and died at the scene.\n\nKentucky\n\nPaducah: Construction of the new U.S. 60 Cumberland River Bridge in western Kentucky will take a big step forward this week as crews plan to float a 700-foot steel truss up the river and install it, officials said. The truss was expected to float from Paducah to the construction site at Smithland, then be placed atop the main piers Monday through Wednesday, according to the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet. Security during the procedure will be tight, but a public viewing area will be available at the north end of the bridge construction site so people can watch the slow process of raising the truss and putting it into place, District 1 Chief Engineer Kyle Poat said. There will be lane restrictions on the existing Cumberland River Bridge while the truss is being installed. The $63.6 million project is expected to be completed next year.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Taxpayers have until Oct. 6 to claim millions in state income tax refunds before they become unclaimed property. The Louisiana Department of Revenue sent letters to 20,400 people and business taxpayers advising them to claim their refunds before they are transferred by law to the Unclaimed Property Division of the state treasurer’s office. More than $36 million in unclaimed refunds is due for transfer if not claimed, the department said in a news release. To claim a refund, taxpayers must complete and return to the revenue department the voucher in the Notice of Unclaimed Property letter dated Aug. 18. The department will issue paper checks to all taxpayers submitting completed vouchers by the October deadline. Any refund not claimed by the deadline remains the property of the taxpayer and can be retrieved from the Unclaimed Property Division.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A federal judge has denied a request from fishing groups that sought to challenge new fishing rules designed to protect rare whales. The lobster fishing groups wanted a federal judge to stop regulators from placing new restrictions on the harvest of the crustaceans. The rules are intended to protect North Atlantic right whales, which number less than 340 and are vulnerable to entanglement in fishing gear. U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg denied the request in a Thursday ruling. It’s the latest in a string of legal setbacks for lobster fishermen who are coping with increasingly strict fishing rules meant to save the whales. The Maine Lobstermen’s Association said in a statement that it was disappointed by the ruling, which it said “puts the future of Maine’s lobstering heritage at great risk, and along with it, the livelihoods of thousands of hard-working men and women.” Conservation groups have long pushed for stricter protections for the vanishing whales. Kristen Monsell, oceans legal director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement the ruling affirms “right whales can’t wait any longer for stronger protections from deadly entanglements in fishing gear.”\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: Offshore wind projects like those by US Wind and Orsted were boosted Wednesday as the Maryland Energy Administration added $1.6million to fund additional projects by emerging companies. The Maryland Offshore Wind Capital Expenditure Grant Program, a fund aimed at assisting new or existing emerging businesses entering the offshore wind supply chain in Maryland, will be awarded on a first-come, first-served basis for qualifying proposals until Jan. 1, 2023, or until all funding has been awarded. “Proposed projects must provide a positive net economic benefit to the state and local communities through job opportunities while encouraging diversity, inclusion and equity in their business operations. Proposed projects should also be designed to serve the larger U.S. offshore wind market and related industries,” the state energy agency said in a statement. Developments like MARWIN I and Momentum Wind by US Wind represent a projected 77 turbines 15 to 18 miles off the coast of Maryland and Delaware that are expected to turn out 1,864.5 megawatts of power for the state – enough to power 285,000 Maryland homes. The state regards the industry as a boon, bringing 12,000 direct full-time equivalent jobs, with both Baltimore-area and Ocean City-area port facilities seeing the windfall.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Voters will get the chance to decide whether the state should reject a new law allowing immigrants in the country illegally to obtain state driver’s licenses. The secretary of the commonwealth’s office announced late Friday that it had certified the signatures needed to put repeal of the law on the November ballot. The measure became law after the Democrat-controlled Massachusetts House and Senate overrode a veto by Republican Gov. Charlie Baker in June. With the override, Massachusetts joined 16 other states and the District of Columbia that have similar laws. The push to repeal the new law is being led in large part by the state Republican Party. The law was a win for immigrant rights groups that had long pushed for the measure, framing it in part as a public safety measure, noting that those seeking the licenses will have to show they can properly operate a car and get insurance in the event of an accident. Maureen Maloney, whose son Matthew Denice was killed in 2011 after being struck and dragged by a driver in the country illegally, is helping to lead the repeal effort and claimed the law hurts the integrity of state elections by creating a backdoor for noncitizens to vote. Backers of the new law say it will make the roads safer for everyone.\n\nMichigan\n\nYpsilanti: Striking Eastern Michigan University faculty members returned to their classrooms Monday, after their union reached an agreement with the university to end a walkout that started last week. University and union officials announced the tentative contract agreement Sunday night following weekend negotiations, but they didn’t immediately release the details. The university said a full class schedule would resume Monday at the Ypsilanti campus of more than 15,000 students about 35 miles southwest of Detroit, where several dozen faculty members started picketing Wednesday. The union represents more than 500 tenured and tenure-track faculty. The two sides had been split over salary increases and how much faculty members should pay for health care. Union leaders had argued that the school’s proposal would have saddled its members with thousands of dollars in additional costs. Union negotiating team chairman Matt Kirkpatrick, an associate professor of English language and literature, called the agreement “an important victory.” “We took a stand to maintain and strengthen quality education at EMU, and this agreement moves us forward,” Kirkpatrick said in a statement. The agreement would have to be ratified by the university’s board and union members to take effect.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Thousands of nurses in the state launched a three-day strike Monday, complaining of low salaries and understaffing worsened by the strains of the coronavirus pandemic. Some 15,000 nurses at seven health care systems in the Minneapolis and Duluth areas walked out. The affected hospitals said they recruited temporary nurses and expected to maintain most services. Picket signs went up and strike chants began at 7 a.m. outside 15 Twin Cities- and Duluth-area hospitals. The hospitals and the striking nurses said staff shortages are a shared concern. Minnesota Nurses Association President Mary Turner said pay raises are necessary to address the “crisis of retention” that would otherwise leave the hospitals severely understaffed. The hospitals have offered 10%-12% wage increases, but the nurses are seeking more than 30%. Hospital leaders called their wage demands unaffordable, noting that Allina and Fairview hospitals have posted operating losses and that the cost of such sharp wage increases would be passed along to patients. Union spokesman Sam Fettig said the nurses settled on a three-day rather than open-ended strike because of concerns about the impact of drawn-out labor action on patient care. “As the nurses always say, this isn’t something they want to be doing; they want to be at the bedside providing care,” Fettig said.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: As the city emerges from the depths of a crisis that made water unusable even for bathing, another is stacking up in piles of empty plastic bottles. The city has distributed hundreds of thousands of water bottles in the past six weeks. Churches, businesses and other groups have rallied to bring truckloads of water to the capital. In the state’s first week of aid, it distributed about 5 million bottles, Gov. Tate Reeves said Monday. Making things worse, the city ended its curbside recycling program in August 2019, saying the lack of interest and cost made it an impractical endeavor. Residents were referred to private recycling companies if they wanted to continue curbside service. Environmentality Recycling Solutions and Allen’s Recycling are among the private companies that pick up recyclables. Tri-Miss Recycling has drop-off points but does not offer curbside pickup, nor does it accept plastics. Derek Augustus, owner of Environmentality Recycling Solutions, said his company is working with Keep Jackson Beautiful to collect empty bottles at some water distribution sites. Keelan Sanders, executive director of Keep Jackson Beautiful, said the group already was working with the city and Jackson Public School District on exploring ways to bring back some sort of recycling program. “The water crisis has basically expedited what we’re trying to do because we saw the need, especially with all the water bottles we are being inundated with now,” he said.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Officers fatally shot a 16-year-old they say was reaching for a gun, police said Monday. Darryl Ross was shot just after 11:30 p.m. Sunday at a gas station on the city’s north side. Ross was Black. A police incident report said one of the officers involved in the shooting was Black, and one was white. The city’s new Force Investigation Unit, established last month, was handling the investigation. Police said two drug enforcement detectives spotted several people with guns at the service station and drove to the parking lot. Their car was unmarked, and they were in plain clothes but wearing black, bulletproof vests with the word “POLICE” written on the front and back. Ross, armed with a gun according to the police report, walked away quickly to an alley. The detectives followed him and announced they were police officers. Ross ran, then tripped and fell, dropping a pistol, police said. As the detectives approached, Ross reached for the pistol, the report said, prompting both officers to shoot him. Ross was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The officers were unhurt. It was the second fatal officer-involved shooting in St. Louis in less than a week. Officers killed a 61-year-old man last Wednesday at an apartment complex. Police said a man who had been evicted engaged police in a standoff.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A federal judge on Friday ordered the Biden administration to reinstate a drilling lease that has been in dispute for decades on land near the Blackfeet Indian Reservation that is considered sacred to Native American tribes in the U.S. and Canada. The 10-square-mile oil and gas lease in the Badger-Two Medicine area of northwestern Montana was first issued in 1982. It was canceled in 2016 under then-U.S. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell, at the request of the Blackfoot tribes and conservation groups. There have been efforts to declare the area a national monument or make it a cultural heritage area, and tribal leaders have bitterly opposed drilling in recent decades. But U.S. District Judge Richard Leon said Jewell lacked the authority to withdraw the lease so many years after it was sold and after several prior studies examined the environmental and other impacts of drilling in the area. He ordered Interior Department officials to reinstate the lease and issue a drilling permit to Solenex LLC, the Louisiana company that holds the lease. Leon issued a similar order in 2018 that was later overturned on appeal. The Badger-Two-Medicine is adjacent to Glacier National Park and is the site of the creation story of the Blackfoot tribes of southern Canada and Montana’s Blackfeet Nation.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A former police captain has prevailed in her lawsuit against Omaha Police Chief Todd Schmaderer and the city, having sued over allegations that the chief failed to promote her in retaliation for filing a discrimination complaint. A federal jury agreed Monday that Schmaderer based his decision, at least in part, to not promote Kathy Belcastro-Gonzalez to deputy chief in 2018 because of a discrimination complaint she made directly to the mayor’s office, the Omaha World-Herald reports. Belcastro-Gonzalez said in her lawsuit that she and another woman who was a lieutenant in the department filed separate complaints against the same male officer in 2010, describing the man as creating a hostile work environment for them because they were women. In 2017, the male officer in question was promoted to one of five chief deputy positions for which Belcastro-Gonzalez had also applied . That same year, Belcastro-Gonzalez went over her police superiors’ heads to complain to the mayor’s office after the earlier complaints about the male officer made through the chain of command went nowhere. During the lawsuit’s trial, two former commanders of the Omaha police internal affairs unit testified to irregularities they described as “very unusual” in the handling of Belcastro-Gonzalez’s and the other woman’s complaints.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Nevada State College won’t get a name change for now, despite a passionate plea from the school’s president, DeRionne Pollard. Pollard told the Board of Regents, the elected body of 13 that oversees the state’s public colleges and universities, that a name change to Nevada State University would have added value to the degree during a quarterly board meeting in Elko on Friday. She said that at schools across the country, the word “college” indicates a community college. The board voted to table the discussion until December so that more information could be gathered about what the name change could mean to state funding formulas including tuition and how staff are paid. Pollard said the name change wouldn’t change the school’s mission and would not compete with the research-driven campuses of the University of Nevada, Reno or UNLV. She said changing the name of the college to Nevada State University would have made a degree more valuable to the students, many of whom are the first in their family to go to college.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPortsmouth: After a successful first year, Oyster Week will return Sunday with a slate of events highlighting the state’s fastest-growing seafood industry. Half of New Hampshire’s 14 oyster farms will take part in events at local breweries and restaurants from Newmarket to Newington showcasing the state’s oyster harvest, which has grown by nearly 800% in value since 2013. “We really want to promote the oyster farmers and help their product,” said Kelsey Meyer, the coordinator for the New Hampshire Shellfish Initiative, which organizes the event. “It’s a local and very sustainable product.” The week will once again culminate with the second annual Seacoast Oysterfest on the deck at Bernie’s Beach Bar on Hampton Beach on Sept. 24. Along with live music, craft beer and cocktails, at least six different oyster farms will be on hand shucking their mollusks until they run out. The week kicks off Sunday with the annual Stone Church Oysterfest in Newmarket, which will pair oysters from Fox Point Oysters, Virgin Oyster Company and Rising Tide Oyster Co. with plenty of live music in the courtyard of the iconic music hall. On Sept. 21, Stoneface Brewing will unveil two new beers that were made with oysters from all the participating farms.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Two bills that expand and promote access to free meals for schoolchildren in middle-income households were signed by Gov. Phil Murphy on Friday as part of a response to food insecurity in New Jersey that was laid bare by the pandemic. Both laws will take effect during the next school year, starting in September 2023. The Working Class Families’ Anti-Hunger Act will provide free school breakfasts and lunches to those students that qualify. The second bill – which Murphy jokingly referred to as the “get the word out” act – builds upon an existing law that requires schools to create public education and promotion campaigns to inform families and communities about the availability of these programs. Both laws work to pick up after a pandemic-era federal program that provided universal free lunches in schools across the nation ended earlier this year. “There’s a stigma to receiving free food and lunch,” Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin said Friday at South Amboy Elementary School, where the announcement was made. “We are taking a big and important step today.” This would mean a saving of $1,260 in school meal costs for families, Coughlin said, saving them about 22% in overall food costs every year. About 26,000 more students would qualify for free meals, he said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Commercial cannabis sales in August grew by about $374,000 over July in data released Wednesday by the state’s Cannabis Control Division. Total sales topped $40 million for the second consecutive month, a high since regulated sales of cannabis opened for adults April 1. Meanwhile, tax data suggests the number of retailers sharing the market is growing much more quickly than the market for adult-use cannabis. Based on data from the state Taxation and Revenue Department, the number of cannabis retailers filing their taxes grew by 15%, while the revenue collected in excise taxes grew by just 2%. Total reported sales back in July topped $40.3 million, which had been the high point since the state opened sales of cannabis for adult use. In August, the total of medical and non-medical cannabis products was reported at $40.7 million, with a 2.1% drop in medical cannabis sales since July. Adult-use sales increased by 3% over the month. The top five cities, who also topped July sales, accounted for 61% of the total market in August: Albuquerque ($14.6 million), Santa Fe ($3.5 million), Las Cruces ($3.3 million), Hobbs ($1.7 million) and Rio Rancho ($1.6 million).\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Water at a public housing complex is OK to drink after earlier tests incorrectly showed the presence of arsenic, city officials said Saturday. A tweeted video showed Mayor Eric Adams and another official drinking glasses of water from a tap at the Jacob Riis Houses. Tests by an outside lab last month had showed higher than allowable levels of arsenic, but on Friday the company said the results were incorrect. Residents of the 1,700-unit complex on the Lower East Side had been told to avoid drinking or cooking with the water beginning last weekend. Adams said Saturday additional tests had confirmed the water was safe. “This morning, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene reviewed the final test results for contaminants and found the water to be well within EPA drinking water quality standards,” Adams said in a statement. “We can confidently say the water at Riis Houses is and has been free of any discernible amount of arsenic since the initial tests were initiated in August and meets EPA standards.” Adams’s office said the city would cease working with the lab, Environmental Monitoring and Technologies, and would “pursue all available legal options” and seek to reimburse residents for costs incurred during the past week.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Oral arguments over the constitutionality of the state’s photo voter identification law will be held next month, the North Carolina Supreme Court has decided in another ruling determined along partisan lines. In a 4-3 decision, the justices who are registered as Democrats agreed with attorneys for minority voters who had asked the state’s highest court in July to move the case along more quickly. These voters are plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed in December 2018, moments after the Republican-controlled General Assembly approved a photo ID law. That law has never been administered. A panel of judges held a trial, and in September 2021 a majority struck down the law, saying it intentionally discriminated against Black voters. Earlier this year, in a similar 4-3 decision, the justices agreed to hear the case, instead of waiting for the intermediate-level Court of Appeals to deliberate first. The plaintiffs wrote in July that an expedited argument date as soon as September would help state officials and voters “prepare for future elections without the risk of voter confusion and disenfranchisement.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A $4.2 million project to install metal poles with reflective markers along two-lane highways across the state has been put on hold because of worries about how the new poles affected farmers driving large equipment. The posts installed this summer along state highways with shoulders less than 8 feet wide will be removed as the Department of Transportation redesigns the project. State Sen. Janne Myrdahl, who complained about the problems the posts were causing farmers, said the hard metal posts will likely be replaced by flexible ones. “I’ve rarely heard about an issue more than I heard about that in two weeks,” Myrdahl told the Bismarck Tribune. Outgoing Transportation Department Director Bill Panos said in a statement that “it’s not uncommon to pause, reassess and implement design changes when new information becomes available.” It wasn’t immediately clear how the changes would affect the cost of the project that is being paid for with federal money.\n\nOhio\n\nMason: Kings Island has been named the park of the year by Amusement Today. The trade journal’s publisher and editor-in-chief, Gary Slade, selected the park for the Publisher’s Pick Award for Park of the Year because of its “important history and celebration of it, with its 50th anniversary event this summer, its excellence in providing record-breaking rides and its ongoing commitment to quality, maintenance and extreme safety in the amusement and theme-park industry,” Kings Island wrote in an announcement on its website. The local park was also a top finalist in four other categories, coming in second and fourth, respectively, for best new show for its “Fun, Fireworks and Fifty – A Kings Island Nighttime Spectacular” and “Phantom Theater Encore”; second for best kids’ area for Planet Snoopy; fourth for best guest experience; and fifth and sixth for best wooden roller coaster, for the Beast and Mystic Timbers. According to Kings Island, the Beast is one of only two wooden roller coaters to place in the top 10 every year in the more than 20 years of the Golden Ticket Awards from Amusement Today. Kings Island first opened in April 1972, as a new amusement park to replace the old Coney Island, which closed in 1971. It opened with five original themed areas, attractions and a number of rides, 11 of which still remain today.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: An inmate found dead in his jail cell over the weekend was a plaintiff in a lawsuit against the county alleging that in 2019, he and other inmates were tortured by jail employees who forced them to repeatedly listen to the children’s song “Baby Shark” for hours. John Basco, 48, was found unresponsive in his cell early Sunday morning, Oklahoma County Detention Center officials said in a news release. He was pronounced dead after jail workers began lifesaving efforts, they said. Basco’s death is the 14th this year at the jail, which has faced criticism over inmate deaths, escapes and other incidents. Jail spokesman Mark Opgrande said there were no obvious signs of foul play, and investigators will look into the possibility of a drug overdose. The State Medical Examiner’s Office will determine the cause of death. Basco, who was booked into the jail Thursday on a drug trafficking complaint, was among a group of inmates suing the county in federal court for allegedly being handcuffed to a wall and forced to listen to the song “Baby Shark” on repeat for hours during separate incidents in 2019. A jail lieutenant retired and two detention officers were fired in connection with the incidents, and all three face misdemeanor charges. Basco’s attorney, Cameron Spradling, said he found the circumstances surrounding Basco’s death “disturbing” and called for the preservation of all evidence as the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation probe of it unfolds.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Utility companies said Monday that they have restored power to tens of thousands of customers after shutting down service over the weekend to try to prevent wildfires during high winds, low humidity and hot temperatures. Both Portland General Electric and Pacific Power enacted planned power shutoffs Friday as high, gusting winds and low humidity moved into Oregon, posing extreme fire danger. The utilities were concerned that the winds would cause power lines to break or sag, making sparks that could ignite tinder-dry vegetation. Portland General Electric halted power to about 37,000 customers in 17 service areas starting Friday, and Pacific Power shut down service to 12,000 customers. Power shut-offs due to fire weather, common in California, are new to the Pacific Northwest. The strategy appeared to be successful, with no major new blazes over the weekend. Portland General Electric also fully restored power to all affected customers by Saturday evening, the company said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state’s highest court on Monday rejected a request from Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf that it immediately take up his challenge to Republican legislation that has bundled a constitutional amendment regarding abortion with four unrelated proposed changes. In turning down Wolf’s request, the justices said he was free to file a legal action before the lower-level Commonwealth Court. The amendments could go before voters as early as May. Wolf filed the legal action in late July, arguing that bundling together the measures in a bill before the politically divided Legislature violates a constitutional rule against passing laws that address multiple, unrelated topics. The proposed abortion amendment would say the state constitution does not guarantee any rights relating to abortion or public funding of abortions. The other amendments would require voter ID, have gubernatorial candidates choose their own running mates, enable lawmakers to cancel regulations without facing a governor’s veto and set up election audits. The two chambers, both with Republican majorities, voted mostly along party lines to advance the package of five amendments. If the General Assembly passes them again in the session that starts in January, they will go before voters as five separate referendums in the May 16 primary.\n\nRhode Island\n\nEast Providence: A nonprofit plans to build an LGBTQ-friendly apartment building for low-income older adults. Four years ago, when Jodi Glass joined the board of Aldersbridge, a nonprofit that runs health care centers for older adults, she had already been working on an issue close to her heart: care of the aging population of LGBTQ people. “Elder LGBTQ folks, they don’t have children as they do now in the younger generation, and their support systems are more lateral,” she said. The idea of a better support system for older members of the queer community started percolating for Glass 15 years ago. When she joined Aldersbridge, formerly known as United Methodist Elder Care, her project gained momentum and direction as she helped form the policies, trainings and procedures to deter discrimination in assisted living and nursing homes. Glass and Aldersbridge CEO Rick Gamache had a bigger, bolder plan in mind: building an income- and age-restricted apartment complex to serve aging members of the LGBTQ community. With a little luck, a little help from the city of East Providence and the right timing, Glass’s vision is set to become a reality as Aldersbridge and the nonprofit housing developer One Neighborhood Developers try to build a 39-unit building as part of the sprawling, 390-unit East Point housing project in East Providence, on the east bank of the Seekonk River. The apartment building will consist of studios, 1-bedroom and 2-bedroom apartments on the 27-acre property. Gamache said their building will be the first of its kind in Rhode Island.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state Department of Corrections will offer a new digital tracking service to support addiction therapy for inmates in the state’s main prison for women. Eligible inmates will report their substance use, cravings and triggers on a smart device, and counselors will use the results to inform their therapy sessions. The $159,840 program is funded by the S.C. Department of Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse Services. Pear Therapeutics Inc. said its program is the first of its kind in a U.S. prison. “We are excited to begin this cutting-edge treatment for our female inmates who suffer from addiction,” SCDC Director Bryan Stirling said in a press release. The Camille Griffin Graham Correctional Institution will offer the FDA-authorized tracking software as a 90-day treatment intended to increase abstinence and boost participation in cognitive behavioral therapy programs. Safety warnings say the devices are designed to work alongside existing medications and in-person clinical contact. A prison spokesperson, Chrysti Shain, said incarcerated people will still receive the therapy required by federal regulators. When used outside of prisons, the digital therapeutics can incentivize users through nonmonetary rewards and retail gift cards. Behind bars, participants will earn digital badges and rewards including “increased canteen spending, homework passes, increased tablet time, no duties or chores,” according to Shain.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem asked a state ethics board to dismiss a complaint against her without a public hearing and to seal off certain records, documents released Friday by the state’s Government Accountability Board show. The Republican governor, who is widely seen as eyeing a 2024 White House bid, argued in an April motion that the state’s then-attorney general, a fellow Republican who filed the complaint, was out for political retribution and should be removed from the complaint. Noem had pushed former Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg to resign and later for his impeachment over his involvement in a fatal car crash. The attorney general’s complaint was sparked by a report from the Associated Press last year that Noem had taken a hands-on role in a state agency. Shortly after the agency moved to deny her daughter, Kassidy Peters, a real estate appraiser license in July 2020, Noem held a meeting with Peters and key decision-makers in her licensure. Days after the meeting, Peters signed an agreement that gave her another opportunity to meet the licensing requirements. The South Dakota Legislature’s audit committee, controlled by Republicans, unanimously approved a report in May that found Noem’s daughter got preferential treatment.\n\nTennessee\n\nKnoxville: The University of Tennessee is hosting a sustainable transportation forum and an electric vehicle summit in November, and registration is now open, officials said. The Drive Electric Tennessee initiative will host the first DriveElectricTN Momentum Summit on Nov. 7 at the Knoxville university’s student union, state officials said in a news release. Then, the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, the Tennessee Department of Transportation and the Tennessee Clean Fuels Coalition will hold the Tennessee Sustainable Transportation Forum & Expo on Nov. 8-9 at the student union, officials said. Research, technology, planning and policy developments to be shared at the forum will aim to improve transportation efficiency, reduce vehicle emissions and address mobility needs, officials said. Speakers and panelists at the forum will address topics such as alternative fuels and advanced vehicle technologies, mobility and transportation justice, and the intersections of transportation with public health and emergency response, among other issues, officials said. The DriveElectricTN Momentum Summit will focus on transportation electrification efforts and include breakout sessions on community outreach, electric vehicle infrastructure, policies and programs, and innovation, officials said.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: State child-abuse investigators are still pursuing families with transgender children and, in at least one case, have expanded the investigation beyond Gov. Greg Abbott’s ordered scrutiny of gender-affirming medical care, a new court filing says. The filing included affidavits from two mothers who, using pseudonyms to protect their families from harassment, described the devastating effect the child-abuse investigations have had on their children. One, 13-year-old Steve, was pulled out of class Aug. 30 and questioned by a state child-abuse investigator, leading to anxiety attacks and missed classes, disrupting his education and upending hard-won improvements to his mental health, mother Carol Koe wrote. “This is extremely upsetting given he has been doing so well in school this year, both socially and in his classes,” she wrote. The other, 14-year-old Whitley, has never received gender-affirming medical care, but the Department of Family and Protective Services has declined to close its investigation after more than six months – and instead added a new requirement, telling mother Samantha Poe on Aug. 25 that investigators wanted proof that Whitley is well-adjusted.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A professional bull rider was killed overnight Monday in what police are calling a domestic violence homicide. Demetrius Omar Lateef Allen, who went by the name Ouncie Mitchell as a pro bull rider, was found shot outside an apartment complex in Salt Lake City, police said in a news release. Allen, 27, was taken to a hospital, where he died. Police arrested LaShawn Denise Bagley, a 21-year-old woman, on suspicion of murder. Bagley and Allen had been in a relationship. Allen had come to Utah to attend the state fair and was staying with Bagley. The two got into a fight at a bar, and Allen went to Bagley’s apartment to get his things, where he was shot, police said. Bagley was booked into jail. No charges had been filed as of Monday afternoon. It was unknown if she had an attorney. Sean Gleason, commissioner of Professional Bull Riders, said in a statement that Allen is the same person who goes by the name Ouncie Mitchell. He said the organization was saddened to find out about the death of a rider who had become a familiar face on the PBR Velocity Tour and competed in the Bill Pickett Invitational Rodeo. He was from Fresno, Texas, according to his bio on the PBR website. “Ouncie got his name because he was born small,” Gleason said. “He grew up to compete with a huge heart.”\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The University of Vermont announced Tuesday that it will build 295 apartments in South Burlington over the next four years to alleviate the school’s housing needs. UVM will partner with local developer Snyder-Braverman to build “Catamount Run” in South Burlington’s City Center. Students and employees at UVM can look forward to the first 100 apartments being completed by summer 2024, another 65 units by summer 2025 and another 130 units by 2026. The apartments will hold nearly 500 beds. A tight job market and tighter housing market have some Vermont employers creating employee housing. “This initiative will increase access to housing within close reach of campus, primarily for students in our graduate and professional programs and for the talented employees we are attracting to UVM and the Greater Burlington area,” UVM President Suresh Garimella said in a press release. “The university expects this project to help address the housing shortage that poses real challenges to nearby communities.” Garimella said he had repeatedly heard from students, staff and faculty that they were having to look farther and farther away for housing because of the extremely low supply in the Burlington area.\n\nVirginia\n\nPortsmouth: The Portsmouth Humane Society is letting the dogs out. A new program called Paws Around P’Town pairs shelter dogs with community members for daylong field trips to the beach, a park or even a person’s couch, The Virginian-Pilot reports. Alison Fechino, executive director of the Portsmouth Humane Society, said she hopes the program will emphasize that helping shelter pets is possible for everyone, including those with a busy schedule. “It helps us by, first of all, getting the dogs out of their cages,” Fechino said. “And it gives them the one-on-one time they deserve.” Anyone who’s at least 18 can participate. Individuals can select a dog after reviewing its documented personality traits, or shelter staff can work to find the right fit. One recent Saturday, Suffolk residents Cassie and Hailey Caldwell picked up Morgan, a 5-year-old female pit bull mix, for a day of fun. The mother and daughter cannot have animals where they live, so weekend trips are a great way for them to enjoy time with some furry friends. They said after grabbing a “pup cup” of whipped cream for Morgan, a trip to the beach or a local park was on the itinerary. Amanda McQuarry, the shelter director, said 70 is the maximum number of dogs the facility ideally can support, but 90 is the absolute cut-off. The shelter has reached 90 this summer, but the program has alleviated some of the burden the staff experiences.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A running dispute over LGBTQ-related policies took a dramatic new turn Monday at Seattle Pacific University. A group of students, faculty and staff at the Christian university sued leaders of the board of trustees for refusing to scrap an employment policy barring people in same-sex relationships from full-time jobs at SPU. The 16 plaintiffs say the trustees’ stance – widely opposed on campus – is a breach of their fiduciary duties that threatens to harm SPU’s reputation, worsen enrollment difficulties and possibly jeopardize its future. The lawsuit, filed in Washington State Superior Court, requests that the defendants – including the university’s interim president, Pete Menjares – be removed from their positions. It asks that economic damages, in an amount to be determined at a jury trial, be paid to anyone harmed by the LGBTQ hiring policy. “This case is about six men who act as if they, and the educational institution they are charged to protect, are above the law,” the lawsuit says. “While these men are powerful, they are not above the law… They must be held to account for their illegal and reckless conduct.” The Free Methodist Church, a denomination whose teachings do not recognize same-sex marriage, founded SPU in 1891.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Lawmakers were scheduled to convene at the state Capitol outside of their regular session Monday to discuss putting millions of dollars into road maintenance and creating a new industrial plant program within the state economic development office. The new special session is set to begin more than a month after the Republican supermajority failed to reach consensus on a sweeping bill that would have barred access to abortions in most circumstances. A version of the bill passed the House, but it stalled after the Senate adopted its own version with amendments, one of which removed criminal penalties for physicians who perform illegal abortions. Instead, delegates asked for a conference committee to iron out differences. Republican Gov. Jim Justice put out a call Saturday for another special session beginning at 1:30 p.m. Monday, while lawmakers are gathered in Charleston for previously scheduled September interim committee meetings. He asked lawmakers to consider legislation that would establish a “Certified Industrial Business Expansion Development Program” within the Department of Economic Development. It would be charged with encouraging the development and construction of high-impact industrial plants “in certain circumstances where the availability of electricity generated from renewable sources is demonstrated to be necessary,” according to Justice.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and Republican challenger Tim Michels announced Monday that they have agreed to debate just one time ahead of the Nov. 8 election. The debate will be Oct. 14, hosted by the Wisconsin Broadcasters Association, held in Madison and broadcast statewide. Both campaigns put out a joint statement announcing the agreement. The debate will include journalists from across the state, according to the statement. “There are plenty of differences between the two candidates, but we agree that voters deserve this opportunity to hear directly from each candidate,” Evers’ campaign manager, Cassi Fenili, and Michels’ campaign manager, Patrick McNulty, said in the joint statement. “This will be the only debate between the candidates before the November election.” In 2018, Evers debated then-Gov. Scott Walker twice in October. Michels, co-owner of construction company Michels Corp., participated in two televised debates with his Republican challengers this summer. One was in a traditional debate format, and the other was a town hall where questions came from people in the audience. Michels also did a radio debate with former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch and state Rep. Timothy Ramthun.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A legislative committee is considering a controversial bill that would allow public inspection of some personnel files in K-12 schools. The Joint Education Committee is considering that more drastic step and another piece of legislation as lawmakers try to address harassment and bullying allegations against teachers, WyoFile.com reports.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/columnists/mike-kelly/2017/07/26/turning-point-holy-land/510007001/", "title": "Turning Point In the Holy Land", "text": "As has happened so often in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, there have been moments when the rest of the world thought a breakthrough for peace was near. The year, 2006, was one of those moments. Israel had scheduled important elections and one of the key issues was the possibility that Israel would finally agree to permanent borders. But that possibility also included the hope that the Palestinians would finally make concessions as well on issues of terrorism and the development of the West Bank, as well as questions about compensation or the “right of return” to property that was lost by Palestinians in the 1940s. None of these hoped-for concessions came to pass. Columnist Mike Kelly, along with staff photographer, James Anness, explored many of these issues in a series.\n\nApril 2, 2006\n\nTerrorist has No Regrets\n\nAttack that Killed Teaneck woman was business as usual\n\nBEERSHEBA, Israel -- The killer smiled at the mention of the young woman from Teaneck.\n\nYes, he knew of Sara Duker. And, yes, he conceded, she was an innocent bystander -- \"her bad luck,\" as he put it -- on a Jerusalem bus that was blown up by Hamas terrorists 10 years ago.\n\nBut Hassan Salameh, the Hamas mastermind who recruited the suicide bomber and assembled the massive bomb that killed Duker, her fiancé Matthew Eisenfeld of West Hartford, Conn., and 24 others on that bus, was not about to apologize or show a hint of regret for the lives he destroyed.\n\nInterviewed for 90 minutes in a maximum-security Israeli prison at the edge of the Negev Desert, Salameh, now 34 and serving 46 life terms for orchestrating a series of terrorist attacks a decade ago, symbolizes a fundamental obstacle in the complicated politics of Israel and the Palestinians, experts say.\n\nSo much of that political journey has been framed by violence -- often with suicide bombers, recruited by zealots such as Salameh, who were trained in Iran and then returned to Israel, Gaza and the West Bank to orchestrate terrorist attacks. With that sort of legacy, how can both sides negotiate, especially with Hamas now in power in the Palestinian government and Iran openly talking about building nuclear weapons?\n\n\"None of these terrorists shows any remorse,\" said Reuven Paz, an Israeli terror expert. \"They are proud of what they do.\"\n\nPaz analyzed Salameh's confession to Israeli police and later testified in a federal lawsuit in Washington in which Duker's family and others were awarded millions of dollars in Iranian funds.\n\n\"Nobody here is talking about peace with Hamas,\" Paz added. \"It's so far away and so unrealistic.\"\n\nSalameh presents a more immediate security problem.\n\nIsraeli officials disclosed that he is being held in an isolated section of Beersheba's Eshel Prison because a year ago he tried to organize another suicide bombing in Israel from his cell.\n\n\"We're talking about a high-profile terrorist with a lot of blood on his hands,\" said Lt. Col. Ian H. Domnitz of Israel's prison service.\n\nAs he shuffled to a room to be interviewed by The Record, the 5-foot-5 Salameh was escorted by two guards and wore handcuffs and leg shackles. He passed through a metal gate, then crossed a sun-splashed prison lobby decorated with paintings of Samson, David and Goliath, Moses and other biblical characters.\n\nSalameh sat down, smiled and announced he would agree to be interviewed only if his handcuffs were removed. A guard removed the cuffs. Salameh spoke in Arabic, which was then translated into English.\n\nBut at the mention of Sara Duker's name, he needed no translator.\n\nHe nodded, then acknowledged he had first heard of Duker when FBI agents interviewed him about terrorists who killed Americans.\n\n\"She wasn't the target,\" Salameh said. \"She was there. We don't really think about who is being killed. Our main objective is opposition to Israel. That was her bad luck that she was on the bus.\"\n\nAppearance deceiving\n\nAs a terrorist, Salameh can seem unassuming at times. He smiles readily and speaks in a lilting pitch, even trading jokes with prison guards.\n\nBut the facts of his life paint a very different image.\n\nBorn in a refugee community in the Gaza Strip in 1971, Salameh joined Hamas in 1992, according to his Israeli police confession, a copy of which was obtained by The Record and translated from Hebrew.\n\nIn mid-1995, Hamas' military wing recruited Salameh for special training, sending him first to Syria, then to the Sudan and finally to Iran.\n\n\"We trained in weapons, setting explosives, ambush,\" Salameh said of his time in Iran. \"We had 10 instructors, all Iranians. We also learned how to lay mines. We worked with Iranian rifles, Uzis ... and large machine guns. We shot Berettas and other arms. We learned how to take apart mines and learned all about throwing different kinds of grenades.\"\n\nBack in Gaza, Salameh plotted his first suicide bombing - on Jerusalem's No. 18 bus. The date: Feb. 25, 1996, a Sunday.\n\nThat morning, Sara Duker, 22, who had graduated nine months earlier from Columbia University's Barnard College and was now studying at Jerusalem's Hebrew University, got up early and met her fiancé, Matthew Eisenfeld, a 25-year-old old rabbinical student and Yale graduate. Around 6:30 a.m., they boarded the No. 18. Also getting on at their bus stop were an off-duty Israeli police officer and a Palestinian man carrying a large gym bag.\n\nThe gym bag held more than 20 pounds of explosives taken from land mines that Salameh and his team of eight other Hamas operatives dug up along the Egyptian border with Israel. The mines were made in the United States and given to the Egyptian military.\n\n\"We had somebody who knew how to identify explosives,\" said Thomas Fay, one of several lawyers representing the Duker family in its lawsuit against Iran. \"As best we could tell, the explosives were manufactured by a company in the Cincinnati area.\"\n\nDuker and Eisenfeld planned to take the No. 18 to Jerusalem's central bus station, then catch another bus to an archaeological site in Petra, Jordan.\n\nAs the No. 18 pulled up to the intersection of Yafo Street and Sarae Yisrael Street, the Palestinian man set off a detonator in his gym bag. The resulting explosion blew debris and body parts more than 100 yards.\n\nDuker and Eisenfeld died of severe burns to their lungs, autopsy records show.\n\nTwo months later, Israeli authorities caught Salameh. After his conviction in an Israeli military court, the judges had a choice: life in prison or the rarely used Israeli death penalty. One judge recommended death two opted for life in prison.\n\nDays of boredom, prayer\n\nSalameh said he gets up each day at 4:30 a.m., prays and then reads the Koran. After that, he is allowed to go alone for an hour into a 4-yard-wide exercise area with concrete walls on three sides -- his only time outside his cell. Back in his cell, he showers, watches TV - mostly Al Jazeera, an Arabic news channel, he said -- and spends the rest of the day sleeping, praying, reading and eating.\n\nBecause he tried to organize suicide bombings from prison, he is not allowed any family visitors. But he does receive money -- the equivalent of about $65 a month from his family and from Hamas, prison officials said. He said he uses some of it to subscribe to an Israeli newspaper.\n\nSalameh said his targets in the bus bombing on Feb. 25, 1996, were Israeli soldiers. But he also acknowledged that no soldiers were riding the bus that morning.\n\nThis led to the only segment in the interview where he came close to admitting any sense of regret.\n\n\"Sometimes when you make a suicide attack, mistakes can be made,\" Salameh said.\n\nThen was Sara Duker's death a mistake?\n\n\"I can't say that it was a mistake. That was her bad luck. In our world, sometimes there are mistakes.\"\n\nSo do you regret killing innocent civilians?\n\n\"You look at the picture in a different way than I do,\" Salameh said. \"You speak about emotions and feelings. The subject is a lot bigger and complicated than you make it.\"\n\nHe went on to say that he believes his brand of terrorism is justified by the Koran. But asked to point to a single passage in Islam's holy book that justified the killing of innocent civilians, Salameh admitted he could not find one.\n\nMoments later, he angrily added: \"You don't care about my people. You ask only about the Americans who were killed.\"\n\nSeeking compensation\n\nBack in Teaneck, Sara Duker's mother, Arline, said she was not surprised to hear of Salameh's intransigence.\n\n\"The most disturbing thing is not about Hassan Salameh,\" said Duker, a psychotherapist and mother of two other grown daughters. \"It's this belief system that is tied to a religious fanaticism.\"\n\nArline Duker said she is directing most of her energies to ongoing legal actions seeking to collect hundreds of millions of dollars from Iran.\n\nAmong those joining Duker in the lawsuit is Stephen Flatow of West Orange, whose 20-year-old daughter, Alisa, was killed by a suicide bomber in Gaza on April 9, 1995. Flatow said he, too, was not surprised by Salameh's lack of remorse.\n\n\"If he gives up on that belief, if he weakens, he has to confront what he did,\" said Flatow, a Jersey City attorney.\n\n\"We're not surprised,\" Matthew Eisenfeld's father, Leonard, a pediatrician, said of Salameh's attempt to justify the murders. \"This is a long-term effort on how we address terror and this different mindset. Hassan Salameh symbolizes that.\"\n\n\"It's difficult to think we can't reason or debate,\" added his wife, Vicki.\n\nFor his part, Salameh said he realizes he will probably die in prison.\n\n\"I knew the cost,\" he said.\n\nHe also said he does not worry about going to heaven when he dies.\n\n\"It's decided by God,\" Salameh said. \"I did what was allowed by God.\"\n\nToday, on a sidewalk near the Jerusalem intersection where Sara Duker and Matthew Eisenfeld died and across from a plaque bearing their names, sits a memorial, made of steel from the bombed bus.\n\n\"Fear shall not win,\" the memorial's Hebrew inscription says. \"In good and bad, all of us together.\"\n\n\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n***\n\n\n\nApril 2, 2006\n\nGaza short of everything except despair, bitterness\n\nStrip becomes fertile ground for terrorism\n\nGAZA CITY, Gaza Strip -- As \"martyrs\" kept watch, Nahed Abu Khair kept selling pants.\n\nIt was almost noon in Al Saha Plaza, and Khair was well into his daily struggle for customers amid dozens of other sidewalk merchants. He scanned the teeming crowd, then looked again toward billboards rimming the plaza, with their photos of Palestinian suicide bombers and others killed fighting Israelis.\n\nThe faded photos -- and politics behind them -- did not interest him right now, Khair said. He just needed a customer or two to feed his wife and eight children that night. But few stopped.\n\n\"I have no future,\" he said. \"I fear the future is passing away.\"\n\nAlmost eight months after Israeli troops evicted Israeli residents from Gaza's settlements and two months after the Hamas terrorist group swept a majority of seats in the Palestinian Legislative Council, the bitter billboard reminders of war in this tattered city go hand in hand with a growing bitterness of people trying to scratch out a living. If ever there was a tinderbox for terrorism, the narrow Gaza Strip may be it -- with Gaza City and its 400,000 inhabitants at the epicenter.\n\nExperts point to a potent mix of fundamentalist Islamic theology and no-way-out poverty as the lethal elixir here. Such disparate organizations as Human Rights Watch, the World Bank and the CIA all portray a crumbling city that could turn into a killing zone in the next few years.\n\nA visit last week revealed a city already with empty grocery shelves, uncertain electrical power, fears of unclean drinking water, rotting piles of garbage and hundreds of unfinished buildings, their windows open to birds, blowing sand and the homeless.\n\nFew traffic lights work, and each intersection is a day-long knot of cars, trucks and donkey carts merging from all directions.\n\nCar horns bleat continuously. And on many evenings now, Gaza residents hear a new sound: the thump, thump of Israeli artillery targeting launch sites of Palestinian Qassam rockets, which are regularly fired across the border by Palestinian militants at nearby Israeli towns.\n\nWith few playgrounds, children dart in and out of traffic. And with fewer construction jobs for thousands of laborers and tighter controls on workers trying to get into Israel, almost every street corner is home to clusters of sullen, unemployed men, Lucky Strike and Viceroy cigarettes dangling from their lips.\n\nFor Israel, the relationship between violence and the 1.4 million Palestinians clustered in the Gaza Strip is hardly new. Stretching like a sandy finger between Israel and Egypt, 21 miles long by six miles wide, the strip has been a terrorist thorn in Israel's side for years, exporting suicide bombers and now launching rockets at non-military targets in Israeli border towns.\n\nA few hours after Khair was trying to sell pants, Palestinian fighters launched Qassam rockets at Israel's Kibbutz Carmiya. The missiles hit a soccer field, only hours after children played there, Israeli officials said. One man was wounded, a 15-year-old girl was treated for shock and a parked car was damaged.\n\nThe Israeli army answered with artillery, the boom-booms coming every few minutes during the Gaza City rush hour as Israeli gunners tried to pinpoint the launch sites and ordinary Gazans went about their work.\n\nThe next day, a massive car bomb exploded in downtown Gaza City, killing a leader from the Popular Resistance Committee, a Hamas rival. Hours later, after the Israeli military denied any involvement, a brief gunbattle broke out between competing Palestinian militias.\n\nFew jobs, little hope\n\nThe violent litany -- rockets, artillery, car bombs, gunfights -- underscores just how dangerous Gaza has become amid so much random, unpredictable violence.\n\n\"There are a lot of guns and weapons in Gaza,\" said Scott Lasensky of the U.S. Institute for Peace, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. \"But it has the capability of being much more unstable.\"\n\nOne of the most turbulent factors is the lack of jobs -- and the daily struggle by ordinary people trying to scratch out a living.\n\nWith Israel, the United States and other nations saying they will withhold funds from the Hamas-led government, the World Bank issued a report last month predicting that Gaza's unemployment would rise to nearly 40 percent this year and personal income would fall by 30 percent. On Gaza's streets, amid the emotional fallout from the bleak economy, such predictions are already coming true.\n\n\"I work from dawn until night,\" said Khair, the pants seller. \"I'm doing what I can. But I keep feeling depressed.\"\n\nHe ran a hand over the stack of Chinese-made baggy jeans, stacked neatly on a table in Al Saha market, then wiped a sweaty film from his forehead. From a minivan parked at a nearby curb, a man with a bullhorn pleaded for donations to a mosque.\n\n\"My time is gone,\" Khair said. \"I'm hoping for a better future for my kids.\"\n\nHe is only 43.\n\nSuch sentiments seem common now in Gaza.\n\n\"Welcome to 'Gaza Planet,' \" Osama Damo, a 27-year-old counselor for the Palestinian Youth Association, said as he rode through the city's center in a car and gazed at walls covered with political graffiti touting Hamas or the names of suicide bombers.\n\nThe Gaza Strip has already bred dozens of suicide bombers, and Damo worries more are coming.\n\n\"Disappointment, depression, sadness, anger, hatred -- they're all common,\" he said as he recalled a young man who became suicide bomber.\n\n\"I still remember his words. He told me, 'Dying once and for all is better than living every day here.' \"\n\n\"Young people feel caged in, waiting to die,\" Damo added. \"Their dream is to leave -- to Canada, New Zealand, Australia, the United States. They want to wash dishes in New Zealand, not stay here.\"\n\nDignity and dreams\n\nAcross town, amid the narrow alleys of the Shati refugee camp, Hatem Magadma sat in a plastic chair in his kitchen. Outside, a group of boys swatted a handball near a wall mural commemorating nine suicide bombers who once lived in the neighborhood. Green Hamas flags hang from nearby telephone poles, along with a few blue flags from Islamic Jihad.\n\nMagadma is 42 and already the father of nine children. His tiny home of cinderblock walls and a corrugated steel roof has only two bedrooms.\n\nFive daughters crowd into one bedroom at night, he said. He and his wife sleep in another. His four sons sleep on sofa cushions on a concrete floor in a living room that has no other furniture. For hot showers or to wash dishes, the family burns wood in a firebox beneath a rusty steel cylinder that holds water.\n\nMoney is tight, Magadma said. But on a recent afternoon, he proudly described how he now selectively eliminates some of his favorite luxuries.\n\n\"I don't buy apples or bananas,\" he said.\n\nMagadma said his mother and father came to the refugee camp in 1948, leaving their home just across the border as Israelis battled Arab armies to establish a Jewish homeland after World War II. Like many Palestinians, Magadma dreams of returning to his home in Israel, even though the Israeli government says such an influx of Palestinian refugees would be disastrous for the Jewish homeland.\n\n\"Being a refugee is my dignity,\" he said. \"Life is like a pyramid. There are ways to go up and ways to go down. We don't give up.\"\n\nMagadma's son, Adnan, 21, said one of his friends had lost hope and became a suicide bomber. But he said he has no intention of following in his friend's footsteps.\n\n\"I'm angry,\" he said. \"But depression and giving up means death. Life is hope.\"\n\nAnd what does he dream for?\n\n\"That I'm married and I'm employed,\" he said.\n\nOn another block, Othman Taleb, 54 and the father of 14, said he, too, hopes to return to his family's home in Israel. His wife, Lamia, 50, added, \"The Jews don't want peace.\"\n\nLeaning against a doorway and listening, Lamia's nephew, Hani Kaskin, nodded.\n\nIn terse, angry bursts of words, Kaskin described how much he hates Israelis and how proud he is to serve as a member of the Islamic Jihad security force, a paramilitary group considered a terrorist group by the U.S. and Israel.\n\n\"I'm not afraid to die,\" he said. \"This is my desire -- to die. God promises that one who dies for him is to be in the highest level of heaven.\"\n\nKaskin then turned and left.\n\nAs he walked along a narrow alley, he said he would like to spend his life as a teacher. But the pull of violence is often too great. As an Islamic Jihad gunman, he said, he has participated in several recent skirmishes with Israeli forces.\n\n\"I can't guarantee my life,\" he said. \"I could be killed at any time.\"\n\nWith that, he walked away.\n\nBulldozed factories\n\nOn another side of town, only a block from a park commemorating \"unknown soldiers\" of the Palestinian resistance, Fouad el-Samnah walked into his gleaming office.\n\nEl-Samnah, whose brother Jamil is a North Bergen dentist, is one of Gaza City's most successful businessmen, with a string of small factories that produce corrugated roofing, pipes, cellular towers and heavy steel, concrete-mixing containers. But in recent years, el-Samnah has run into problems that few American industrialists could ever imagine: Three of his factories were bulldozed by the Israeli military, who suspected he was making rockets or allowing Palestinian snipers to take up positions behind his factory walls.\n\nEl-Samnah, 58, denied the Israeli charge that his factories produce rockets or provide cover for snipers. Instead, he claims he lost $2.5 million when the factories were knocked down.\n\n\"I know how to make money,\" he said. \"I do make money. Why would I make rockets and jeopardize my business?\"\n\nHe got up and headed to his car, followed by his 25-year-old son, Ibrahim.\n\nMinutes later, after a speedy dash through Gaza City's teeming streets and narrowly missing several head-on crashes, el-Samnah stopped at two of the damaged factories he is rebuilding. Sunlight still poured through bullet holes. Cracks ran up cinderblock walls. A row of broken steel-pressing machines sat lifeless.\n\n\"All broken,\" he said, running his hand over one machine. \"All. All. All.\"\n\nHe then turned to head out the door, patting a young Palestinian neighborhood boy on the head.\n\n\"I have a will,\" el-Samnah said. \"Let us show you the will of the Palestinian people.\"\n\nHe got into his car again and headed the third damaged factory on the outskirts of the city. He is not rebuilding this factory -- not yet. The damage is too great.\n\nAfter knocking down cinderblock walls, Israeli military bulldozers dug a hole and buried the factory machines and rubble.\n\n\"I don't cry, but I cried when this happened,\" el-Samnah said.\n\nHe grew silent, his eyes looking over the concrete slab.\n\n\"We know how to build,\" his son said. \"We know now to keep standing.\"\n\nEl-Samnah nodded.\n\nIt was almost sunset. El-Samnah pointed to a row of olive trees that farmers planted in freshly dug ground next to his former factory site.\n\nHe smiled.\n\n\"Look at the olive trees,\" he said.\n\nSuddenly, from beyond a hill a mile away, Israeli army artillery battery fired again, the shells streaking across the evening sky toward suspected launch sites for Qassam rockets on the other side of the Gaza Strip.\n\nEl-Samnah did not look up, didn't flinch at the artillery boom. He walked to a corner of his property and kicked a piece of twisted steel that had once held a portion of the roof of his factory.\n\n\"The Palestinians could lose everything except our will,\" he said.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 30, 2006\n\nClinging to a hostile land, guns on hips\n\nHebron Jews say they’d defy eviction plans\n\nHEBRON, West Bank - Residents of the tiny Jewish enclave in this sprawling Muslim city have a way of demonstrating their toughness.\n\nThey point to bullet holes from Palestinian snipers, who have killed several residents, including a baby.\n\nOn Wednesday, as Hebron's Jews gathered to commemorate the shooting death of 10-month-old Shalhevet Pass in March 2001, many also spoke of dodging another kind of bullet: a political shot from Israel's government.\n\nIsrael's Kadima party, fresh from Tuesday's narrow victory in Knesset elections, again trumpeted a plan calling for the possible removal of about 60,000 Jewish residents from West Bank settlements, possibly Hebron's. But without knowing yet whether they will be ordered to move, Hebron's well-armed Jewish community of 90 families is already drawing a line in the sand of their ancient city.\n\nThey're not going anywhere.\n\nIndeed, if there is a potential flashpoint in what some Israeli leaders fear could be a border war, pitting Jews against Jews, Hebron could be a spark. At the center is David Wilder, who grew up in Cresskill and is now one of Hebron's Jewish leaders.\n\n\"Are we concerned? Of course,\" Wilder said Wednesday of the possible pullout plan, which has been extensively discussed by Israeli's politicians but is still well short of specifics.\n\n\"Nobody is going to get up and walk out on their own. If we run away from Hebron, no one is safe. If we run away from Hebron, the Arabs will keep running after us.\"\n\nWilder pledged that Hebron's Jews would \"resist\" any order from Israeli authorities to move out. He would not say whether they would take up arms against Israeli soldiers sent to remove them, though he left open that possibility.\n\n\"I'm not going to say what we would do,\" said Wilder, who goes about town with a 9mm semiautomatic pistol strapped to his waist. \"I'm not going to say if people will get their Uzis and M-16s and shoot.\"\n\nBut one of Hebron's rabbis, Israel Schlissel, was more emphatic Wednesday.\n\n\"We will do everything we can, including resisting,\" said Schlissel, whose father-in-law, Rabbi Schlomo Raanan, was stabbed to death by a Palestinian several years ago.\n\nWill Schlissel fight Israeli soldiers who come to evict him?\n\n\"Certainly,\" he said. \"We are not willing to give up.\"\n\nThat Hebron's Jewish community is even discussing the possibility of battling Israeli soldiers to stay in their homes is ironic. For years, Israel has assigned more than 2,000 soldiers to protect Hebron's 675 Jews from Palestinian militants.\n\nAt the same time, the possibility that Israel's leaders are even contemplating the removal of Jewish residents from Hebron is deeply ironic, too.\n\nThe city's Jewish roots rival those of Jerusalem. Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob are buried in Hebron, along with Jewish matriarchs, Sara, Rebecca and Leah. And David was anointed as Israel's king in Hebron.\n\nThe city, which is home to 150,000 Palestinians, has become one of the West Bank's most militant towns -- and the scene of horrific violence on both sides.\n\nIn 1980, six Jewish students were shot to death and 20 wounded by Palestinians. In 1994, a Jewish physician and settler, Baruch Goldstein, walked into the Tomb of the Patriarchs and opened fire on worshipers, killing 29 Muslims and wounding 125 others before survivors beat him to death.\n\nIn recent years, Palestinian snipers have peppered Jewish homes with bursts of gunfire. As a result, almost every corner of the Jewish enclave now has a concrete bunker or steel guardhouse for soldiers. Some roofs support military watchtowers.\n\nAdding to the tension is the presence of the Hamas terrorist organization. In January's Palestinian elections, Hamas candidates won all nine of Hebron's seats in Palestinian Legislative Council.\n\nOther West Bank towns have quieted in recent years, but gunfire is still a part of Hebron's daily soundtrack.\n\nJust after 10 a.m. on Wednesday, two gunshots rang out from a hillside overlooking the city's Jewish homes. An hour later, two more shots were fired near the Tomb of the Patriarchs and Matriarchs.\n\n\"It's not an easy place to live,\" Schlissel said as he turned toward the sound of the shots.\n\nAt a nearby guard post, two soldiers armed with M-16s looked up a hillside, too, but saw nothing.\n\nMinutes later, a blue bus pulled up with visitors -- its flanks protected by armor plating paid for with donations by Congregation B'nai Yeshurun in Teaneck. As the soldiers scanned nearby Palestinian homes for the source of the gunfire, the visitors toured an archeological excavation that featured walls, a home, and a stairway dating to the days of Abraham.\n\nIn a way, the scene was emblematic of Hebron. The city is steeped in history. It is also steeped in horror. Bullet holes from Palestinian guns riddle walls of homes of many Jewish residents, windowsills, a soldiers' water cooler -- even a book of kosher rules inside Wilder's apartment.\n\n\"We're not afraid,\" Wilder said, pulling the book from its shelf and pointing to a hole the size of a dime. \"We're getting used to it.\"\n\nDownstairs, in a courtyard outside a school, six boys played a pickup game of soccer. Beyond a chain-link fence, Israeli soldiers kept watch over nearby Palestinian homes from a watchtower. Also guarding the boys, from the edge of the courtyard, was math teacher Israel Ben Aharon, a 9mm handgun on his hip.\n\n\"You don't know when they are going to shoot at you,\" Aharon said of Palestinians.\n\nWilder walked up, smiled at the boys kicking the soccer ball back and forth.\n\n\"Some people ask how we can bring up a child in such an environment,\" he said. \"How can you not? Kids here grow up with ideals. We believe the children here are the Jewish leaders of tomorrow. These kids aren't made of plastic.\"\n\nNor are the children completely isolated from the world. Thirty minutes after the pickup soccer game ended, the boy gathered with other students to watch a partial solar eclipse.\n\nTo Wilder and other residents, the Jewish presence in Hebron carries deep religious significance today. Hebron is not just a place where Abraham and other key Jewish figures happened to live. The city's ancient Jewish community was one of the taproots of Judaism, he said.\n\n\"If you take a tree and chop off its roots, what happens to the tree?\" he said.\n\nIn a nearby apartment, Shelli Karzan, 45 and a mother of five children, said her apartment has been fired on from three sides in her 21 years in Hebron.\n\n\"You can hear them bouncing off the walls,\" she said of Palestinian bullets.\n\nKarzan, who grew up in Chicago, said she once poked her head out a window in a room that now holds her computer, only to have a bullet whiz by and ricochet off a wall. Another time, she looked out her kitchen window and saw two of her neighbor's sons wounded by gunfire -- one hit in the hand, another in the stomach.\n\n\"We're not going to have peace,\" she said.\n\nShe won't move, though.\n\n\"We're staying here,\" she said. \"I believe this is our land, and this is God's plan for us. It's manifest destiny.\"\n\nStill, the possibility that Israel will pull back its borders and allow for the creation of a Palestinian nation worries her -- especially if Hebron is in the middle of that nation.\n\n\"I don't think a Jewish community in a so-called Palestinian state would have a chance of surviving more than a few hours,\" Karzan said. \"If I'm afraid of being murdered, then I will run away. What can you do?\"\n\nLater, in the basement of an apartment house, Wilder opened a door into Hebron's murderous past. On a stone wall were a set of black-and-white photographs of the 67 Jews who were murdered during Palestinian riots in 1929.\n\nOne after another, Wilder pointed to photos naming each victim and told how he or she died.\n\n\"The same mindset that existed then exists today,\" he said of the Palestinians.\n\nOutside, it was hard to tell. What's immediately noticeable to visitors in Hebron is that neither side talks to the other, not even casually. It's almost as if they live in separate universes.\n\nOn a nearby street, five Palestinian men passed Israeli soldiers and said nothing. Neither did the soldiers.\n\nAs Wilder walked down a street, two Palestinian women passed. They said nothing to Wilder he said nothing to them.\n\n\"When they shoot at you for so long, it's not like a scar,\" he said. \"It's an open wound.\"\n\nNot far from Abraham's tomb and its massive walls, erected 2000 years ago by Israel's King Herod, Wilder opened another door -- to a synagogue.\n\nThe synagogue was built in the 1500s by Jews who escaped from persecution in Spain. Years later, it was ransacked by Muslims. In recent years, Hebron's new Jewish community has restored it.\n\nWilder walked in and stood in silence for a moment.\n\nEverybody could be living somewhere else, under conditions that are much better,\" he said. \"But this is part of you and your religion. I wouldn't change anything.\"\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 29, 2006\n\nNeighbors, not enemies\n\nModel community points way to peace\n\nNEVE SHALOM, Israel - The voting station looked like hundreds of other polling places, from the Galilee hills to the Negev desert. There was an Israeli flag, a blue ballot box and a team of election officials.\n\nBut Election Day in this tiny Israeli town midway between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv was significantly different from what it was in the rest of the nation: Jews and Arabs voted together.\n\nThere were many places in Israel to measure the emotional significance of Tuesday's pivotal Knesset elections. But one of the most unusual was this model community on a lush hillside where the coastal plain rises into the Jerusalem hills.\n\nHere, Jews and Arab citizens of Israel not only live in the same town, they are allowed to move in only if they promise to participate in programs aimed at finding common ground and working out their differences.\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, Neve Shalom -- Hebrew for \"Oasis of Peace\" -- did not support the victorious Kadima Party, which is trumpeting a plan to set up a security border to separate the Palestinian-dominated West Bank from the Jewish homeland.\n\n\"We tend to go for liberals, even communists,\" Rita Boulos, a Palestinian Christian, said after dropping her ballot into a box at the town's community center.\n\n\"We are trying to live together,\" she added. \"We don't always succeed. You don't have to be in love with everyone here. You just have to understand and respect them.\"\n\nThere is a Sixties, utopian-commune feel to Neve Shalom. As voters trickled to the community center, they walked past a rack of pamphlets that advertised such things as holistic therapy. Later, the day's gossip was not about politics, but about a possible concert this summer by Roger Waters of Pink Floyd fame.\n\nThe laid-back style is deceiving, though. The town takes great pride in not only organizing programs for residents but in reaching out to others to spread its message. One of its chapters is in Mount Laurel, in Burlington County.\n\n\"We are doing something unusual,\" said Elan Frish, 58, one of the town's original Jewish residents. \"We are pioneers. This is a model for the country. Arabs and Jews can live together.\"\n\n\"We chose a different way of life,\" Frish's 23-year-old daughter, Adi, said. \"There is a lot of prejudice in Israel from both sides. The rest of the country doesn't think like us.\"\n\nFounded in the 1970s by a Roman Catholic Dominican brother, the town's charter calls for equal numbers of Jewish and Arab residents. It now has about 25 families from each group, with Arab families almost evenly divided between Christian and Muslim. In keeping with the inclusive attitude, many residents not only recite the town's Hebrew name when saying where they live, but go out of their way to include an Arabic translation as well -- Wahat al-Salam.\n\nOn road signs, however, Israel's government just sticks with the Hebrew name. Indeed, the town's mayor said no Israeli prime minister as ever visited his community, even though it has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize and praised by such luminaries as Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel.\n\nIndeed, at times, Israel's government has been a bit befuddled by Neve Shalom.\n\nThe town's elementary school has both Jewish and Arab students. Even in Israeli towns with substantial Arab populations, most Jewish and Arab students attend separate public schools.\n\nAnd when Neve Shalom applied for government agricultural funds to help pay for its sheep farm, the town ran into a not-so-small bureaucratic wall: Was this an Arab farm or a Jewish farm? Israel's Agriculture Ministry maintained separate funding for farms run by Jewish and Arab citizens.\n\nNeve Shalom residents often chuckle in recounting such moments in their town's history. But those moments underscore a fact of life: The town is so different from the rest of Israel that citizens on the outside have a difficult time understanding it.\n\nHere, Arab and Jewish children not only study in the same classrooms, they play on the same soccer field and swim in the same community pool.\n\n\"Our country is for Jews and Arabs, and both peoples have to live together,\" said Ahmed Hijazi, a 39-year-old Muslim. \"The diversity enriches us.\"\n\nIf there is a dividing line, it's dating among singles. Residents say that while Arab and Jewish young people may attend dances together, few go on dates and none have married outside their ethic group.\n\nResidents say town meetings are a mix of the political and the pedantic. Sometimes, they exchange views about such hot-button topics as how the Israel government is building fences and walls in the West Bank to separate Jewish settlements from Palestinian villages. At other times, though, discussions focus on how loud residents are playing their stereos.\n\n\"What we have is a community of good intentions,\" Mayor Rayek Rizek said.\n\nRizek, 53, a Palestinian Christian, runs a cafe and gift shop just across the parking lot from the town's community center. As residents stopped by to vote, he played a CD of sitar music over outdoor speakers.\n\nFor years, Rizek said, the town was so focused on balance and ensuring no group dominated that Arab and Jewish candidates alternated running for the one-year mayor's term: only Jewish candidates one year and only Arabs the next.\n\nBut eventually, such balancing seemed forced. Rizek said all residents now can run for mayor.\n\n\"We try to open up all the questions,\" Rizek said. \"We cannot avoid the difficult questions.\"\n\nPerhaps one of the thorniest, however, does not involve Neve Shalom but Israel in general: Should the town's residents, many of whom are peaceniks, serve in the Israeli military -- a national obligation for most citizens.\n\nOri Sonnenschein, 22 and Jewish, was living in Princeton only a few years ago while his father, a physicist, worked at a research lab. When he returned to Neve Shalom, the army called.\n\nSonnenschein, an industrial design student, enlisted, but opted for a non-combat unit. Looking back, he said his army experience helped him focus on Neve Shalom and why the community's way of life is so valuable in prompting its residents to think about how they get along with others who are different.\n\n\"Most people don't know people on the other side,\" Sonnenschein said. \"They might see them in the market, but they never meet.\"\n\nAs he stood outside the voting center, Shay Saar, 25, said it's rare that Arabs and Jews in Israel find any common ground.\n\n\"Maybe they are afraid to connect,\" Saar said.\n\nAs he spoke, an army helicopter flew overhead -- a reminder of the high counterterror alert throughout Israel on Election Day and how the problems of Arabs and Jews are not small. But after the helicopter passed, a rooster's crowing filled the silence.\n\nSaar looked across the parking lot outside the town's community center. In the center of the lot was a garden with an olive tree.\n\n\"We need more of these places,\" Saar said.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nMarch 28, 2006\n\nTeaneck émigrés could be on the wrong side of fence\n\nIsraeli election may shut West Bank enclave\n\nMITZPEH YERICHO, West Bank -- Rabbi Mordecai Weiss breathed in the cool desert air and fell silent for a moment.\n\nStretching for miles, as if painted on a massive canvas, the brown, treeless Judean hills rolled like ocean swells toward the Jordan River Valley. On the horizon, the Dead Sea glimmered like a silver puddle in the morning sun.\n\n\"It's definitely not Teaneck,\" Weiss said.\n\nAfter today's Israeli elections, it might not be Israel, either.\n\nIsrael's quirky voters go to the polls for what is considered a referendum on whether to keep long-established settlements such as Weiss's inside new national borders or on the other side of a proposed border fence -- and in the hands of a future Palestinian state and its terror-linked Hamas leadership.\n\nFor Weiss, who left a high-profile synagogue post in Teaneck three years ago to move his wife and 10 of their 11 children to this West Bank settlement of roughly 250 families, the prospect of living in a hostile nation is hardly easy to comprehend. Just as difficult is the prospect of having to move again.\n\n\"The elections are going to tell us a lot,\" Weiss said Monday. \"We're more optimistic, but that's how the people in Gaza felt also.\"\n\nLast summer, as part of a similar plan to firm up Israel's southern border and fence off a large Palestinian community, Israel closed its Gaza Strip settlements and removed 7,000 residents. Israeli soldiers had to drag many protesting settlers from their homes.\n\n\"Our community has been here 28 years,\" Weiss said. \"Those in Gaza were there 30 years. So it can happen.\"\n\nVote on pullback\n\nIsrael's dominant political party, Kadima, proposes pulling back the nation's West Bank borders as a security measure to protect the area's 190,000 Israelis against Palestinian attacks. The party leadership has declared today's elections to be a national plebiscite on the plan.\n\nThis is not good news for Weiss and the 60,000 Israelis who live in West Bank settlements outside Kadima's proposed borders. Every major Israeli election poll indicates Kadima may win handily.\n\n\"The 60,000 settlers on the other side of the fence could become bargaining chips,\" said David Makovsky, director of the Project on the Middle East Peace Process for the Washington Institute.\n\n\"Everybody is concerned,\" Weiss said of his community, Mitzpeh Yericho, which is about halfway between Jerusalem and the Dead Sea.\n\nDriving through its winding streets Monday, Weiss pulled over and offered a ride to a neighbor, Elka Etzion, who was raised in Mitzpeh Yericho and stayed after getting married and taking a job as a teacher's aide at a local elementary school. The talk quickly turned to the election -- and a possible border fence.\n\n\"It's been very difficult, because we don't know what will happen,\" said Etzion, 22. \"I've been here 21 years. I love this place. It's where I plan to raise children. We hope nothing will happen. But people don't know where we would live.\"\n\nThat kind of conversation is common in Mitzpeh Yericho and in other settlements. Unlike some West Bank residents who parked trailers illegally atop mountains and dared the army to evict them, Weiss and his neighbors followed government procedures in setting up their homes. Not only did they have full approval of Israeli authorities: In Weiss's case he even received a $2,000 government grant to help finance his spacious eight-bedroom home, which features a swimming pool and olive and mango trees.\n\nBut what seemed like firm support only a few years ago now seems shaky all over the West Bank.\n\nLiving in uncertainty\n\nTwenty miles away in Beit El, Yedidya Atlas, whose parents live in Teaneck, said he, too, is not happy with the proposed border fence.\n\n\"A lot depends on who you talk to and who is drawing the maps, but as a rule, we're on the wrong side,\" he said of the long-established settlement.\n\nIn Mitzpeh Yericho on Monday, the Weiss household carried on as if it were just another day. Eight of the children still live at home the three oldest live on their own.\n\nJust after 6:45 a.m., 11-year-old Mendel and 8-year-old Shimon headed for the kitchen and fetched bowls of cereal. Chana, 6, hugged her father. Weiss's wife, Ellie, carried the family's youngest, 2-year-old Nechama, downstairs for breakfast. In the basement, Yaakov, 19, stayed in bed nursing a throat infection.\n\nMendel, cereal bowl in hand, took a seat near a window that looked south to an ancient Jerusalem road that passed over a stone bridge built more than 2,000 years ago by Roman invaders.\n\nDoes he miss Teaneck?\n\nMendel nodded.\n\nStanding next to his son, Weiss gazed out the window in silence for a moment.\n\n\"I loved Teaneck, but look at this,\" he said. \"We had a friend who came in from Teaneck, and he said I'm looking at a movie set.\"\n\nBack in Teaneck, Weiss, a member of the Lubavitch branch of Orthodox Judaism, was the rabbi of the Chabad House. He was also something of a neighborhood fixture, known for his fast-paced morning walks up and down Larch Avenue, often while reading a newspaper.\n\nBut Weiss and his family wanted to be closer to their Jewish roots.\n\n\"It's the ties to the land,\" Weiss said. \"It's one of the reasons I enjoy praying with the people here. The land is our foundation.\"\n\nThe Mitzpeh Yericho Web site explains that the ancient Hebrews first passed through the nearby hills after crossing the Jordan River for the first time after their long flight from Egypt. Joshua's army passed nearby on its way to conquer Jericho.\n\nThe Weisses quickly settled into their new town.\n\nTale of adaptation\n\nYaakov joined the Israeli army. Mendel became a star player and earned rookie-of-the-year honors in an Israeli youth baseball league. This summer, two sons and a daughter plan to marry -- and stay in Israel. Another daughter, also in Israel, is pregnant with the couple's third grandchild -- all this with Weiss only 47 and his wife, Ellie, only 44.\n\nBut all that is now overshadowed by the border plan.\n\n\"I don't know what's going to happen,\" Ellie said as she brushed Chana's hair.\n\nHer husband tried to keep an optimistic outlook.\n\n\"You've got to have a long-range vision,\" the rabbi said. \"Two years ago, my son was walking on Cedar Lane in Teaneck. Now he's in the Israeli army. To live here, you have to have a long-range vision.\"\n\nBut maintaining that vision isn't easy.\n\nAs breakfast ended, the rabbi herded the children into his minivan for the trip to school. The school's principal, Rabbi Berachya Boas, said many students had become so upset after seeing Gaza residents dragged from their homes last year that teachers now avoid class discussions about borders and possible fences near their settlement.\n\n\"It's a very uncomfortable feeling,\" Boas said of the possibility that the community will find itself outside Israel's new borders. \"It takes away stability.\"\n\nLater, on a drive to visit a friend who lives in a temporary trailer at the edge of a high cliff in Mitzpeh Yericho, Weiss pondered the beauty of his new community and how his future may be affected by what happens when today's polls close.\n\nHe remembered his walk with Ellie earlier that morning and the sparkling of the morning star and the moon against the sky. Then, he squinted into the sun again, toward the Jordan Valley and the Dead Sea.\n\n\"The light always changes during the day,\" he said. \"And when it rains, we get rainbows.\"\n\nHe paused at the thought, then smiled. His new home was definitely different from North Jersey, he said.\n\n\"We don't have any leaves to rake,\" he said, falling silent, then smiling yet again at a wish that seemed to come from straight from his Jersey roots.\n\n\"If anything changes here, hopefully my property taxes will go down.\"\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nMarch 27, 2006\n\nGetting past Arafat\n\nPalestinians want end to regime’s corruption\n\nRAMALLAH, West Bank -- Roudina Basher just wanted directions to get home after a day of shopping.\n\nBut as she stood on a sidewalk near a torn and faded poster of dead Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and reflected on his tattered legacy, she yearned for another kind of direction: a reversal of the Arafat regime's corruption.\n\n\"A lot of those people stole money,\" she said.\n\nThe accusation is hardly flippant -- or unimportant to Israelis, who will go to the polls Tuesday in what many here call a referendum on whether to give back more West Bank land to the Palestinians.\n\nFor years, Israeli leaders accused the slippery Arafat of dishonesty. They depicted his governing style as a cross between mob boss and Third World dictator, squirreling away millions in Swiss banks and ignoring such basic governmental needs as filling potholes and picking up garbage.\n\nNow Palestinians, who rejected Arafat's Fatah party in January elections in favor of the terrorist-linked Hamas organization, are pointing fingers at what he left behind.\n\nThe blame seems to echo everywhere in Ramallah, the hub of Palestinian culture and politics in the rolling hills 10 miles north of Jerusalem. You hear those echoes amid the strawberry and kumquat vendors that ring Manara Square, in the tiny grocery stores on Nablus Road and especially in government buildings now occupied by Hamas.\n\nAt his offices on Ramallah's south side, Dr. Mahmoud al Ramahi, the new Hamas secretary general of the Palestinian Legislative Council, said his staff already has discovered 35,000 no-show jobs under the Arafat regime.\n\n\"We don't know where the money went,\" al Ramahi said in an interview with The Record. He chuckled when asked to describe Arafat's legacy.\n\n\"It's difficult,\" he said.\n\nAl Ramahi, an Italian-trained anesthesiologist who once visited New Jersey for a medical convention, served three years in an Israeli jail in the early 1990s for his Hamas links. He said the Israeli occupation of the West Bank remains a major \"external challenge\" for his government and for Palestinians, but other concerns also are priorities.\n\n\"The biggest challenges are the internal issues -- the corruption,\" he said.\n\nThis is not to say Hamas is a model of good government. And it is not ready to offer an olive branch to Israel.\n\nEven though Hamas has had a cease-fire in effect with Israel for more than a year, it declines to change its charter, which calls for the Jewish state's destruction. Indeed, at several points in the interview, al Ramahi declined to renounce terrorism, including suicide bombings.\n\n\"The suicide bombings were the reactions against what Israelis do,\" he said. \"The Israelis were shelling houses, killing children and women. Until Israel's occupation of the West Bank is over, the resistance is legitimate.\n\n\"We are the victims,\" al Ramahi added. \"We have to continue the resistance. We said that until the occupation is over, the resistance is legitimate.\"\n\nThat resistance, he said, is a \"political and armed struggle against the Israeli army -- not only the army, but the settlers\" in West Bank communities.\n\nAgainst such refusals to renounce terrorism, the party's attempt to root out corruption may seem odd. It's not, experts say.\n\n\"Hamas leaders are extremely shrewd,\" said Christopher Hamilton, a former FBI counterterrorism agent who studies Hamas for the Washington-based Institute for Near East Policy.\n\nHamilton said that while many Hamas operatives are \"crazy irrational extremists,\" he also found a growing number focused on establishing a well-run government as a way of solidifying their power base.\n\n\"Look for the guys who are going to be the pragmatists,\" Hamilton said.\n\nRoudina Basher, 36 and a mother of three, is clearly looking for such leaders.\n\nFor years under Arafat and his Fatah Party, it was convenient to blame the Israelis for every problem in the West Bank. Now, with Arafat dead and his Fatah cronies humbled by Hamas' \"change and reform\" platform in recent elections, Palestinians like Basher are asking the same basic questions voters everywhere ask.\n\nWhy don't traffic lights work? Can't someone fill the potholes? Why don't Palestinians have better schools and hospitals?\n\n\"We need peace, we want peace,\" Basher said. \"But we need change in our government, too. People in our government were stealing far too much money.\"\n\nIn his office down the hall from al Ramahi's at the Palestinian Legislative Council, where he now directs training for new workers, Iyad Mohamed, 29, said he initially took a government job under Arafat because he \"wanted to work for my country.\" He quickly became disappointed, though.\n\n\"There was much corruption,\" Mohamed said.\n\nAnd now?\n\n\"We have to improve the skills of the workers here,\" he said.\n\nOne possible place to start might be at Manara Square.\n\nAs the afternoon traffic swarmed in from five different streets, police Officer Ismail Abu Awad spun on his heels, kicked the air, flapped his arms, twirled his hands in circles -- indeed, almost every motion possible to get cars to stop. But after 30 minutes, he was clearly frustrated.\n\n\"No one is paying attention,\" he said.\n\nDrivers simply pushed ahead, oblivious to the police officer who was trying to stop them -- albeit with definitely unconventional gestures. Pedestrians, meanwhile, merely smiled and strolled into traffic as they watched Awad.\n\nA block away, Dina Abdel Hamid, a Venezuelan Muslim who lives in a nearby village, watched the traffic and frowned when asked about the new Hamas government.\n\n\"We haven't seen any changes yet,\" she said.\n\nSeveral blocks away on the grounds of Arafat's old headquarters -- the Muquata -- not a single person visited his grave during a 30-minute stretch at midday Saturday. Meanwhile, construction workers busily assembled frames for a new mausoleum, prayer hall and museum.\n\n\"More people will come when this is done,\" a police officer said.\n\nSeveral blocks away, at the edge of what once was known as \"Martyr's Crossroads,\" where Palestinian children often threw rocks at Israeli soldiers and Palestinian gunmen sometimes fired at the Israeli settlement of Beit El, grocery store owner Tariq Musleh tried to make sense of Arafat.\n\n\"He's gone to God,\" Musleh said, pausing and smiling. \"Maybe now we'll have change.\"\n\nAround a corner, at a new shopping center, Samer Freitekh tried to think ahead, too.\n\n\"Our dream is to have a country,\" he said. \"But there was no vision for the Palestinian people. When there is no vision, people think only of the past. As we all know, the past is past.\"\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nMarch 26, 2006\n\nA divided family mirrors a divided land\n\nMOUNT HORESHA, West Bank -- The Temple Mount in Jerusalem is not the only hill where people of faith are divided by politics during Israel's election season.\n\nThirty-five Jewish families live illegally in trailers atop this desolate mountain. They are preparing to fight their government over plans to give back West Bank territory to Palestinians.\n\nFor Zimra Siegman Schlessinger, formerly of Teaneck, the fight is even more personal. The question of giving back land won in the 1967 Six-Day War has divided her extended family.\n\nOn one side is Schlessinger, 35, a mother of two sons and three daughters, with another child due in two months. On the other is her uncle, Henry Siegman, a former executive director of the American Jewish Congress who now runs the U.S. Middle East Project for the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nWhile Schlessinger was settling into her mountaintop trailer home recently to protest giving back land, her uncle was meeting in Lebanon with representatives of Hamas, the terrorist group that swept into power in January's Palestinian elections.\n\n\"He's going in the opposite direction,\" said Schlessinger, the daughter of Siegman's brother. \"Jews versus Jews - that's a very difficult issue for all of us.\"\n\nReached by telephone in Paris, Siegman sighed at how Israel's divisive politics had widened the split in his family.\n\n\"We haven't spoken in many years,\" he said sadly of his brother and niece.\n\nWhat Siegman and Schlessinger are experiencing reflects in some ways the sort of divide now running through Israel.\n\nOn the question of whether to return more land to Palestinians and reign in Israel's borders, polls show Israelis are divided almost down the middle.\n\nSchlessinger reflects one extreme, Siegman another.\n\nSchlessinger believes Israel should continue to plant settlements throughout the West Bank and certainly not give back any land. Siegman believes Israel should not only negotiate with the Hamas-led Palestinian government, but give back enough land so Palestinians can have a sizeable nation of their own.\n\nLast August, Schlessinger, an English teacher whose husband is a full-time Torah student, was evicted from a home in the Gaza Strip by Israeli soldiers in preparation to turn over the land to the new Palestinian government. She remembers the day well.\n\nFirst, her husband was carried out and put on a bus. Then her children were taken - with her youngest, a 2-year-old girl, running around the dining room table in an attempt to escape.\n\nThe soldiers then took Schlessinger.\n\n\"I was kicking,\" she said. \"It took eight soldiers to carry me out.\"\n\nMonths later, she moved to Mount Horesha, knowing she might be evicted again.\n\n\"I live in something which is unfortunately called an illegal settlement,\" Schlessinger said. \"But I feel a responsibility as a Jew to settle anywhere in Israel.\"\n\nShe considers Israel to include all of the West Bank, which many devout Jews refer to by the biblical names of Judea and Samaria.\n\nSiegman favors creating a Palestinian state in the West Bank -- and more. He favors dismantling many illegal settlements like his niece's.\n\n\"The most important factor in Israel's needed security is a successful Palestinian state,\" he said.\n\nThat means a Palestinian state without small communities of West Bank Jewish settlers who consider it a slap in the face of their covenant with God to leave the West Bank -- or even the Gaza Strip last August.\n\nSchlessinger disagrees.\n\nShe won't single out her uncle by name, but she leaves little doubt about how she feels toward those who would give West Bank land to the Palestinians.\n\n\"You have Jews trying to undermine Israel,\" she said.\n\nAs she sat in her trailer the other day, Schlessinger reflected on how disrupted -- and blessed -- her life has been.\n\nFellow settler families on Mount Horesha helped her family find furniture and appliances for the two trailers they live in. At the same time, a crib, a stereo, suitcases and other belongings are piled in the living room as she tries to find storage space.\n\nShe worries that her sons, 11 and 9 years old, now dislike the Israeli army so much they may do what Palestinian boys have been doing for almost two decades -- throwing rocks at soldiers assigned to guard her settlement and others nearby.\n\n\"We had to explain to my sons not to throw rocks,\" she said. \"They don't trust the soldiers.\"\n\nAnd neither does she.\n\n\"We don't know if they are here to watch us or protect us,\" she said as she walked by a water tower and an Israeli soldier in a green uniform and carrying an M-16 approached.\n\nA nearby fence was adorned with orange plastic strips -- the color of protest by former Gaza residents. Schlessinger ran a hand over the strips as they blew in the wind.\n\n\"Orange signifies the fight to settle the Jewish land with Jews,\" she said.\n\nAs for her uncle, Schlessinger concedes she has differences, but she still harbors a pleasant memory.\n\nTraveling back to America a decade ago, she discovered during a stop in Rome that her Israeli-born husband did not have a visa. She phoned her uncle, who then called his political contacts.\n\nThe next day, Schlessinger's husband had his visa.\n\n\"Henry turned it around for us,\" she said, smiling at the memory.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nMarch 26, 2006\n\nFlashpoint of faith\n\nTemple Mount is religious, political hot spot\n\nJERUSALEM -- Just before heading to the office one morning last week in this city of clashing faiths and divisive politics, lawyer David Eisen performed a revolutionary act.\n\nHe prayed.\n\nIt's not that prayer is revolutionary in Jerusalem -- far from it. Religion seems to drip from every stone.\n\nThe problem is where Eisen chose to pray -- the Temple Mount.\n\nMuslim religious authorities, backed by Israeli police, allow only Islamic prayer there.\n\nMeanwhile, Jews are not even in full agreement about whether it is theologically proper to pray on the mount. Indeed, many rabbis say it's downright wrong.\n\nAll this underscores why the Temple Mount -- Haram al Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary, to Muslims -- is considered the most contentious piece of property in this contentious landscape. Roughly the size of two side-by-side city blocks in Manhattan, some consider it the most contentious real estate on earth.\n\nAs Israel prepares for Tuesday's election -- and ponders what to do about the new Palestinian government led by the Hamas terrorist organization -- the Temple Mount looms as a potential flashpoint in efforts to bring a permanent peace between Israelis and Arabs.\n\n\"The tricky problem in peace talks is always Jerusalem,\" said Rachel Bronson, who grew up in Ridgewood and directs Middle East and Gulf Studies for the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nAt the center of Jerusalem -- literally rising above the Old City atop Mount Moriah -- is the Temple Mount.\n\n\"It's a keg of gunpowder,\" Eisen said.\n\nWhy? How can such a comparatively small patch of land loom so large amid the clash of world religions and international politics that runs through Jerusalem.\n\nThe reason has everything to do with faith and the omnipresent link in this part of the world between religion and real estate.\n\n\"We are at a very critical time in the history of Israel and for all the world,\" said Gershon Salomon, who helped capture the Temple Mount area of Jerusalem as an Israeli paratrooper during the 1967 Six-Day War and went on to found the Temple Mount Faithful. \"Don't forget that Jerusalem will be a focus of these events, especially the Temple Mount.\"\n\nFaith, history linked\n\nTo walk on the Temple Mount is to set foot on the same turf as Noah, Abraham, Muhammad, King David, King Solomon, most major Jewish prophets, St. Joseph, the Virgin Mary, the Christian Apostles and Jesus -- to name just a few of the religious luminaries linked to the spot.\n\nFor Jews, the mount is the site of the First and Second temples and the Holy of Holies, which held the Ark of the Covenant and the stone tablets containing the Ten Commandments. The Western Wall, on the flank of the mount, is a remnant of the Second Temple and is Judaism's holiest site.\n\nMuslims claim it as a holy place, too, ranking it behind only Mecca and Medina in importance. To them, it is the site of Muhammad's Night Journey, and it is the first \"qibla\" or Islamic direction of prayer. The mount is home to Islam's golden Dome of the Rock and the al-Aqsa mosque.\n\nAnd while Christian denominations have not officially designated the Temple Mount as sacred space -- on par with Calvary, a hill on the other side of the Old City where Jesus was crucified -- the area certainly plays a key role in early Christian history as the backdrop for so many Gospel events.\n\n\"This is a very important reminder of my faith,\" the Rev. Eusebio Gonzalez, a Roman Catholic priest from Spain, said as he strolled across a sun-washed Temple Mount plaza on the same morning Eisen visited. \"Jesus was here, walking around.\"\n\nBut the historical link that drew Gonzalez is only part of the reason for the mount's importance. The primary reason has to do with the future.\n\nSome Jews believe a new temple will rise on the mount during a coming messianic age. How that would affect the Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa mosque is unclear.\n\nBut that is only one of the weighty -- and politically volcanic -- questions surrounding life on the Temple Mount.\n\nVery silent prayer\n\nAs he stood on the southern end of the mount one morning last week, only steps from al-Aqsa mosque, Eisen was more concerned with doing something that would attract police attention and get him booted out.\n\nAmerican-born, he is part of a small band of devout Jews who come to the Temple Mount regularly to pray after first taking a spiritually purifying bath. Eisen, 34, a father of four, and a reserve sergeant in the Israeli army, tries to come once a month.\n\nWatching him in action, though, onlookers would hardly know he was praying. His is a deliberately silent devotion, as he prays for deceased relatives, his wife and children.\n\nAn odd-couple combination of Muslim law and Israeli police regulations prohibit non-Muslims from bowing, gesturing, praying out loud or even moving their lips. Eisen wears a yarmulke or Jewish skullcap, but he can't bring a Bible or any non-Muslim religious object to the mount. Nor can people of other faiths.\n\nOnly minutes before he walked through a metal detector up a ramp, and through a stone gate at the southwestern corner of the mount, guards ordered a Christian tour group to turn over a book of prayers to the Virgin Mary and book about Christian saints.\n\nEisen frowned and shook his head in disbelief at the notion of police from Israel, a nation created out of the ashes of Nazism's religious intolerance, playing the role of religious enforcers.\n\n\"I come here to be close to God,\" Eisen said. \"This is part of my heritage. I think it would be remiss of me to leave this area abandoned by Jews. It's wrong for Jewish people to not come.\"\n\nStill, Eisen will not walk in certain parts of the mount. Jewish tradition prohibits Jews from walking too close to even the former Holy of Holies until the area can be purified.\n\nAt the same time, he also believes Muslims have dishonored it. They've planted trees there.\n\n\"We believe you can't plant trees before God,\" Eisen said in a reference to a Jewish tradition that no trees were allowed near the ancient temple. \"The Arabs know that tradition. What they did is an affront.\"\n\nThe view from Islam\n\nSuch a problem, stemming from what seems like a harmless planting of trees underscores how even the smallest act can loom so large on the Temple Mount -- or how one person's faith is another person's heresy.\n\nAn hour after Eisen prayed at the southern end, Ahmad Abu Hadid, an assistant to the Islamic manager of the mount, gazed at the Dome of the Rock, which covers the actual rock that Jews call the \"foundation stone\" for God's creation of the world.\n\n\"That rock is a whole biography,\" said Catriel Sugarman, an American artist who moved to Jerusalem and has created a model of the second Jewish temple.\n\nJews, Christians and Muslims all believe the foundation rock was the spot where Abraham nearly sacrificed his son Isaac before God intervened. It is also the spot where Jews and Christians believe King David placed the Ark of the Covenant and where Muslims say the prophet Muhammad came during his Night Journey and prayed with Abraham, Moses and Jesus.\n\n\"I don't believe the Jews were here,\" Abu Hadid said, gesturing toward the dome. \"Where is the evidence?\"\n\nHe then handed a visitor an official pamphlet from the Islamic administration, which says \"some people\" believe the mount was the site of the Jewish temples, but \"no documented historical or archeological evidence exists to support this.\"\n\nAs Abu Hadid passed out the pamphlet, archeologists were laboring below the edge of the Temple Mount, painstakingly uncovering the evidence Abu Hadid and the mount's Islamic administration calls for -- but seem to conveniently ignore.\n\nMerely by taking a tour of tunnels, which show an extension of the Western Wall, Abu Hadid would view artifacts and stonework that date to the ancient Jewish temples.\n\n\"There are Holocaust deniers,\" archeologist Basha Zusman said, sighing at the sort of claim made by Abu Hadid and the official Islamic pamphlet for the mount.\n\n\"The evidence is very clear,\" she said, as she walked through a series of tunnels that even uncovered a market street where temple pilgrims walked. \"There is no question the temples were on the mount. It's a joke for them to say we don't have a claim here.\"\n\nBut what to do with that claim?\n\nThis is a question that divides Jews -- even friends.\n\n2 Jewish views\n\nThe day before Eisen visited, 18-year-old Nechemya Kagedan of Teaneck made his first visit to the mount. His friend, Moshe Rapps, 19, and also from Teaneck, declined.\n\nKagedan and Rapps, who are on a yearlong sabbatical in Jewish studies at a yeshiva not far from the mount, represent a fundamental difference of opinion among Jews about what to make of the Temple Mount.\n\nKagedan paid a visit to the mount not just to underscore Judaism's spiritual link there, but also to make a political point as the Israeli Knesset campaign season winds down and amid a campaign debate about whether to turn over West Bank land to Palestinians.\n\n\"One reason I went up is because of the issue right now of Israel giving away land,\" Kagedan said. \"If no Jews go up there, the government will say we don't care about it.\"\n\nRapps stayed behind, not because of politics, but because of religion and the widespread belief among Jews that they should not go to the mount until the messiah comes and a new temple rises.\n\n\"One of the big goals is unity among all Jews in the world,\" Rapps said. \"There's a reason why we don't have the temple. Maybe we should take a step back and think about why.\"\n\nFrom his spot on the Temple Mount where he regularly prays, Eisen says he understands the sort of religious concerns Rapps raises. But such concerns are outweighed by the spiritual benefits of coming to the mount, he says.\n\n\"This is a site of prayer,\" he says. \"Here, you have the convergence of place, time and mankind.\"\n\nAs Eisen spoke, birds chirped in nearby cedar trees. On the other side of the plaza, boys kicked a soccer ball.\n\nEisen smiled and felt silent. He looked across the open spaces, then spoke of a secret wish he harbors.\n\n\"I wish we could put up a little synagogue somewhere in a corner,\" Eisen he said.\n\nHe paused and smiled again.\n\n\"But that would set off World War III,\" he said.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nMarch 24, 2006\n\nDreams of unity now lie shattered\n\nEx-North Jerseyans divided over security fence\n\nMAVASERET ZION, Israel -- As a golden sun sank behind the rocky hills that surround their new hometown outside Jerusalem, Stuart and Ruth Pilichowski stood on a cliff and gazed at a dream they longed to see.\n\nAcross the valley was a Palestinian town in the contentious West Bank that the Pilichowskis hoped might someday welcome Jewish couples like themselves for a day of shopping or just a leisurely dinner.\n\nThen both looked to the valley floor -- where that dream lay fractured.\n\nSnaking through ancient stone terraces and olive groves below, construction crews were methodically building a fence to separate their town from the Palestinians across the valley.\n\nIf fences make good neighbors elsewhere, in Israel they have become fissures -- for Jews as well as Palestinians. On the eve of Tueday's Israeli elections and with the Hamas terrorist group now controlling many offices in the Palestinian government, those fissures are widening.\n\n\"I hate what I feel is the reality,\" said Stuart Pilichowski, who once traveled extensively to Palestinian factories in the West Bank as a textile agent for Lands' End.\n\nRuth Pilichowski, a former science supervisor in Wallington's schools, sighed at her husband's words.\n\n\"I feel like there is no hope,\" she said.\n\nTo move to Israel, as the Pilichowskis and hundreds of other devout northern New Jersey Jews have done in recent years, is to live with a sense of optimism. They not only believed peace would grow from decades of war and terrorism, but took it for granted that Israelis were mostly united in the direction their nation is taking.\n\nFor the Pilichowskis, formerly of Fair Lawn, and others, that optimism and unity frayed badly in recent months.\n\nA key dividing line is the Israeli government's construction of fences and other barriers to permanently separate Palestinians from Israelis and possibly Jewish West Bank residents from their own country.\n\nAt issue is something as basic to national identity as choosing the colors of a flag: setting national borders. And here in Israel and on the Palestinian West Bank, drawing borders is not just a matter of penciling lines on a map.\n\n\"This is a consequential election, with monumental events,\" said David Makovsky, director of the Project on the Middle East Peace Process at Washington's Institute for Near East Policy. \"It's all about one idea: borders.\"\n\n\"A lot is at stake,\" added Howard Charish, executive vice president of the UJA Federation of Northern New Jersey, which reports that almost two-thirds of North Jersey's Jewish families have at least one member who has visited Israel.\n\nFor many Israelis, fences -- and in a few areas, walls -- are considered necessary antidotes to years of suicide bombings, random shootings and budget-draining deployments by Israeli troops in the West Bank. But to other Israelis, the barriers represent a wrongful surrender of land they believe was given to them by God.\n\n\"There is a very serious rift in the country,\" said psychologist Daniel Wechter, who moved from Fair Lawn to Ginot Shomron, a West Bank settlement of 8,000 that is now outside border lines proposed by Israeli politicians and within an area that may be given to the Palestinians. \"The lack of unity among Israelis is an understatement.\"\n\n'It's like a jail'\n\nPalestinians, meanwhile, are distraught about the possibility the fences will block them from jobs in Israel or from what once was a short trip to and from the West Bank to visit relatives in Jerusalem.\n\nAs Israeli construction workers put the finishing touches on 28-foot-high walls near the Kalandia Checkpoint north of Jerusalem, Palestinian taxi driver Ahmad Abdallah shook his head in disgust.\n\n\"It's like a jail,\" Abdallah said. \"It's the biggest jail in the world.\"\n\nSeveral hours later, atop the Mount of Olives, Imam Mohamad el-Ostah stepped through a narrow slit in another 28-foot-high section of wall to walk to a mosque in Jerusalem's old city.\n\n\"The world tore down the Berlin Wall,\" el-Ostah said. \"Now they're bringing it back here.\"\n\nIn his own town on the other side of Jerusalem, Pilichowski was not making any comparisons to the Berlin Wall -- or jails. He seems to epitomize a far more nuanced view among many Jews about why security barriers are needed and what they mean for the future of Israel.\n\nPilichowski is 51, a grandfather who yearned for years to move to Israel to fulfill his sense of religious identity after growing up listening to his father talk of how he survived the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz.\n\nHe readily acknowledges that many Palestinians may be inconvenienced by the border barriers. And he certainly is aware of the Jewish belief that God set aside modern-day Israel and the Palestinian West Bank as a Jewish homeland that should not be fenced off or given away to Palestinians.\n\nBut Pilichowski now reluctantly embraces a need for protection from suicide bombers. The same day he gazed across the valley at the Palestinian town, he found himself caught in a traffic jam as Israeli police stopped a van carrying Palestinians and explosives.\n\nLater that day, pausing with his wife during a walk in their town, the conversation turned to the upcoming elections and the fence in the valley below.\n\n\"I feel like we are fencing ourselves in rather than fencing the danger out,\" Pilichowski said. \"But we have to do something to make life safer.\"\n\n\"Now what's going to happen?\" Ruth Pilichowski said before quickly answering her own question: \"I don't know.\"\n\nThe couple paused at the thought.\n\n\"This isn't a dream now,\" Stuart Pilichowski said. \"As you live here longer, you become less of a dreamer and more of a realist.\"\n\nSuch weighty discussions about dreams and reality are hardly uncommon now in Israel.\n\nFormer Teaneck resident Yossi Klavan even wonders whether he will be forced to move.\n\nLike Wechter, the psychologist from Fair Lawn, Klavan, 38 and the father of four sons and three daughters, lives in Ginot Shomron, and wonders whether he may have to move because his community lies outside a possible new Israeli border fence. He remembers last summer's forced eviction of 7,000 Jewish residents from the Gaza Strip after the land was turned over to the Palestinians.\n\n\"I'm uncertain what's going to happen,\" said Klavan, a high-tech researcher who commutes to Jerusalem.\n\n\"I wanted to move to Israel to be part of life here. That means you have to take the good with the bad.\"\n\nRabbi Ari Katz, who grew up in Elizabeth, is still trying to piece his life together after being evicted from Gaza.\n\n\"Imagine you are living somewhere, and you're used to it,\" he said. \"Then your own government throws you out.\"\n\nOthers see Gaza residents and West Bank settlers as finally getting their comeuppance after years of pushing and prodding Israeli politicians to annex more sections of land the international community does not think Israel has a right to take.\n\n\"The settler movement had become so powerful that it began to pull the government along with it,\" said Scott Lasensky, a senior research associate for the U.S. Institute of Peace in Washington, an independent agency funded by Congress.\n\nNot so, says Deborah Buckman, a lawyer who moved to Israel a decade ago from Fair Lawn with her husband and four children.\n\nBuckman does not live on the West Bank -- her town of Bet Shemesh is tucked in the hills between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. But she found herself attending demonstrations to protest any notion of giving West Bank settlements to the Palestinians.\n\n\"The whole reason I moved here is I believe this is the place where Jews belong,\" Buckman said. \"I don't believe we occupy the West Bank. It's ours. It would be nice if we could live with the Palestinians, but they insist on killing us.\"\n\nAs his walk with his wife ended and the sun dropped behind the hills near Mavaseret Zion, Stuart Pilichowski looked beyond the Palestinian town he dreamed of visiting on a regular basis and fell quiet, lost in thought as his eyes scanned the empty hills.\n\n\"There's plenty of room for everyone,\" he said finally. \"I think the land is big enough for Israelis and Palestinians.\"\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nSecurity fences may forever alter Bedouins' nomadic way of life\n\nMinority group forgotten in debate over West Bank\n\n\n\nTALMON, West Bank -- The man with the tent, the donkey and herd of goats could not answer one of life's most basic questions:\n\nHow old was he?\n\n\"I'm a Bedouin,\" Musa Ali said as he stood in an olive grove 20 miles north of Jerusalem. \"We don't always know such things.\"\n\nFor all the focus in upcoming Israeli elections on the fate of West Bank Jewish settlements and security barriers around Palestinian towns, one group of West Bank residents has largely been overlooked -- the Bedouins.\n\nNo one is precisely sure how many Bedouins live on the West Bank. Counting them can be like trying to catch the wind.\n\nIsrael's government puts the overall number at more than 110,000 in the West Bank.\n\nThe U.S. Agency for International Development says as many as 5,500 go to health clinics near Jericho alone.\n\nWhat most agree on is this: The Bedouins' nomadic, home-is-a-tent lifestyle may be altered permanently by security fences popping up throughout the West Bank.\n\nMusa Ali was not worried, though.\n\nAs his goats wandered among olive trees in search of grass to eat, he pointed to his black Bedouin tent halfway up a hillside.\n\n\"My home,\" he said.\n\nOne of his sons hopped on a donkey and guided the two dozen goats across a road. Ali watched in silence.\n\n\"We don't stay in the same place,\" Ali said.\n\nHe said he has no idea how long he had stayed in the olive grove. As for his age, he paused yet again and wrinkled his sun-beaten brow.\n\n\"I think I'm between 50 and 60,\" he said.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 24, 2006\n\nSecurity walls impose a new daily challenge\n\nPalestinians revert to walking\n\nABU DIS, the West Bank -- The doctor in the trim business suit and white shirt was walking, but not on house call. Dr. Salem Imng was just engaging in a new West Bank lifestyle -- passing through a security wall.\n\nAs Israel tries to protect itself from terrorist attacks with a variety of security barriers -- which are credited with reducing the number of suicide bombings -- many Palestinians find themselves adjusting to a new way of getting from one place to another.\n\nActually, many resort to mankind's oldest means of transportation: They walk.\n\n\"For me, it's easy,\" Imng said as he stepped through a 3-foot-wide gate in the wall. \"But for my patients, I don't think it's so good.\"\n\nTo watch the comings and goings at these openings in the security barriers is to see a delicate ballet, with occasional moments of human kindness or comic relief.\n\nThere are old men wearing Arab headdresses and young Muslim women talking on cellphones. There are young men carrying computers and young mothers with children. People carry furniture, groceries, books.\n\nIn short, most every kind of person is there, with most anything. The wall is the great leveler.\n\nBut it forces people to help, too.\n\nEarlier at the Kalandia Checkpoint north of Jerusalem, a mother pushed a baby carriage through an opening in another 28-foot-high section of the wall as construction crews in dump trucks and earthmovers rolled past them.\n\nJust beyond the opening, she discovered she had to push the stroller over new gravel. A Palestinian taxi driver approached -- and helped her pick up the stroller and carry it over the gravel. Nearby, a Palestinian man gave cups of sweet tea to machine-gun toting Israeli border guards sweating in the hot sun.\n\nBack at Abu Dis near the Mount of Olives, Mohamad Zaoror, a taxi driver, demonstrated to a crowd that no wall would ever stop him.\n\nExchanging his shoes for sneakers, Zaoror, 34, climbed up and down the 28-foot barrier by placing his feet in cracks between pieces of the wall.\n\n\"This wall doesn't mean anything,\" Zaoror proclaimed afterward.\n\nImng, the walking pediatrician, smiled.\n\n\"We have to hope for peace,\" he said. \"Only peace can stop this.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/06/01/shots-shore-wwii-vets-psa-lifted-curfews-news-around-states/116719846/", "title": "Shots at the Shore, WWII vet's PSA: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The pace of COVID-19 vaccinations in the state has fallen to a level not seen since the earliest days of the immunization campaign, even though less than 30% of the state’s population is fully inoculated. Statistics from the Alabama Department of Public Health showed Friday that the number of people getting shots in recent days was similar to the rate in January, when vaccine supply was still very limited. Officials are worried that large numbers of residents are simply refusing to get shots, meaning the coronavirus’ threat will remain higher than necessary. “It’s very distressing because we have vaccine, and we have it in every corner of Alabama,” said Dr. Karen Landers, assistant state health officer. Several vaccination sites have closed because of the lack of demand, and some areas have considered turning down vaccine shipments. In Opelika, East Alabama Medical Center said “very low demand” and plenty of vaccine supply meant a community clinic would close after giving patients a second round of shots June 14. With just about 28% of its population fully immunized, Alabama’s vaccination rate is better only than that of neighboring Mississippi. And at roughly 11,140 lives lost, the state’s overall death rate from COVID-19 is the eighth-worst in the nation, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Rangers who keep an eye on North America’s highest mountain peak say impatient and inexperienced climbers are taking more risks and endangering themselves and other climbers after a year off because of the coronavirus pandemic. Denali in southern Alaska is 20,310 feet above sea level and requires a level of expertise and acclimation to high altitudes not needed for climbing most peaks in the U.S. “We have seen a disturbing amount of overconfidence paired with inexperience in the Alaska Range,” the National Park Service wrote in a statement Thursday. The remoteness and extreme weather in Alaska pose extra risks, even for climbers who may have a good deal of experience at elevations up to 14,000 feet in the Lower 48. After no deaths were reported in 2018 and 2019, at least two people have already died on the mountain in 2021. Two others were seriously injured, authorities said. Last month a skier from Colorado died after falling into a crevasse. A climber from Idaho was killed by a falling block of glacier ice, according to rangers. The rangers issued their statement after a Canadian climber was seriously injured in a nearly 1,000-foot fall. He was not wearing ropes. Other climbers reported the fall, and a nearby helicopter doing glacier surveys was able to rescue the man, park officials said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: COVID-19 vaccine outreach is increasing in the Arizona-Mexico border area in an effort to use up doses before they expire this month. There’s waning demand for the shots in Arizona, and a 10-day pause on administration of the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine in April because of safety concerns has fueled an excess vaccine supply. Health care providers, in partnership with binational government entities, are working on getting the COVID-19 vaccines to vulnerable groups along the international border before doses expire. Those groups include temporary agricultural workers and Mexican truck drivers who often cross the border several times a day. Still, some doses may go to waste. The pause on use of the J&J vaccine “really slowed down demand for it,” said Will Humble, executive director of the Arizona Public Health Association. In the meantime, production of the drug continued, and orders placed prior to the pause were still delivered, he said. “You can decide not to order some, but once you’ve ordered it, you can’t send it back,” said Humble, who is a former state health director. Maricopa County as of Thursday had 15,610 doses of the J&J vaccine that are set to expire June 23.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Nearly 60,000 doses of the state’s allotment of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine are nearing their expiration date and would have to be discarded if not used by the end of June, according to a state health official. The J&J doses administered so far include 11,150 given May 1 through Friday – an average of fewer than 400 per day, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “What we have done is move them around” to various vaccination sites “so that the earlier expiring doses get used,” state epidemiologist Jennifer Dillaha told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. “States everywhere are in a similar situation where they’re not ordering doses.” Health officials in several Arkansas counties last month slowed or stopped their orders for doses, and demand for the shots decreased. The health department reported more than 2.6 million total doses of vaccines have been received and more than 1.9 million doses administered, including to nearly 898,000 people who are fully immunized. There have been 341,130 total coronavirus cases in Arkansas since the pandemic began, the department reported Friday, and 2,016 cases are active.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Workforce regulators recommended Friday that the state stick with a July 31 deadline for updating certain employer pandemic safety rules instead of adopting Gov. Gavin Newsom’s mid-June lifting of mask and distancing requirements in most social settings. Revised rules to be considered Thursday by the California Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board have relatively few changes from an earlier proposal that drew extensive criticism from business and agricultural groups. Cal/OSHA’s staff withdrew their initial proposal last month so they could take into account new federal guidance that fully vaccinated people can now skip face coverings and distancing in virtually all situations. California is delaying that recommendation until June 15 in social settings, and business groups hoped the workplace regulators would adopt the same date. The timing of the standard board’s emergency hearing this week means the new regulations could take effect in mid-June, but several of the proposed revised rules affecting masking and physical distancing still include a date six weeks later. That broad mask requirement could mean a shortage of the most effective N95 masks for health care workers and agricultural workers entering what is expected to be another drought-driven wildfire season, critics said.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Two sheriff’s deputies who contracted COVID-19 have died in less than two weeks. The Denver Sheriff’s Department announced the death of Deputy Daniel “Duke” Trujillo on Thursday. The former Marine was a seven-year department veteran who worked for the city’s downtown jail. His death followed the death of Deputy James Herrera, announced May 17. Herrera worked for the department for 25 years and was assigned to the downtown jail. After Trujillo’s death was announced, criticism of some of his social media posts that seemed to express skepticism about COVID-19 vaccinations surfaced, such as one Facebook profile photo update that said “I have an immune system.” Following Herrera’s death, Trujillo changed his profile photo to one of Herrera and a badge with a black band. Like other workplaces, the sheriff’s department does not require its employees to be vaccinated, spokesperson Daria Serna said. It has tried to educate employees about vaccinations, including by inviting a doctor to speak to them during a town hall. This week, the department will offer vaccination clinics for deputies in its jails after previously offering clinics in sites nearby, she said. Sheriff Elias Diggins said he was designating the deaths of both deputies as happening in the line of duty, a move that provides certain rights and benefits.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont held his last regular COVID-19 briefing for the media Thursday – a sign that he and his administration believe the state is well on its way to finally emerging from the pandemic. But Lamont said he wasn’t proclaiming “mission accomplished” after about 15 months of giving regular, televised updates. He warned there could still be some flare-ups of infections, especially with variants of the coronavirus, in parts of the state where vaccinations have lagged, such as eastern Connecticut and some urban areas. “So that’s why we are not taking our foot off the accelerator when it comes to getting everybody vaccinated,” he said. Also, new data released Thursday showed persistent racial disparities in vaccine distribution in the state. Fifty-nine percent of white residents have received a first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, compared to 36% of Black residents, 41% of Hispanic residents, 45% of American Indian/Alaskan residents and 58% of Asian/Pacific Islander residents. But the Democratic governor said the state’s infection numbers are “where we want them to be.” Over the past two weeks, the rolling average number of daily new cases in Connecticut has decreased by 59.8%, according to researchers from Johns Hopkins.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: St. Anthony’s Italian Festival in the city’s Little Italy neighborhood is back this year with a pandemic twist. The carnival atmosphere is still a no-go even as social distancing guidelines ease, but the festival, one of the most popular in the state, will be offering takeout Italian fare June 8-11. Wilmington’s Greek Festival is also featuring a to-go version this week, from Wednesday through Saturday. More details are available on the festival’s Facebook page. Organizers say they hope to be back Sept. 7-11 for a bigger festival outside Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church. St. Anthony’s Italian Festival, a celebration of Italian Amerian culture and heritage, has been a Delaware institution since the early 1970s, but its roots go back even further in the neighborhood that has been home to many Italian immigrants. The eight-day festivities – featuring rides, beer tents, live music, and food and wine booths – are widely considered one of the state’s most popular tourist attractions. President Joe Biden, when he served as a senator and later as vice president, often visited the festival, especially during the Procession of Saints parade, which won’t take place this year. In 2020, the festival was canceled due to COVID-19. It was the first time in almost 50 years the church called off the celebration.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A majority of child care centers in the city reported zero coronavirus outbreaks between July and December, even as cases citywide spiked by more than 500% over that same period, WUSA-TV reports. COVID-19 outbreaks in about 6% of the 469 licensed D.C. child care facilities accounted for almost half of all cases linked to child care facilities from July 1 to Dec. 31, 2020, and represent only a quarter of all facilities that reported at least one case, according to data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The data also shows that more than half of the people who tested positive for the virus were teachers or staff members at the facilities. This suggests that the following of CDC safety guidelines stopped the virus from spreading to others even when a case was identified. It was also reported that COVID-19 outbreaks were more likely to happen in newer facilities than older, more established ones. The research suggests this may have happened because the older centers had more experience using resources to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. The CDC said delays of more than three days in testing for symptomatic people were associated with COVID-19 outbreaks.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: A former Florida Department of Health employee has received whistleblower status a year after being fired for repeatedly violating the agency’s policy about communicating with the media. Rebekah Jones had raised questions about Florida’s COVID-19 data after being ousted as the data’s curator. State officials said she was fired for insubordination after being reprimanded several times, according to state records. The Miami Herald reports the Office of the Inspector General told her attorneys Friday that “the information disclosed does meet the criteria for whistleblower status as described by … Florida statutes.” Jones, who helped build the state’s online presentation of its COVID-19 data, received national attention a year ago when she sowed doubt about the information being reported by the state when Florida was an epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic. She suggested that Health Department managers wanted her to manipulate information to paint a rosier picture and that she pushed back. A letter from Inspector General Michael J. Bennett, the Herald reports, said Jones’ complaint demonstrates “reasonable cause to suspect that an employee or agent of an agency or independent contractor has violated any federal, state or local law, rule or regulation.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Gov. Brian Kemp declared Friday that public schools no longer have his permission to require masks for coronavirus protection, though his executive order fell short of banning such mandates outright. The Republican governor’s written order came two days after he gave a preview in a Fox News Channel interview Wednesday, declaring: “The time for mandates is over.” “We’re not going to have a mask mandate for our kids,” Kemp said. “Our teachers have had the ability to get vaccinated. It certainly doesn’t keep anyone from wearing a mask.” The actual order adjusting Georgia’s few remaining coronavirus restrictions isn’t so strongly worded. Instead, Kemp’s order says his COVID-19 emergency declaration “does not include the authority for local school districts to rely on the Public Health State of Emergency as a basis for requiring students or workers to wear a face covering” on school campuses. In other words, Georgia school districts can no longer claim their authority to require masks comes from the governor. Anthony Michael Kreis, a constitutional law professor at Georgia State University, said school boards can likely require teachers and students to wear masks without the governor’s permission.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: Hawaiian Airlines is ending service between Honolulu and the rural islands of Molokai and Lanai in Maui County. Citing significant cost and an inter-island travel market that has been limited by restrictions due to the pandemic, Hawaiian Airlines said it will terminate its ’Ohana by Hawaiian service to the two islands, The Maui News reports. “With our focus on rebuilding and restoring our mainline interisland, North America and international service, we cannot responsibly justify incurring the startup costs and weakening our financial outlook,” Hawaiian Airlines President and CEO Peter Ingram said in a statement. “We do this as stewards of our company, with a firm eye on ensuring that Hawaiian Airlines is positioned to not only survive but thrive as we exit the pandemic.” Travel to Hawaii has increased as pandemic restrictions have eased. Hawaiian Airlines announced last week that it has 400 open positions and is offering a $2,000 bonus for many positions on Maui, where the need for workers is high. “While we have seen a strong recovery for our North America routes, Neighbor Island and international demand continues to be suppressed by travel restrictions,” Hawaiian Airlines spokesperson Alex Da Silva said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little on Friday issued an executive order repealing a mask mandate prohibition put in place by the lieutenant governor while he was out of the state. Little described Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin’s actions as a tyrannical abuse of power and an “irresponsible, self-serving political stunt.” The governor had previously been reserved in his comments about his fellow Republican, a member of the far-right who has worked to undermine Little’s handling of the pandemic. Last month McGeachin announced her run against him for governor. Her executive order Thursday banning mask mandates in schools and public buildings is widely seen as part of that campaign, and she is already using the order in fundraising efforts. Little has never issued a statewide mask mandate, but counties, cities and schools have issued their own directives. “I have opposed a statewide mask mandate all along because I don’t think top-down mandates change behavior the way personal choice does,” Little said in a statement about his repeal of McGeachin’s order. “But, as your Governor, when it came to masks, I also didn’t undermine separately elected officials who, under Idaho law, are given authorities to take measures they believe will protect the health and safety of the people they serve.” Little was attending the Republican Governors Association conference in Nashville, Tennessee, and returned late Thursday.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Both state fairs this summer will boast a unity theme: “One Illinois.” Gov. J.B. Pritzker said the theme is to inspire the state to come together after the COVID-19 pandemic led to the cancellation last summer of the Illinois State Fair in Springfield and the DuQuoin State Fair. “Coming off a year where the fair was canceled for the first time since World War II, we want to convey a show of unity and strength when people return to the fairgrounds in August,” Illinois State Fair Manager Keven Gordon said. Both fairs will host on-site mobile vaccination clinics for their duration so that any fairgoer who wants a COVID-19 shot can get inoculated. The “One Illinois” logo will be featured throughout the grounds of both fairs and on merchandise. The Illinois State Fair is scheduled for Aug. 12-22 and the fair in DuQuoin for Aug. 27-Sept. 6.\n\nIndiana\n\nLafayette: While Indiana University faces political backlash over its plans to require proof of COVID-19 vaccinations for all students and employees, Purdue University is offering a chance at winning a full year’s tuition for students who get the shots. Purdue’s “Old Golden Ticket” drawing makes students who submit proof of a COVID-19 vaccination by July 15 eligible for one of 10 prizes paying $9,992. That is the equivalent of a year’s undergraduate tuition. Purdue has avoided criticism of its plans to require students and employees to either provide proof of vaccination for the fall semester or participate in frequent coronavirus testing. IU said Thursday that it “will further consider our process for verifying the requirement,” a day after the state attorney general issued a nonbinding opinion that the policy was illegal under a new law banning the state or local governments from issuing or requiring so-called vaccine passports. Many Republican legislators have also come out against IU’s plan, with a letter signed by 35 GOP state senators calling it a “heavy-handed mandate.” IU officials have defended the vaccine requirement as a way to safely resume full in-person classes and events on all the university’s campuses across the state.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: A man who left a threatening voicemail telling Gov. Kim Reynolds she should be hung or shot “for treason” for imposing coronavirus restrictions has pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor harassment charge. Harvey Hunter Jr., 48, pleaded guilty Thursday to second-degree harassment, accepting a plea agreement offered by Polk County prosecutors. In a written guilty plea, he said he “did threaten to commit bodily injury to a government official” in his Jan. 5 voicemail. Prosecutors will recommend that Hunter serve a one-year term of probation, pay a fine, have no contact with the governor and undergo a mental health evaluation. A judge will not be bound by the recommendation when Hunter is sentenced this week and could impose stricter penalties. Hunter left the voicemail on a governor’s office phone line set up to gather input on the partial statewide mask mandate. He called the governor a dictator and said that “every single one of you need to be hung for treason for pushing this COVID scam.” He also called Reynolds two derogatory names for women and said that “you need to be put in front of a firing squad.” Hunter had defended his comments as free speech in April interviews with the Associated Press, saying he was expressing opposition to what he considered “tyrannical” COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Advocates for renters are troubled by the end of the state’s ban on evictions and foreclosures on home mortgages for people who are struggling financially because of the coronavirus pandemic. Top Republican lawmakers on Friday rescinded the executive order from Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly imposing the ban. State law gives leaders of the GOP-controlled Legislature the power to rescind such orders. Republicans have long argued that the state’s moratorium prevents landlords from getting paid. Many landlords have their own mortgages to pay on the properties they rent. But advocates said ending the state’s ban is troubling because of questions about how long a nationwide ban from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will stay in place. The CDC ban, imposed through June, would prevent evictions and foreclosures in Kansas, but it could be nullified by a federal lawsuit. “If that goes away, I think we’re going to be in for a world of hurt,” said Dustin Hare, a Wyandotte County organizer. Hare said the CDC’s ban was more effective. But Vince Munoz, an organizer with the advocacy group Rent Zero Kansas, said providing rental assistance is not as helpful as “simply saying we aren’t going to have evictions.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state ushered in the Memorial Day holiday weekend by relaxing pandemic-related limits on crowd sizes as COVID-19 vaccinations continued to climb. Friday marked the start of a two-week stretch in which Kentucky businesses and events are allowed to operate at 75% capacity. The state also lifted its coronavirus-related curfew on bars and restaurants. All of the state’s pandemic-related capacity restrictions will end June 11. “We are safely and sustainably easing restrictions to limit the spread of COVID as more of our young people get their ‘shot of hope’ and we end this pandemic,” said Gov. Andy Beshear, who recently announced the new round of relaxed restrictions. In urging more people to get inoculated, Beshear warned that the return to larger gatherings “comes with a heightened risk” for the unvaccinated. While more than 80% of people 65 and older in Kentucky have been vaccinated, inoculation rates have lagged among younger residents. The Deocratic governor on Friday praised Kentuckians ages 12 to 17 for their willingness to roll up their sleeves for the shots to “protect themselves and others.” “These vaccines are a miracle – and they are the key to safe classrooms for our students, teachers and staff,” Beshear said on social media.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A statewide “Shot for a Shot” campaign offering free drinks for people who get vaccinated against COVID-19 begins this month, officials said Thursday. Participating businesses will provide a free alcoholic or nonalcoholic drink to people who can prove they’ve been fully vaccinated within the previous seven days, the Louisiana Office of Alcohol and Tobacco Control said. Just under 31% of Louisiana residents have been fully vaccinated, compared to 40% nationwide, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Several bars and restaurants in New Orleans held “A Shot for a Shot” events in April. Establishments in Baton Rouge also have held such events. The LA Wallet app or the state-issued vaccination card can be used as proof of inoculation, the news release said. The state office will collect drink tallies from participating bars and restaurants for the Louisiana Restaurant Association, which will provide partial reimbursements. No taxes will go toward the reimbursements, it said. The campaign will run “between June 1 and June 30 or until funds are exhausted,” the statement said.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Legislative leaders are keeping in place a mask requirement for the State House, despite Republican opposition. The Legislative Council on Thursday took no further action on the mask mandate, despite an uproar among Republicans who say lawmakers shouldn’t be subjected to different rules than the public. The governor has lifted requirements for masks indoors, though businesses can choose to continue requiring them. On May 24, seven Republicans defied the rule by entering the State House without masks. House Speaker Ryan Fecteau, a Democrat, responded by stripping them of their committee assignments. Fecteau said he had received “veiled threats” over the decision and was still unwavering in the decision to keep the mask rule. And some GOP lawmakers are vowing to continue to flout the rules. “We will not have a House that is not in order,” Fecteau said, referencing a common order of the presiding officer of the chamber. Rep. Chris Johansen, R-Monticello, one of the seven lawmakers who were punished for not wearing masks, said he was exploring whether legal action could be taken against Fecteau.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan vetoed more than a dozen measures Friday, including one aimed at creating greater transparency in emergency procurements – such as the one that made headlines when Hogan confidentially purchased 500,000 coronavirus tests from South Korea that later stirred controversy. The bill would require the governor to provide a legislative panel notice within 72 hours after the execution of the contract or the expenditure of funds when authorizing a certain emergency procurement during a state of emergency.In his veto letter, Hogan said that “extraordinary measures were necessary to keep Marylanders safe from this deadly virus.” But Del. Brooke Lierman, a Democrat who sponsored the legislation in the House, said that “it’s incredibly disappointing and quite frustrating that our governor would be opposed to shining a light on how his administration is spending taxpayer dollars.” Last month, a state audit found that the Hogan administration failed to follow state procurement regulations when it bought the 500,000 tests last year. The first batch that later had to be replaced at an additional $2.5 million cost had not been authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Hogan has adamantly defended the purchase of the tests.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Gov. Charlie Baker signed an order Friday officially lifting Massachusetts’ pandemic state of emergency June 15, and the state lifted nearly all COVID-19 restrictions Saturday, in an indication its battle against the coronavirus has turned a sharp corner. “I would pretty much say it’s over,” Gov. Charlie Baker said, cautioning that the pandemic has thrown a number of curves in the past year. “I do believe it’s certainly on the run.” There are still locations where masks will be required, including public transportation, Baker said. The mandate was replaced with a mask advisory that echoes recommendations from federal health officials. Baker also said businesses may still require customers and visitors to continue wearing masks inside. More than 3.5 million residents have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, he said, predicting the state will hit its 4.1 million goal by mid-June. Massachusetts is also launching a new campaign to encourage diners to start eating out in their favorite restaurants. Restaurants are among the businesses hit hardest during the pandemic, and Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito said Friday that the Baker administration wants to send the message that restaurants are open, and vaccinated people should go out and dine to help those eateries bounce back.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson is defending her decision to stick with appointment-only visits to branch offices after the coronavirus pandemic, amid pushback from lawmakers who say people should again be able to go without an appointment. Half of all appointments are next-day appointments – an option for drivers with urgent business such as renewing an expiring license or transferring a vehicle title. Benson conceded they fill up quickly but contended the system, while “not perfect,” is better than residents having to potentially wait hours in line, as they did before COVID-19 struck. Critics note that other appointments are months in the future. Benson is pledging to add appointment slots – which are booked online or by phone – saying fewer staff will be out sick and fewer offices will be closed as infections continue to subside. The state is on track, in July, to implement a new law that requires in-person visits for new license and ID photos every 12 years instead of eight. “That will dramatically reduce the demand for office visits for a number of years,” Benson, a Democrat, told the Republican-led House Oversight Committee this past week. She said the department is continuing to work through a backlog caused by a 13-month grace period for driver’s license and ID renewals in the pandemic.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Several breweries and distilleries are offering a shot and a beer to adults to encourage them to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Gov. Tim Walz announced the “Cheers to the Vaccine” campaign Friday in partnership with the Craft Brewers Guild and the Minnesota Distillers Guild. It’s separate from a list of incentive giveaways he announced Thursday, including Minnesota State Fair tickets, fishing licenses and state park passes. As of Friday, all statewide coronavirus restrictions for Minnesota bars, restaurants, event centers – and all other businesses – were lifted under a plan Walz announced earlier. However, local governments and individual businesses can still maintain restrictions. Masking and social distancing mandates remain in effect in Minneapolis, St. Paul and some other communities, for example. Establishments participating in “Cheers to the Vaccine” will offer free or discounted drinks through June 30 to Minnesota residents 21 and older who provide proof that they have received at least one vaccine dose. The limit is one drink per person. Several of the breweries and distilleries are also planning on-site vaccination clinics in the coming weeks. Details will be announced by the establishments themselves.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Outdoor enthusiasts weren’t spared when the pandemic put the world on pause in 2020, leading to the cancellation of the Wildlife Extravaganza and what would have been the first Mississippi Ag & Outdoor Expo. But both events are on track for this summer. The Wildlife Extravaganza on July 30-Aug. 1 falls on its traditional weekend but will be held in a new location and promises a fresh look. The event will be held at the new Sheraton Refuge Hotel & Conference Center in Flowood in Rankin County near Jackson. The development offers a hotel, golf course, restaurants, a swimming pool and lazy river, among other amenities. It also features a 12-acre lake and outside space to exhibit larger products such as hunting blinds, trucks and boats. The Mississippi Ag & Outdoor Expo, expected to be the largest outdoor show held in Mississippi, is scheduled for Aug. 6-8 at the new Mississippi Trade Mart at the Mississippi Fairgrounds in Jackson. It is hosted by the Foundation for Mississippi Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks. Organizers said there will be a petting zoo and vendors with special items for kids, possibly to include an indoor trout pond where younger children can experience catching a fish. And a concert is in the works, too.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: The Missouri Supreme Court is lifting directives for the state’s courts aimed at protecting the safety of employees and the public during the coronavirus pandemic. Court officials said the restrictions were being lifted June 15 because of a decrease in the national and local levels of COVID-19 cases and the effectiveness and availability of vaccines, the Jefferson City News Tribune reports. The Supreme Court last revised its directives in March, saying local courts could operate in one of four operating phases. Each phase reflected differing approaches to in-person proceedings, personnel and staffing, and courthouse operations. The new order applies to Missouri’s appellate and circuit courts, including associate, family, juvenile, treatment, municipal and probate divisions. Court officials said local chief and presiding judges may determine whether to continue precautions, based on local health conditions and recommended federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. The state Department of Health and Senior Services reported that as of Friday, more than 2.5 million Missouri residents, or 41.6% of the state’s 6.2 million people, had received at least a first vaccine shot.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: A new wellness center on the Fort Peck Reservation has received about $5million in funding that will help bring the 20-year project “across the finish line,” according to a news release. The project is expected to be complete by January 2022. Financing for the $23 million wellness center came through investment from the Fort Peck Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes and New Markets Tax Credits from Missoula-based community development lender MoFi. Jackie Weeks, tribal operations officer for the Fort Peck Tribes, said the funding “provided the bridge ... to complete the project.” The 50,000-square-foot center aims to address the disparity in life expectancy and provide a supportive space to promote long-term health and wellness among tribal members. The wellness center is expected to create 70 new full-time jobs with benefits. The genesis for the Fort Peck wellness center came in 2001, when local high school students partnered with Harvard Medical School to study disparities in life expectancy among members of the Fort Peck Tribes. The group found that the average life expectancy for an individual living on the Fort Peck Reservation was nearly 20 years lower than the average life expectancy in Montana, according to a release.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Restaurants can now offer carry-out alcohol permanently under a new state law inspired by Gov. Pete Ricketts’ efforts to help struggling businesses during the pandemic. Ricketts announced Wednesday that he signed the measure into law. It went into effect immediately. The governor issued an executive order to allow carry-out alcohol in March 2020 to aid restaurants that were struggling financially because of the pandemic and social distancing restrictions. The order proved popular with the public, and some restaurants reported that it had helped their sales. Ricketts said the order showed that the previous restriction on carry-out alcohol was unnecessary. The law applies to restaurants and farm wineries with the proper liquor licenses. To-go alcohol must be sold in a sealed, tamper-evident container and not partially consumed. Lawmakers approved the measure 45-0.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Uber and Lyft will be able to resume surge pricing in the state after Gov. Steve Sisolak ended a ban meant to prevent price gouging amid the pandemic. The Democratic governor’s emergency order late Friday took effect immediately. App-based ride-hailing firms, known formally as transportation network companies, generally raise their prices during periods of high demand, which they say reduces wait times by encouraging more drivers to work. But that’s been banned during the public health emergency declared in March 2020. Uber said last month that the loss of surge pricing led to a shortage of drivers because it depressed their earnings, and the company urged users to pressure Sisolak to ease the restriction. The Nevada Transportation Authority said peak wait times have jumped 225% since March 2021, with some riders waiting as long as 30 minutes, according to documents released by Sisolak’s office. In future emergencies, surge pricing will only be banned for 30 days.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state is moving toward making it easier for paramedics and others to become nursing assistants to address workforce shortages exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. The state Senate passed a bill Thursday that would allow certain military personnel, emergency medical technicians and paramedics to take the licensed nursing assistant exam without having to take the standard courses. The bill passed the House last month. It now goes to the governor’s desk. Meanwhile, Gov. Chris Sununu once again renewed New Hampshire’s state of emergency declaration Friday, but for only 14 days instead of the usual 21. Sununu first declared a state of emergency because of the coronavirus pandemic March 13, 2020, and has renewed it every three weeks since then. Friday’s decision came six weeks after Sununu eliminated the statewide mask mandate and three weeks after the lifting of business restrictions. “Today’s action to renew the State of Emergency allows the legislature to take up our various critical emergency orders that have brought flexibility to manage through this pandemic, and I call on the House and Senate to move swiftly in this charge so that we can move out of a State of Emergency as quickly as possible,” he said in a statement.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nBelmar: The second summer of COVID-19 at the Jersey Shore is shaping up to look far different from last year’s: Many virus restrictions have been lifted, nightclubs and dance floors are packed again, and restaurants and bars can serve full crowds indoors. Shore towns have reported brisk beach badge sales as they drop capacity limits put in place last summer to keep people further apart on the sand. Ocean City was closing in on $1 million worth of beach badge sales by the end of April – the earliest they had ever reached that mark. “It’s been exceptionally busy,” city spokesperson Doug Bergen said. The lifting of outdoor capacity limits has cleared the way for large-scale concerts to resume at venues including the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel, which lists upcoming shows including Luke Bryan, Lady A and the Jonas Brothers. Summer rentals are seeing strong bookings. Meanwhile, beachgoers at three popular spots were able to get vaccinated against COVID-19 over Memorial Day weekend. Gov. Phil Murphy said the “Shots at the Shore” effort would offer free jabs Saturday and Sunday at Sandy Hook, Long Branch and Asbury Park. “We’re going to make it possible for beachgoers to get some sun and at the same time get their first shot,” the Democratic governor said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Drug overdose deaths in the state in 2020 increased by 25% from the previous year, continuing a trend seen before the pandemic. Increased abuse of the deadly synthetic opioid fentanyl pumped up the number of overdose deaths to 721 in 2019, up from 574 in 2019, the Albuquerque Journal reports. The provisional numbers were gathered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and broken down by QuoteWizard, a division of LendingTree, according to the Journal. Fentanyl is an extremely potent opioid that is prescribed for legitimate medical uses, including treatment of cancer patients and in surgical anesthesia, but it also is smuggled into the United States from Mexico and often trafficked illegally in counterfeit pills known as “blues.” “The pervasiveness of fentanyl on the illicit drug market in New Mexico is one of the most daunting public safety issues we face,” said Fred Federici, acting U.S. attorney for New Mexico. “Over the past several years, we have seen the prevalence of fentanyl rise from occasional seizures to an alarming number of cases.”\n\nNew York\n\nNew Paltz: A 102-year-old Army veteran is comparing his World War II service to the campaign to vaccinate Americans against COVID-19 in a public service announcement released by officials in Ulster County. “When our nation needed us, and Uncle Sam came calling, we answered. We fought the Nazis and stormed the beaches of Normandy,” veteran Bill Swetow says in the video released Saturday by County Executive Pat Ryan. “And over 75 years later, we are at another moment where we need every American to do their part.” The Daily Freeman of Kingston reports that Swetow, who lives in New Paltz in the Hudson Valley, joined the Army after the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 and went on to serve as a cryptographer and a statistical control officer. Swetow says in the minutelong PSA: “We are not asking you to fire a gun, dig a trench or go to a foreign land. But we are asking you to join the fight, the fight against COVID-19. And we want you to get vaccinated.” The ad will air on local TV and radio stations as well as social media sites. Two-thirds of adults in New York state have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, according to recent federal data.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nDurham: A former deputy is suing a sheriff over his requirement for employees to get a COVID-19 vaccine. Christopher Neve is asking a court to force Durham County Sheriff Clarence Birkhead to reinstate him with back pay and to rule that vaccine mandates are unconstitutional, The Herald-Sun of Durham reports. The lawsuit, filed in April in federal court, argues that mandating a vaccine that has only emergency authorization from the Food and Drug Administration and not formal approval violates federal law. The Durham County Sheriff’s Office declined to comment Friday, citing the ongoing litigation. In January, Birkhead sent a notice to employees that the COVID-19 vaccine would be mandatory except for medical or religious objections, according to court documents. After Neve and other deputies failed to schedule a vaccine appointment, Birkhead sent an email Jan. 25 reminding deputies to schedule their appointments. Neve continued to refuse, according to the lawsuit, and his badge and other equipment were confiscated in March. Public employers can mandate that employees receive a COVID-19 vaccine, according to the N.C. Department of Labor and Diane Juffras, a professor of public law and government at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state Capitol is resuming public tours after suspending them for more than a year, officials said Thursday. Tuesday’s reopening comes on the heels of data that showed the number of active COVID-19 cases dropped about 51% last month, going from 995 on May 1 to 508 on May 26. “As we resume normal activities, we are anxious to again offer this service to the public. We know it is appreciated by visitors to the Capitol at all times of the year, but especially during the summer travel season,” Office of Budget Management Director Joe Morrissette said. Face coverings are required for those who are not fully vaccinated. Tours are conducted Monday through Friday.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: Wednesday is “Re-Opening Day” in the city after it went without its baseball opening day traditions the past two years because of the pandemic. The afternoon game with the Philadelphia Phillies will mark the return of full seating capacity at the Reds’ Great American Ball Park home after most seats were closed off to begin this season. City and county leaders said it will be a “half-day holiday,” and they want everyone to wear red and to gather in downtown entertainment venues to celebrate. Tickets as low as $5 each were being sold for the game. “No city does Opening Day like Cincinnati,’ said Jill Meyer, President and CEO of the Cincinnati USA Regional Chamber. She called June 2 a time to “celebrate the future and honor what we have been through together as a community.” In announcing the half-day holiday Thursday, officials said everyone should get vaccinated against COVID-19 so they can be safe while visiting Great American Ball Park, as well as local bars and restaurants. “If you haven’t gotten one, get one – don’t be stupid,” Mayor John Cranley said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: State agencies will be barred from requiring a mask or COVID-19 vaccination as a condition of being allowed to enter a state building or office under an executive order signed by Gov. Kevin Stitt. “It is time to return to normal,” Stitt said in a statement after signing the order Friday. “Every Oklahoman must have access to all government services whether or not they choose to be vaccinated or wear a mask.” The order, which does not apply in medical settings with patients, was announced after Stitt signed into law a bill prohibiting schools and colleges from adopting mask or vaccination requirements. Stitt refused to issue a statewide mask mandate but in November required masks inside state buildings. That order was lifted in March. The Oklahoma State Department of Health on Friday reported 452,777 total coronavirus cases since the pandemic began and 1,214 currently active cases in the state.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Significant coronavirus-related staffing shortages at the Oregon State Hospital prompted health officials to call for the National Guard’s assistance at the psychiatric facility last week. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports the state’s health authority, which oversees the hospital, requested 30 nurses from the National Guard. “We need your help,” Oregon Health Authority Director Patrick Allen wrote to state employees. “OHA has exhausted all other staffing options for the hospital’s Salem Campus, and our circumstances are dire.” Officials say the hospital, which employs 1,800 people and has more than 600 patients, is full and temporarily stopped new admissions. The hospital treats some of the state’s most vulnerable: those found guilty except for insanity, civil commitment patients, and those ordered to the hospital by a judge on aid and assist orders. The staffing crisis at the hospital has persisted on and off throughout the pandemic. But the number of staff out on coronavirus-related leave has increased dramatically since February. Hospital Superintendent Dolly Matteucci told state lawmakers last month that nearly 700 employees had taken some form of COVID-19 leave, and from February to March there was a 45% increase in direct-care staff taking leave.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The Philadelphia Phillies will soon be able to pack their ballpark, and the city said Friday that it will lift nearly all its pandemic restrictions more than a week ahead of schedule, as new coronavirus infections decline to their lowest point since September. Capacity limits for businesses and events and social distancing rules will go away Wednesday. The city had planned to eliminate the restrictions June 11, but officials said the relatively low number of new cases and a test positivity rate of less than 3% made it possible to do it earlier than planned. The city’s indoor mask mandate and an 11 p.m. last call at bars and restaurants will continue until at least June 11, the city said. After the city’s announcement Friday, the Phillies announced that seating at Citizens Bank Park will be increased to 100% capacity starting next Friday, June 4, the club’s next home series.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A bill that gives the state’s nursing homes the highest staff-to-patient ratio in the nation has been signed into law by Gov. Daniel McKee, despite objections from industry leaders who said it will lead to nursing home closures. Advocates, however, say the staffing mandate will improve resident safety and lead to better pay for workers – problems that were highlighted during the coronavirus pandemic. “Today we take a step forward for staff, residents and their families,” McKee said during the signing ceremony Thursday. “Stronger staffing standards and funding for direct care staff will help raise the bar on resident care in our state.” The law establishes an average of at least 3.58 hours of direct nursing care per resident, per day, starting next Jan. 1 and 3.81 hours starting Jan. 1, 2023, which both sides agree is the highest staff-to-patient ratio in the nation. Nursing home owners warned of mass closings due to mounting losses and years of state cuts to Medicaid reimbursement. The Rhode Island Health Care Association, a coalition of nursing homes, said the bill attempts to legislate “the impossible.” Association President Scott Fraser said nursing homes already have a hard time filling open positions.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A top Democratic lawmaker wants the state to use some of its COVID-19 relief money to offer $1 million prizes to people who get vaccinated for the disease, similar to a program in Ohio. That type of program might get South Carolina, where just 36% of residents are fully vaccinated, out of the bottom 10 in the percentage of residents who have completed their COVID-19 immunizations, House Minority Leader Todd Rutherford said. “I think the message of the State of South Carolina should be clear. Get vaccinated: protect yourself, protect those around you, and you just might win a million dollars,” the Columbia Democrat said in a statement. Ohio saw an increase in vaccinations after announcing its prizes. South Carolina senators considered more modest incentives during April’s budget debate, including a $250 scholarship to college students who get vaccinated or $100 for the first 500,000 people to get a COVID-19 shot. Senate Minority Leader Brad Hutto compared it to how crazy people get when prizes worth only several dollars are offered at sporting events. “When they drop the things at the ball games, people jump all over themselves to get a Chick-fil-A sandwich gift card,” said Hutto, D-Orangeburg. Both proposals failed with minimal support from the Republican majority.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Sanford Health has closed its mass vaccination clinic on its Medical Center campus in the city. The health care system opened the clinic in the Sanford Imaginetics building in December. “And five and a half months later, we’ve seen over 102,000 patients at this location alone,” said Terri Carlson, executive director at Sanford Health. On the mass vaccination clinic’s final day Thursday, 14-year-old Rayna Goehring got her first dose, KELO-TV reports. “It feels good; hopefully it’ll stop me from getting COVID too,” Rayna said. “It shocked me how old they will allow people to get vaccinated.” She’s looking forward to when things are back to normal, especially at school, she said. “And finally it’s kind of starting to get back to normal, but it’s the new normal, people will say.” Carlson said Sanford still offers the vaccines at its primary care facilities in the Sioux Falls area. Getting to the point where the clinic can be closed is surreal, she said. “It’s emotional when I think about it,” Carlson said. “What we’ve been able to accomplish is very humbling, and it’s very rewarding to be able to see people being able to start living their lives again and seeing hugs again and families together and hearing all those good stories.”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The owner of a hat shop is dealing with pushback after posting a photo of herself to social media wearing a yellow patch resembling the Star of David with the words “not vaccinated.” The photo posted by Gigi Gaskins, owner of HatWrksNashville, shows her smiling and wearing the badge that looks similar in shape and color to those that the Nazis forced Jews to wear in Europe during the Holocaust. A caption with the photo advertised the patches for $5 apiece. “People are so outraged by my post? But are you outraged with the tyranny the world is experiencing?” Gaskins said on Instagram. “If you don’t understand what is happening, that is on you not me. I pay much more respect to history by standing up with the fallen than offering silence and compliance.” Gaskins later deleted the photo and issued an apology Saturday. “In NO WAY did I intend to trivialize the Star of David or disrespect what happened to millions of people. That is not who I am & what I stand for,” Gaskins wrote. “My intent was not to exploit or make a profit. My hope was to share my genuine concern & fear, and to do all that I can to make sure that nothing like that ever happens again. I sincerely apologize for any insensitivity.” The photo was shared widely on social media and prompted hat maker Stetson to announce it was pulling its products from the store. Hat maker Goorin Bros. of San Francisco said on Instagram that it was “horrified” by the patch.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A bill that would curb the governor’s powers during a pandemic has died after a committee of appointed members of the state House and Senate missed a midnight Saturday deadline to issue a compromise report on the measure. The initial version of what was known as the Pandemic Response Act would have created an oversight committee with powers to strike down any governor’s order, waiver or suspension. The legislation, a priority for House Speaker Dade Phelan, R-Beaumont, came in response to Gov. Greg Abbott’s use of sweeping powers under the state’s disaster declaration during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many conservative Republicans chafed at Abbott’s coronavirus restrictions, which followed the recommendations of public health experts, including state health officials and the governor’s medical advisers. Abbott’s pandemic performance, however, was not a central feature of debate about the bill. Phelan has called the legislation “the House’s blueprint for pandemic response,” and Rep. Dustin Burrows, R-Lubbock Republican, the top lieutenant of the speaker, carried the measure. The House version of the bill would have continued to allow the governor to suspend state laws and trump decisions by local officials, a change denounced by Democrats, including Austin Mayor Steve Adler.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Zion National Park has ended a shuttle ticket system that was implemented to combat the coronavirus pandemic. Masks are still required while in line and while riding the shuttle, but seating capacity will now be similar to pre-COVID-19 levels. The change was announced Thursday, shortly before the Memorial Day weekend, a busy time for visitation. More than 85,000 visitors are expected this year. Tickets are no longer required, though anyone who has already purchased one will be prioritized in the shuttle queue at or after the ticket’s time and date. Otherwise the shuttle will be boarding first-come, first-served during the day from the Zion Canyon Visitor Center. The shuttle ticket system was installed last July, with removed seats in the buses to allow for social distancing. Tickets were $1, which had increased to $2 apiece just two weeks ago.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Restaurants, bars and social clubs can now stay open past 10 p.m. Gov. Phil Scott announced Friday that he’s lifting the curfew because the rate of 18- to 29-year-olds getting vaccinated against COVID-19 had risen from less than 30% to over 50% in the past month. He said he expects Vermont to reach 80% of the eligible population – ages 12 and up – getting at least one dose by this week, at which time he will drop the remaining pandemic-related restrictions. As of Thursday, 77% of eligible Vermonters had been vaccinated, he said. But Vermont will not let up on efforts to get as many people vaccinated as possible, particularly with variants of the coronavirus circulating, including one report of a strain first identified in South Africa, said Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine. Walk-in vaccine clinics were held Friday at various sites and over the weekend, including at Thunder Road in Barre, and there will be more than 130 walk-in vaccine sites, including at many pharmacies, this week, Scott said. “Get vaccinated, and help protect yourself and those around you,” Levine said. “Because the good news is that vaccines are showing tremendous success against the virus in general, and this includes variant strains.”\n\nVirginia\n\nHarrisonburg: James Madison University has announced it will require students to provide verification that they have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 before returning to campus in the fall, according to a post on its website. That includes undergraduate, graduate, and full-time and part-time students who attend in-person classes or participate in in-person studies, research opportunities or any other on-campus activities. “I’m grateful that JMU is not only prioritizing the safety of professors and students by requiring the vaccine,” said Maddie Painter, a rising JMU sophomore. “But I’m also relieved to know that the local community will not have to worry about transmission of the virus from students.” Locally, JMU joins Mary Baldwin University and Bridgewater College in requiring its students to receive a COVID-19 vaccination before the start of fall semester. “Exceptions will be accommodated for medical conditions, religious beliefs or in cases where individuals agree in writing to the conditions set forth in an assumption-of-risk exemption,” JMU said in the post. “All individuals who do not complete vaccination for any reason must complete an Assumption of Risk form, which defines the mitigation strategies that will be required of students who have not been fully vaccinated.”\n\nWashington\n\nLynnwood: Bicycle store owners have raised concerns over a shortage as more people are buying bikes during the coronavirus pandemic. Gregg’s Cycle General Manager Marty Pluth said most of the racks are empty, and the remaining bikes have already been sold and are awaiting pickup, KING-TV reports. He said the wait to buy a bike is now at least four to six weeks. “I joke that we’ve become the toilet paper of the pandemic,” said Pluth, who operates the store in Lynnwood, about 15 miles north of Seattle. “People have been calling us from as far away as Oregon and California. The supply chain is pretty much broken.” Currently, Gregg’s Cycle only has about 10% of its normal inventory, with 8,000 bikes on backorder. Pluth attributes the increase in demand to the coronavirus. He said more people started buying bikes for transportation and exercise as mass transit and gyms closed to limit the spread of COVID-19. Harvy’s Bikes, also in Lynnwood, is seeing that increase in demand, too. Owner Harvy Massoud said the store is doing double the number of repairs but having trouble getting bike parts from manufacturers. Industry experts believe it will take another year or two before supply catches up with demand again.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state will step up its prizes for vaccines, enrolling all residents who have received a COVID-19 shot into a lottery for the chance to win a college scholarship, an F-150 pickup truck or cash rewards. Republican Gov. Jim Justice announced the plan for the new incentives Thursday, but more details are expected to be finalized this week. The governor has aimed to turn around a vaccination drive that drastically slowed down after a strong early start. “We’re going to make a few West Virginians millionaires before this is over,” Justice said. The program is expected to be paid through federal pandemic relief funds. Vaccinated residents ages 16 to 35 are already set to receive a $100 savings bond or gift card. Half of the state’s residents have received at least one vaccine dose, according to state data. Justice projects more than two-thirds of eligible residents will be vaccinated by the time the state removes its mask mandate June 20. He said he wanted to beat Ohio’s $1 million prize incentive program. “We’ll blow Ohio out of the water,” Justice said. Giveaways will include 10 Rocky Ridge version Ford F-150 trucks, which can cost around $80,000. The state will also follow its northwestern neighbor’s prizes, which include full-ride college scholarships and $1 million rewards.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWisconsin Dells: One of the state’s major tourist attractions was making do with fewer workers over Memorial Day weekend, hoping more will arrive during the summer. Tom Diehl, president of the Attractions Association and Tommy Bartlett Inc. in Wisconsin Dells, said they’re ready to welcome visitors, but labor is a problem. “We don’t have the young people that we used to have, and then we put on top of that the enhanced unemployment,” he said. Diehl said due to the pandemic, there’s also a shortage of so-called J1 workers from other countries who come to the United States on work visas. He said they typically get 3,200 employees from around the world, but they’re “going to be lucky” to get 1,000 workers this year, WMTV-TV reports. Noah’s Ark Water Park General Manager Roland Reyes said the park is working to get back to a full staff of 500 employees. He said he expects more J1 workers as the summer continues. “We’re very optimistic – so much so that we’ve added eight operating days to our calendar season,” Reyes said. The water park will now be open on eight Tuesdays from June 22 through Aug. 10, when it was previously planning to close. As embassies start to approve more applications, Diehl is hopeful new workers will come to start filling the gap.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A coronavirus outbreak among staff has indefinitely closed a local animal shelter to the public, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. The Cheyenne Animal Shelter said Sunday morning that positive tests among essential staffers and related quarantines took out too many workers to allow public access for the time being, but those pets already in custody “are being well taken care of and loved upon,” according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/01"}]}

The skill will be named after her.\n\nSAN JOSE, Calif. − Add another entry in the record books for Simone Biles.\n\nShe won her eighth U.S. gymnastics title Sunday night, breaking a tie with Alfred Jochim for most by a U.S. gymnast. And no offense to Jochim, who competed back in the 1920s and ‘30s, when rope climbing and Indian clubs were still parts of the sport, but what Biles is doing is even more impressive.\n\nShe won four in a row from 2013-16. After taking a break for more than a year following the Rio Olympics, Biles returned to win again in 2018 and 2019. After the world shut down because of the COVID pandemic in 2020, she won in 2021.\n\nBiles again took a break after the Tokyo Olympics, where she was forced to withdraw from the team final and four event finals when rising anxiety manifested itself in a case of “the twisties,” causing her to lose her sense of where she is in the air. Biles returned for the balance beam final and won a bronze medal.\n\nNow she’s back, and looking possibly better than ever in getting win No. 8.\n\nShe did the Yurchenko double pike on the first night of competition, and stuck the landing of her Biles I pass on floor exercise. She made an incredibly difficult beam routine look effortless, wracking up bonus points with one series of elements after another, as if to say, “Oh, you liked that? How about this one?”\n\nShe finished with two scores of 15 or higher – Shilese Jones was the only other gymnast to get a 15 – and an overall total of 118.450 points. That was almost four points ahead of Jones, who was the silver medalist in the all-around at last year’s world championships.\n\nTokyo alternate Leanne Wong was third, three-plus points behind Jones.\n\nSimone Biles' championship feeling\n\nSimone Biles didn’t really get serious about training until this spring. Yet, just two meets in, she’s as good as she’s ever been. Asked how that feels, Biles said she’s happy with how things are progressing because there were times she wasn’t sure if she’d be back competing.\n\nAnything else she’s feeling?\n\n“Hungry,” she said emphatically. “I’m so starving right now.”\n\n\"I've been doing it for so long, I feel like I don't think about numbers. I think about my performance,\" Simone Biles said on NBC when asked about her record-breaking title. \"I think overall, I hit 8 for 8 (clean events). So eight, I guess it's a lucky number this year.\"\n\nAfter her first day of competition Friday, Biles was asked on NBC what drives her at this point in her career, and she said she still has personal goals she wants to achieve. On Sunday, she was asked to specify those goals.\n\n\"I like to keep them personal, just so that I know what I'm aiming for. I think it's better that way,\" Biles told the network. \"I'm trying to move a little bit differently this year than I have in the past. I think it's working so far, so I'm going to keep it a little bit secretive.\"\n\nBut could she say if competing at the 2024 Paris Olympics is one of them?\n\n\"Not yet,\" Biles added.\n\nSimone Biles wraps up with magnificent floor routine\n\nWhat a way to cap her record-setting eighth U.S. title.\n\nSimone Biles brought the house down at the SAP Center with a magnificent floor routine. She stuck her Biles I tumbling pass – double layout with a half twist – like she was landing in fly paper, not needing to move in the slightest to control her landing.\n\nShe was beaming when she finished, and the crowd gave her a standing ovation. Jordan Chiles, her longtime training mate, was waiting to follow Biles on floor, and waved her hands at the crowd, asking them to cheer louder.\n\nBiles scored a 15.4 – more than a half-point better than what she got Friday night.\n\nShe finished with 118.45. Though the meet isn’t over, this will be Biles’ eighth national title, breaking a tie with Alfred Jochim for most of any U.S. gymnast.\n\nSimone Biles in control after three events\n\nWith only one event to go, Simone Biles has cracked the 100-point mark.\n\nBiles has 103.050 points so far, with only floor exercise to come. That’s one of her signature events, so expect her final score to be in the mid- to upper teens when she’s done.\n\nShilese Jones, the silver all-around medalist at last year’s world championships, is second, 3.5 points behind Biles. Tokyo alternate Leanne Wong is third.\n\nSimone Biles better on beam\n\nSimone Biles did what she wanted.\n\nA three-time world champion on balance beam, Biles made a couple of errors on the event on the first night of competition at the U.S. championships. Small errors, but she wasn’t happy about them and said she hoped for better on the second night of competition.\n\nUh, yeah.\n\nBiles scored a 14.85, 0.40 points better than she did Friday and far and away better than anyone else here will manage.\n\nBiles’ beam routine is incredibly difficult, loaded with elements that give her bonuses. Yet she makes it look easy, moving across the apparatus – which is 3 inches wide and 3 feet off the ground, mind you -- with more confidence than most of us walk on flat ground.\n\nOther Olympians have tough night\n\nThe other members of the Tokyo Olympic team aren’t faring as well as Simone Biles.\n\nJordan Chiles fell off uneven bars. Jade Carey came off balance beam and also went out of bounds on floor exercise, where she’s the Olympic champion.\n\nBoth will still have a chance to make the world team, however. The U.S. women are selecting their team after a training camp next month.\n\nSimone Biles in control at midway point\n\nSimone Biles is comfortably in control at the midway point of Day 2 at the U.S. gymnastics championships.\n\nThe four-time Olympic champion is more than three points ahead of Shilese Jones, last year’s all-around silver medalist at the world championships. Just how big a gap is that? Think of those early-season college football or basketball games and you get the idea.\n\nBiles didn’t do the Yurchenko double pike vault, opting for a Cheng instead. Her right ankle was taped, so it’s possible she was trying to protect it. She also scored lower on her uneven bars the first night after taking a hop on her dismount.\n\nWho is Simone Biles tied with?\n\nWho is Alfred Jochim, who currently shares the record for most U.S. gymnastics titles (seven) with Simone Biles? He competed in the 1920s and 1930s, and is so far the only U.S. gymnast to compete at four Olympics. He won his first six titles from 1925 to 1930, and then his last one in 1933.\n\nHe was inducted into USA Gymnastics’ Hall of Fame in 1959, its inaugural class.\n\nNo Yurchenko double pike for Simone Biles\n\nSimone Biles opted not to do the Yurchenko double pike on Day 2 of the U.S. gymnastics championships.\n\nIt wasn’t a big surprise, given she had her right ankle taped for vault and didn’t do it during warm-ups. And it didn’t really matter. Biles instead did the Cheng, the second-hardest vault any woman is doing these days, and scored a 14.85.\n\nThat’s 0.85 below what Biles scored the other night for the Yurchenko double pike, but it’s higher than what anyone scored on vault on Day 1.\n\n2008 Olympic team honored\n\nThe 2008 Olympic team was honored before the start of the women’s competition Sunday.\n\nThe Americans combined for 10 medals in Beijing. The U.S. women – Nastia Liukin, Shawn Johnson, Alicia Sacramone, Chellsie Memmel, Sam Peszek and Bridget Sloan – took silver in the team competition, and Liukin and Johnson went 1-2 in the all-around.\n\nLiukin also won silvers on uneven bars and balance beam and a bronze on floor. Johnson won gold on balance beam and a silver on floor exercise.\n\nThe U.S. men – Jonathan Horton, Sasha Artemev, Raj Bhavsar, Kevin Tan, Justin Spring and Joey Hagerty – won the bronze medal, the last time they've won a medal in the team competition at the Olympics. Horton also won a silver on high bar.\n\nOther prizes awarded\n\nUSA Gymnastics announced the men’s team for next year’s world championships and, no surprise, it will be led by new U.S. champion Asher Hong. Joining Hong will be U.S. silver medalist Khoi Young; U.S. bronze medalist Fred Richard; Tokyo Olympian Yul Moldauer; and Paul Juda, last year’s NCAA all-around champion.\n\nThe world championships are Sept. 30 to Oct. 8 in Antwerp, Belgium. The U.S. women’s team will be named after a selection camp next month.\n\nIn the junior women’s event, Hezly Rivera won her first all-around title while also claiming the top spot on uneven bars and balance beam. Kieryn Finnell was second and Izzy Stassi was third.\n\nWhen is Simone Biles competing at the US gymnastics championships?\n\nThe women's senior competition concludes Sunday night, starting at 6:30 p.m. ET.\n\nHow to watch Simone Biles on Sunday at the US gymnastics championships\n\nThe U.S. gymnastics championships will begin airing on television on NBC and CNBC at 7 p.m. ET, though not all events will be broadcast live. See the broadcast schedule at NBCSports.com.\n\nThe U.S. gymnastics championships will be live streamed on NBCSports.com, the NBC Sports app and Peacock.\n\nWhich other Olympians are competing at the US gymnastics championships?\n\nJade Carey, Jordan Chiles, Suni Lee are all competing in San Jose and each joined Biles at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nWhy did Simone Biles get a deduction during Friday's vault?\n\nThe Yurchenko double pike vault Simone Biles did Friday night was close to perfect. Her coach knew it. Fans knew it. The judges knew it, awarding Biles a 9.8, out of 10, for execution.\n\nYet, when her score posted, it included this: \"ND: -0.500.\" A deduction? For what?\n\nAs it turns out, it wasn’t anything Biles did, exactly. More like what she had. Which was coach Laurent Landi standing on the podium, ready to assist her if something went awry during the vault so difficult Biles is the only woman to ever do it in competition and few men even try.\n\nSimone Biles should be judged on what she can do, not what other gymnasts can't\n\nSimone Biles shouldn’t be punished for giving international gymnastics officials exactly what they wanted.\n\nThe four-time Olympic champion continues to push the boundaries of the sport and it appears the International Gymnastics Federation is going to continue to push back, refusing to give the skills she does their rightful value.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2023/08/25/simone-biles-us-gymnastics-championships-updates-suni-lee/70670508007/", "title": "USA gymnastics highlights: Simone Biles in control at championships", "text": "SAN JOSE, Calif. — Simone Biles is halfway to another national title.\n\nThe four-time Olympic champion finished the first night of competition at the U.S. gymnastics championships with 59.3 points, more than 2.5 points ahead of reigning world all-around silver medalist Shilese Jones. It’s also .2 better than Biles did at the U.S. Classic earlier this month, her first meet back since the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nCompetition concludes Sunday night.\n\n\"I'm pretty happy with the overall meet today,\" Biles told NBC after Friday's action. \"My goal for the weekend is just to hit 8-for-8 and then hopefully come in on Sunday and hit a little bit of a smoother beam routine.\"\n\nIf Biles is feeling any rust, she’s very quickly knocking it off. She had two wobbles on balance beam, and overcooked her signature pass, the Biles I, on floor exercise, taking a big hop out of bounds. But she found her groove on vault — and gave the crowd its money’s worth for the whole night with a near-perfect Yurchenko double pike.\n\nThe vault is so difficult few men even try it ­— with no bailout, a gymnast could land on his or her head if they’re even the slightest bit off — but Biles made it look effortless. She took just a small step on the landing and was rewarded with a 9.8 for execution.\n\nTaking it up a level:How Simone Biles separated herself from the competition with mastery of one skill\n\n\"No. No. No. It's not normal. She's not normal,\" Laurent Landi, one of Biles' coaches, said when asked if Biles making the Yurchenko double pike look easy was \"normal.\" \"But she's one of the rare gymnasts that goes to the meet and does it even better under the pressure.\"\n\nBiles followed with a massive Cheng, and her score on the event all but ended anyone’s chances of catching her on this night.\n\nWhen is Simone Biles competing again?\n\nThe women's senior competition concludes Sunday night, starting at 6:30 p.m. ET.\n\nSimone Biles cruises through uneven bars\n\nSimone Biles made what used to be her least-favorite event look easy. She cruised through uneven bars, her final event of the night, flowing from one skill into the next. Her 14.35 was the third-highest score of the night on the event, and she gave a satisfied nod as she left the podium, exchanging high-fives with her teammates.\n\nIt's Simone Biles, then everyone else\n\nWith one event to go, there's Simone Biles ... and the rest of the field. The four-time Olympic champion, competing at her first nationals since the Tokyo Games, has a 2.25-point lead over world all-around silver medalist Shilese Jones. That's almost as big as the gap between Jones and Jordan Chiles, who is in seventh place. Tokyo alternate Leanne Wong is third, followed by Skye Blakely, Tiana Sumanasekera, Joscelyn Roberson and Chiles.\n\nFun fact? Four of the gymnasts in the top seven are from World Champions Centre, the gym owned by Biles' parents.\n\nSimone Biles takes control with breathtaking vault\n\nBiles is the only woman to do the Yurchenko double pike in competition; she did it at the U.S. Classic earlier this month and at Classic in 2021. It's a vault so difficult few men even try it. There's no bailout for it, so if you don't do it right, you're likely to end up on your head. But Biles did it perfect, getting a perfect block off the table and great height in the air. She landed slightly off-center, but that's nitpicking.\n\nHer Cheng, the second-most difficult vault possible right now, was breathtaking. She flew so far she landed about midway back on the mat, though she did have to take a big hop back to control the landing. But, again, that's nitpicking.\n\nShe had a combined score of 15.7, something no woman here will be able to touch. On any event.\n\nSimone Biles opens up commanding lead\n\nAbout this being a competition? Yeah, so much for that. Simone Biles is now 2.25 points ahead of Shilese Jones after sticking her Yurchenko double pike and following it with a massive Cheng. Jones also struggled on balance beam, having to put her hand down on the apparatus to keep herself from falling. But even without the mistake, this would no longer be a contest.\n\nSimone Biles, Shilese Jones pulling away from pack\n\nMidway through the meet, Simone Biles and Shilese Jones have pulled away from the rest of the field. The four-time Olympic champion and the all-around silver medalist at last year's worlds are tied with 29.25 points. Skye Blakely is in third, 0.80 behind. Just how big a gap is that? Think of those early-season routs in college football and you get the picture.\n\nSimone Biles' vault upcoming\n\nHold the planes at San Jose airport, please. Simone Biles is on vault in the next rotation, and we expect to see her do the Yurchenko double pike, a vault no other woman has done in competition and one so difficult few men even try it. She was also warming up a Cheng before the meet, which would mean she's going for the vault title here. Gymnasts have to do two vaults, from different families, in order to be in the running for the vault title.\n\nSimone Biles floor exercise\n\nThis is only Biles' second competition since the Tokyo Olympics, and her flaws are not a big surprise. She had way too much power on her third tumbling pass on floor, the Biles I, and took a big step out of bounds. But the rest of the routine was impressive, getting so much height on her tumbling passes you could have parked a mini Cooper below her. The crowd loved it, letting out shrieks of delight at every pass.\n\nSimone Biles in tight battle with Shilese Jones\n\nWell, well. We have a competition on our hands. Simone Biles is tied with world all-around silver medalist Shilese Jones midway through the second rotation with 29.25 points. Jones was flawless on uneven bars, her specialty, while Biles had small errors on both balance beam and floor exercise. But Biles still has vault to go, where she could put some distance between her and the rest of the field.\n\nSuni Lee vault\n\nOlympic champion Sunisa Lee is only doing two events at nationals, vault and balance beam, as she recovers from a kidney issue. She took a big hop back on the landing of her vault, a Yurchenko full, but she looked good in the air and her legs were glued together. Her low score — she got a 13.35 — reflects the lesser difficulty of the vault, but she scored a 9.15 in execution\n\nSimone Biles leads after first rotation\n\nAfter scoring a 14.45 on balance beam, Simone Biles has a .050 lead over Skye Blakely after the first rotation. While that appears close, Blakely started on uneven bars, her best event. Shilese Jones, the silver medalist in the all-around at last year's world championships, is third at 14.350.\n\nSimone Biles balance beam routine\n\nSimone Biles recovered from a shaky start to her balance beam routine. Her right foot was slightly off-balance on her mount, causing her to wobble before she regained her balance. She also had to come out of her crouch as she neared completion of the third revolution in her wolf turn. They weren't huge deductions, and the rest of her routine was solid. Her 14.45 put her in familiar territory: in first place.\n\nWhen is Simone Biles competing again?\n\nSimone Biles will return to action Friday night when the women's senior competition begins at 8 p.m. ET.\n\nWant to keep track of where Simone Biles is tonight?\n\nShe starts the night on balance beam, then moves to floor exercise, goes to vault and finishes Day 1 of the national championships on uneven bars. She's the final competitor on bars, too.\n\nSimone Biles met with cheers\n\nBiles was greeted with loud cheers and screams when she was introduced Friday night in San Jose, CA. Biles grinned and waved to acknowledge fans following the applause from the crowd, which includes Biles' mother, dad and brother.\n\nReigning Olympic champion Sunisa Lee and Jade Carey, the Olympic champion on floor exercise, also got enthusiastic cheers from the crowd at the SAP Center.\n\nIs Simone Biles sending a message?\n\nBiles and two of her World Champions Centre teammates wore purple leotards with \"But still I rise\" on the back for warmups Friday afternoon. The line is adapted from Maya Angelou's poem, \"Still I Rise.\"\n\nIt's not clear why Biles chose that line for the leotard, which is part of her personal GK collection, but the message was also on her competition leotard. Biles' family wore purple T-shirts that also said \"But still I rise,\" too.\n\nThe poem is a tribute to persevering in the face of hardship and criticism, and Biles is no stranger to that. These are her first national championships since the Tokyo Olympics, where anxiety manifested itself in a case of \"the twisties\" and forced her to withdraw one event into the team final.\n\nBiles missed four individual finals before returning for the balance beam final, where she won a bronze medal.\n\nHow to watch Simone Biles tonight\n\nFriday night's action at the U.S. Gymnastics championships can be seen on Peacock.\n\nUSA Gymnastics doesn't know who called Simone Biles a 'gold-medal token.' That's unacceptable.\n\nSimone Biles deserved better from USA Gymnastics. Still does.\n\nHer being treated like a commodity by someone with USA Gymnastics — Biles said she was called a \"gold-medal token\" — deserves answers, not ignorance.\n\nSimone Biles should be judged on what she can do, not what other gymnasts can't\n\nSimone Biles shouldn’t be punished for giving international gymnastics officials exactly what they wanted.\n\nThe four-time Olympic champion continues to push the boundaries of the sport and it appears the International Gymnastics Federation is going to continue to push back, refusing to give the skills she does their rightful value.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/06/02/simone-biles-us-gymnastics-championships-live-results/73920585007/", "title": "US gymnastics championships: Simone Biles wins record ninth ...", "text": "FORT WORTH, Texas – By the time Simone Biles rolled backwards onto the mat on her vault Sunday night, the error didn't even matter. Her lead at the 2024 U.S. championships was so massive, and her eponymous vault so difficult, that her victory was already all but assured.\n\nBiles won her record ninth all-around national title Sunday night, cruising to victory once again at Dickies Arena en route to what will surely be a third trip to the Olympic Games. Over two nights of competition, she recorded the highest score on all four events. And her all-around margin of victory – 5.9 points – was the gymnastics equivalent of a rout.\n\nBiles, 27, will now look ahead to the U.S. Olympic trials at the end of this month – the moment when she will learn who her four teammates on Team USA will be.\n\n\"I couldn't be more proud of how I'm doing at this time in the year,\" Biles said on NBC after her win. \"Just gaining that confidence over and over, getting myself back in front of a crowd and just doing what I do in practice.\"\n\nSkye Blakely, who finished second, was among several women who boosted their candidacies for Paris – displaying the combination of consistency and ability that the selection committee will be seeking as it assembles the 2024 Olympic team.\n\nSuni Lee, the reigning all-around Olympic champion, also had a strong showing – particularly on her two best events, uneven bars and balance beam. On Sunday, she improved her scores on those two apparatuses alone by nearly a full point from Friday's opening round. She finished fourth.\n\nKayla DiCello (third) and Jordan Chiles (fifth) rounded out the top five.\n\nHere's a recap of everything else you missed on the final night of the 2024 U.S. championships.\n\nSkye Blakely shines at home\n\nBlakely, 19, was perhaps the most impressive gymnast in the senior women's competition Friday night outside of Biles. And she finished just a quarter of a point off that all-around score on Sunday.\n\nBlakely received a thundering ovation when she stepped onto the podium alongside Biles at the end of the night, celebrating one of the biggest moments of her senior career to date in front of what amounts to a hometown crowd; Blakely resides in Frisco, Texas, just a short drive east of Dickies Arena in Fort Worth.\n\nSuni Lee comes up big on key events\n\nLee had a disappointing vault to start her Sunday night, sitting down on the landing after appearing to either trip or slip in the run up. But she didn't let it affect her − and thrived on her two most important events.\n\nThough Lee is the reigning all-around Olympic champion, it's her scores on balance beam and uneven bars that would be most valuable to Team USA in Paris. So it was a positive sign that Lee fared well on both events on both nights, finishing second only to Biles on beam and placing fourth on bars − even with a routine that is well short of her top-end difficulty.\n\nRecapping Jordan Chiles' night and wardrobe\n\nAfter rocking a Beyonce-inspired leotard on Friday night, Chiles arrived on the floor Sunday wearing a white Nike trenchcoat.\n\nA veteran of the 2021 Olympic team and close friend and training partner of Biles', Chiles improved slightly on the second night of competition, earning a silver medal on uneven bars and placing in the top-five on vault. She's hardly a lock to make the Paris team at this point, but she's put herself squarely in the mix.\n\nShilese Jones, Kaliya Lincoln will compete at Olympic trials\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas − Moments after competition ended Sunday night, USA Gymnastics announced that it has approved the petitions by Shilese Jones and Kaliya Lincoln to compete at the U.S. Olympic trials later this month.\n\nJones, who has generally been the second-best U.S. all-arounder behind Simone Biles, withdrew from the U.S. championships with a shoulder injury. Kaliya Lincoln participated in the first two rotations Friday night before bowing out.\n\nThey are expected to join Biles, runner-up Skye Blakely and at least eight others at trials, which will take place in Minneapolis starting June 27. − Tom Schad\n\nSimone Biles wins every event, caps night with solid uneven bars routine\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas − Winning a ninth U.S. title wasn’t enough for Simone Biles. She won every event, too.\n\nBiles capped her night with a solid routine on uneven bars, her “weakest” event. She flitted effortlessly between the bars and worked quickly going from one skill to the next. She was a little off-center on her upgraded dismount, a double-twisting, double somersault, and needed to take a step to secure herself. But that’s a minor blemish.\n\nShe scored a 14.4 and her combined total of 29.050 over the two nights put her in first place on the event ahead of Skye Blakely.\n\nThis is the second time Biles has swept all of the titles at nationals. She also did it in 2018. −Nancy Armour\n\nSimone Biles has commanding lead with one rotation to go\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas − What Simone Biles does is so difficult, her scores are still well above anyone else’s even with an error.\n\nBiles overcooked her Yurchenko double pike, also known as the Biles II on vault, and rolled onto her back. She’d been landing them short in warmups and might have been trying to make sure she didn’t do that when it counted.\n\nNo matter. Biles scored a 15, more than a half-point better than anyone else so far Sunday night. Her second vault, a Cheng, was cleaner, with just a small step on the dismount.\n\nBiles has a commanding lead going into the final rotation, uneven bars. −Nancy Armour\n\nSuni Lee celebrates her 14.900 on beam\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas − Several accomplished veterans have fallen on balance beam tonight, including Jade Carey, Jordan Chiles and Leanne Wong. But Suni Lee did not join them.\n\nLee brushed off a few minor wobbles to dramatically improve on her beam score from the first night, putting together a generally clean routine that left her pumping her fists in celebration. Her score of 14.900 was one tenth of a point higher than Simone Biles'.\n\n\"I don't want to overstate how big that beam routine was,\" NBC analyst John Roethlisberger said on air, adding that consistency on bars and beam will be the biggest key for Lee to make it to Paris. − Tom Schad\n\nSimone Biles steps out of bounds on floor but still in command\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas − Simone Biles isn't perfect.\n\nBiles took a small step out of bounds on her first tumbling pass on floor exercise, a triple-twisting double somersault that's also known as the Biles II. Still, this is only the third time she's done her floor routine in competition this year, and it's looking more and more polished each time she does it. Her landings were cleaner and her smiles seemed to be coming more naturally as she did her dance moves. When she stepped into the corner, she looked directly at the camera and flashed a big grin.\n\nBiles' score was a 15.1, just 0.1 lower than it was Friday night. The deduction for stepping out on that first pass was the difference. Still, she's in firm control, and is two more routines from her ninth U.S. title, which would extend her own record. −Nancy Armour\n\nShilese Jones is sitting out nationals, but injury is improving\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas − Shilese Jones, who has generally been the second-best all-arounder behind Simone Biles, isn't competing this week because of a shoulder injury. But she was nevertheless in the house Sunday to cheer everyone else on, and she indicated that her shoulder is improving.\n\n\"There's been a little bit of progress for today,\" Jones said in a televised interview on NBC. \"I woke up and it's feeling a little bit better than this whole week. It's been a little bit stiff, but some progression today.\"\n\nAsked about what it's like to take in the national championships from the stands, Jones said she's still nervous.\n\n\"I'm shaking for literally everyone,\" she said. \"I'm like, I know they got it, but the nerves are definitely still there.\" − Tom Schad\n\nSuni Lee looks relieved after scoring 14.500 on uneven bars\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas − Suni Lee was practicing handstands in the entryway of an arena tunnel until moments before her turn on uneven bars, looking a bit unsettled after her disappointing vault. Perhaps noticing that, Simone Biles walked from the other side of the floor to give Lee some words of encouragement. \"You got this!\" Biles yelled as Lee started her routine.\n\nLee proceeded to notch a score of 14.500 in what is one of her signature events − two-tenths higher than what she scored on Friday night. She appeared visibly relieved after her dismount, smiling as she shared a hug with coach Jess Graba. − Tom Schad\n\nSuni Lee takes substantial deduction on vault\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas − Suni Lee's night got off to an inauspicious start. The reigning Olympic all-around champion appeared to slip on her vault and then sat down during her landing, resulting in a substantial deduction.\n\nLee ultimately received a score of 12.150, which was nearly two full points lower than the 14.000 she received on the first night. She then left the floor briefly before returning with Simone Biles, who gave her a hug before they returned to their separate apparatuses. −Tom Schad\n\nSimone Biles starts Night 2 strong on beam\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas − Gymnastics is hard. Not that you would realize that from watching Simone Biles.\n\nBiles opened the second night of competition at the U.S. championships on balance beam Sunday night, and she ticked off one big skill after another. The beam is just 4 inches wide and is 4 feet in the air, but Biles looked as if she was standing on flat ground.\n\nThe only bobble was a hop forward on her dismount, but it hardly mattered. She scored a 14.8, the same score she got on Friday night when she had the highest mark of the meet on the event. –– Nancy Armour\n\nNBC viewers won't see Simone Biles' first rotation live\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas − Tonight's competition is being streamed live on Peacock and NBC... well, mostly anyways.\n\nWhile the first rotation began at 6:45 p.m. ET, the television coverage wasn't scheduled to begin until 15 minutes later − meaning American television viewers missed out on seeing Simone Biles' routine on balance beam as it happened. They also missed the first performances of the night from Suni Lee (vault), Jordan Chiles (balance beam) and Kayla DiCello (floor exercise), among others. − Tom Schad\n\nWhen does Simone Biles compete at the U.S. gymnastics championships?\n\nSimone Biles will compete in Session 2.

But the announcement of Gabby Douglas’ withdrawing was not a surprise after Douglas' rough outings in her first two competitions since the Rio Olympics in 2016. She fell twice on uneven bars, her signature event, at the American Classic on April 27. She looked better in training ahead of the U.S. Classic on May 18, but scratched after one event after again falling twice on bars. –– Nancy Armour\n\nKaliya Lincoln scratches from second night of nationals\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas − Kaliya Lincoln has scratched from the second night of competition after departing early Friday night. USA Gymnastics said in a social media post that she has already petitioned for an invitation to the Olympic trials later this month.\n\nLincoln, 18, earned a a 12.700 on uneven bars and 12.300 on balance beam Friday before withdrawing. Her strongest event is floor exercise, where she finished second only to Simone Biles at last year's national championships. − Tom Schad\n\nWhat's at stake at the U.S. gymnastics championships\n\nBecause this weekend's event is the last one before the U.S. Olympic gymnastics trials, it is an important showcase for everyone who is hoping to book a ticket to the 2024 Paris Games.\n\nOn the women's side, the top two all-around finishers at the U.S. championships will automatically earn a spot at the Olympic trials, where they will be joined by a minimum of 10 other athletes invited at the discretion of USA Gymnastics. Of the 12 or more who compete at the Olympic trials, only five will make Team USA, not including alternates. – Tom Schad\n\nWhen are the U.S. Gymnastics Olympic Trials?\n\nJune 27-30 in Minneapolis.\n\nHow did Simone Biles do on Night 1\n\nBiles recorded her best all-around score of this Olympic cycle to date: 60.450. It’s the first time Biles has scored above 60 since 2021.\n\n\"That was a goal of hers. Very happy with her routines, attitudes — everything was really good,\" said Cecile Landi, who coaches Biles along with husband Laurent.\n\nHow to see live results from the U.S. gymnastics championships\n\nUSA Gymnastics will be providing live results of the women's competition, including Biles' pursuit of a ninth all-around national championship, on its website here. –– Tom Schad\n\nMessage from Gabby\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas − Gabby Douglas is cheering on her would-be competitors Sunday night.\n\nThe three-time Olympic gold medalist took to Instagram earlier in the day to thank fans for their support during her comeback, and send good vibes to the gymnasts at the U.S. championships. Douglas had hoped to be among them, but she announced her withdrawal Wednesday and said in her Instagram post that she’d hurt her foot during training.\n\n“this may be the end of this chapter but not the end of my gymnastics story,” Douglas, the all-around champion at the 2012 Olympics in London, wrote. “thank you all for being with me on this journey and lifting me up on my lowest days i love you all so much!\n\n“sending all the best to the girls tonight! always cheering usa on!” –– Nancy Armour\n\nTrinity Thomas scratches for Night 2\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas − Trinity Thomas, who returned to elite-level gymnastics this year after her final season at Florida, scratched the last three events on the first night of competition Friday after crashing twice on floor exercise. She warmed up on uneven bars Sunday but did not compete.\n\nThomas was the NCAA all-around champion in 2002, the same year she won the first of consecutive Honda Sports Awards as the nation's best college gymnast. –– Nancy Armour", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/05/31/simone-biles-us-gymnastics-championships-live-results/73920118007/", "title": "Simone Biles highlights: US gymnastics championships results", "text": "FORT WORTH, Texas – Once again, for the umpteenth time, it's Simone Biles at the top and everyone else fighting for second.\n\nBiles appears set to cruise to what would be her ninth all-around national title after putting on a clinic on the first night of the U.S. gymnastics championships in Fort Worth, Texas, on Friday.\n\nNot only is Biles sitting a full three points ahead of the rest of the field entering the second half of competition Sunday, but she recorded the highest single score on each of the four apparatuses – a rare feat at an event of this caliber, even for a gymnast as dominant as Biles, the reigning world all-around champion and 2016 Olympic gold medalist.\n\n\"Simone, she's like an artist. She's like a musician. People want to show up to see greatness, and she embodies it in every way,\" NBC analyst John Roethlisberger said after her 15.200 on floor exercise.\n\nThe non-Biles division is where it gets interesting, however – especially given the absence of Shilese Jones, who withdrew earlier Friday to rest a shoulder injury.\n\nSkye Blakely, 19, is sitting in second place through the first day of competition with a score of 57.050 – thanks in part to a massive vault, which notched a score of 15.000.\n\n\"My goal I wrote down was actually 56 in the all-around so 57 really tops it and I'm excited about that,\" Blakely said. \"That's my first 15 ever.\"\n\nBut there is a pack of veterans right behind Blakely, including Kayla DiCello (56.850), Suni Lee (55.750) and Leanne Wong (55.550).\n\nHere is a recap of everything else you might have missed Friday:\n\nHow did Simone Biles do?\n\nBiles, 27, recorded her best all-around score of this Olympic cycle to date: 60.450. It’s the first time Biles has scored above 60 since 2021.\n\n\"That was a goal of hers. Very happy with her routines, attitudes — everything was really good,\" said Cecile Landi, who coaches Biles along with husband Laurent.\n\n\"Nothing is normal. But with the amount of work that she does, it's expected, with the talent that she has,\" Landi said. \"I feel really lucky to be around her, that's for sure.\"\n\nHow did Suni Lee do?\n\nIn her first all-around competition in more than a year, Lee recorded a score of 55.750 on Friday night, which was good for fourth. More importantly, she appeared strong on her two best events – uneven bars and balance beam – and scored well even with routines that are not as difficult as ones she's done previously.\n\nIf Lee can replicate this performance Sunday, it could significantly boost her odds of punching a ticket to Paris.\n\nThe women's competition will continue Sunday night and be televised live on NBC. The top two all-around finishers (Biles and someone else) will automatically qualify for the U.S. Olympic trials in Minneapolis roughly one month from now.\n\nFor most of the top gymnasts in the mix, however, this weekend isn't really about a trials invite. It's about continuing to show their strengths and prove their consistency to the selection committee that will ultimately pick the four women who will join Biles in Paris.\n\nDon't take Simone Biles' greatness for granted\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas — Most athletes are at their peak for a couple of years. If they’re lucky, they can stretch it to four or five. Only the singular talents — LeBron, Serena, Tiger, Brady — can sustain a level of excellence over their entire careers.\n\nSimone Biles is deservedly in their company.\n\nAt 27 years old, and at her ninth U.S. championships, she looks as good as she did in, well, pick a year. Any year. Actually, she’s even better, because she continues to push herself and the boundaries of her sport with skills so difficult other women don’t even bother trying them.\n\nRead Nancy Armour's full column here.\n\nSimone Biles puts up another big score on floor\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas – The more Simone Biles does a routine, the better it gets.\n\nTwo weeks after nearly landing off the podium on her Biles II – a triple-twisting double somersault that's the opening pass in her floor routine – Biles had it under control Friday. She had only the smallest hops on some of her other passes, and had coach Laurent Landi clapping in satisfaction. Her score of 15.2 was her second above 15 of the night – to give you an idea of how impressive that is, the only other gymnast to get above a 15 was Skye Blakely, on vault – and gave her a total of 60.45. — Nancy Armour\n\nSuni Lee closes strong on uneven bars\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas – Suni Lee capped the night with uneven bars, the event in which she won Olympic bronze in Tokyo. And it didn't disappoint.\n\nIn what NBC analyst John Roethlisberger called \"the single most important routine\" of the night in terms of piecing together the Olympic team, Lee recorded a score of 14.300 – including an execution mark of 8.500. And that's without being close to her full difficulty.\n\nSkye Blakely also ended the night on a high note, with a 15.000 on vault. She was the only athlete besides Biles to eclipse the 15-point mark on an apparatus tonight. — Tom Schad\n\nSimone Biles dazzles on beam\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas — It’s a disservice to Simone Biles that, because she’s as good as she is, and has been for so long, what she does gets taken for granted.\n\nLike her beam routine Friday night. She flipped and twisted on the 4-inch-wide beam more easily than most people walk on flat ground, one skill flowing seamlessly into the next. Other gymnasts could spend years training just that event and they still wouldn’t make it look as easy as she does.\n\nAnd this wasn’t easy, by the way. Her 6.4 difficulty score was, by far, the highest in the field and her 14.8 was better than most gymnasts got on vault, where scores are highest.\n\nThe score boosted Biles’ total to 45.250 through three events. She finishes the night on floor exercise, putting 60 within reach.\n\nIn the non-Simone division, Skye Blakely is second and Olympic champion Suni Lee has moved up to third. — Nancy Armour\n\nWhy Suni Lee should be 'very pleased' with vault performance\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas – Suni Lee looked relieved after landing her vault, small hop and all. In a step up from her vault at the U.S. Classic two weeks ago, Lee went with a Yurchenko double full Friday night and received a score of 14.000 – keeping her firmly in the all-around mix, non-Biles division.\n\n\"I think Suni Lee is going to be very pleased to see that number,\" NBC analyst Sam Peszek said on the Peacock broadcast.\n\nThe absence of Shilese Jones has led to a crowded pack near the top of the leaderboard through three rotations, with Skye Blakely, Jade Carey, Jordan Chiles and Kayla DiCello all separated by less than a point, with Lee not far behind. — Tom Schad\n\nKaliya Lincoln scratched from vault and floor\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas – Kaliya Lincoln's night is over. According to USA Gymnastics' live scoring system, Lincoln scratched from vault and floor exercise – the latter of which has traditionally been her strongest event.\n\nLincoln, 18, recorded a 12.700 on uneven bars and 12.300 on balance beam – thanks in part to a fall.\n\nTrinity Thomas, who starred collegiately at Florida, has also scratched, according to USA Gymnastics. — Tom Schad\n\nSimone Biles out in front at halfway point: Day 1 scoring update\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas – At the halfway point, Simone Biles is in the lead and there’s starting to be some separation in the “non-Simone” division.\n\nSkye Blakely is second, 1.6 points behind Biles with 28.85 points. Tokyo Olympian Jordan Chiles is third, 0.2 points back and Kayla DiCello is at 28.60 points.\n\nThis is only the first day of competition, however. Day 2 is Sunday. — Nancy Armour\n\nJade Carey has strong showing on floor and vault\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas – Jade Carey knows that her best chance of making the team for Paris will be with strong scores on floor and vault. So far, so good.\n\nAfter a solid showing with a floor exercise that has potential to score even higher, Carey hit a Cheng vault that, despite a small hop backwards on the landing, netted a score of 14.500 – the best of the night so far outside of Simone Biles' famed Yurchenko double pike.\n\nJordan Chiles, another veteran of the 2021 Olympic team, also impressed in her second rotation with a 14.500 on uneven bars, while Suni Lee competed on floor for just the second time in a year. She earned a score of 13.250, the third-best of the evening at the halfway point. — Tom Schad\n\nSimone Biles puts up great score in her 'worst' event\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas – Even Simone Biles was happy with that one.\n\nBiles crushed her set on uneven bars, her “worst” and least-favorite event. When she trotted off the podium, she pumped both her fists. She scored a 14.65, which is likely to be the highest score of the night event with Shilese Jones out of the competition. — Nancy Armour\n\nSimone Biles takes early lead\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas – We’re only one event in, but the person at the top of the standings isn’t likely to change the rest of the night.\n\nSimone Biles, who is seeking her ninth U.S. title, has a 1.3-point lead over Kayla DiCello on Friday night. Granted, she started on vault, one of her best and highest-scoring events. But that’s a lot of ground for anyone to make up.\n\nThe non-Simone division is much closer. There are eight gymnasts within a half-point of each other, including reigning Olympic champion Suni Lee and fellow Tokyo Olympian Jordan Chiles. — Nancy Armour\n\nSimone Biles putting on a show early\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas – Simone Biles gave the crowd a show in her first event.\n\nBiles did her trademark Yurchenko double pike vault – also known as the Biles II, for those keeping track of all the skills she has named for her – and landed almost cleanly. She needed to take one step and slide her other foot a bit, but she was still rewarded with a 9.4 for execution and a 15.8 overall.\n\nThe crowd oohed and aahed, knowing what Biles is doing is extraordinary, even if she makes it look the opposite. The vault is so difficult other women aren’t even training it, but Biles has perfected it to the point that coach Laurent Landi is no longer standing on the podium when she does it, a safety measure that cost her a half-point deduction last season. — Nancy Armour\n\nSuni Lee off to solid start\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas – Competing in all-around for the first time in more than a year, Suni Lee got off to a solid start on what has historically been one of her best events: Balance beam.\n\nLee, the reigning Olympic all-around champion, barely put a foot wrong in the first half of her routine but had two wobbles in the latter half – only just hanging on at the end of the beam at the end of her aerial series. But a smooth dismount left her with a score of 14.200, which led the field at the end of the first rotation.\n\nElsewhere, Kayla DiCello and Skye Blakely – both of whom have some work to do to secure a spot on the Paris team – impressed in back-to-back routines on uneven bars. DiCello notched a 14.500, with Blakely just a shade off at 14.400. — Tom Schad\n\nWhen does Simone Biles compete at the U.S. gymnastics championships?\n\nSimone Biles will compete in Session 2.

More than 50 athletes will also be competing in the junior competition.\n\nFriday, 2:45 p.m. to 5 p.m. ET: Senior Women (Session 1), Day 1\n\nFriday, 7:45 p.m. to 10 p.m. ET: Senior Women (Session 2), Day 1\n\nSaturday, 8 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. ET: Senior Men, Day 2\n\nSunday, 1:45 p.m. to 4 p.m. ET: Senior Women (Session 1), Day 2\n\nSunday, 6:45 p.m. to 9 p.m. ET: Senior Women (Session 2), Day 2\n\nWhere are the 2024 US gymnastics championships?\n\nThe U.S. championships will run from Thursday to Sunday at Dickies Arena, located a few miles west of downtown Fort Worth. — Tom Schad\n\nSimone Biles is a lock for Paris Olympics. But who's going to join her?\n\nSo long as she’s healthy, Simone Biles is going to the Paris Olympics. The obvious was reaffirmed with her big win at the U.S. Classic in mid-May where Biles finished almost two points ahead of Shilese Jones, an all-around medalist at the last two world championships. Biles brought back some of her big skills for the first time since the Tokyo Games, too. There are four other spots on the U.S. team, however, and performances at Classic gave an indication of who will be joining Biles in Paris. Here is Nancy Armour’s look at the contenders.\n\nWhat happened to Shilese Jones?\n\nJones, an all-around medalist at the last two world championships, announced Friday afternoon that she was withdrawing from nationals because of a shoulder injury.\n\nJones tore the labrum in her right shoulder in 2022 and has had problems with it off and on since then. She said Wednesday that it flared up after the U.S. Classic two weeks ago and by last Friday she “barely could raise my arm,” but was going to try and compete here.\n\n“It hurt. I’m not going to lie,” Jones said when asked how it felt after her first training session here Tuesday night.\n\nJones said she’ll petition for a spot at the Olympic trials, and it’s almost sure to be accepted. In addition to her international success, she was second to Biles at last year’s nationals and again at Classic.\n\nThe women’s competition at trials begins in four weeks, June 28.\n\nWhy did Gabby Douglas pull out?\n\nGabby Douglas, 2012 Olympic champion, withdrew from this weekend's national championships, ending her hopes of making the U.S. team for this summer's Paris Games after an almost eight-year absence from competition. Douglas told ESPN she'd injured her ankle this week in training. Her agent, Lowell Taub, declined further comment.\n\nWhat's at stake at the U.S. gymnastics championships\n\nBecause this weekend's event is the last one before the U.S. Olympic gymnastics trials, it is an important showcase for everyone who is hoping to book a ticket to the 2024 Paris Games.\n\nOn the women's side, the top two all-around finishers at the U.S. championships will automatically earn a spot at the Olympic trials, where they will be joined by a minimum of 10 other athletes invited at the discretion of USA Gymnastics. Of the 12 or more who compete at the Olympic trials, only five will make Team USA, not including alternates. – Tom Schad\n\nWhen are the U.S. Gymnastics Olympic Trials?\n\nJune 27-30 in Minneapolis.\n\nSuni Lee: What to know\n\nThe reigning Olympic all-around champion had the highest score on balance beam at the U.S. Classic in mid-May. While she didn’t compete in uneven bars, her signature event, what she’s shown in training has been impressive and would give the United States three big scores – her, Jones and Biles – on the event.\n\nLee also plans to do an upgraded vault at nationals, and her floor routine should be more polished. Classic was the first time she’d competed floor in more than a year, since a kidney ailment derailed her final season at Auburn and severely limited her training.\n\n\"It was really important for me to go out there and fight those demons, compete a floor routine,\" Lee said. \"It’s been a while. Obviously not the routine that I want for the upcoming competitions but I really just wanted to get out there and compete again.\"\n\nIf she does, she gives the Americans a third formidable all-arounder, something few other countries can match.\n\n\"It’s going to come down to bars and beam for me,\" she said. \"… I’m hungrier to be able to be in the all-around. That’s been the main priority but we all know, I’m the strongest on those two.\" –– Nancy Armour\n\nJade Carey: What to know\n\nThe Americans need another big vault score, and Carey would provide that. She’s also strong on floor, where she’s the reigning Olympic champion. Carey was training an upgraded floor routine this week. –– Nancy Armour\n\nJordan Chiles: What to know\n\nThe Tokyo Olympian made a case for herself at the U.S. Classic with a solid performance on all four events. Chiles might not give the United States a massive score on any one event, but she doesn’t leave any holes, either.\n\n\"I think realizing that I had the potential,\" Chiles said of the difference between this season and last, when she struggled with the transition from NCAA to elite.\n\n\"A lot of the time, you say you want to do something and you never know what's going to happen, because there's a lot of eyes on you and expectations,\" Chiles added. \"When you put that aside, you realize, 'I'm going to just step forward into it and be the person I need to be and put every effort I need into each and every practice.'\" –– Nancy Armour", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2023/08/05/simone-biles-live-updates-return-competitive-gymnastics-2023-us-classic/70531328007/", "title": "Simone Biles wins return to competitive gymnastics at 2023 US ...", "text": "HOFFMAN ESTATES, Ill. — Once again, at long last, Simone Biles strode into an arena Saturday night. She flipped and flew and, perhaps most importantly, twisted. She was dominant, and she smiled. It looked like a weight had been lifted off her shoulders.\n\n\"Did it look like I was having fun? Oh thank God,\" Biles said afterward. \"I thought I was going to (expletive) bricks, but that's good.\"\n\nYes, the proverbial GOAT of U.S. gymnastics is officially back.\n\nTwo years after bowing out of the 2021 Tokyo Olympics due to mental health issues, Biles made her competitive return at the U.S. Classic in a suburb of Chicago on Saturday night. And, to the surprise of no one, she began her comeback tour with a win.\n\nIn front of a packed crowd and a flock of NBC television cameras, Biles ran away from a field in which several of her closest U.S. rivals − including Olympic teammates Jade Carey, Jordan Chiles and Suni Lee − competed in only some of the four events. Her all-around score of 59.10 was a full five points clear of runner-up Leanne Wong − and more than two points higher than the total with which Brazil's Rebeca Andrade claimed the 2022 world championship.\n\n\"I feel really good about where I am right now, mentally and physically,\" Biles said. \"I still think there are some things to work on, (mistakes) throughout the night in my routines. But for the first meet back, I would say it went pretty well.\"\n\nMost everyone who watched her at NOW Arena would probably say the same thing.\n\nExactly 732 days after her last competitive appearance, on the balance beam at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, Biles reminded the world of her brilliance − and proved that it hasn't dimmed. The 26-year-old star − who already has four gold medals, 19 world championships and 24 national titles to her name − was steady, then at times spectacular. She pulled off at least one of the skills that bears her name, and another − the famed Yurchenko double pike vault − that will become eponymous in the not-too-distant future.\n\n\"I competed at a high level, and watching her do this sport − it just amazes me,\" NBC commentator Sam Peszek, who was on the 2008 Olympic team, said during the television broadcast Saturday night.\n\nBiles said that, in her mind, it was always obvious she would return to competition after her experience in Tokyo, when she withdrew in shocking fashion from the team competition after the first event. She later revealed that she was suffering from the \"twisties\" − a sudden inability to sense and understand her body positioning while twisting through the air. She only competed in one event thereafter, winning bronze with a stripped-down routine on the balance beam.\n\n\"It was like a mental injury, you know?\" she explained. \"So something like that, with the proper work and the proper help, I knew I could come back and hopefully have a shot.\"\n\nWhich, of course, begs the question: How does twisting feel to her now?\n\n\"I still get a little bit nervous, but I think it's just subconscious,\" Biles said. \"Other than that, I know my body is capable and prepared and all of that stuff, so I just have to trust my training.\"\n\nAfter Tokyo, Biles didn't talk about retiring, but she didn't talk about returning to competition, either. Her personal life drew her focus. She got engaged, and then married, to now-Green Bay Packers safety Jonathan Owens. She launched a new clothing line with Athleta. And she became the youngest athlete to ever be awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nThen, earlier this year, something changed. Biles' coach, Cecile Landi, said they got dinner and margaritas at a Mexican restaurant, and Biles expressed an interest in coming back to compete. After her wedding this spring, the training intensified.\n\n\"She really wants it for herself,\" Landi said Friday. \"She’s a married woman. She’s matured. She knows what she wants.\"\n\nBiles said she couldn't recall a specific moment when she decided to compete again. She had returned to the gym in September, then started fiddling around with combinations of skills after the holidays. In time, Laurent Landi, Cecile's husband, started giving her routines to work on. And at some point, Biles said, they all kind of just knew she would be back in an arena.\n\nAlong the way, Biles said she's continued to meet with her therapist once a week. She believes she's in better shape now, mentally and physically, than she was in 2021 ahead of Tokyo. And she has no plans to stop after one night back; National championships are later this month, with worlds in Antwerp, Belgium beginning in late September.\n\n\"At this point, nobody's forcing me out here,\" Biles said. \"This is truly me.\"\n\nContributing: Nancy Armour\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on social media @Tom_Schad.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/05/30/us-gymnastics-championships-simone-biles-paris-olympics/73897520007/", "title": "US gymnastics championships: Simone Biles' path to Paris Olympics", "text": "No American gymnast has won more all-around national championships than Simone Biles' eight.\n\nAnd this weekend, she hopes to make it nine.\n\nBiles will be the headliner at the U.S. gymnastics championships in Fort Worth, Texas this week — the last and most significant competition before the U.S. Olympic trials at the end of next month. The start of the Paris Olympics is now less than two months away.\n\nBiles, 27, won the all-around national title last year and is a safe bet to make the Olympic team regardless of her performance this weekend. The event carries more significance for the women hoping to join her, including regining Olympic gold medalists Suni Lee (all-around) and Jade Carey (floor exercise), among many others. Gabby Douglas, the 2012 all-around Olympic champion, will not be competing after announcing her withdrawal Wednesday.\n\nThe U.S. championships will also be a pivotal event for the men, where Brody Malone, Fred Richard, Yul Moldauer and Asher Hong are among those trying to position themselves for Olympic team inclusion.\n\nMore gymnastics news:Gabby Douglas withdraws from national championships, ending bid for Paris\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the 2024 U.S. gymnastics championships.\n\nWhen are the 2024 U.S. gymnastics championships?\n\nThe U.S. championships will run from Thursday to Sunday at Dickies Arena, located a few miles west of downtown Fort Worth. The senior men will compete Thursday night and Saturday night, with the women in action Friday and Sunday.\n\nUnlike the Olympics, where there are separate all-around and apparatus finals, the national championships will consist of two all-around sessions in each gender.

That means she, and the other big names on the women's side, will be in action starting at around 8 p.m. ET on Friday night and around 7 p.m. ET on Sunday night.\n\nHow to watch the 2024 U.S. gymnastics championships\n\nThe first half of senior competition for both the men and women will air live on Peacock, which is NBC's streaming platform, and then on a tape delay on CNBC on Saturday — with the men's session airing from 12 to 2:30 p.m. ET and the women's session from 2:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m.\n\nThe second and final session of men's competition will then air live on both Peacock and CNBC, while the second session of senior women's competition, which will feature Biles, will receive the most prestigious television slot: A primetime broadcast window on NBC on Sunday.\n\nHow to see live results from the U.S. gymnastics championships\n\nUSA Gymnastics will be providing live results of the women's competition, including Biles' pursuit of a ninth all-around national championship, on its website here.\n\nThe men's results can be viewed here.\n\nWhat's at stake at the U.S. gymnastics championships\n\nBecause this weekend's event is the last one before the U.S. Olympic gymnastics trials, it is an important showcase for everyone who is hoping to book a ticket to the 2024 Paris Games.\n\nOn the women's side, the top two all-around finishers at the U.S. championships will automatically earn a spot at the Olympic trials, where they will be joined by a minimum of 10 other athletes invited at the discretion of USA Gymnastics.

Has she qualified?\n\nTechnically speaking, Biles has not yet been named to Team USA for the Paris Olympics. But based on her track record and the subjectivity within the selection process, she will almost certainly be there — and she'll be favored to win another all-around gold medal.\n\nWhere does Simone Biles train?\n\nBiles trains at the World Champions Centre, a facility in the Houston suburbs that her family opened after the Rio Olympics. Her parents, Ron and Nellie Biles, still own the gym.\n\nWho is Simone Biles' coach?\n\nBiles has two coaches: Cecile and Laurent Landi, who have led the elite team at WCC since 2017. Biles has a particularly close relationship with Cecile Landi, who represented France at the 1996 Olympics and is set to take over as co-head coach of the University of Georgia's gymnastics program following the Paris Games.\n\nWho is Simone Biles' husband?\n\nBiles is married to NFL player Jonathan Owens, who is currently a safety for the Chicago Bears. They celebrated their one-year wedding anniversary earlier this year.\n\nWhat gymnastics moves are named after Simone Biles?\n\nIn the International Gymnastics Federation's current code of points, there are five: Two each on floor exercise and vault, and one on balance beam. Biles' got her latest skill, the Biles II on vault, after she landed the Yurchenko double pike vault at last fall's world championships. (Skills in gymnastics are named after the first person to land them in a major international event.)\n\nAre there Simone Biles scoring restrictions?\n\nIn a way, yes. The international federation's technical committee has previously undervalued some of the skills that Biles has landed in competition, explaining that they could be too dangerous for other gymnasts to attempt.\n\n\"In assigning values to the new elements, the (technical committee) takes into consideration many different aspects; the risk, the safety of the gymnasts and the technical direction of the discipline,\" the committee said in a statement about one of Biles' skills in 2019.\n\nBiles' supporters have argued that such undervaluing punishes Biles for safely completing skills that few other gymnasts can do.\n\nSimone Biles vault: What’s her best ever vault?\n\nWhen you think of the best, her Yurchenko double pike, now known as the Biles II, at last year’s national championships immediately comes to mind. It was massive and she landed it without even a wiggle or wobble. Her feet were slightly apart, but the judges gave it a well-deserved 9.8 execution score, which is almost unheard of for a vault.\n\nBut you’ve also got to give it up for the Amanar that Biles did on the first day of the 2015 national championships. She got so much height people in the first few rows had to look up at her and she drilled the landing.\n\nHow many Olympics has Simone Biles been in?\n\nBiles has competed in two editions of the Summer Olympics: The 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro, and the 2021 Games in Tokyo. However, she only competed in some of her scheduled events in 2021 after experiencing a case of the \"twisties,\" which caused her to lose track of where she was in the air, jeopardizing her physical safety.\n\nHow many Olympic gold medals does Simone Biles have?\n\nBiles has won four Olympic gold medals, all of them at the 2016 Rio Games. She led the \"Final Five\" to team gold, claimed the individual all-around gold and won two of the four individual events: Floor exercise and vault. She has also won a silver medal (in the 2021 team competition) and two Olympic bronzes on balance beam in 2016 and 2021.\n\nHow many world titles has Simone Biles won?\n\nAltogether, Biles has won a record 23 gold medals at world championships across team and individual competition. Among them are six individual all-around world titles, five team championships and 12 world titles in apparatus finals — including six in floor exercise.\n\nWhy is Simone Biles called the GOAT?\n\nIn short: See above. Biles has been dubbed the GOAT (or Greatest of All Time) in gymnastics for her consistency, longevity and, perhaps most importantly, for her ability to push the boundaries in her sport.\n\nNo gymnast has won more world championship medals than Biles, who has racked up 30 in total, and no American gymnast has won more Olympic medals than her seven. (She is currently tied with Shannon Miller for the largest Olympic medal haul by an American.) Her 37 medals at the world championships and Olympics are also the most by any gymnast, male or female.\n\nHow Simone Biles' GOAT leotard became a thing\n\nAs a not-so-subtle nod to her GOAT status, Biles has twice worn a leotard with the figure of a goat's head outlined in rhinestones on her back. She first wore it during podium training ahead of the 2019 national championships, then again at the 2021 U.S. Classic, in the leadup to the Tokyo Games.\n\n\"There should be times where we can celebrate whenever we do a good routine. Or if you’ve been on a winning streak for a year. Or so forth,\" Biles said in 2019. \"I think it’s something you should have pride in. Not be cocky about it, but have pride in it.\"\n\nWhen does Simone Biles compete in the Olympics?\n\nBiles' first day of competition at the Paris Olympics would be in women's qualifiers on July 28, followed by the team final on July 30 and all-around final on August 1.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2019/08/11/simone-biles-strong-floor-leads-another-gymnastics-national-title/1983752001/", "title": "Simone Biles: Strong floor leads to another gymnastics national title", "text": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Another national title for Simone Biles? Been there, done that.\n\nBut a move on floor exercise so difficult no other woman has done it and very few men even try it? Now that made it a night to remember.\n\nBiles landed her triple twisting-double somersault Sunday, getting so much height on the move the folks in the first half-dozen rows had to crane their necks to see her. An NBC replay showed she was actually above its boom camera, which means someone could have parked an SUV on the floor and Biles would have cleared it easily.\n\nTake that, NBA Dunk Contest participants.\n\nAnd unlike Friday night, when she had too much adrenaline and pitched forward, needing to put her hand down to avoid landing on her head, she landed perfectly upright. The back of one of her heels was close to the out-of-bounds line, but she lifted it with such catlike quickness and no flag was raised.\n\nBiles was beaming when she landed. Rightfully so.\n\n\"I was so relieved,\" she said of the triple double. \"Today I was very, very pleased.\"\n\nWhen she came back to gymnastics after taking a year off following the Rio Olympics, it wasn’t because she wanted more medals or had anything left to prove. She’s won every meet she’s entered dating back to the 2013 nationals — and often by large margins — and her sixth U.S. title tied a record that has stood since 1952.\n\nShe won five medals in Rio, four of them gold, and has more world titles than any other gymnast, male or female.\n\nNo, Biles wanted to challenge herself, to see how much she could wring out of her otherworldly talent. In doing so, she is pushing the boundaries of the sport beyond where anyone could ever imagined.\n\nIn this meet alone, she’s done two skills that no one else has ever tried. The triple-double on floor exercise gave her a score of 15.1 — a rarity on events besides vault for the women. She also did a double twisting, double somersault dismount on balance beam Friday night.\n\nThere is no question Biles is the best her sport has ever seen and, no offense to LeBron James, Mikaela Shiffrin, Serena Williams and Alex Morgan, you can make the argument that she’s the best athlete in the world right now, too.\n\nShiffrin seemed to agree, retweeting a video of Biles’ triple-double with a crown emoji\n\nFour years ago, her U.S. teammates used to joke about the \"Simone Division,\" but it’s no longer a joke. At every meet, domestic or international, it’s not a question of whether she’ll win but by how much and what gravity-defying skills she’ll do along the way.\n\nHer score of 118.500 was almost five points ahead of Sunisa Lee. She had the top scores on vault, floor and balance beam, and her uneven bars score of 14.750 was tied for second. When she finished bars — her least-favorite event — she gave coach Laurent Landi a huge hug then ran off the podium sticking out her tongue and waving her arms like a 4-year-old set free on the playground.\n\nHer night was done and she'd won yet another title. Even better, she'd made the impossible possible.\n\nWell, for Biles, at least.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/05/18/simone-biles-womens-gymnastics-us-classic-live-results/73738946007/", "title": "Simone Biles wins gymnastics US Classic by a lot. Shilese Jones ...", "text": "HARTFORD, Conn. — There is Simone Biles and then there is everyone else.\n\nBiles easily won the U.S. Classic on Saturday night, and did so while leaving herself room to improve. Her score of 59.5 points was 1.85 points ahead of Shilese Jones, an all-around medalist at the world championships the last two years.\n\nBiles didn’t score lower than a 14.55, and posted the highest score on vault and floor exercise. She was second to Jones on uneven bars and to reigning Olympic all-around champion Suni Lee on balance beam. Tokyo Olympians Jordan Chiles and Jade Carey were third and fourth and Skye Blakely, a member of the last two world teams, was fifth.\n\nThe scary part? This was Biles’ first meet of the year. She’s only going to get better from here.\n\nLondon Olympics champion Gabby Douglas joined Lee and Biles on Saturday, marking the first time ever three Olympic all-around champions competed together. Douglas completed one event before withdrawing. Lee completed three events for a 40.75 total score that qualified her for the all-around competition at nationals.\n\nThe U.S. Classic doesn’t directly affect who makes the U.S. team for the Paris Olympics. But it plays a role because it’s a qualifier for the national championships later this month in Fort Worth, Texas. Results at nationals determine who gets invited to the Olympic trials, June 27-30 in Minneapolis.\n\nWhat Simone Biles said after U.S. Classic win\n\nAfter a comfortable victory at the U.S. Classic, Simone Biles said on NBC that she has no complaints about how her first meet of 2024 unfolded.\n\n\"For me, I was happy to just be back out there, get through those nerves again, feel that adrenaline,\" she said.\n\nBiles was asked about her performance on uneven bars and acknowledged \"there's things to go home and fix, but I'm not mad about it.\" She was also asked about having her husband, Chicago Bears safety Jonathan Owens, in the crowd cheering for her. What does he think of gymnastics meets?\n\n\"I think this one was a huge thing for him because he hasn't been in a while,\" Biles told NBC. \"But to hear those girls scream as loud as the fans in the football field I think is something new, so it's really exciting to be in both atmospheres.\"\n\nBiles' power on display\n\nBiles had so much power on her first tumbling pass on floor exercise, a triple twisting double somersault – also known as the Biles II on floor – that she bounced way out of bounds, laughing as she did so. It cost her 0.3 points, but she’ll get that under control in the coming weeks.\n\nBiles is also likely to clean up the landing of her Yurchenko double pike vault. She’s no longer having coach Laurent Landi stand on the podium as a safety precaution, which cost her a half-point last year.\n\nBiles’ closest competition, Rebeca Andrade of Brazil and Jones, already needed to be perfect and have Biles make a couple of mistakes in order to have a chance against her. With this performance, the gap between Biles and everyone else grows even wider.\n\nWatch a replay of the 2024 U.S. Classic\n\nBiles' session of competition was televised live on CNBC and Peacock, which is NBC's streaming service. NBC will also run a show recapping all the highlights from the U.S. Classic at 2 p.m. ET on Sunday.\n\nYurchenko double pike (aka the Biles II) sighting\n\nSimone Biles isn’t leaving room for anyone else.\n\nBiles did the Yurchenko double pike – the Biles II on vault, for those keeping track – which would give her a big score, anyway. But unlike last year, when she took a half-point deduction for having coach Laurent Landi stand on the landing mat in case she was in danger of crashing, Landi was off to the side.\n\nWithout the deduction, Biles scored a whopping 15.6 – and that was after having to run backward several steps to control her landing. It was one of only two scores in the meet above 15 – Shilese Jones had a 15.25 on uneven bars – and gave Biles a 1.3-point lead going into the final rotation.\n\n2022 US champion Konnor McClain leaves US Classic in wheelchair\n\nAfter a solid start to the night on beam, Konnor McClain suffered an injury while warming up on floor and was forced to withdraw from the U.S. Classic.\n\nNBC television cameras showed McClain, 19, being taken out of the arena in a wheelchair with tears in her eyes. She had been sitting in third place after notching a score of 14.200 on balance beam in her first rotation.\n\nNBC's John Roethlisberger reported on air that McClain's coach, Courtney McCool Griffeth, told him \"it's an Achilles,\" without providing additional information about the severity of the injury.\n\nBiles is back\n\nBiles brought back her triple twisting double somersault – aka the Biles II – in her floor routine. It’s one of the elements she dropped after the Tokyo Olympics, when a case of “the twisties” caused her to lose sense of where she was in the air and jeopardized her physical safety.\n\nBiles won her eighth U.S. and sixth world titles last year, both records, but she did so with some of her most difficult twisting elements removed from her routines. No more. The triple-double is her first pass on floor and it was massive, so big she bounced way out of bounds. She grinned when she landed and completed the rest of her routine with power and polish.\n\nHer score of 14.8 gave her 29.35 midway through the meet. That’s .25 points behind Shilese Jones, an all-around medalist at the last two world championships. But Jones has done her two highest-scoring events while Biles still has vault.\n\nGabby Douglas scratches after one event\n\nGabby Douglas' performance at the U.S. Classic was a short one.\n\nDouglas scratched after the first event Saturday night. No reason was given, but she'd come off the uneven bars twice.\n\nThe 2012 Olympic champion, who is hoping to make the Paris team eight years after she last competed, was trying to qualify for the all-around at the national championships in two weeks. She is already qualified to do three events — vault, balance beam and bars — but needed to score a 51 or higher in order to do all four at nationals. With a 10.1 on bars, that was going to be a tough task.\n\nRead more:Gabby Douglas out of US Classic after one event. What happened and where she stands for nationals\n\nSimone Biles starts Olympic season off strong\n\nBiles scored a 14.55 on balance beam, her first event at the U.S. Classic. There are still three events to go, but she has a .20 lead on Shilese Jones with vault and floor exercise, her two highest-scoring events, still to come.\n\nThis isn’t a surprise, of course. Biles is the best to ever do it, returning to competition for the first time since the Tokyo Olympics last year and winning her eighth national title and sixth world title, both records. So long as she’s on her game, no one will beat her.\n\nBut, honestly, everyone in the United States knows that. The other women are just hoping to make a claim on the remaining four spots on the team.\n\nTough start for Gabby Douglas\n\nThat was a tough start for Gabby Douglas, who is trying to make the Paris Olympics eight years after she last competed. Starting on uneven bars, her signature event, Douglas got off balance on a pirouette. She managed to save it, but couldn’t get back into her rhythm and came off. She got back up but dropped off a couple of seconds later. With fans – many of whom weren’t even alive when she won gold at the London Games in 2012 – chanting her name, Douglas got back up and finished her routine.\n\nDouglas got a 10.1, which is going to hurt her chances of qualifying to do the all-around at the national championships in two weeks. She’s already qualified to do three events at nationals, but needs a 51 or higher here to qualify for the all-around. (She could also petition to do all four events.)\n\nA historic competition with 3 Olympic all-around champs\n\nThis is the first time ever three Olympic all-around champions ― Gabby Douglas, Simone Biles and Suni Lee ― have competed together. But to put that in better perspective, when Douglas made the Rio team, she became the first reigning all-around champion since Nadia Comaneci in 1980 to compete at the next Olympics. Biles obviously did the same in Tokyo.\n\nBiles, Douglas, Carey start on signature events\n\nThere will be fireworks early. Gabby Douglas starts on uneven bars, her signature event, while Simone Biles is up on balance beam, where she's the reigning world champion. Oh, and Jade Carey starts on floor exercise, where she won gold at the Tokyo Olympics. Settle in and grab the popcorn. This is going to be fun.\n\nFans get rowdy for Biles before event starts\n\nThere's still an hour until the meet starts and the XL Center isn't even close to being half-full. But fans are already LOUD. When Simone Biles did her Yurchenko double pike vault ― also known as the Biles II ― the cheers were deafening.\n\nWhat to expect from Biles, Lee and Douglas\n\nBiles has already qualified for nationals as a member of the U.S. squad that won a seventh consecutive title at last year’s world championships. But she’s using this meet to test out her routines. She’s brought back her triple twisting, double somersault on floor exercise, also known as the Biles II, as well as the double-double dismount on uneven bars.\n\nShe’s also got new choreography on floor, from French choreographer Gregory Milan.\n\nLee was originally planning to do the all-around, which would have been her first since she had to cut short her final season at Auburn because of a kidney ailment, more than a year ago. She did bars and balance beam at Winter Cup in February, and vault and beam at the American Classic last month. But Lee is opting not to do bars here, and instead do vault, beam and floor.\n\nDouglas qualified to do three events at nationals with her performance at the American Classic, but is hoping to improve on that so she can compete in the all-around.\n\nWho is competing at the U.S. Classic?\n\nGymnasts like to have a meet to work out the nerves and have their routines judged before things start counting, so pretty much everyone is here. Biles and Shilese Jones, an all-around medalist at the last two world championships, are making their season debuts, as is Tokyo floor gold medalist Jade Carey and 2022 U.S. champion Konnor McClain, whose LSU team won the NCAA title last month.\n\nHow do you make the U.S. Olympic team?\n\nThe top all-arounder at the Olympic trials, likely to be Biles, is guaranteed a spot in Paris. The remaining four gymnasts, along with two alternates, are chosen by a selection committee based on their performances this year, scoring potential and how they'd contribute in both qualifying and team finals.\n\nUnlike other sports, such as swimming and track and field, gymnastics teams can't be chosen purely on results or rank order. In qualifying at the Olympics, teams compete four athletes on each event and can drop the lowest score. But in the team finals, only three athletes compete on each event and all three scores are counted. That means teams must be constructed to produce the highest scoring potential and consistency on all four events.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nThe U.S. championships are less than two weeks away, May 30 to June 2 in Forth Worth, Texas. The Olympic trials are June 27-30 in Minneapolis. The Paris Olympics begin July 26, with the women's competition beginning two days later with qualifying.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/packers/2023/08/28/simone-biles-husband-jonathan-owens-reacts-us-championship-gymnastics-all-around-title-san-jose/70701037007/", "title": "Simone Biles' husband Jonathan Owens says nobody better than ...", "text": "The gymnastics world was in awe once again over Simone Biles after she won a record eighth U.S. championship over the weekend, setting herself up for what appears to be another run at the Olympics in 2024.\n\nBut no one might have loved her performances more than Biles' husband, Jonathan Owens, a safety for the Green Bay Packers, even if he wasn't in person to witness greatness.\n\nOwens, signed by the Packers in the offseason, showed his appreciation for what his wife is accomplishing at this stage in her career through a series of social media posts during the event and after she took home gold.\n\n\"Nobody better,\" Owens tweeted Monday, and included an emoji of a goat to note that she's the greatest of all time.\n\nNot many people would argue about that if there was still such a debate going on.\n\nAll things Packers: Latest Green Bay Packers news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.\n\nThe 26-year-old's all-around championship in San Jose, California, Sunday added to her four straight victories from 2013-16, two in a row from 2018-19 and in 2021.\n\nAnd Biles already holds several world championship records: most medals, most gold medals and most all-around titles.

I'm Taylor Wilson, and today is Monday, June 3rd, 2024. This is The Excerpt.\n\nToday, Mexico has elected a new president. Plus, we take a look at Hunter Biden's gun trial which is set to begin today. And is corporate America keeping promises it made to Black Americans?\n\n♦\n\nMexicans have elected their first woman president. Claudia Sheinbaum received between 58.3 and 60.7% of the vote according to preliminary results announced by Mexico's National Electoral Institute earlier today. On October 1st, she'll become the leader of a country that is the top trade partner of the US and the second-largest economy of Latin America. She'll also be overseeing a country slammed by violence tied to organized crime. With Sheinbaum's win, Mexico beat the United States in electing a female head of state. Sheinbaum is a scientist, engineer, and former mayor of Mexico City who shares the populist ideology of her political mentor, outgoing President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. For more on what's next across the border, check out our Saturday episode of The Excerpt when I spoke with USA TODAY national reporter Lauren Villagran who put the election in context for us. You can find a link to that episode in today's show notes.\n\n♦\n\nHunter Biden's felony gun trial is set to begin today following the collapse of a deal with federal investigators last year. I spoke with USA TODAY Justice Department correspondent Bart Jansen for a look ahead. Bart, thanks for hopping on.\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nThanks for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Bart, the build-up to this trial has really been kind of start, stop, start, stop for months. What's that issue here and what's happened leading up to this week?\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nThe government had tried to reach a plea agreement with Hunter Biden last July to resolve its multi-year investigation of tax and gun complaints, and it envisioned him pleading guilty to a couple of misdemeanors for tax charges and then getting put into a pretrial diversion program over gun charges so that if he completed the program, which meant two years of sobriety and no other crimes committed, that he could have those charges wiped out entirely. So it looked like last July, he was going to be able to walk away without any jail time and resolve this lengthy investigation. Well, the plea negotiations fell apart and so the prosecutor David Weiss, who is the US Attorney in Delaware and he was later appointed to special counsel to pursue this investigation further, he indicted Hunter Biden on three felony gun charges in September. And those are the charges that are coming to trial today finally in Delaware. A second set of nine tax charges are scheduled for trial in California on September 5th.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo what can we actually expect today and the rest of this week?\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nJury selection starts today. The trial overall is expected to last a couple of weeks. The charges against Hunter Biden focus on a form that he filled out where he was asked, \"Are you the unlawful user or addicted to marijuana, depressant, stimulants, or a narcotic drug or other controlled substance?\" And he marked an X on that page. But his lawyer, Abbe Lowell, has suggested that he didn't know what the term addict or user meant at that time, and he had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and he was living with a sober companion so that he didn't view himself as a current user or addict.\n\nNow, that will be something for the jury to decide. Prosecutors have said that they want to use federal definitions of what is a user or an addict. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms says that a user or an addict is somebody who used a controlled substance within the past year or had multiple arrests during the past five years. So they take a much more expansive view. Hunter Biden's lawyers have tried to rule out that view and disputed whether the jury will be instructed to consider the charges in that way. And so that's one of the key points that we're going to be seeing in this trial.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nBart, the timing here is interesting coming just days after former President Donald Trump was found guilty on all counts in his hush money trial, and half of Americans say they believe Hunter Biden received favorable treatment from prosecutors because he's the president's son. That's according to a Reuters Ipsos poll last summer. Bart, how are Americans viewing this trial in the wake of being so focused on the former president in recent weeks?\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nWell, there's definitely a lot of skepticism about how Hunter Biden's investigation was handled because he is the son of the president. When the plea agreement was announced and the prospect of no jail time was revealed, House Republicans just blasted as a sweetheart deal. They said clearly he was giving favored treatment because he is the son of the president. Attorney General Merrick Garland has forcefully denied that. He said the investigation was carried out independently. They followed the facts and the law. And then as the plea agreement fell apart over basically a dispute between defense lawyers and prosecutors over whether Hunter Biden would be protected from potential future charges, ones that we don't even know about yet, when that deal fell apart, Garland named David Weiss, the US Attorney in Delaware, as a special counsel so he would have even more independence to pursue charges. And Weiss then came back two separate indictments, one dealing with gun charges and one dealing with tax charges.\n\nBut so then on the flip side, Democrats are now criticizing the investigation, saying that it has now become too harsh that the gun charges at stake about lying on the federal form about whether you are an addict are rarely prosecuted and that basically Hunter Biden is being prosecuted just because he is the president's son. And so it is almost flipped to the other side, the accusations that the trial is too harsh. So it is absolutely viewed through a political lens from both sides, and there'll be a lot of attention paid to how the trial goes because of the implications for potentially having the first presidential child convicted of a crime while the president is in office. That would be a first.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right. Bart Jansen covers the Justice Department for USA TODAY. Thanks, Bart.\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nThanks for having me.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAs Pride Month begins this week, LGBTQ+ communities and allies around the country are taking steps to promote safety at Pride events. In Colorado, organizers at the Pikes Peak Pride Festival are making plans to mark the event's 34th anniversary in Colorado Springs where a gunman killed five and injured 25 at the LGBTQ+ nightclub, Club Q, in 2022. Pikes Peak Pride board member Justin Burns said, \"The importance of Pride and celebrating our identity is more important than any fear.\" At a time of continuing anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric and a spate of legislative measures targeting the trans community, LGBTQ+ groups and their advocates say it's more important than ever to maintain a proud sense of identity while remaining vigilant in the face of unknown threats.\n\nLast month, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security issued a public service announcement to raise awareness of the potential targeting of LGBTQIA+ events like Pride by foreign terrorist organizations or their supporters. One national group hopes to provide the community a sense of security by training faith leaders and congregants to play a protective and calming role at Pride events around the country. Interfaith Alliance, an organization that promotes LGBTQ+ rights and inclusive faith communities, teamed with the Southern Poverty Law Center to offer the training as part of its third annual Faith for Pride initiative. You can read more about steps being taken to keep Pride safe this month with a link in today's show notes.\n\n♦\n\nAn estimated 5.4 million children provided care to parents, grandparents, or siblings with chronic medical conditions or functional decline in 2019. That was up from just over a million in 2005 according to reports from the National Alliance for Caregiving and others. An aging population, more drug and alcohol use, mental health issues, shorter hospital stays, and long COVID have likely boosted the need for kids to help in the home according to experts. And in-home care and nursing homes are hard to find and unaffordable for most, especially if you're still relatively young.\n\nPresident Joe Biden took executive action last year to expand care and raise wages, but none of them help youth caregivers. Other countries, including the UK and Australia, recognize young carers through legislation and policy and offer stipends. In the US, Medicare does not pay family members to provide care, and low income families on Medicaid can only get reimbursement for adults. Experts say help for now is left to nonprofits.\n\n♦\n\nAmid an anti-DEI backlash, is corporate America keeping the promises it made to Black Americans after George Floyd's murder? I spoke with USA TODAY senior reporter Jessica Guynn for more. Jessica, thanks for hopping on.\n\nJessica Guynn:\n\nThanks so much for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Jessica, what did companies promise when it comes to diversity in the wake of George Floyd's murder?\n\nJessica Guynn:\n\nWell, four years ago as a business journalist, I couldn't go a few minutes without a press release or a tweet from companies declaring that they were all in the fight against racial injustice and vowing to do their part after George Floyd's murder. And in these missives, they ponied up billions in financial commitments and they outlined pretty ambitious goals to make their workforces look more like America.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo are companies keeping those pledges?\n\nJessica Guynn:\n\nFor the last 10 years at USA TODAY, I've been documenting the deep racial disparities in the nation's largest and most powerful companies. And these companies were certainly signaling that they were really ready to do something about it, but then they ran headlong into a conservative-led backlash that is hellbent on vilifying just the kind of diversity efforts that they were undertaking.\n\nThis what they call anti-woke movement gain momentum last year with the Supreme Court ruling that ended affirmative action in college admissions, and activists claim that DEI in the corporate world is handing women and people of color jobs and promotions at the expense of more qualified candidates. They also argue that corporate programs that exclude white people like a fellowship or an internship geared to racial minorities is just as illegal as a program that excludes Black people. What's more, there are now questions about the legality as some of these initiatives in the wake of that ruling, and that's put the business world on the defensive. They've began to scrutinize and walk back some policies and programs they adopted after Floyd was killed, such as hiring targets for Black executives. Critics say those hiring goals are illegal quotas in disguise.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo have Black workers made any gains since Floyd's murder?\n\nJessica Guynn:\n\nBlack Americans are making headway, and we've established that in our own data investigations here at USA TODAY. For example, we reported last year that the nation's 100 largest companies had four Black CEOs and a growing number of top executives who were Black. But of course, that's just a small dent. Of the 533 top executive officers across these companies, white men were 7 in 10. And of those companies, about 1 in 7 had executive teams that were made up only of white men.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nJessica, DEI refers to diversity, equity, and inclusion. But what are some companies saying about shifting this conversation to refer to just the word inclusion instead?\n\nJessica Guynn:\n\nWell, no one wants to be caught referring to DEI anymore. Companies are dropping that language from their shareholder reports and in earnings calls. Some companies are even listing DEI as a risk factor. Instead, increasingly we're seeing talk of inclusion, and that's an attempt to sidestep some of the controversy that's been created around DEI. The idea being that creating inclusive workplaces is less likely to get you in hot water with critics since you're stressing company initiatives that are for everyone, not just certain demographic groups.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nJessica Guynn is a senior reporter with USA TODAY. Thank you, Jessica.\n\nJessica Guynn:\n\nThanks so much.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd a happy first week of June, listeners, the unofficial start to summer for many.

Sheinbaum uses the hashtag #EsTiempodeMujeres, meaning “this is women’s time”, and told Gatopardo that “girls see an example in me”. Gálvez says she rebelled against her abusive father to pursue education, and when a man tried to rape her when she was 17 she fought back with a soldering iron.\n\nViolence against women has been rising. “In Mexico, some 10 women and girls are killed every day by intimate partners or other family members,” according to the UN. Women have been “dying at a frightening pace”, The Associated Press reported, a result of “cultural machismo, systemic gender inequality and latent domestic violence”. Even when crimes are punished, many view sentences as too lenient.\n\nThe current president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has faced criticism for his inability to stop Mexico becoming a “femicide nation”, The Guardian reported last year.\n\nAnd in August he “sparked ridicule and outrage” when he responded to more questions on the subject by suggesting that he too could be the victim of gender-based violence. “Everything they say to me, isn’t that gender-based violence?” López Obrador said. “Or is gender only female?”\n\nSheinbaum and Gálvez have put women’s rights at the forefront of their respective agendas. And the feminist movement has already brought about change. Last week the Supreme Court, which in January elected its first female president, legalised abortion, stating the “denial of the possibility of a termination violated the human rights of women”. The majority of senators are now women and the central bank governor is female.\n\n“It’s not quite Barbie Land,” said The Washington Post, “but the progress is remarkable in a country where women couldn’t even vote until 1953.”\n\nNext June’s election is “a feminist’s dream”, Mexican women’s rights activist Maricruz Ocampo told the newspaper. It “is going to signify a turn in the way that we see women in politics”.\n\nMany women in Mexico, who make up 52% of the population, “hope the government that takes office in October 2024 will empower them as never before”, said Reuters.\n\nOthers are more cautiously optimistic. “They’re not magical unicorns; they don’t have magic wands,” Jennifer Piscopo, professor of gender and politics at the University of London, told The Washington Post. “They’re not going to fix centuries of discrimination against women overnight.”", "authors": ["Rebekah Evans", "The Week Uk", "The Week Staff", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Sorcha Bradley", "Peter Weber", "The Week Us", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/09/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/09/07/mexico-woman-president-election-candidates-claudia-sheinbaum-xochitl-galvez/70785828007/", "title": "Mexico likely to get its first woman president in 2024 election", "text": "Maria Verza\n\nAssociated Press\n\nMEXICO CITY (AP) — With the selection of former Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum as the candidate of the country's ruling party in next June's election, Mexico will for the first time have time two women from its main political movements competing for the presidency.\n\nSheinbaum, as well as the opposition candidate Xóchitl Gálvez, have insisted that Mexico is ready to be led by a woman, but it will not be an easy path.\n\nBorderland:Mexican army special forces soldiers sent to Juárez as murders surge\n\nOn Wednesday night, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador's Morena party announced that Sheinbaum had defeated five internal party rivals – all men.

The reality is that no, and the saddest thing is that women themselves are not voting for women.\"\n\nImmigration:U.S. State Department officials say 'full court press' underway to address mass migration\n\nSuch low turnout in the June 2 presidential election is less likely because so much is at stake, Alcocer Olmos said. There is also the possibility that the Citizen Movement party, which controls Nuevo Leon and Jalisco – two of the most economically important states – could nominate a male candidate who would attract that macho vote, she said.\n\nAnother question mark is what former Foreign Affairs Secretary Marcelo Ebrard will do. As Sheinbaum's closest rival in Morena he did not accept the results of the internal party selection process, claiming there were irregularities.\n\nMorena controls 22 of Mexico's 32 states and López Obrador remains highly popular, giving Sheinbaum a strong advantage. But Gálvez emerged from virtual obscurity, helped largely by daily public criticism from López Obrador, to become the consensus candidate of the largely directionless opposition.\n\nAurora Pedroche, a Morena activist who supports Sheinbaum, suggested another problem should one of the female candidates win the presidency. Given the greatly increased power and responsibility that López Obrador has given the military during his administration \"how are they going to accept a woman as commander in chief?\"\n\n\"That scares me,\" Pedroche said.\n\nMore:In Mexico, accusations of 'communism' and 'fascism' mark school textbook debate\n\nWhile Mexican women have advanced to positions of political power in public life – in part because of required representation quotas for public office -- women suffer from high levels of gender violence. Femicides – cases of women killed because of their gender – have been a persistent problem for decades.\n\nSheinbaum represents continuation of López Obrador's social agenda, but without his charisma to take on an opponent in Gálvez who has an ease of connecting with people that is more reminiscent of the outgoing president.\n\nThe independent Gálvez is representing the Broad Front for Mexico, a coalition of the conservative National Action Party, the small progressive Democratic Revolution Party, and the old-guard Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, that held Mexico's presidency without interruption between 1929 and 2000.\n\nGálvez caucuses with the National Action Party in the Senate but is not a member.\n\nStrategist Antonio Sola, who worked on the 2006 campaign of former President Felipe Calderón and later with one of the parties that helped López Obrador win, thinks Gálvez's outsider image could help her.\n\nWith much of the world experiencing the end of a political era dominated by traditional candidates, the emerging figures are those who are \"kicking the system,\" he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2024/06/02/mexico-elections-claudia-sheinbaum-live-updates/73893100007/", "title": "Will a woman become president?

In Phoenix, voters showed up as early as Saturday night to make sure they got a ballot. As polls closed at 5 p.m. PST, disenfranchised voters angrily demanded that electoral officials at the Phoenix consulate open the doors and allow them to vote.\n\nAbout an hour before closing, electoral officials at the consulate said an average of 60 people per hour had voted with five polling stations open.\n\nA similar situation unfolded at Mexican consulates in San José, Los Angeles and Fresno, California, and in Houston and Dallas, Texas, where residents voiced discontent about the delays.\n\n-Nadia Cantú and Paula Soria, Arizona Republic\n\nMexican mothers of disappeared women make plea\n\nThe mothers of three missing persons sat in the pews of a Catholic church in Ciudad Juárez on Sunday for a mass in honor of their daughters.\n\nThey wore T-shirts with each girl’s face and name.

You must come armed with knowledge and a clear message. It takes confidence and a bit of showmanship to keep everyone’s attention.\n\nLast year, when I stood in front of a class of 10 girls at Lewis and Clark Elementary School in Missoula, I brought a book called Grace for President. It tells the story of a little girl who learns that there has never been a female president and decides to become the first. I don’t mind saying, it’s an inspiring story for all ages.\n\nEach year, the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University sends a children’s book about inclusive leadership to every female legislator, member of Congress and governor in the United States. They ask that we visit a local elementary school, read the book, talk about our experiences as elected officials, and donate the book to the school library. The goal of TAG, the Teach a Girl to Lead program, is simple: by being present and visible in the classroom, even for a day, women elected officials like me can encourage young girls to follow in our footsteps.\n\nI spent that afternoon with the students of Lewis and Clark Elementary talking about what leadership means and — more importantly — what it looks like. I came back the next week with three of my fellow women leaders in our local government. We all talked about what running for and holding elected office is like. We discussed how government and the Electoral College work, and the importance of voting.\n\nA few weeks later, I received a crayoned picture and a note from an 8-year-old girl that read, “You made me feel special. I am going to run for office too, just like you!”\n\nSheryl Sandberg: Pay gap holds us all back\n\nMills: Why we protest\n\nIn their earliest years, when their ideas about the world are first formed, children study the Founding Fathers and discover the stories behind major milestones of American history — Christopher Columbus, Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King Jr. Boys grow up seeing powerful public leaders who look like them. Rarely are young girls given the same example. Women figure poorly into our country’s historical narrative, often reduced to wives or daughters. No national holiday honors the accomplishments of a woman.\n\nWomen have achieved success as leaders in almost every sector of our society, but we remain underrepresented in elected office. Even though we make up more than half of the population, women hold less than a quarter of our nation’s public leadership positions. We volunteer and vote at higher rates than men, but don’t seek elected office at the same rate.\n\nAs Marion Wright Edelman said, kids can’t be what they can’t see. Research shows that simply hanging a picture of a woman leader in a classroom improves the performance of girls, changing the way they think about their place in the world. Imagine the impact of deploying real women leaders in the classroom.\n\nWhen I was a young girl growing up in Idaho, I met the state’s First Lady, Bethine Church, who was visiting our school. Later, in a children’s book filled with color pictures, I learned about Sandra Day O’Connor, our first woman on the United States Supreme Court, and Dorothy Day, who was a fearless social activist for poor people without a voice. These memories profoundly influenced me to become an attorney and run for office.\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nThe truth about white working-class men: Jill Filipovic\n\nI’m lucky to have been able to look up to the women who came before me. And I’m grateful that they encouraged me, on more than one occasion, to run for office. Today, I am a girl who leads.\n\nThis year, TAG’s book selection is called If I Were President. The story introduces readers to the presidency by showing a diverse group of children taking turns carrying out presidential duties. I returned to Lewis and Clark Elementary this year very excited to share this story. We talked and drew pictures of our “sheroes”— our female heroes. They included everyone from Hillary Clinton to Taylor Swift to their mothers, grandmothers and aunts. We talked about the qualities of a hero, among them strength and compassion.\n\nPart of me imagined that this year I would be talking to the students about the first female president.

Will it be ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThis fall, Americans could get boosted with a mRNA Covid-19 vaccine unlike any that’s come before.\n\nBoth Pfizer and Moderna are working on bivalent boosters: vaccines made up of both the old formula and a new one that targets the Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of the coronavirus.\n\nIf the shots meet US Food and Drug Administration standards, they will probably be available as early as September, the FDA says.\n\nBut cases are high now. There are about 124,000 new cases reported each day – far from the levels reported during the Omicron surge, but nearing peak case rates from the Delta wave – and cases are more undercounted than ever.\n\nSome experts wonder whether the Omicron-specific boosters will come in time to make a difference and if they will actually offer more protection than the current shots.\n\nA prediction game\n\nThe current shots are based on the original strain of the virus and offered nearly full protection, even from infection, early on. With new variants in circulation, the vaccines still are good at keeping people out of the hospital, but most scientists think people need a vaccine that offers more protection.\n\nDr. Michael Chang, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Memorial Hermann Health System in Houston, thinks vaccines with an Omicron component will be helpful – within limits.\n\n“I just wish that the timing had been sooner so that we could actually be dealing with the kind of BA.5 surge that we have right now,” he said.\n\nWith the highly contagious BA.5 subvariant now dominant, the goal of minimizing the number of infections is “kind of lost,” but the new vaccines should help keep hospitalizations and deaths down, Chang said.\n\n“I do think, anytime you can introduce additional strains or variants into a vaccine, the human body’s immune response tends to be a little bit broader and more durable and potentially longer-lasting,” he said.\n\nBut it’s impossible to know at this point what variant will be dominant a couple months from now, how different it will be from the currently circulating variants or even how many cases there will be, because it’s hard to predict how humans will behave when cases rise – and cases will most likely rise. Much like with the flu, scientists think the coronavirus transmits more efficiently in colder weather. It also spreads more easily as people spend more time indoors.\n\nDr. Edward Michelson, chair of the Department of Emergency Medicine at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in El Paso, is seeing many patients again, even those who had Omicron earlier in the year.\n\n“Omicron is not protecting people even a few months after they got sick with it. These subvariants are getting them again, much to my surprise,” Michelson said. “The good news is, most of the patients don’t need hospitalization.”\n\nStill, 375 people are dying of Covid-related causes on average every day in the US, according to the CDC.\n\n‘A new vaccine could really pay dividends’\n\nThe Covid-19 Scenario Modeling Hub, a group of scientists across the country who create projections for the coming year, predicts an upswing in hospitalizations through early fall. But the model suggests that a booster campaign will make a dent in these numbers, according to Justin Lessler, a University of North Carolina epidemiologist who works with the group.\n\nWhile scientists are still trying to determine exactly how well the new vaccines will protect people, Lessler said, the model assumes that the reformulated vaccine would have about 80% efficacy against infection with the currently circulating strains. But that depends on how many people actually get an updated booster.\n\n“Absent any real new variants, that kind of efficacy would be enough to really tamp down the current circulation if we have a broad uptake of the vaccines,” Lessler said. “A new vaccine could really pay dividends, particularly if we can get it to a broad swath of the population.”\n\nIdeally, public health campaigns could be built to encourage people to get a flu vaccine and a Covid-19 vaccine at the same time, he said.\n\nLessler presented an earlier version of the model to the FDA’s independent vaccine advisers, who voted in June to recommend that the vaccine makers include BA.4 and BA.5 in the fall booster. They said that including an Omicron element would offer more protection.\n\n“While it’s impossible for anyone to predict which variants will be circulating at the time, the goal as I see it is to add the subvariants that are most likely to give us that broad spectrum of antibodies that will hopefully prevent serious disease, which is really what we’re trying to do,” said Dr. Archana Chatterjee, dean of the Chicago Medical School at Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science and a member of the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee.\n\nEurope’s approach\n\nSome countries may go with vaccines based on the BA.1 Omicron subvariant this fall. It’s not fully understood to what extent the sublineages of Omicron influence vaccine effectiveness, but some scientists who advise the World Health Organization argued that BA.1-based shots would be “more distinct” than other subvariants.\n\nModerna said it’s developing a booster for the European Union, the UK and Australia that uses the original strain and BA.1. The subvariant is largely extinct, but the company said its studies have shown that this booster candidate still drew “significantly higher neutralizing antibody responses” against BA.4 and BA.5 compared with the currently authorized booster.\n\nPfizer has said it too will make a vaccine that fits Europe’s needs, as well as the needs in the US.\n\n“Our program continues to focus on all variants of concern and we remain committed to the public health needs as defined by regulators, Europe and elsewhere,” a spokesperson for Pfizer told CNN in an email.\n\nPfizer submitted its bivalent BA.1-specific vaccine to the European Medicines Agency in mid-July and told CNN it will be ready to distribute this fall, pending authorization.\n\nIn the United States, a vaccine updated for BA.4/5 got the go-ahead for fall.\n\nDr. Larry Corey, a vaccine development expert and professor of medicine and infectious disease division at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, said the data makes a strong case for the addition. Research on infections shows that the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants seem to induce stronger immune response than BA.1 and BA.2.\n\n“We don’t have the data yet. Certainly, we will know by the end of August,” Corey said.\n\nAs with so much during the pandemic, scientists are making educated guesses and figuring things out as they go.\n\n“We’ll start sleeping better in a month, see whether it does well in animals, and we’ll feel we made the right decision when we boost a bunch of people with the BA.4/BA.5 variants,” Corey said.\n\nA virus that breaks all the rules\n\nEven as the virus changes, there is only so much vaccine makers can do, says University of Michigan epidemiologist Arnold Monto, who has served as acting chair of the FDA’s vaccine advisory panel.\n\n“Basically, we can only use those viruses that we know about,” Monto said.\n\nOmicron was a big change from previous variants, he said, and most evolutionary virologists don’t think there will be such a big leap again. Rather, the changes will probably be along the Omicron lines.\n\nBut then again, “this has been a tricky virus. It has broken all the rules.”\n\nRegardless, Monto is confident that adding the BA.4/BA.5 element to the new vaccines will help.\n\n“While we know that the latest viruses that we are encountering that will go into the vaccine probably are not going to the be the viruses in the coming fall and winter, the answer is not to chase them but to try and catch up and broaden them,” he said.\n\nIn other words, vaccine makers will want to have a wide a distribution of immunity in the population. That’s why they’ll continue to include the original strain as well as Omicron.\n\nIt seems possible that we’ll be facing different variants in the fall, but Dr. Eric Rubin, an adjunct professor of immunology and infectious disease at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said there is a “very reasonable argument” that having some diversity in the immune response is still a good thing.\n\n“For me, the most important thing we can measure right now is the breadth of immunity and not try to guess which strain is going to be there. That’s probably more important than trying to guess what comes up in the fall,” said Rubin, who is also on the FDA’s vaccine advisory committee but was not a part of the Omicron booster discussion.\n\nEvolution is trying to find its own path, however, and the virus will do whatever works for it as opposed to us. Down the line, he hopes we’ll have even better vaccines that will prevent not just severe disease but infections as well.\n\n“I don’t think a perpetual game of catchup is going to work forever. We need to think about new approaches,” Rubin said.\n\nBut he emphasized that more people should get vaccinated and boosted in order to keep cases, hospitalizations and deaths down.\n\nSome people should still get boosted now\n\nThe FDA is still encouraging adults 50 and older and those with compromised immune systems to get a second booster now, with the current formula. That would leave enough of an interval for them to get an updated booster in the fall.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe Biden administration has ended its conversations with the FDA about allowing adults under 50 to get a second booster with the current formula this summer.\n\nOnce boosters are updated for the fall, the FDA said, people who get boosted now “may consider getting one.” Scientists say it will be important to get this updated version.\n\n“The current vaccines do a pretty great job at keeping people out of hospitals,” Rubin said. “I don’t really want to dismiss what we’ve got there. Of course, we always want better.”", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/08/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2023/09/25/iowa-covid-boosters-rsv-flu-shot-what-to-know-about-fall-autumn-vaccines-when-to-get-them/70789901007/", "title": "What you need to know about new winter shots for the flu, COVID ...", "text": "Winter weather is back in Iowa, and with it, another unpredictable respiratory viral season. But this year, Iowans will have more tools to help reduce the risk of infections.\n\nIf they use them.\n\nIn 2022, clinics and hospitals across the state were inundated with sick patients from a \"tripledemic\" of respiratory illnesses: COVID-19, influenza and RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus.\n\nEmergency rooms at Iowa's children's hospitals were filled with young patients infected with RSV, while urgent care clinics were forced to implement a scheduling process after scores of patients sick with the flu and coronavirus created long wait times.\n\nVaccine fatigue at work:Only 8% of Iowa nursing home workers have up-to-date COVID shots\n\nIn 2023, vaccines are available to reduce hospitalizations and deaths from all three viruses.\n\nIn addition to annual flu shots, federal health officials have approved a new round of COVID-19 booster shots. New immunizations for RSV, approved for the most at-risk populations, will also be available this winter.\n\nHere's what you should know:\n\nWhat's the latest with new COVID-19 boosters?\n\nVirtually all Americans are recommended to get the latest COVID-19 vaccine by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which issued guidance in September that everyone over the age of 6 months receive an updated COVID-19 shot this winter.\n\nFederal regulators approved two shots from Pfizer and Moderna, both of which are crafted to target an omicron subvariant of the virus called XBB. Though new variants have emerged to drive up new COVID-19 infections, experts say the updated shots will still adequately reduce risk of serious illness.\n\nStudies have shown the new vaccines re-upping coronavirus vaccines administered in 2021 offer strong protection against infection, reducing risk of serious illness, hospitalization and death among those most at risk, such as the elderly and those who are immunocompromised.\n\nThe approval represents federal health officials' new push to put COVID-19 shots on an annual schedule, similar to how Americans receive flu shots once a year. Just like influenza shots, vaccine manufacturers will identify the strain most likely to circulate the following winter and develop a shot targeting that particular strain.\n\n\"I think it's safe to anticipate an annual COVID-19 (booster), similar to an annual flu shot,\" said Lina Tucker Reinders, executive director of the Iowa Public Health Association. \"… We've crossed the threshold from pandemic to endemic, and endemic means the condition exists but it's relatively predictable. There seems to be more a seasonality to it, so we can predict when the highs and lows are going to be.\"\n\nWhat does the end of the public health emergency mean for COVID vaccines?\n\nThese are also the newest COVID-19 shots since the end of the federal public health emergency in May 2023, making this the first round of shots not fully paid for by the federal government.\n\nShots are still guaranteed for free for people on public or private insurance plans, but some experts have raised concerns about the potential cost facing the estimated 25 million uninsured Americans. In September, federal health officials and manufacturers announced a partnership to temporarily provide free vaccines to uninsured individuals using leftover pandemic emergency funds.\n\nIowans can find free or low-cost options for vaccines through the federal vaccines.gov website. Uninsured and underinsured children are guaranteed free access to vaccines through the federal Vaccines for Children Program.\n\nLocal residents can also find clinics offering free or low-cost vaccines by contacting the Polk County Health Department or visiting immunizepolk.com.\n\nHow many people will seek out the boosters, however, remains unclear, as uptake of the vaccine has dropped in recent years. Only 21% of Iowans were up-to-date on their COVID-19 vaccinations as of Oct. 13, the latest data available from the CDC.\n\nWhen can I get the new COVID booster shot?\n\nNew COVID-19 vaccines are available at clinics and pharmacies across the state. Check with your doctor or local retail pharmacy to schedule an appointment.\n\nExperts say individuals should wait at least two months after getting the last dose of any COVID-19 vaccine before getting the latest booster.\n\nBeyond that, the timing of the shot may depend on your risk factors or your and your family's schedule, Tucker Reinders said. However, it's important that individuals check their calendars and make sure they get the vaccine before interacting with any at-risk loved one, especially if cases start to increase as temperatures drop.\n\n\"Especially as we head into the holiday season, we want to make sure that we are as protected as possible before we gather with family members, friends or whoever might have weaker immune systems or might otherwise be medically fragile,\" she said.\n\nWhat are the new RSV vaccines?\n\nRSV is one of the most common respiratory viruses in the United States, with nearly everyone getting infected by the time they reach the age of 2, according to the CDC.\n\nSymptoms are similar to a cold for most, but the virus poses a heightened risk to young infants and seniors, said Dr. Pat Winokur, an infectious disease specialist and co-director of the Institute for Clinical and Translational Science at the University of Iowa.\n\nNow, these vulnerable groups have additional protection.\n\nEarlier this year, federal regulators approved two vaccines — developed by pharmaceutical companies GSK and Pfizer — to reduce risk of infection in adults ages 60 and older. Clinical studies of both these vaccines offer strong protection against infection and an even higher rate of success in preventing severe disease in older adults, Winokur said.\n\nIn addition, the vaccine offers protection for two RSV seasons.\n\nA vaccine administered to pregnant women in their third trimester has also been approved by federal health regulators and was recently backed by CDC experts, clearing the way for the first vaccine meant to protect young children from the virus to hit the market. Made by Pfizer, the vaccine would be given to pregnant people who reach 32 to 36 weeks of gestation between September to January.\n\nThe goal is to protect babies born between October and March, when the risk of RSV infection is at its highest. Studies have shown the new vaccine is effective in reducing the risk of RSV hospitalization among vaccinated babies by 57% in the first six months after birth.\n\nFederal health officials have also approved two monoclonal antibody treatments to help protect babies and some infants from severe illness from RSV. One drug, called Beyfortus, can be given to babies younger than 8 months old entering their first RSV season and to those ages 8 months to 19 months who are at increased risk of severe disease.\n\nThe other treatment option, called Synagis, is limited to children under the age of 2 with certain conditions that place them at increased risk for severe illness from an RSV infection. This treatment is given once a month to the child during RSV season.\n\nWho qualifies for the new RSV vaccine for older adults?\n\nThe CDC is not recommending all adults ages 60 and older get the RSV vaccine. Instead, individuals 60 and older should talk with their health care provider to decide whether the vaccine is appropriate for them.\n\n\"If you are 60 and very healthy with no chronic medical conditions, maybe this isn't the vaccine that you need,\" Winokur said. \"If you are 65 or 70 and you have chronic lung disease or chronic cardiac disease or you have other chronic medical conditions, this may be a very important vaccine for you.\"\n\nClinical studies did detect rare, but severe, side effects in both vaccines, prompting federal regulators to take a more measured recommendation for the initial rollout, Winokur said. However, she emphasized that health officials will continue to monitor the vaccine's effectiveness and any potential side effects.\n\nWinokur noted that flu vaccines, which are now recommended for virtually all Americans, had a similar rollout when first introduced in the United States.\n\n\"This measured approach has been done before, and flu vaccines are a great example,\" she said.\n\nHow can I get an RSV vaccine?\n\nIowans will likely need to seek out the new vaccines at their doctor's office, especially for babies and young infants, Winokur said.\n\nHowever, retail pharmacies such as Walgreens have announced plans to offer RSV vaccines to older adults. Check with your local pharmacy to see if they are scheduling appointments.\n\nWhat do I need to know about this year's flu shot?\n\nThe CDC recommends all Americans ages 6 months and older get a vaccine against influenza. Clinics and retail pharmacies across the state are still appointments for the shot.\n\nTucker Reinders encouraged Iowans to get the shot two weeks ahead of any holiday gatherings or other family events, especially if they will be interacting with babies, elderly relatives or other at-risk loved ones.\n\n\"Protecting ourselves with a vaccine isn't just about us. It's also about caring for those around us,\" she said.\n\nCan I get my COVID booster, flu shot and RSV vaccine together?\n\nHealth officials are confident individuals of all ages can safely receive their COVID and influenza vaccines at the same time, Winokur said. Iowans can typically receive these shots at the same time at retail pharmacies and clinics across the state.\n\nThe CDC says individuals can receive the RSV vaccine at the same time as other vaccines. However, there's no data on how this new shot will interact with the updated COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nBecause individuals will likely have to seek out RSV vaccines at their local doctor's office, Winokur said Iowans will likely have to schedule separate appointments regardless.\n\nEither way, Winokur said individuals should talk with their doctor if they have questions about the appropriate timing.\n\nMichaela Ramm covers health care for the Des Moines Register.

To reach Biden's goal, that number would need to increase to about one million adults newly vaccinated each day.\n\nWhile the U.S. will likely fall short of Biden's initial target, the White House announced Tuesday that more than 70% of Americans age 30 and older have received at least one COVID-19 shot, and said that the country is on track to vaccinate 70% of people age 27 and older by the Fourth of July weekend.\n\nHow many adults will be vaccinated by July 4 if COVID-19 shots are given at the current rate?\n\nJust over half of the nation's total population, including children, have received at least one vaccine. The pace of vaccine administration has fallen significantly from its peak in early April, when more than 2 million adults were reported newly vaccinated each day.\n\nThe Biden administration is working to pick up the pace by increasing public outreach, as well as encouraging vaccine incentives like discounts or sweepstakes for vaccinated people.

The shots, which are updated for variants circulating this year, could become available in Ohio in the coming weeks.\n\nWith a new booster on the way, The Dispatch checked back in with one of the most familiar faces throughout the pandemic — Dr. Joe Gastaldo, medical director of infectious diseases for OhioHealth.\n\nRead More:Can Ohio State students sue for a refund of their COVID-19 semester fees?\n\nGastaldo weighed in on what people should know about the new booster, when exactly it will likely be available and when people should get it. Although more federal guidance is forthcoming, Gastaldo said it's likely that doctors will recommend anyone eligible for the original COVID vaccines get this latest dose as well.\n\n\"It's very important to get this,\" Gastaldo said. \"The virus is not going away. It is endemic, and we still have to be cognizant of unknowns with this virus.\"\n\nHere's what else the doctor had to say about the latest round of COVID vaccines:\n\nWhen should Ohioans start getting the new booster shot?\n\nIt won't be long, Gastaldo said, before the new COVID shot is shipped out to pharmacies and health care providers nationwide.\n\nOnce the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention signs off on the shot, Gastaldo said it would likely be a matter of days before the new booster is available.\n\nSupplies of the updated vaccine were expected to be available to providers by the end of this week, Ohio Department of Health Director Bruce Vanderhoff said Thursday night.\n\nHe said the vaccines would continue to be readily available to Ohioans, including to those without insurance.\n\n“If you have medical insurance, and that includes Medicare or Medicaid, vaccines should be covered as a preventive health service, which means you likely will have no out-of-pocket costs,” Vanderhoff said. “Those without insurance can take advantage of several programs to ensure they can continue to get free vaccines, as well.”\n\nBut when it comes to the question of when Ohioans should make an appointment for their next COVID jab, Gastaldo said there is no one right answer.\n\n\"It depends on the person, if someone's had COVID recently, or if you're healthier,\" the doctor said.\n\nA person who has had COVID can wait between four and six months before getting the new booster. That's due to the fact that catching the disease boosts a person's immunity on its own temporarily, Gastaldo said.\n\nOhioans over the age of 65 and those who are immunocompromised should get the shot right away, Gastaldo said. Relatively healthy individuals may be able to wait to get the booster if they want to time it around when they'll be seeing people over the holidays, he said.\n\nDoes it protect against newer variants?\n\nThe short answer is yes.\n\nTesting has shown the new COVID shot is effective at preventing serious disease from newer variants, including the XBB.1.5 strain and the eg.5 variant.\n\nSimilar to the process followed annually by the flu vaccine, the latest COVID shot was reformulated to target the most likely variants of the virus that would be circulating this fall and winter, Gastaldo said.\n\nRead More:Life in a COVID ward: Frontline workers struggle to save lives, taking each day as it comes\n\nAlthough it's possible another unknown strain could yet develop, Gastaldo said the new booster has proved to be able to ward off serious infections of the latest variants.\n\n\"There's a soup of variants out there and we make the best prediction we can,\" Gastaldo said.\n\nHow safe is this booster and can Ohioans get it with other shots?\n\nAs in years past, Gastaldo said it is still safe to get the new COVID booster and the flu shot at the same time. In fact, Gastaldo said eligible Ohioans could even get the COVID booster, the flu shot and a vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) all in the same visit to the doctor's office or local pharmacy.\n\nVaccines for RSV, another respiratory illness that can cause serious infection in infants and the elderly, became available for the first time this year. Ohioans over the age of 65 and soon-to-be moms in their third trimester of pregnancy can get vaccinated for RSV, the doctor said.\n\nThe latest COVID boosters are just as safe as previous versions of the vaccine, Gastaldo said. Supporting that is the fact that mRNA COVID vaccines have been given to hundreds of millions nationwide with relatively few negative outcomes by comparison, according to the FDA.\n\nThe latest dose uses mRNA just as the original shots from Pfizer and Moderna both did, Gastaldo said. The difference is that the formula's genetic makeup has been retooled to better target the latest variants.\n\n\"I feel quite comfortable as a clinician recommending these (shots),\" Gastaldo said. \"There's so many different eyes that are looking at things. ...

This would create what’s known as a bivalent, or two component, booster.\n\n“We have advised manufacturers seeking to update their COVID-19 vaccines that they should develop modified vaccines that add an omicron BA.4/5 spike protein component to the current vaccine composition to create a two component (bivalent) booster vaccine, so that the modified vaccines can potentially be used starting in early to mid-fall 2022,” Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said Thursday in a statement.\n\nIndependent advisers to the FDA met on Tuesday and the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee voted to support recommending inclusion of an Omicron-specific component for a Covid-19 booster.\n\nThe committee felt that a modified vaccine would offer broader protection to match the coronavirus strains that are in circulation now.

The levels of neutralizing antibodies that a previous infection or vaccinations elicit are several times lower against these subvariants compared with the original coronavirus, studies suggest. This means while the current vaccines still provide substantial protection against severe disease, these subvariants could likely lead to surges of new infections.\n\nMarks said Tuesday that there will be a conversation going forward to determine who needs another booster and what that booster will look like.\n\nThe FDA said in May that the “new normal” may include an annual Covid-19 and flu shot for people in the fall. Cases are expected to rise again in the fall and winter.\n\nFiguring out what goes in the next vaccines are a tricky decision, because as Dr. Arnold Monto, the acting chair of the independent vaccine advisers committee, suggested, this is a virus that changes quickly and puts scientists in “uncharted territory”\n\n“Looking in the past doesn’t help us a great deal to look in the future for this virus which has baffled a lot of us and made predictions almost irrelevant,” Monto added.\n\nThe FDA said Thursday that this coming year is what it considers a “transitional period.” It has not advised manufacturers to change the primary vaccination for those who still have not gotten the Covid-19 vaccine. The FDA said that the primary series of shots that use the formula created to fight the version of the virus that first emerged in 2019 still provides a base of protection against serious Covid-19 symptoms, even with the version of the virus that is currently in circulation.\n\nThe new formulation would instead go into a booster shot that may be introduced in the fall.\n\nVaccine makers have already been testing new versions of their vaccines and presented the data at the independent advisers meeting on Tuesday.\n\nModerna’s presented details about its bivalent booster vaccine candidate that contains components of both Moderna’s original Covid-19 vaccine and a vaccine that targets the original Omicron variant.\n\nWhile it isn’t specifically designed to target BA.4/5, the company said its booster known as mRNA-1273.214 demonstrates a “potent neutralizing antibody response” against these subvariants.\n\nPfizer/BioNTech also presented data to the committee that showed that their two Covid-19 vaccine boosters targeting Omicron showed a substantially higher immune response than its current Covid-19 vaccine. Preliminary lab studies suggest the vaccines could also neutralize the Omicron BA.4 and BA.5.\n\n“Based on the strength of our initial data from our Omicron BA.1 bivalent candidates, we believe we have a strong solution with a bivalent BA.4/BA.5 subvariant booster as we head into this next chapter of the pandemic, and will continue to share our available data with health experts and regulators. We are ready to distribute a vaccine to the world by early October 2022, pending regulatory authorizations,” said a Pfizer spokesperson in a statement to CNN.\n\nAnother vaccine maker, Novavax, has committee support for emergency use authorization in the United States, but the FDA has not yet authorized its vaccine. Novavax told the committee that it has been developing variant-specific updated versions of its Covid-19 vaccine as well as a Covid-19 and flu combination vaccine.\n\nOn Thursday, the FDA encouraged the vaccine makers to submit the latest data on these modified vaccines to the FDA for evaluation prior to the authorization of an Omicron BA.4/5 component vaccine.\n\nThe FDA also said it would ask vaccine makers to begin clinical trials with modified vaccines with the Omicron BA.4/5 component, because the agency said the data would be helpful as the pandemic “further evolves.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAt Tuesday’s meeting, the World Health Organization told the FDA’s independent committee that the vaccination strategy going forward should probably be based around a vaccine that would offer as broad a kind of protection as possible, rather than just continuing with the vaccines that were made against the original strain that is no longer in circulation.\n\n“I still think there’s value in increasing the breath of immunity and I will reiterate that we’re not trying to match what may circulate,” said Dr. Kanta Subbarao with the World Health Organization Collaborating Center for Reference and Research on Influenza and the University of Melbourne. “It is not so much to match what is likely to circulate because there’s so much uncertainty about the trajectory of this evolution.”", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/06/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2024/06/05/covid-19-vaccine-jn-1-fda-panel/73975197007/", "title": "New COVID-19 vaccine for fall should target JN.1 lineage, not ...", "text": "A panel of health experts convened this week to decide which vaccine the U.S. should use against COVID-19 this fall.\n\nThe federal advisory group decided on Wednesday the new vaccine should focus on the JN.1 lineage that has dominated virus strains in recommendations.\n\nThe Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee – composed of leading U.S. health experts – gathered virtually to recommend a new vaccine to supplement protection against COVID-19, which weakens over time. Current vaccines built to fight XBB.1.5 also don’t provide as much protection against JN.1 and several sub-variants driving cases for months, officials and vaccine makers said during the hourslong meeting.\n\nThe 16-member panel, which gathered four previous times since 2022, unanimously voted for a shot that would target the JN.1 lineage. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is expected to use the committee’s recommendations to develop vaccines for the next year. The recommendations follow a recent assessment by the World Health Organization that vaccines should use a “monovalent JN.1 lineage” for vaccines.\n\nBridge Access Program:Free COVID-19 vaccines could be a thing of the past. Experts weigh in.\n\nThe panelists considered several JN.1 sub-variants. The sub-variants KP.2 and KP.3, which are very similar to JN.1, have been driving new cases, according to federal tracking estimates. Officials noted that COVID-19 is rapidly evolving. The goal of the group was to capture the virus’ changes ahead of expected upticks in cases later this year.\n\nVaccine manufacturers Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax each told the panel they were prepared to make JN.1-targeted vaccines available in August pending FDA approval.\n\nLate in 2023, JN.1 overtook the XBB lineage that formed last year’s vaccines. Officials said JN.1 infections were no more severe than XBB cases. This was distinct from the severity when cases jumped from delta to omicron variants that drove cases, hospitalizations and deaths globally in 2021.\n\nLast year’s vaccine offered increased protection against COVID-19 to people who got the vaccine, officials said. It terms of protection by lineage, last year’s vaccine for XBB.1.5 gave protection against the JN.1 lineage, however, it likely wasn’t as effective compared to other XBB lineage sub-variants.\n\nCOVID-19 sub-variants:There's a new COVID-19 variant called FLiRT: Here's what you need to know about it\n\nUpdated vaccines are set to be released in the fall, ahead of expected winter upticks in COVID-19 cases.

On Wednesday, the panel didn’t say whether older people would need boosters.

With masks going by the wayside, a vaccine may offer the best protection against infection and severe disease.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has yet to issue specific recommendations but many are expecting that COVID boosters will soon become annual events, with tweaks made each year depending on the dominant strain similar to the way the flu vaccine works.\n\n“We’re in for a big change from the CDC,” said Dr. Rick Reifenberg, a primary care physician and former chief medical officer for HealthNet, a federally qualified health center with nine locations in Central Indiana.“We’re all curious as clinicians, what is the CDC going to suggest going forward.”\n\nHere’s what we know so far:\n\nCOVID-19 seeing slight uptick\n\nNew COVID-19 cases are among the lowest levels they have been since the start of the pandemic, according to the state’s COVID dashboard.\n\nBut that could also be due in part to the fact that many people who test positive do so through home tests that never get reported. Week over week, there is a rise in cases of 29 for a total of 145.\n\nThe amount of the virus officials have tracked in wastewater has risen slightly and emergency room department visits for COVID exceeded last week’s numbers by seven.\n\nWhat will be in this fall’s COVID shot?\n\nIn June the Food and Drug Administration told vaccine makers that they hoped to see a vaccine for the fall that would protect against a strain of the virus that’s related to Omicron.Unlike last year’s bivalent booster, which targeted the original strain of COVID and two Omicron strains, this shot will only target an XBB strain, which experts are predicting will be the dominant one this fall. The new shot will not contain any protection against the first COVID strain, which has not been in circulation since 2021.\n\nWhen might this new COVID shot arrive?\n\nIn July, Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra sent a letter to COVID vaccine manufacturers advising them to have vaccines ready for the FDA to approve and the CDC to recommend by the “latter part of September.”Last week during earning calls, Moderna and Pfizer officials announced their companies are poised to start shipping doses as soon as the FDA approves their new vaccines. Novovax has a similar vaccine waiting in the wings.\n\nWho should get the new COVID shot?\n\nUntil the CDC makes formal recommendations, it’s hard to know.\n\nIn April, the CDC recommended that everyone 6 years of age and older receive a bivalent booster whether or not they had completed the initial two-dose series.\n\nThe CDC could decide to go a similar path and recommend this new shot for anyone, regardless of their vaccine history.\n\nCan you still get COVID vaccines now?\n\nAbsolutely. HealthNet is holding vaccine clinics at least through the end of this week where they dole out the primary series or the booster for free, depending on their age and health condition\n\nMost of the adults they’re currently seeing are taking the booster, though periodically they do meet a patient who has just decided to get the vaccine for the first time, Reifenberg said.\n\nFor more information about the clinics, visit indyhealthnet.org/covid-19.\n\nIf you’re up-to-date on your shots, what should you do?\n\nAt this point the best course for those who are up-to-date is just to wait and see what the CDC recommends, Reifenberg said.\n\nContact IndyStar reporter Shari Rudavsky at shari.rudavsky@aherron", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/20/health/child-vax-rates-school-mandates/index.html", "title": "Covid-19 vaccines will be on the 2023 vaccine schedule, but that ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nCovid-19 vaccines will be part of recommended immunization schedules in 2023 for both children and adults, after a unanimous vote by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s independent Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.\n\nThat doesn’t make the vaccines mandatory for anyone, a point that was emphasized in a discussion before Thursday’s vote. The board members addressed concerns from the public that adding Covid-19 vaccinations to the schedule would force schools to require the shots.\n\n“We recognize that there is concern around this, but moving Covid-19 to the recommended immunization schedule does not impact what vaccines are required for school entrance, if any,” said Dr. Nirav Shah, a committee member and director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n“Indeed, there are vaccines that are on the schedule right now that are not required for school attendance in many jurisdictions, such as seasonal influenza. Local control matters, and we honor that. The decision around school entrance for vaccines rests where it did before, which is with the state level, the county level and at the municipal level, if it exists at all. They are the arbiters of what vaccines are required, if any, for school entry. This discussion does not change that.”\n\nIn fact, Covid-19 vaccines are explicitly banned from being included in school mandates in at least 20 states. Only California and the District of Columbia have announced that Covid-19 shots will be among mandated vaccinations for students, but those mandates were not implemented for this school year.\n\nIt’s been nearly a year since eligibility for the Covid-19 vaccine was expanded to include everyone in the US 5 and older, but coverage among children still lags behind that of adults. Even as these vaccines and the related mandates have become highly politicized over the course of the pandemic, experts say vaccine hesitancy among parents isn’t new.\n\nAlthough the Covid-19 shot will not become mandatory for school, all 50 states do have laws requiring specific vaccines for students – most of which include shots for measles, mumps and rubella (MMR), diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTaP) and varicella.\n\nUptake for these vaccines, mandated by schools long before Covid-19, fell during the pandemic.\n\nIn the 2020-21 school year, vaccination coverage for kindergarteners fell to less than 94% – dropping below the overall target of 95% that was set as an objective by the US Department of Health and Human Services in the Healthy People project for the first time in six years.\n\nA CNN analysis of the latest CDC data suggests that students in states with stricter school vaccine requirements are more likely to have their shots.\n\nAll school immunization laws grant exemptions to children for specific medical reasons. But 44 states and Washington, DC, also grant religious exemptions, and 15 states allow philosophical or moral exemptions for children, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nAccording to the CNN analysis, states that were stricter with exemptions were much more likely to still meet the 95% coverage target. In the 2020-21 school year, an average of about 96% of kindergarten students had their MMR vaccine in states that allowed only medical exemptions, compared with 92% of students in states that also allowed philosophical or moral exemptions.\n\nThe full effect of the pandemic on children’s routine vaccination rates isn’t clear: It will be another few months before the CDC shares national data for compliance rates for mandatory vaccinations in the 2021-22 school year, and schools are in the midst of outreach and programming to ensure that as many students as possible will continue through the 2022-23 school year up to date on their vaccines.\n\nVaccine hesitancy isn’t new\n\nCorrecting the drop in vaccination coverage in students will probably depend more on better access to care, information and outreach – and school vaccine mandates can help.\n\nWith many people who are hesitant, it’s “because of something they’ve heard or something they’ve read,” said Dr. Jesse Hackell, a pediatrician who co-authored a clinical report about countering vaccine hesitancy in 2016. “Most people [who are hesitant] have a very free-floating worry about vaccines. It’s not specific in most cases.”\n\nA small share of parents – about 2% or 3% – are adamantly opposed to vaccines, and that rate has stayed mostly consistent over the years, said Hackell, who is also chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Practice and Ambulatory Medicine.\n\nOverall vaccination coverage fell among kindergarteners in the 2020-21 school year, but the share of students who had an exemption also declined from 2.5% to 2.1%, according to CDC data. The rate has changed by less than 1 percentage point over the past 10 years.\n\nAbout 3% of kindergarteners in the US – about 120,000 students – were considered to be out of compliance with mandatory vaccines in the 2020-21 school year.\n\n“Mandates may not do anything to those people who would pull their kids out of public school,” Hackell said. “But the vast majority of parents are not opposed. They’re hesitant, or they’re uncertain. And when there’s pressure to do it for another reason, such as getting your kid into school, they come around.”\n\nResponsibility for enforcing vaccine mandates falls to the education system, and practices vary by state. Some students are ultimately turned away because they aren’t up to date, but most states offer provisional enrollment periods that allow kids to stay in school if they are in progress with at least one shot in a series or evidence of an upcoming appointment.\n\nAccording to the CDC, “school officials may prefer to keep students in school where they have access to education, safe supervision, nutrition, and social services while working with parents or guardians to get children vaccinated.”\n\nAnd many states do their best to help students stay up to date on their immunizations, with vaccination drives and direct followup with parents.\n\n“I think that the drop in the past year or two is partly pandemic-related,” Hackell said. “What we’re seeing, I think, is a little bit of a disparity between kids who have a medical home and have a private [doctor] versus kids who get their immunizations from a public source” like a school clinic.\n\nA model of high vaccination: Mississippi\n\nMississippi is an impressive example of finding ways to keep child vaccination rates high, Hackell says. Public schools are the only option for many in the state, where poverty rates are higher than anywhere else in the US.\n\nDespite the large public need and additional resource struggles that the pandemic brought, 99% of kindergarteners in Mississippi met required vaccination coverage in the 2020-21 school year – better than any other state, according to the CDC.\n\n“They’ve done a tremendous job at that,” Hackell said, and it demonstrates the power of mandates. Mississippi is strict with exemptions – one of just six states allowing medical reasons only – and just 0.1% of kindergarteners were exempt in the 2020-21 school year.\n\nHackell says he would be most concerned if he sees a sustained drop in vaccination rates for highly transmissible diseases, especially measles and polio. And he’s worried about pockets of low vaccination rates in certain communities.\n\nSchools are public spaces with a level of control, and 95% vaccination coverage is a goal with intent.\n\n“We know it’s never going to be 100% because there are some people who cannot medically be vaccinated. But if you have 95%, that means in any given school classroom of 30 kids, there might be one unvaccinated kid. And so if that child brings a case of something into the class, there’s nobody else to give it to,” he said. “It stops there with one case.”\n\nAnd when it comes to adding Covid-19 vaccines to the CDC’s recommended immunization schedule, the focus is still on public health – not on adding another requirement.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“I’ve had parents who come in my office, and I say, ‘What are you here for?’ And they say, ‘Well, we’re here for vaccines so that our kids can go to school.’ And I’ve said, ‘OK, I understand that, but really I’m not vaccinating so you can go to school, I’m vaccinating because I want to prevent serious disease and death in your kids,’ ” Dr. Matthew Daley, an ACIP member and senior investigator with the Institute for Health Research at Kaiser Permanente Colorado, said at Thursday’s advisory meeting.\n\n“And the fact that there’s a school immunization requirement helps because it brought you into the office, but that’s not my goal.

Nonetheless, it is time to accept that the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is the new normal. It will likely circulate globally for the foreseeable future, taking its place alongside other common respiratory viruses such as influenza. And it likely will require similar annual consideration for vaccine composition updates,” Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research; Principal Deputy Commissioner Dr. Janet Woodcock; and new FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf wrote in a paper published in the medical journal JAMA on Monday.\n\n“During the 2022-2023 COVID-19 vaccine planning and selection process, it is important to recognize that the fall season will present a major opportunity to improve COVID-19 vaccination coverage with the goal of minimizing future societal disruption and saving lives,” they wrote. “With the plan for implementation of this year’s vaccine selection process, society is moving toward a new normal that may well include annual COVID-19 vaccination alongside seasonal influenza vaccination.”\n\nJune could be when FDA officials make a decision on the composition of Covid-19 vaccines for the fall and winter seasons – and what the vaccination plans might be.\n\nBy this summer, “decisions will need to be made” on who should be eligible for additional Covid-19 shots in the fall, and by June, the composition of the vaccines will need to be determined, Marks, Woodcock and Califf wrote.\n\nLast week, the FDA announced plans to convene its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee on June 28 to discuss whether the composition of current Covid-19 vaccines should be modified, and if so, what updates should be selected for the fall.\n\n“In terms of practical considerations, at the recent meeting of the VRBPAC, there was relatively uniform agreement that a single vaccine composition used by all manufacturers was desirable and that data would be needed to inform and drive the selection of a monovalent, bivalent, or multivalent COVID-19 vaccine,” Marks, Woodcock and Califf wrote. “There was also general agreement that, should a new vaccine composition be recommended based on the totality of the available clinical and epidemiologic evidence, optimally it could be used for both primary vaccination as well as booster administration.”\n\nVRBPAC members met in April to discuss how the composition of Covid-19 vaccines could change to target any new and emerging coronavirus variants. The committee agreed that there needs to be a framework for how and when such changes take place. The advisers plan to continue their conversation in the coming months.\n\n“By summer, decisions will need to be made for the 2022-2023 season about who should be eligible for vaccination with additional boosters and regarding vaccine composition. Administering additional COVID-19 vaccine doses to appropriate individuals this fall around the time of the usual influenza vaccine campaign has the potential to protect susceptible individuals against hospitalization and death, and therefore will be a topic for FDA consideration,” Marks, Woodcock and Califf wrote.\n\nCertain immunocompromised people and adults 50 and older are eligible for additional booster doses of Covid-19 vaccine in the United States. The FDA officials added that for those who have yet to get vaccinated or boosted, getting a vaccine dose now will not have adverse effects that preempt getting an additional dose in the fall.\n\nThe composition of the current vaccines could be updated to target circulating coronavirus variants. Marks, Woodcock and Califf wrote that this coming fall and winter, three factors may come together to place the nation at additional risk of Covid-19: waning immunity, seasonal waves of more coronavirus spread, and the further evolution of the coronavirus, leading to new variants.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“The timeframe to determine the composition of the COVID-19 vaccine for the 2022-2023 season, to use alongside the seasonal influenza vaccine for administration in the Northern Hemisphere beginning in about October, is compressed because of the time required for manufacturing the necessary doses,” the officials wrote. “A decision on composition will need to be made in the US by June 2022.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/05/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/coronavirus/2022/09/02/nj-fda-covid-booster-omicron-pfizer-moderna/65470116007/", "title": "New COVID boosters targeting omicron variants available in NJ in ...", "text": "State officials announced a new COVID-19 booster aimed at the omnicron variants will be available to everyone ages 12 and up.\n\nThe COVID-19 bivalent booster dose is expected to offer stronger protections against severe illness and death from the BA.4 and BA.5 omicron subvariants as well as the original COVID strain and can be received two months after a person's most recent booster or primary series.\n\nThe booster recommendation comes from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

During a sweltering two weeks in Washington, American and British political and military leaders hammered out an agreement that included a specific timetable for what would become the D-Day invasion of Nazi-occupied France on June 6, 1944.\n\nThe Trident conference of 1943 also bequeathed the alliances that have become a target in the 2024 race for the White House, particularly the North American Treaty Organization.\n\nAs President Joe Biden and other world leaders head to Normandy to mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day this week, they will also be defending alliances that guided the western world through World War II, the Cold War, the war on terror and, currently, Russia's bloody invasion of Ukraine.\n\nTrump has repeatedly threatened to abandon NATO, saying the U.S. bears too much of the burden. But supporting – and attacking – international agreements can be traced back in part to the Trident Conference of 1943.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n\"It was a crucial moment,\" said Thomas A. Schwartz, a distinguished professor of history at Vanderbilt University. \"The importance of the trans-Atlantic relationship remains to this day.\"\n\nHere's a look at how D-Day came together politically and diplomatically – and how those negotiations still echo.\n\nRoosevelt and Churchill\n\nTrident featured one of the world's greatest geopolitical partnerships: U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill.\n\nTheir relationship is revered by history, but their interests at the time didn't always align.\n\nIn May of 1943, American officials had grave concerns as Churchill and a large entourage of British military officials arrived in crowded war-time Washington.\n\nThere was talk that the British might back away from their previous commitment to support a 1944 invasion of Nazi-held France, across the English Channel into the Normandy region.\n\nChurchill and others, haunted by the blood-soaked trench warfare in Europe that marked the First World War, instead pushed for an invasion of Italy and other parts of southern Europe.\n\nFearful over whether a cross-channel attack could succeed, Churchill wanted to go after what he called the Nazis' \"soft underbelly.\" At one point, he suggested pushing the operation in France back to even 1946.\n\nAs with other summits of this type, these differences were not aired publicly amid all the pomp. Officials worked things out in private, and left disputes for the history books.\n\nFDR and the U.S. push for 1944\n\nFDR and Pentagon officials wanted a cross-channel invasion as soon as possible, if only to take some pressure off another ally: The Soviet Union.\n\nThe Soviets were engaged in brutal fighting with the Germans in the east, and leader Joseph Stalin was demanding that western allies generate a second front to spread out the German military.\n\nWhile emerging as the dominant partner over the British, Roosevelt and the Americans wanted to be careful with Churchill. They still needed Britain's help, particularly as a staging area for the operation over the English Channel.\n\nThis basic dispute – attack western Europe or southern Europe – dominated two weeks of hard negotiating, plus some wining and dining as the Americans alternated between intense pressure and gentle persuasion.\n\nIn the end, Roosevelt and the U.S. were in an increasingly strong position to force their will, as they were busy supplying more troops, more equipment and more money to the war effort.\n\nThe deal in 1943\n\nThe two sides wound up with a face-saving deal involving both Italy and the D-Day operation in France.\n\nDelegates at the Trident conference agreed to transfer more military divisions to Britain to begin staging the assault on Normandy. The British also agreed to a target date for D-Day: May 1, 1944; that would eventually slip by a little more than a month.\n\nThe U.S., meanwhile, backed an attack on Italy, though that proved to be a harder-than-expected exercise. Allied forces didn't enter Rome until June 4, 1944, news that was quickly eclipsed by the Allied landings in Normandy just two days later.\n\n'A plan now existed'\n\nThen, as now, the public statements on Trident papered over the differences behind closed doors. So did many of the books and articles that followed the war, although later authors and historians reported the tense maneuvering behind the scenes.\n\nThe bottom line: The British, finally, fully signed onto D-Day.\n\n\"Despite this glossing over, a plan now existed where there had been no plan,\" wrote Rick Atkinson in \"The Day of Battle: The War in Sicily and Italy, 1943-44.\"\n\nAtkinson said all the planning disputes about the Normandy invasion \"were kicked around and argued about\" at the Trident conference. \"That's the nature of alliances, especially with the stakes as high as they were.\"\n\nPeople still debate the meaning of the agreements reached in Washington, and which negotiator made out the best.\n\nDavid M. Kennedy, author of \"Freedom From Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-1945,\" wrote that the agreement \"signaled the beginning of Roosevelt’s ascendance over Churchill in the scales of geopolitical influence and cheered the president’s advisers.\"\n\nIt wasn't a total loss for the British, other historians have said. Some U.S. officials had wanted to divert resources to the war against Japan in the Pacific; Churchill and his negotiators managed to keep the focus on Europe, including a strike at Italy.\n\nStill, the relationship between the United States and NATO, up and down over the years, now faces a new challenge: The 2024 presidential race between Biden and Trump.\n\nNATO and the 2024 election\n\nBiden is only the latest president to travel to Normandy to commemorate D-Day, and to pay tribute to the trans-Atlantic alliance that emerged from the planning of it.\n\nDuring his upcoming visit to Normandy, Biden will speak about \"the importance of defending freedom and democracy,\" the White House said in its announcement.\n\nAlso on the agenda: \"The enduring and comprehensive relationship between the United States and France, our oldest ally, founded on shared democratic values, economic ties, and defense and security cooperation.\"\n\nEven Trump, then president, honored the U.S.-Europe-NATO relationship during the 75th anniversary of D-Day in 2019.\n\n“To all of our friends and partners − our cherished alliance was forged in the heat of battle, tested in the trials of war and proven in the blessings of peace,\" Trump said. “Our bond is unbreakable.”\n\nTrump has taken a different attitude toward international cooperation at other times in his presidency, and during his 2024 presidential campaign. The Republican candidate has said that too many countries have taken advantage of the United States.\n\nDuring a February event in Conway, South Carolina, Trump claimed that one foreign leader once asked him whether the U.S. would come to the defense of his country if Russia attacked, even if he felt his country had not paid enough for mutual defense.\n\n“No, I would not protect you,” Trump said he told the leader. “In fact, I would encourage them (the Russians) to do whatever the hell they want. You got to pay. You got to pay your bills.”\n\nNATO members are asked to spend at least 2% of their GDP on defense. Not all members have reached this goal, fueling Trump's criticism of the alliance.\n\nBiden and other world leaders condemned Trump's attacks against NATO saying he is putting Ukraine and other potential Russian targets at further risk.\n\n\"He wants to walk away from NATO,\" Biden said after Trump's South Carolina comments. \"He doesn’t understand that the sacred commitment that we’ve given works for us as well.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/06/05/d-day-patton-concerts/9989861/", "title": "Gen.

Helen Patton is 52.\n\nSAINT-PIERRE-DU-MONT, France — Helen Patton is here for the 70th anniversary of D-Day, but the granddaughter of the famous World War II general doesn't want a somber ceremony.\n\nPatton, 52, will host two concerts to bookend Friday's official ceremony with world leaders as a way to attract young people to remember the battle.\n\n\"With the Patton concerts, we want to find a new way to commemorate, something different than the same old-same old with military drums,\" said the granddaughter of Gen. George S. Patton.\n\nAs she put it: \"Let's do war and peace\" – emphasis on the latter.\n\nThe concerts are among hundreds of events large and small in the French province of Normandy to commemorate the invasion and the ensuing Battle of Normandy, which lasted several weeks and cost thousands of lives.\n\nEvery small village has something on the calendar, often involving processions of schoolchildren and wreath-laying ceremonies at liberation monuments that dot the region.\n\nAmong this year's celebrations:\n\n•The town of Bayeux, pop. 14,000, will hold more than a dozen major events through June 14, ranging from an open-air photo exhibit to a Flash Mob du D-Day gathering.\n\n•In Caen, a small group called Amitié Franco-Americaine (French American Friendship) honors a different U.S. soldier every year by creating a shrine at the place he was killed. This year, the spotlight is on Maj. Richard O'Malley.\n\n•The news on France 3, one of the country`s major television networks, is broadcast live from a different Allied landing site each day.\n\n\"We will never forget,\" Philippe Laillier, mayor of Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer, said before going on the air as a guest on a France 3 newscast at Omaha Beach. \"There are families of veterans and French families that have maintained lasting contacts over the last 70 years.\"\n\nThousands of visitors from around the world are expected in the region over this weekend. Houses and buildings are decorated with more American flags than one might see stateside on July 4, though the stars-and-stripes often share space with French, British and Canadian banners.\n\nFriday's main ceremony will include President Obama, British Prime Minister David Cameron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nSaturday, Patton plans a repeat of Thursday's concert, which took place on a stage at Utah Beach, one of the two spots where American troops made amphibious landings June 6, 1944.\n\nThe second concert will be in the small village of Néhou, where Patton's grandfather was stationed while waiting to lead his 3rd Army deeper into France and eventually into west-central Europe to spearhead the Allied effort in the Battle of the Bulge.\n\nThe area encompassing what's now called Camp Patton in Néhou was until recently owned by Benedictine nuns. About two decades ago, they offered Helen Patton the chance to take it over, along with a former monastery that had, among other things, served as a Wehrmacht officers headquarters during the German occupation.\n\nAt the time, she was settling in with her husband, a German doctor, on the German side of the French-German border. Patton, a mother and housewife, was organizing theater productions. During the Bosnian conflict in the 1990s, she invited youths from rival ethnic groups to Germany to participate in an artistic workshop. That led to the creation of a German-based foundation called the Patton Stiftung Sustainable Trust. Later she founded the independent U.S.-based Patton Foundation. The two organizations co-organized the D-Day concerts.\n\nDouglas Gordon, president and CEO of the Patton Foundation, views the concerts as a new way to preserve fading memories. \"We want to get the story out about the sacrifice made during World War II to young people,\" he said.\n\n\"Music attracts younger people.\" Gordon said that for many youngsters, \"70 years ago can seem like 500 years ago.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/06/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/politics/nancy-pelosi-visit-taipei-taiwan-trip/index.html", "title": "Nancy Pelosi lands in Taiwan amid threats of Chinese retaliation ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nUS House Speaker Nancy Pelosi landed in Taipei on Tuesday, marking a significant show of support for Taiwan despite China’s threats of retaliation over the visit.\n\nPelosi’s stop in Taipei is the first time that a US House speaker has visited Taiwan in 25 years. Her trip comes at a low point in US-China relations and despite warnings from the Biden administration against a stop in Taiwan.\n\nPelosi and the congressional delegation that accompanied her said in a statement on Tuesday that the visit “honors America’s unwavering commitment to supporting Taiwan’s vibrant democracy.”\n\n“Our discussions with Taiwan leadership will focus on reaffirming our support for our partner and on promoting our shared interests, including advancing a free and open Indo-Pacific region,” the statement said. “America’s solidarity with the 23 million people of Taiwan is more important today than ever, as the world faces a choice between autocracy and democracy.”\n\nUS House Speaker Nancy Pelosi landed in Taiwan Tuesday night (local). TAIWAN Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n\nChina responded by announcing military exercises and with bellicose rhetoric warning that the speaker’s visit “has a severe impact on the political foundation of China-U.S. relations, and seriously infringes upon China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.”\n\n“It gravely undermines peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and sends a seriously wrong signal to the separatist forces for ‘Taiwan independence,’ ” China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. “China firmly opposes and sternly condemns this, and has made serious démarche and strong protest to the United States.”\n\nChina’s military said it was on “high alert” and would conduct exercises around Taiwan in response to Pelosi’s trip, saying in statements it was launching a series “targeted military operations to counteract the situation.”\n\nTaiwan’s Ministry of National Defense said that 21 Chinese warplanes made incursions into its air defense identification zone (ADIZ) on Tuesday. In response, the Taiwanese military issued radio warnings and deployed air defense missile systems to monitor the activities, it added.\n\nChina frequently sends warplanes into Taiwan’s self-declared ADIZ. The highest number of incursions ever recorded was on October 4 last year, when 56 military planes flew into the area on the same day. An ADIZ is unilaterally imposed and distinct from sovereign airspace, which is defined under international law as extending 12 nautical miles from a territory’s shoreline.\n\nUS ambassador summoned\n\nChina’s anger was underlined when Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Xie Feng summoned the US Ambassador to China, Nicholas Burns, late on Tuesday evening local time to protest the visit, Chinese state media outlet CCTV reported on Wednesday.\n\nXie accused Pelosi of “deliberately provoking and playing with fire against people’s will,” saying her visit is “extremely egregious” and the consequences will be “extremely serious.”\n\n“Anyone who attempts to manipulate the Taiwan issue to gain political gain … will eventually be nailed to the pillar of shame in history,” Xie said, according to the state media report.\n\nTaiwan’s foreign ministry welcomed Pelosi on Tuesday evening. “It is believed that the visit of Speaker Pelosi and other heavyweight members of Congress will strengthen the close and friendly relationship between Taiwan and the United States and further deepen cooperation between the two sides in various fields globally,” the ministry said in a statement.\n\nTaipei Mayor Ko Wen-je also embraced Pelosi’s visit but cautioned that the self-governing island should avoid being put “between a rock and hard place” in US-China relations.\n\n“Taiwan should keep its own agency. We are friends with the US and Japan, and we don’t have to be on bad terms with China,” Ko said in a statement. “Taiwan is in between the US and China. We should keep an open communication channel with China and the US to effectively avoid crises.”\n\nPelosi to meet with Taiwan’s president Wednesday\n\nThe House speaker is expected to visit Taiwan’s presidential office and parliament on Wednesday morning (local time), a senior Taiwanese official told CNN. She will first visit the parliament before heading to the presidential office for a meeting with Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen, the official said.\n\nPelosi is expected to depart Taiwan later on Wednesday, according to a news release issued by the foreign ministry. The official was not authorized to speak about Pelosi’s travel plans that have not been publicized.\n\nPelosi is traveling with House Foreign Affairs Chairman Gregory Meeks of New York, Veterans’ Affairs Chairman Mark Takano of California and Reps. Suzan DelBene of Washington state, Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois and Andy Kim of New Jersey.\n\nThe American Institute in Taiwan said Pelosi’s delegation will meet with senior Taiwanese leaders “to discuss US-Taiwan relations, peace and security, economic growth and trade, the Covid-19 pandemic, the climate crisis, human rights, democratic governance, and other significant issues of mutual interest.”\n\nPelosi wrote an op-ed that published in The Washington Post after she landed Tuesday, arguing that her trip demonstrated the US commitment to Taiwan under threat from China. “In the face of the Chinese Communist Party’s accelerating aggression, our congressional delegation’s visit should be seen as an unequivocal statement that America stands with Taiwan, our democratic partner, as it defends itself and its freedom,” the California Democrat wrote.\n\nPelosi’s stop in Taiwan was not listed on the itinerary of her congressional visit to Asia, but the stop had been discussed for weeks in the lead up to her trip. The potential stop prompted warnings from China as well as the Biden administration, which has briefed the speaker about the risks of visiting the democratic, self-governing island, which China claims as part of its territory.\n\nThe White House said Tuesday that Pelosi’s trip was consistent with US policy on Taiwan, and that the US would be watching China’s actions closely after Pelosi leaves.\n\n“Obviously, we’re going to be watching this closely. There is no reason for this visit to become a spurring event for a crisis or a conflict or for a pretext that the Chinese might try to whip up for some sort of military action,” National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby said on CNN’s “At this Hour with Kate Bolduan” on Tuesday.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen arrive for a meeting in Taipei, Taiwan, on Wednesday, August 3. Pelosi said her visit -- the first by a sitting US speaker in 25 years -- was intended to make it \"unequivocally clear\" that the United States would \"not abandon\" the democratically governed island.

There’s no change to our policy. This is absolutely consistent with it. And we’re just going to watch as things unfold.”\n\nBipartisan praise\n\nA group of more than two dozen Senate Republicans, including Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell, issued a statement supporting Pelosi’s congressional delegation, which was all Democrats, landing in Taiwan.\n\n“We support Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi’s trip to Taiwan,” the Republicans said. “For decades, members of the United States Congress, including previous Speakers of the House, have travelled to Taiwan. This travel is consistent with the United States’ One China policy to which we are committed. We are also committed now, more than ever, to all elements of the Taiwan Relations Act.”\n\nMcConnell praised Pelosi’s arrival in Taiwan, saying Tuesday that he believes “she has every right to go.”\n\n“It’s been unseemly and counterproductive for President Biden and his aides to have publicly sought to deter her from doing so,” the Kentucky Republican said. “I welcome the speaker’s display of support for Taiwan’s democracy, but I hope she returns from Asia more mindful of the military dimensions of the Chinese threat, and more committed to working with Republican to address the changing balance of military power out in the region.”\n\nUS President Joe Biden said publicly before Pelosi’s travel that the US military did not believe it was a good time for Pelosi to visit Taiwan, but he stopped short of telling her directly not to go, two sources previously told CNN.\n\nBiden did not speak to Pelosi before her trip, Kirby said Tuesday.\n\nThe issue of Taiwan remains among the most contentious in US-China relations. Biden and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, discussed it at length during a phone call last week that lasted more than two hours.\n\nAdministration officials are concerned that Pelosi’s trip comes at a particularly tense moment, as Xi is expected to seek an unprecedented third term at the upcoming Chinese Communist Party congress. Chinese party officials are expected to begin laying the groundwork for that conference in the coming weeks, putting pressure on the leadership in Beijing to show strength.\n\nWhile Biden has not endorsed Pelosi’s visit, US officials believe Chinese leadership may be conflating the House speaker’s trip with an official administration visit, and they’re concerned that China doesn’t separate Pelosi from Biden, much, if at all, since both are Democrats.\n\nPelosi has long been a China hawk in Congress. She’s previously met with pro-democracy dissidents and the Dalai Lama – the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader who remains a thorn in the side of the Chinese government. She also helped display a black-and-white banner in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square two years after the 1989 massacre, and in recent years she’s voiced support for the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Jeremy Herb Eric Cheung", "Jeremy Herb", "Eric Cheung"], "publish_date": "2022/08/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/world/cool-cities-heat-wave-climate-cmd-intl/index.html", "title": "Heat wave: These cities are better at enduring extreme temperatures ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nBlistering heat has returned to western Europe, as some countries like France enter into their third wave of the summer with temperatures expected to reach over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius), while more than 80% of the US population will experience temperatures over 90 degrees (32C) within the next week, including in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Around 100 million Americans have been under heat alerts for eight of the past 16 days.\n\nThis means hundreds of millions of people living in urban areas are again desperately trying to stay cool. The climate crisis is making extreme heat more frequent and last longer — but cities, without thoughtful design, can make life even hotter.\n\nAir conditioners might keep the indoors cool, but they only add to heat outdoors. And in most cases, they are adding to the climate crisis by increasing planet-warming emissions. Public transportation may be unbearable on a hot day, but driving a car that runs on gas instead just worsens traffic, also adding to heat and emissions. A lack of trees means a lack of shade, and buildings made of dark materials bring hotter interiors, which means more air conditioning.\n\nIt’s a vicious cycle, but there are other solutions.\n\nHere’s how eight cities are taking some of the heat out of their summers.\n\nMedellín, Colombia: Grow trees on the streets, not just in parks\n\nA green wall in Medellín, Colombia. The city has won awards for its Green Corridors project. Jorge Calle/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nWhen it gets really hot, people with air conditioning might stay indoors, but not everyone has that luxury and — well, who wants to say in all the time?\n\nFor cities that aren’t on the coast, parks that offer shade are a good option. Colombia’s second-largest city, Medellín, however, has created an entire metropolis of shade with its award-winning Green Corridors project.\n\nThe web-like network has transformed 18 roads and 12 waterways into lush green cycling lanes and walkways that connect the city’s parks and other frequently visited sites.\n\nTemperatures have come down in these areas and their surrounds by as much as 5.5 degrees Fahrenheit (around 3 degrees Celsius), and officials hope that before 2030, it could shave off up to 9 degrees Fahrenheit (5 Celsius).\n\n“Urban forests are the very best thing for city heat,” Kathy Baughman McLeod, director of the Adrienne Arsht-Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center (Arsht-Rock) at the Atlantic Council, told CNN. “Medellín has dropped the city’s average summer temperature, which is remarkable.”\n\nBy 2019, the city had planted more than 8,000 trees and over 350,000 shrubs. It also uses an area beneath a raised Metro line to collect rainwater that flows down from the bridge, capturing it in a system of pipes to help water the green belts.\n\nVienna: Splish, splash, splosh\n\nA child using a cooling down water feature on Schwarzenberg Square in Vienna, Austria. Guo Chen/Xinhua/Getty Images\n\nLike in much of Europe, many in Vienna don’t have air conditioning, so water is a big part of how the Austrian capital keeps cool.\n\nFor those who don’t have time for a dip in the Danube, the city offers cooling parks with mist-spraying “trees” that people can either “shower” in, or just sit near to enjoy the cooler temperatures they bring their surrounds.\n\nChildren, who are generally more vulnerable to extreme heat than adults, are often seen playing in the city’s splash pools or running around in pop-up water features — typically hosepipes with holes punched in them — that the city government brings out on the hottest of days, including in areas like Karlsplatz, a popular city square.\n\nVienna also has a huge number of water fountains for drinking to keep people hydrated — more than 1,100 for its population of 1.9 million — which is important in preventing heat-related illness.\n\n“Air conditioning in homes may sound like a quick and easy solution. But it’s not a long-term sustainable solution because of the source of the power and the waste heat that comes off the unit,” McLeod said. “So thinking about how to get more airflow, use water features and get windows to open in some of the oldest buildings is key. The nature-based solutions are the best for extreme heat.”\n\nAbu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates: Use old cooling techniques and modernize them\n\nAbu Dhabi's Al Bahar Towers uses a dynamic solar shading system to keep the building cool. Ben Job/Reuters\n\nParts of the Middle East are some of the hottest inhabited places on Earth. Temperatures in Abu Dhabi can climb to more than 120 degrees Fahrenheit (over 50 Celsius). Air conditioning is seen as a necessity, and people tend to spend a lot of time indoors.\n\nBut people here haven’t always had air conditioning, and an ancient Arabic architectural cooling technique has made a comeback — with a modern twist.\n\nMashrabiya refers to the latticed screens often seen in Islamic architecture, sometimes surrounding a small balcony, that diffuse sunlight and keep buildings cool without completely blocking light. They are designed to encourage a breeze and offer a spot of respite from the heat within a building. The idea is essentially to stop direct sunlight landing on a building’s exterior.\n\nThat’s what inspired the design of Al Bahar Towers, a 25-story building wrapped in more than 1,000 hexagonal shades with built-in sensors that allow them to respond to the sun’s movements. When the sun hits the shades, they unfold like an umbrella to ward off the heat. Without these measures, the outside of such a building in Abu Dhabi could reach as high as 200 degrees (around 90 Celsius).\n\nThe technique has helped reduce the building’s need for air conditioning by 50%. Cool, huh?\n\nMiami: Target heat traps\n\nThe shady bus stop project in Miami. Miami-Dade County Parks, Recreation and Open Spaces\n\nIn a lot of cities, catching the bus can mean a long wait. If it’s really hot, the wait can be all the more punishing — unless, of course, that bus stop has been thoughtfully engineered to include natural shade.\n\nMedellín in Colombia may have proved that urban forests, or simply planting more trees, can cool a city a down, but Miami’s Dade county has put a lot of thought into exactly which parts of the city need cooling the most.\n\nNeat Streets Miami, a board convened by the county council, recognized that bus stops had become real danger zones during heat waves, so they planted trees around 10 stops. They wrote a guide on which trees work best and where to plant them so that other areas could replicate the project.\n\nAnd that they have. There are now 71 green bus stops in the country, most of them by communities that applied to the government for resources to green their own bus stops.\n\nTo make it more fun, the organizers also held a haiku poetry competition, and selected the best 10 to etch into the sidewalks by the original stops.\n\nHere’s one of them:\n\nThe trees have also\n\nmissed their bus — look how they wave\n\ntheir many sad arms\n\n— Ariel Francisco\n\nAthens: Work with what you’ve got\n\nThe Hadrian Aqueduct was built around 140 AD and can still carry water today. Greek photonews/Alamy\n\nNot every city has an ancient aqueduct at their disposal, but the Greek capital of Athens does. The Hadrian aqueduct was once used as a main source of water, using a system of pipes that worked with gravity to allow water to flow from its source to the city for human consumption.\n\nThe water today isn’t drinkable, but the city is looking at ways to salvage the 800,000 cubic meters of water that flows off as waste into the sea each year. One use will be to irrigate new greenbelts to run all along the 20 kilometer structure, which should help take the heat out of the areas around it. The water will also be used for misting, like in Vienna.\n\nEven for cities without infrastructure quite this old, Athens is a good reminder that defunct water systems can sometime be revived.\n\nLos Angeles: Paint the town white\n\nWorkers painting a road in Los Angeles to tackle heat. City of Los Angeles\n\nThis one is a little more controversial.\n\nSome cities have experimented with painting rooftops white to reflect sunlight and keep buildings cool, but Los Angeles went a step further and is painting entire roads white. Dark things like asphalt absorbs sunlight and emits that energy back into the air as heat. Painting the asphalt white would theoretically nip that process in the bud, and lead to cooler air temperatures.\n\nThe idea has some merit. Researchers Ariane Middel and V. Kelly Turner found that technique did cool the streets themselves by around 10 degrees. But there was a major knock-on effect. The same researchers also said it was likely the extra heat reflecting off the roads was being absorbed by … people.\n\nThat means if you’re a few blocks away, the white streets may help you feel cooler, but if you’re on the street, you could actually feel hotter.\n\nNonetheless, LA is continuing with this program to see what works and what doesn’t. It currently uses a grayish-white substance called CoolSeal, once used to help hide grounded aircraft from satellites, but it’s possible that another type of paint could yield different results.\n\nPainting rooftops has had greater success.\n\nResults vary depending on the level of heat and materials a roof is made of, but in places like Ahmedabad in India, which gets seriously hot, cool roofs have shaved 3-8 degrees Fahrenheit of the heat in homes. According to Berkeley Lab’s Heat Island Group, a black roof could be as much at 54 degrees (around 30 Celsius) hotter than a white roof.\n\nAnother option is the green roof. Cities all around the world have created “gardens in the sky” to cool down buildings.\n\nParis: Get really organized\n\nPeople cool down at the Jardin des Tuileries on a hot afternoon in Paris. Mehdi Taamallah/NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\nThe French capital gets seriously hot.\n\nTemperatures there have surpassed 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 Celsius) this summer, but the combination of high-rise buildings, limestone monuments and busy asphalt roads means it can feel even hotter.\n\nThe city has a strong urban heat island effect, where it is often 18 degrees hotter in the city center on a summer’s day than it is in the Parisian hinterlands.\n\nBut Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo has been credited with putting in place some of the world’s most innovative measures to combat heat, and the city’s heat plan is truly comprehensive.\n\nThe main result is a city full of “cool islands.” Parisians can use an app called EXTREMA to guide them to more than 800 cool spots — parks, water fountains and air-conditioned museums, for example — and get there via a naturally cooled walkway. The idea is that a cool island is always a maximum seven minutes’ walk away for everyone.\n\nLike Vienna, Paris uses mist machines on hot days. It also has dozens of new “splash fountains,” in addition to its many traditional fountains, which are very shallow pools with fountain-like effects.\n\nParis’ heat plan involves a register that identifies the most vulnerable, so officials can check up on them by phone and offer advice on staying cool. Kindergartens get temporary air conditioners in their classrooms, and public parks and pools stay open for longer hours into the night. And like LA, Paris is trying to take the heat out of its roads and sidewalks by “demineralizing them,” using more porous materials. Now that sounds like a plan.\n\nSeville, Spain: Name your heat waves\n\nVisitors use a public fountain in Seville, Spain. Marcelo del Pozo/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThe world has been naming hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons for decades for a reason: A named storm makes you sit up and pay attention. The southern Spanish city of Seville is taking that approach with heat waves, becoming world’s first to do so.\n\nThe July heat wave there was named Zoe.\n\n“Naming heat waves is a positive thing because it means we’re recognizing how lethal they are, and that they’re here to stay. It’s not a fluke heat wave,” the Arsht-Rock’s McLeod said. “This is this is something we’re going to be living with for a long time, no matter what we do with our emissions.”\n\nBut there’s more to what Seville is doing than naming. Arsht-Rock is working with Seville on a new categorization system for heat waves based on projected negative health outcomes. The idea is to avoid scientific jargon that most people don’t understand and link alert levels to what a heat wave is likely to do to people.\n\nA 2018 Brown University study of 20 heat warning systems in the United States found that only Philadelphia’s heat warning system was effective in saving lives, partly because it uses health-based metrics.\n\n“Besides physical interventions for heat, naming and categorizing heat waves is the best, most immediate thing you can do,” McLeod said. “Because that’s the key — heat is killing people, and that’s because people are not aware of the magnitude of the problem.”", "authors": ["Angela Dewan"], "publish_date": "2022/08/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/29/asia/pelosi-taiwan-visit-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Taiwan: What to know about Nancy Pelosi's visit | CNN", "text": "Hong Kong/Beijing/Taipei CNN —\n\nUS House Speaker Nancy Pelosi landed in Taiwan Tuesday evening, marking a significant show of support for Taiwan despite China’s threats of retaliation over the visit.\n\nPelosi’s stop in Taipei is the first time that a US House speaker has visited Taiwan in 25 years. Her trip comes at a low point in US-China relations and despite warnings from the Biden administration against a stop in Taiwan.\n\nThe California Democrat is leading a congressional delegation on a tour in Asia this week, which includes stops in Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea, and Japan. Although not included in her official itinerary, expectations that she was planning a visit to Taiwan have fueled US-China tensions since reports of her trip emerged last month.\n\nIn a statement after landing, Pelosi and the congressional delegation that accompanied her said the visit “honors America’s unwavering commitment to supporting Taiwan’s vibrant democracy.”\n\nPelosi, a forthright critic of Beijing, has previously said it is important for the US to show support for Taiwan.\n\nChina has lashed out at the visit. In a statement following Pelosi’s arrival, China’s Foreign Ministry said the trip would have a “severe impact on the political foundation of China-US relations.”\n\n“China will definitely take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity in response to the US Speaker’s visit,” the statement said.\n\nA spokesman for China’s Ministry of Defense said the People’s Liberation Army was “on high alert” and would launch “a series of targeted military operations to counteract the situation, resolutely defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and resolutely thwart the interference of external forces and ‘Taiwan independence’ secessionist schemes.”\n\nPrior to the visit, US officials had been worried that China could respond militarily, potentially triggering the worst cross-strait crisis in decades. Last week, China’s Defense Ministry warned: “If the US insists on taking its own course, the Chinese military will never sit idly by.”\n\nThe tensions provided the backdrop for a lengthy phone call between US President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday, in which Xi warned the US not to “play with fire” on the Taiwan issue. Neither side immediately confirmed if Pelosi’s reported plans were discussed, though a US official later confirmed they were. Preparation for the call predated reports of the trip.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about the high-stakes visit.\n\nWhy is Beijing angry about Pelosi’s visit?\n\nChina’s ruling Communist Party claims the self-ruled democracy of Taiwan as its own territory – despite never having governed it – and has not ruled out the use of force to “reunify” the island with the Chinese mainland.\n\nFor decades, Beijing has sought to isolate Taipei on the world stage, from chipping away at its diplomatic allies to blocking it from joining international organizations.\n\nAny move that appears to lend Taiwan a sense of international legitimacy is strongly opposed by China. And in the eyes of Beijing, high-profile overseas visits by Taiwanese officials, or visits by foreign officials to Taiwan, will do just that.\n\nIn 1995, a visit by Taiwan’s then-President Lee Teng-hui to the United States triggered a major crisis in the Taiwan Strait. Enraged by the trip, China fired missiles into waters around Taiwan, and the crisis ended only after the US sent two aircraft carrier battle groups to the area in a forceful show of support for Taipei.\n\nIn recent years, Taiwan has received a flurry of visits by US delegations, consisting of sitting and retired officials and lawmakers. That has drawn angry responses from China, including sending warplanes into Taiwan’s self-declared air defense identification zone.\n\nBut Pelosi’s political stature makes her visit all the more provocative to Beijing.\n\n“Pelosi is the third public official in the line of succession after the President and Vice President, I think the Chinese take that very seriously,” said Susan L. Shirk, chair of the 21st Century China Center at UC San Diego.\n\n“So she is a very important figure in American politics. It’s different from your ordinary member of Congress.”\n\nPelosi is a longstanding critic of the Chinese Communist Party. She has denounced Beijing’s human rights record, and met with pro-democracy dissidents and the Dalai Lama – the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader who remains a thorn in the side of the Chinese government.\n\nIn 1991, Pelosi unfurled a banner in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square to commemorate victims of the 1989 massacre of pro-democracy protesters. More recently, she has voiced support for the 2019 pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.\n\nWhy is the trip fueling US-China tensions?\n\nBeijing sees Pelosi’s trip as a “serious violation” of historical US-China agreements governing their relations.\n\nThe US formally switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979 – but has long trod a delicate middle path. Washington recognizes the People’s Republic of China as the sole legitimate government of China, but maintains close unofficial ties with Taiwan.\n\nThe US also supplies Taiwan with defensive weaponry under the terms of the decades-old Taiwan Relations Act, but it remains deliberately vague on whether it would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion – a policy known as “strategic ambiguity.”\n\nChina’s authoritarian turn under Xi’s leadership and plummeting relations with Washington have pulled Taiwan closer into the orbit of the US. This has infuriated Beijing, which has accused Washington of “playing the Taiwan card” to contain China’s rise.\n\nThe US, meanwhile, has stepped up its engagement with Taiwan, approving arms sales and sending delegations to the island.\n\nSince the Taiwan Travel Act was signed into law by then-US President Donald Trump in March 2018, US officials and lawmakers have embarked on more than 20 trips to the island, according to a CNN tally. The 2018 law encourages visits between officials of the US and Taiwan at all levels.\n\nTaiwan figured prominently in Xi and Biden’s two-hour-and-17-minute phone call, with the Chinese leader urging Washington to honor existing agreements with Beijing both “in word and in deed,” according to a readout from China’s Foreign Ministry. The statement added that China would “resolutely safeguard” its national sovereignty.\n\nFor his part, Biden reiterated that US policy “had not changed,” according to a White House readout of the call.\n\n“The United States strongly opposes unilateral efforts to change the status quo or undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,” Biden said, according to the statement.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Why one former diplomat is worried about Pelosi's visit to Taiwan 02:58 - Source: CNN\n\nHas a US House speaker ever visited Taiwan?\n\nPelosi’s trip isn’t the first time a sitting US House speaker has visited Taiwan.\n\nIn 1997, Newt Gingrich visited Taipei only days after his trip to Beijing and Shanghai. China’s Foreign Ministry criticized Gingrich after his Taiwan visit, but the response was limited to rhetoric.\n\nFormer US House Speaker Newt Gingrich meets with Taiwanese Vice President and Premier Lien Chan during a brief visit to Taiwan in April, 1997. Central News Agency/AP\n\nBut twenty-five years on, China is stronger, more powerful and confident, and its leader Xi has made it clear that Beijing will no longer tolerate any perceived slights or challenge to its interests.\n\n“China is in a position to be more assertive, to impose costs and consequences to countries that don’t take China’s interest into consideration in their policymaking or actions,” said Drew Thompson, a visiting senior research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore.\n\nBut the decision not to include Taiwan on the official itinerary released by the delegation “preserves the unofficial nature of the visit,” and should be a “good outcome for Beijing and US-China relations,” Thompson added on Twitter following the release of Pelosi’s statement Sunday listing her itinerary.\n\nWhat about the timing?\n\nPelosi’s visit comes at a sensitive time for China.\n\nThe House speaker had previously planned to lead a US congressional delegation to Taiwan in April, but postponed the trip after she tested positive for Covid-19.\n\nThe Chinese military celebrated its founding anniversary on August 1, while Xi, the country’s most powerful leader in decades, is preparing to break conventions and seek a third term at the Communist Party’s 20th congress this fall.\n\nIn August, Chinese leaders are also expected to gather in the seaside resort of Beidaihe for their annual summer conclave, where they discuss personnel moves and policy ideas behind closed doors.\n\n“It’s a very tense time in Chinese domestic politics,” Shirk said. “(Xi) himself and many other members of the elite in China would view the Pelosi visit as a humiliation of Xi Jinping (and) his leadership. And that means that he will feel compelled to react in a way to demonstrate his strength.”\n\nWhile the politically sensitive timing could trigger a stronger response from Beijing, some experts believe it could also mean the Communist Party would want to ensure stability and prevent things from getting out of control.\n\n“Honestly, this isn’t a good time for Xi Jinping to provoke a military conflict right before the 20th party congress. It’s in Xi Jinping’s interest to manage this rationally and not instigate a crisis on top of all the other crises he has to deal with,” Thompson said, citing China’s slowing economy, deepening real estate crisis, rising unemployment, and constant struggle to curb sporadic outbreaks under its zero-Covid policy.\n\nHow has China reacted?\n\nChina’s military will start exercises around Taiwan in response to US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to the self-governed island and launch a series of “targeted military operations to counteract the situation,” according to statements released by its Eastern Theater Command and Ministry of Defense Tuesday.\n\n“Starting from the evening of August 2, the Eastern Theater Command will carry out a series of joint military operations around Taiwan Island, and conduct joint air and sea exercises in the sea and air spaces of the northern, southwestern and south-eastern Taiwan Island, conduct long-range live ammunition firing in the Taiwan Strait, and organize regular-guided-fire testing in the eastern waters of Taiwan Island,” Col. Shi Yi, spokesman for the Eastern Theater Command, said.\n\n“This action is a solemn deterrent against the recent major escalation of the negative actions of the United States on the Taiwan issue, and a serious warning to ‘Taiwan independence’ forces,” the statement added.\n\nThe Eastern Theater is one of the five joint commands of the People’s Liberation Army with jurisdiction over China’s eastern coastal provinces of Fujian and Zhejiang, which sit opposite and above Taiwan.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback China sends warplanes into Taiwan's air defense zone amid Pelosi's visit 02:33 - Source: CNN\n\nPrior to her arrival, national security officials quietly worked to convince Pelosi of the risks her trip to Taiwan could pose, while the Pentagon developed a security plan to use ships and aircraft to keep her safe.\n\nThe constant worry among US officials is that miscalculations or inadvertent incidents or accidents could occur if China and the US significantly increase their air and maritime operations in the region.\n\nBut US does not expect direct hostile action from Beijing during a visit by Pelosi. At least five defense officials, speaking prior to her arrival, described this as a very remote possibility and said the Pentagon wants to see the public rhetoric lowered.\n\nWhat has Taiwan said about Pelosi’s trip?\n\nPelosi was welcomed at the airport by Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu, and the iconic Taipei 101 skyscraper was lit up with a welcome message for the speaker praising “US-Taiwan friendship forever.”\n\nTaiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen will receive Pelosi and her delegation at the Presidential Palace on the morning of August 3, according to a statement from the president’s office.\n\nPresidential Spokesperson Xavier Chang said that Speaker Pelosi had not only supported Taiwan for a long time, but also paid attention to Taiwan’s democratic development and regional peace and security.\n\nBut prior to her arrival, Taiwan had been tight-lipped about the situation. When Pelosi’s visit was first reported by the Financial Times last week, Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it had “received no information” about the visit.\n\nDuring a regular news briefing on Thursday, a ministry spokeswoman reiterated it had not received any definite information on whether Pelosi would be visiting the island and had “no further comment” on the matter.\n\n“Inviting members of the US Congress to visit Taiwan has long been a focus of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Taiwan and our Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States,” spokeswoman Joanne Ou said.\n\nThough international media is closely watching events, the escalating tension barely made headline news in Taiwan this week. Taiwan’s media has mostly focused on upcoming local elections and Taiwanese military drills.\n\nPreviously, Taiwanese officials have publicly welcomed visits by US delegations, seeing them as a sign of support from Washington.", "authors": ["Nectar Gan Selina Wang Eric Cheung Simone Mccarthy", "Nectar Gan", "Selina Wang", "Eric Cheung", "Simone Mccarthy"], "publish_date": "2022/07/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/05/28/underwater-art-tomato-fight-lawn-mower-racing-news-around-states/39520639/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From staff and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state House of Representatives has passed legislation allowing residents to purchase wine and have it shipped directly to their house. The bill by Republican Rep. Terri Collins would allow licensed wine manufacturers to obtain a permit to deliver limited quantities of wine directly to Alabamians. The Alcoholic Beverage Control Board doesn’t allow such shipments now. The bill passed 77-11 and now heads to the Senate. Democratic Rep. Thomas Jackson jokingly shouted during Thursday’s debate, “What’s wrong with the wine we got now?” – a reference to former Rep. Alvin Holmes, who famously asked in a 2008 debate about allowing stronger beer: “What’s wrong with the beer we got? I mean the beer we got drank pretty good, don’t it?”\n\nAlaska\n\nAkiak: The community has quickly lost entire buildings due to erosion along the banks of its river, officials say. Residents of this southwest Alaska town awoke last week to find that smokehouses built along the Kuskokwim River had fallen into the water along with stretches of the riverbank, KYUK-AM reports. The community 42 miles northeast of Bethel lost between 75 and 100 feet of the riverbank, according to Akiak City Administrator David Gilila. “That’s just in one day; that’s just in a matter of hours,” Gilila says. Akiak has experienced erosion problems before but now faces damage to about a mile of riverbank. “There’s no comparison to it,” Gilila says. “Before, it was just certain spots. Today, it’s the whole bank from the upper end of Akiak to the lower end of it.” Houses now face possible destruction.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The Republican-led Legislature has proved receptive in recent years to certain proposals offered up by teenagers, passing laws to designate lemonade as the state drink and copper as the state metal. But some students who went to the Capitol this year say they got a different type of reception – if they got one at all – when they tried to pitch proposals on meatier public-policy topics. The Arizona Capitol Times reports that those topics include gun control, school safety and climate change. While GOP legislators said refusing to sponsor progressive bills doesn’t amount to disrespect, some teenage policy advocates said some lawmakers were condescending at times but gushed about the civic involvement of young people who pushed innocuous bills sponsored by Republicans.\n\nArkansas\n\nHope: The publisher of the largest newspaper in the state has said by the end of the year, the publication will no longer print or deliver daily editions and will instead distribute iPads for subscribers to access a daily digital replica. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette will still print a Sunday edition but will urge subscribers to convert to the daily digital replica, accessible via the newspaper’s app. The newspaper’s publisher, Walter Hussman, has said that if 70% of subscribers convert to the digital version, the paper will be profitable for the first time since 2017. Some subscribers who converted say they prefer the digital paper, which can be enlarged and which is easily transportable. But it remains to be seen if the program will also appeal to younger generations.\n\nCalifornia\n\nAnaheim: Massive crowds are expected at Disneyland when its Star Wars Galaxy’s Edge land opens this week, but park officials have a plan to manage them – and it involves Stormtroopers. Park employees dressed as the white-armored foot soldiers may be used to encourage guests to “move along” to other parts of the theme park if they’ve overstayed a four-hour limit inside Galaxy’s Edge. The time limit will be in place from the area’s opening Friday until June 23. Reservations and a special wristband are required to visit the area at the Anaheim theme park for the first three weeks. Galaxy’s Edge is the largest single-theme land created inside a Disney park. The 14-acre land’s marquee attraction is a ride inside a replica of the Millennium Falcon.\n\nColorado\n\nBoulder: The state has a new law on the books that legislators say expands protections for mobile home residents and leads to better enforcement of those regulations. The Daily Camera reports Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed the bill into law Thursday that sets up a resolution process for disputes between mobile home residents and park owners. The law allows the state Division of Housing to accept complaints and begin the mediation process. The law also gives residents 30 days to leave properties when evicted, instead of the previous 48 hours. Democratic state Rep. Edie Hooton says the state will likely see a spike in complaints during the law’s first year, but lawmakers expect the volume to subside as “park owners start to see that the rules are being enforced.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nTorrington: Police are still searching for a fugitive who failed to honor an agreement and surrender once enough people responded to his wanted poster on social media. Jose Simms is being sought as a fugitive after failing to appear in court on charges that range from breach of peace to risk of injury to a child. He is believed to be in New York state. Torrington police Lt. Brett Johnson posted on the department’s Facebook page last week that Simms had contacted him through the site and agreed to turn himself in if the post containing his poster received 15,000 likes. The page has far surpassed that number, but still no sign of Simms. Maki Haberfeld, an expert in police ethics and procedure at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, says Simms is using social media to manipulate the news media and police, who she said have no business negotiating a deal with a suspect, never mind one that involves likes on Facebook.\n\nDelaware\n\nGeorgetown: A church has been badly damaged by a fire, though no injuries have been reported. The blaze engulfed Saint Mary’s Holy Church near Georgetown on Sunday. State investigators are trying to determine the cause of the destructive blaze. Delaware’s office of the state fire marshal says the “heavy damage” at the church was estimated at $50,000. The Georgetown Fire Company responded to the early Sunday blaze. It was first reported shortly after midnight.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Archbishop Wilton D. Gregory welcomed parishioners to his first Sunday Mass at the Cathedral of Saint Matthew the Apostle over the weekend, WUSA-TV reports. D.C.’s newest archbishop officially took possession of the cathedral during the Mass, welcomed by Monsignor Ronald James in a celebration of the beginning of the new ministry. Gregory expressed his joy, saying, “We are beginning something new – a new friendship and relationship that we pray will be fruitful and filled with joy.” He then asked the parishioners for their faith and prayers. Following the Mass, Gregory introduced himself, shaking hands and talking with the Catholic parishioners he will serve in his new position. He was formally installed last Tuesday as the first African American leader of the district’s Catholic community.\n\nFlorida\n\nKey West: Divers off the state’s far southern coast can now visit an underwater art museum. Divers finished placing a series of artworks on a sunken ship Saturday about 7 miles south of Key West in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. The project consists of 24 large photo illustrations created by Austrian artist Andreas Franke. They were placed on the Gen. Hoyt S. Vandenberg, a former U.S. Air Force missile tracking ship that was intentionally sunk 10 years ago to create an artificial reef. Franke calls it the “Plastic Ocean Project” and says he wants it to draw attention to the need to eliminate plastics in the world’s oceans. On Monday, divers unfurled a giant American flag on the 523-foot long ship to commemorate Memorial Day and the 10th anniversary of the ship’s sinking.\n\nGeorgia\n\nValdosta: A civil rights activist is clashing with the mayor over a proposal to rename a street for former President Barack Obama. The Valdosta Daily Times reports police escorted the Rev. Floyd Rose, 80, from a city council meeting Thursday after Mayor John Gayle said he kept talking beyond his public comment time. Rose wants Forrest Street renamed to honor the nation’s first black president. He says it was named in 1883 for Confederate Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest, a Ku Klux Klan leader. Gayle said petitioners need to follow a new ordinance, but Rose said it was designed to thwart the name change. It says only one signature can come from each parcel along a road, so multiple signatures from a single apartment complex don’t count.\n\nHawaii\n\nKeauhou: Federal officials are in the final review stages for rules that would ban swimming with Hawaiian spinner dolphins. West Hawaii Today reported last week that National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration officials are nearing completion of regulations proposed almost three years ago that would create a 50-yard barrier around the mammals. Officials say the rules would outlaw coming within the protected area around Hawaiian spinner dolphins – or “naia” in the Hawaiian language – by any means including swimming or using a boat to intercept the animal’s path. The prohibition would cover all persons, vessels and objects and extend 2 nautical miles from island coastlines, including waters bounded by Maui, Lanai and Kahoolawe. The regulations would include exceptions such as dolphins approaching swimmers and boats and safe navigation.\n\nIdaho\n\nMeridian: Federal data shows the state’s largest cities have grown larger, with a second city now seeing its population topping 100,000 residents. The Post Register reports new numbers from the U.S. Census Bureau show the most dramatic growth was in this city neighboring the capital, Boise. Meridian’s population has jumped nearly 39% since 2010, with a population estimated at nearly 107,000. The data indicates Meridian grew the seventh fastest of the major cities across the country. Meridian is now second to Boise, which recorded a population of nearly 229,000 residents last year. Behind Meridian is Nampa with 96,000 people and Idaho Falls with 61,000.\n\nIllinois\n\nJoliet: The head of the Army Corps of Engineers has sent Congress a $778 million plan to fortify a waterway in the state with noisemakers, electric cables and other devices in the hope that they will prevent Asian carp from reaching the Great Lakes, where the aggressive invaders could leave other fish with too little to eat. Lt. Gen. Todd Semonite on Thursday approved the plan to install defenses at the Brandon Road Lock and Dam near Joliet, about 40 miles from Lake Michigan. The site is a crucial choke point in an aquatic pathway between the lake and the carp-infested Illinois River. Although only a few live Asian carp have been found past the barrier, the fish’s DNA has turned up there as recently as April, when water samples were taken from Chicago’s Lake Calumet.\n\nIndiana\n\nClarksville: A former Colgate-Palmolive factory could become the home of a hotel, housing and commercial space. The factory in this Ohio River town in southern Indiana made toothpaste and other personal hygiene products for decades until it closed in 2007. A plan recently approved by Clarksville officials and the Clark’s Landing development group calls for redeveloping the building, which is known for its large, iconic clock. Clarksville redevelopment director Dylan Fisher tells the News and Tribune the project is expected to include a hotel, multifamily housing, commercial space and a civic center. That proposal is part of a redevelopment planned for Clarksville’s south side. It will have elevated bike trails, a revamped riverfront area, and a mix of businesses, residential spaces and community spaces.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Gov. Kim Reynolds has vetoed a bill that would have lifted a cap on the potency of medical marijuana products available in the state. Reynolds vetoed the bill Friday afternoon, saying the state must proceed cautiously in any expansion of its medical marijuana program. Reynolds says she could support in the future a more limited effort to increase the potency of products. Democratic lawmakers who have supported expansion of the program criticized Reynolds’ decision, saying it would hurt sick people who get little benefit from products now available that have low levels of THC, the compound that causes a high. Rep. John Forbes, an Urbandale pharmacist, called the veto “distressing news for thousands of sick and vulnerable Iowans who deserve greater access to this life-changing medication.” The bill had been approved overwhelmingly in both legislative chambers.\n\nKansas\n\nHutchinson: Restored mission control consoles used by NASA to guide trips to the moon will soon be shipped from the state to the control room where they were used from the 1960s through the 1990s. The Hutchinson News reports that Cosmosphere’s SpaceWorks experts have restored 19 consoles in Hutchinson over the past year and a half. NASA picked up 10 of the consoles last year, and the remainder will be sent to the Johnson Space Center in Houston on Friday. The consoles, which will be unveiled in June ahead of the 50-year anniversary celebration of Neil Armstrong’s first steps on the moon, were used for the Apollo 11 mission to the moon. They also helped communicate with astronauts to fix an oxygen tank that exploded on Apollo 13.\n\nKentucky\n\nWilliamstown: In the Bible, the ark survived an epic flood. Yet the owners of the Noah’s ark attraction in the state are demanding their insurance company bail them out after heavy rains caused nearly $1million in property damage. The Ark Encounter says in a federal lawsuit that rains in 2017 and 2018 caused a landslide on its access road. The attraction’s insurance carriers refused to cover the damage. The 510-foot-long wooden ark has been a popular northern Kentucky attraction since its 2016 opening. The lawsuit says the road has been rebuilt. The ark was not damaged. The suit names Allied World Assurance Co. Holdings of Switzerland, its use company and three other insurance carriers. Ark Encounter seeks compensatory and punitive damages. The Swiss company hasn’t responded in court filings.\n\nLouisiana\n\nMetairie: A young bald eagle found soaked and stumping along a street in the neighborhood where it hatched will be released Tuesday in the same area. A resident brought the mottled brown eaglet to the Louisiana State University School of Veterinary Medicine’s Wildlife Hospital on May 11, after making sure it needed help. Another neighbor has been collecting money for its care and posting health updates outside her home. Coastal consultant and photographer P.J. Hahn says it was on the ground, barely able to fly, and appeared to have a wing injury. Veterinary school spokeswoman Ginger Guttner says the eagle needed supportive care and has been in the school’s flight cage since May 20 so veterinarians could be sure it flies well enough to be released.\n\nMaine\n\nKennebunkport: Local Memorial Day celebrations have noted the absence of a particularly prominent veteran who died last year. The American Legion had two empty chairs in Kennebunkport’s Dock Square on Monday in memory of all of the times former President George H.W. Bush and his wife, Barbara, watched the Memorial Day parade from that spot. Mark Matthews from American Legion Post 159 said organizers wanted to acknowledge the absence of Bush, a longtime summer resident and a Navy veteran. He missed last year’s parade after falling ill after attending an American Legion pancake breakfast earlier in the weekend. He died at age 94 on Nov. 30, months after his wife’s death. Town Manager Laurie Smith said the Bushes’ absence is felt every day. She said it will be a “strange” summer without their presence.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: To Marylanders, Old Bay is more than a seasoning – it’s a symbol of state pride. The yellow and blue tin with a red lid is tattooed on calves or placed in windowsills along with a crab and decorative mallets. A T-shirt proclaims: “I put Old Bay on my Old Bay.” Eighty-three percent of the state’s residents reported a favorable opinion of Old Bay, according to The Goucher Poll, a political survey of 808 adults. Yet the seasoning’s popularity belies a little-known truth: Cooks in restaurants and crab shacks rarely use Old Bay to steam crabs. The Baltimore Sun called dozens of crab houses in the region, and the majority – 18 out of 30 – said they steam crabs with either J.O. No. 2 seasoning or a custom blend made by the Halethorpe-based spice company.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Authorities say a group of Jewish teens played a key role in saving the life of a drowning man with a tattoo of a swastika. NBC Boston reports it happened Thursday night as the four youths – all students at an Orthodox Jewish high school in suburban Brookline – spotted the body of a man partially submerged in Chestnut Hill Reservoir. Boston College police officer Carl Mascioli says two of the teens ran to his patrol car to alert him. Mascioli says he rushed down the embankment, pulled the man from the water and noticed the Nazi symbol tattooed on his hand. He says the unidentified students told him they don’t regret helping the man despite his anti-Semitic tattoo. Officials say the man is expected to make a full recovery.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Pvt. James Robinson played an important role in the final battle of the Revolutionary War, but like many African Americans who took up arms against the British, he received little lasting recognition. That’s about to change. Members of two patriotic lineage societies linked to historic wars are planning to unveil a special grave marker and give Robinson, who died in 1868, military funeral honors during a ceremony next month at Elmwood Cemetery in Detroit. “Over 5,000 African Americans served in the Revolutionary War, and Robinson is one of the most consequential figures of the period,” said Elijah Shalis, secretary of the Michigan Society Sons of the American Revolution. “He deserved this honor 151 years ago.” Robinson led a remarkable life. He was a slave and a minister who fought in two wars and died at age 115 as the last known living African American veteran of the Revolutionary War.\n\nMinnesota\n\nCook: A woman in northern Minnesota has donated a kidney to a volunteer firefighter who was the first responder when she and her child needed help. KARE-TV reports that their paths first crossed in 2016 when Becca Bundy’s 1-year-old daughter was having a seizure. She dialed 911, and Bearville volunteer firefighter Bill Cox was the first on the scene. Last fall, Bundy came across Cox tending bar and wearing a T-shirt that said he was in end-stage kidney failure and needed a donor. Bundy was a match, and the transplant took place in February. The 66-year-old Cox, who is now free from dialysis, says Bundy is his angel. She says she feels blessed to be on his journey with him.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A federal judge on Friday temporarily blocked a state law that would ban most abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected, at about six weeks of pregnancy. “Here we go again,” U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves wrote in his order. “Mississippi has passed another law banning abortions prior to viability.” His new order stops the law from taking effect July 1. Reeves is the same judge who struck down a 2018 Mississippi law to ban abortion at 15 weeks. The Magnolia State is one of several states that have pushed this year to enact bans on early abortions. Opponents of abortion are emboldened by new conservative Supreme Court justices and are looking for ways to challenge the court’s 1973 ruling that legalized abortion nationwide.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: The state has become the 20th to join a nationwide sex offender registry. OffenderWatch said in a news release last week that every Missouri law enforcement agency that manages or investigates registered sex offenders will be able to collaborate on offender records, aid each other in investigations and share notifications with the public. It won a five-year contract from the Missouri Highway Patrol. Missouri has about 16,000 registered sex offenders. The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children says there are more than 900,000 registered sex offenders in the United States. OffenderWatch says its service allows different law enforcement agencies to collaborate on a single offender record, improving accuracy and aiding in public safety. Its technology is used by more than 3,000 law enforcement agencies in 37 states.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state will install a permanent monument on the Capitol grounds recognizing Native American contributions to the state and nation. Gov. Steve Bullock on Thursday held a ceremonial signing of legislation to erect a monument and display the flags of the state’s eight recognized Native American tribes. The bill’s sponsor, Democratic Rep. Marvin Weatherwax of Browning, called it a big honor and “well overdue.” Bullock says the monument will be a symbol of respect and understanding, as well as a recognition that the Capitol belongs to everybody. The measure was part of a package of bills Bullock signed dealing with Native American issues, including legislation meant to improve the response to reports of missing American Indian women.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: It’s not very often you get to touch a dinosaur. But that’s just one of the many cool things about the newly renovated Schramm Education Center at Schramm Park State Recreation Area near Gretna, the Omaha World-Herald reports. The pallid sturgeon touch tank lets kids feel the unique fish, which outdoor education specialist Amber Schiltz says is like a living dinosaur. That fish family has been around for 70 million years. School kids who recently visited loved to touch the bony plates of sturgeon when a curious one swam up to their hands. “They were squealing and getting excited,” Schiltz told the paper. “It was really fun.” The center will soon hold its grand opening after an almost two-year renovation that cost several million dollars, much of it funded by donors. The building, previously called Aksarben Aquarium, was gutted and expanded by about a third.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Lake Tahoe’s clarity rebounded last year from its worst level in a half-century of record-keeping as weather and streamflow returned to more normal conditions. Scientists at the UC Davis Tahoe Environmental Research Center say the dinner plate-sized disc used to measure clarity was visible at an average depth of 70.9 feet in 2018. That’s 10.5 feet better than the year before. The new clarity measurement is in line with the five-year average of 70.3 feet, which is an increase of nearly a foot from the previous five-year running average at the alpine lake that straddles the California-Nevada line. Scientists hope efforts to combat threats to lake clarity posed by development and climate change will eventually return the lake to its historic clarity level in excess of 100 feet.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nIsles of Shoals: The state has had an artist in residence at the White Mountain National Forest for years. Now it will have one at an island off its coast. The nonprofit Star Island Corporation is launching a weeklong Artist-in-Residence program. Star Island is one of a group of small islands among the Isles of Shoals, an hour’s boat ride from the New Hampshire and Maine coasts. A formal application process is being worked on for the program for next summer. For centuries, the Shoals have attracted artists drawn to the rugged beauty of the islands. The residency will require artists to share their time and talent with conference guests, day visitors and staff of Star Island. Exhibit space for artwork will be provided in the lobby of the 19th-century Oceanic Hotel.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWest Deptford: The largest U.S. seller of San Marzano tomatoes, known to food lovers as the best tomatoes to make pasta sauce, has been hit with two federal lawsuits claiming what’s inside the can isn’t the real thing. New Jersey-based Cento Fine Foods called the claims “wrongful” last week and assured the company’s tomatoes are true San Marzanos, meaning they were grown at the base of Mount Vesuvius in Campania in Italy. One suit filed in February alleges fraud, saying there’s no way Cento can produce that many San Marzano tomatoes. Another suit says the cans lack certain labeling that qualifies them as true San Marzanos. The company says that isn’t a requirement. San Marzano tomatoes are a favorite among foodies for their sweet flavor, stronger taste and low acidity.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: John Pinto, a Navajo Code Talker in World War II who became one of the nation’s longest-serving Native American elected officials, has died at age 94. State Senate colleague Michael Padilla confirmed Pinto’s death in Gallup on Friday after years of suffering from various illnesses that rarely kept him from his duties. After serving as a Marine, Pinto was selected to the New Mexico Senate in 1976 and represented a district that included the Navajo Nation for more than four decades. The region is one of the poorest in the country. Born on the Navajo Nation to a family of sheep herders, Pinto didn’t start formal schooling until he was nearly a teenager. “At the age of 12, I was in kindergarten,” Pinto told the Albuquerque Journal in a 2007 interview. “I guess I did all right.”\n\nNew York\n\nCobleskill: The State University of New York at Cobleskill is launching a new four-year program in “canine training and management” amid a surge in demand for specially trained dogs to detect threats and assist veterans in the wake of 9/11. While several institutions hand out training certificates, and at least one small private college awards a bachelor’s in dog handling, the program at Cobleskill is more ambitious in its scope. Professor Stephen Mackenzie says he developed Cobleskill’s Bachelor of Technology degree partly in response to a heightened demand for dogs capable of sniffing out explosives in the aftermath of Sept. 11. The need for service dogs trained to assist those with post-traumatic stress disorder or reduced mobility has also expanded as veterans started returning from Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: As the 75th anniversary of D-Day approaches, historians and educators worry that the World War II milestone is losing its resonance with today’s students. In North Carolina as in many other states, D-Day isn’t part of the required curriculum, though some teachers do use the anniversary to spend extra time on the June 6, 1944, battle. It’s not a stand-alone topic in France, which was liberated from German occupation. German schools concentrate on the Holocaust and Nazi dictatorship. Schools in Russia avoid D-Day because they believe the victories on the Eastern Front won the war. In Cary, North Carolina, Kasey Turcol taught her students at Crossroads FLEX High School about D-Day, including lesser-known aspects like tales of a Spanish spy.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: A group raising awareness about post-traumatic stress disorder and suicide among combat veterans has finished a 400-mile walk. Brady’s Border2Border Ruck March began on the state’s western border Tuesday and concluded Saturday in Fargo. The event honors Brady Oberg, who served in Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom. After coming home, Oberg suffered from PTSD and killed himself in 2015. KFGO- AM reports that a group of 16 family and friends participated in the march. They each carried a bag with 20 pounds to represent the 20 veterans with PTSD who take their lives every day. The first march took place a year ago. Oberg’s family started the Brady Oberg Legacy Foundation to raise awareness of PTSD.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: The city is working to preserve the heritage of century-old trees planted to commemorate area soldiers who died in World War I. The planting of the 9-mile stretch of red oaks that runs through Cleveland and into suburban Cleveland Heights and Shaker Heights marked its 100th anniversary on Memorial Day. Local officials are taking an inventory of remaining Liberty Row trees, many of which have died over the years, with some plaques lost or damaged. The greater Cleveland area was one of the first communities nationally to envision a multi-mile stretch of trees as a memorial to fallen soldiers. Between 1919 and 1924, more than 800 oak trees were planted, each with a bronze plaque at its base engraved with the name of a fallen soldier.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt has signed the state’s largest-ever appropriations bill, an $8.1 billion spending plan that funds pay raises for teachers and state workers and pumps tens of millions more dollars into public schools. Flanked by Republican legislative leaders, the first-year governor signed the bill Friday, a day after the Legislature adjourned the 2019 session. The deal also socks away an additional $200 million into a state savings account. When combined with additional revenue in the state’s Rainy Day Fund, the savings will give the state more than $1 billion in reserve funds. Democrats criticized the plan as not doing enough for working-class Oklahomans and argued the additional $200 million was needed to shore up previous cuts to core services.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A judge on Friday ordered a man to learn about the Sikh religion and submit a report to the court as part of his sentence for an attack on a Sikh shopkeeper in Salem, a civil rights group said. Andrew Ramsey pleaded guilty to misdemeanor counts of intimidation and assault in the Jan. 14 incident targeting Harwinder Singh Dodd, according to a release from the Sikh Coalition, the largest Sikh civil rights organization in the U.S. The intimidation count is considered a hate crime, the group said. Witnesses said Ramsey pulled on Dodd’s beard after he refused to sell him cigarettes without an ID, punched him and pulled him to the ground. Bystanders restrained Ramsey until police arrived. Dodd, who came to the U.S. from India and owns the convenience store, noted in a written statement to the court that hate crimes are on the rise in America. The FBI says hate crimes increased by 40% in Oregon from 2016 to 2017.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Weather officials say the state has already recorded the average number of tornadoes for a year even before the summer period in which severe weather is most common. Meteorologist Sarah Johnson of the National Weather Service says 16 tornadoes – the yearly average – have had preliminary confirmation in the commonwealth so far this year. Severe weather is more common in June and into July, but that’s not a hard and fast rule. For example, Johnson says, a large outbreak of severe weather occurred Oct. 2 across Pennsylvania. In recent weeks, Johnson says, the high plains and Mid-Atlantic have been getting the brunt of low-pressure systems bringing precipitation. On Thursday, six tornado warnings were issued across the commonwealth in a span of just two hours.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNewport: The mansion once owned by Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Edith Wharton is on the market for nearly $12 million. The Providence Journal reports that Land’s End in Newport, where Wharton and her husband lived in the late 19th century, is for sale at $11.7 million. It was more recently owned by socialite Marion Oates Charles, who died there in December. The 24-room mansion on a 5.6-acre estate was built in 1880. It’s located on a street that runs between two of the city’s most famous thoroughfares, Bellevue Avenue and the Cliff Walk. Kendra Toppa, the listing agent, said the property “truly epitomizes Newport real estate at its finest.” Wharton won the Pulitzer for 1920’s “The Age of Innocence” and also wrote “Ethan Frome” and “The House of Mirth.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: The city kicked off 17 days of operas, plays, chamber music and jazz Friday as the world-renowned Spoleto Festival USA returns. The 43rd season of the arts festival began with the opening ceremony from Charleston City Hall. It will run through June 9. The spotlighted performance is the opera “Salome.” Spoleto plans a contemporary retelling of the 1905 Richard Strauss opera, based on an Oscar Wilde play of the same name about the Biblical story of the woman who asked for the head of John the Baptist. The Spoleto Festival USA choir will join the festival’s orchestra and the Charleston Symphony for a performance of Johann Sebastian Bach’s St. John Passion on June 4. The festival will take place in 11 indoor and outdoor venues.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nHoughton: An 88-year-old man has made his mark on this farming community as a prolific gopher killer. Clayton Sanderson of Houghton estimates he has caught 22,000 of the varmints since he started hunting them down in 1997. Sanderson told the Aberdeen News he doesn’t poison the animals because poison is expensive, and he can’t reach their bodies if they go deep into their gopher holes to die, making it harder for him to turn them into profit. So he widens the top of the hole and sets a trap with two pressure-triggered arms. He says he’s been bitten only once in 22 years. Farmers hate gophers, he said, “with a passion,” because of the damage wrought on their farm equipment when they hit the mounds at the entrance of the gopher holes. Sanderson said he earns $3 for every set of gopher front paws he hands over to Shelby or Lansing township officials.\n\nTennessee\n\nJasper: A University of Tennessee doctoral student is resurrecting research that was abandoned nearly 80 years ago that could be crucial for Tennessee Valley Authority’s understanding of long-term weather patterns that factor into the agency’s decisions regarding water. Scientist Florence Hawley began research in the 1930s studying tree rings to understand long-term weather patterns in the Norris Basin, The Times Free Press reports. She worked at TVA in its earliest days but faced sexism on the job and was never allowed to publish her results, according to TVA officials. She abandoned TVA in the 1940s and went to work in the Southwest. Her research was recently found in the TVA archives. The utility provider approached the University of Tennessee about finishing the work, and doctoral student Laura Smith has taken on the task.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: The police chief has announced a youth jobs program meant to give children something to do during high-crime summer months and better connect officers to underserved areas. The Dallas Morning News reports Chief U. Renee Hall says the DPD to You(th) initiative will focus on students from schools with higher rates of crime and arrests. The project involves recruiting 50 students, from schools primarily in South Dallas, and inserting them in occupations with city government agencies, nonprofits and the Dallas Police Department. Volunteers will mentor the students in the program. Assistant City Manager Jon Fortune says the program “is critical as we look for ways to have a greater impact on the lives of teens.” Police officials also aim to host a citywide youth community service day.\n\nUtah\n\nUtah Lake: On a recent visit to Utah Lake’s west shore, Alison Green scrutinized sandstone outcrops, measuring lines chiseled into the stone by ancient hands, then doing her best to replicate them on gridded sheets. The 12-year-old from Sandy inspected one petroglyph cut into rock hundreds of years ago by Fremont Indians. “It shows the person has braided legs, and that could be a birthing scene,” she said. “That could mean it was a fertile area.” Green was among two dozen middle schoolers from Sandy’s Blessed Sacrament Catholic School recently doing archaeological surveys at the Adelbert Doyle Smith Family Preserve as part of an effort to list the 196-acre site on the National Register of Historic Places. “The kids are doing the work the way an entry-level archaeologist out of college would,” says John McHugh, a science teacher at Blessed Sacrament leading the expedition. He calls the school’s archaeology club the Shovel Bums, after the moniker given to rookie archaeologists who do the grunt work at excavation sites.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Seven historic sites owned by the state are now open for the season. The sites include more than 80 historic structures and hundreds of acres of forest and farmland that opened Saturday. State Historic Preservation Officer Laura Trieschmann says the historic sites include prehistoric camps, Revolutionary War sites and the homes of U.S. presidents. She says they all shed light on the history of Vermont. Among the sites that opened include the President Calvin Coolidge State Historic Site in Plymouth Notch, the Old Constitution House in Windsor and the Hubbardton Battlefield in Hubbardton. More than 70 public events and programs are scheduled this season at Vermont’s State Historic Sites.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A new television series with Ethan Hawke starring as the fiery abolitionist John Brown is set to film in the state. Gov. Ralph Northam’s office announced Thursday that production of the eight-part series will start in central Virginia this summer. The show is based on the novel “The Good Lord Bird” by best-selling author James McBride and is set to air on Showtime. Brown led a raid in 1859 on a federal arsenal in Harpers Ferry, in what is now West Virginia, hoping to start an armed slave rebellion. The rebellion didn’t happen, and Brown was later hanged for treason. Before the raid, Brown and a group of abolitionist settlers killed five pro-slavery settlers in Kansas in the Pottawatomie massacre.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane Valley: Proponents of creating a 51st state have held a bake sale to raise money for their cause. The Spokesman-Review reports that supporters of the proposed Christian conservative state, which would span parts of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana and Wyoming, raised money by auctioning pies and other desserts. The Liberty State Gala drew about 200 people in the city of Spokane Valley on Thursday evening. Speakers included Washington state Rep. Matt Shea, a Spokane Valley Republican who has championed the Liberty State movement. Shea spoke of the cultural and political differences between eastern and western Washington, denied the existence of global warming, and claimed the United States is “a Christian nation” under siege by atheists and Communists. Spokane City Councilman Mike Fagen and county Prosecutor Larry Haskell also attended.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Republicans in the state Senate have pitched a broad-based education plan that allows for charter schools but doesn’t include vouchers. Senate President Mitch Carmichael released a lengthy draft of the proposal late Friday and said it’s a compromise that folds in many ideas backed by Democrats. “Nobody gets everything they want,” he said. The legislation includes a pay raise for teachers, mental health services for students and a provision that would withhold pay for teachers if a school is closed because of a strike. The proposal comes as the GOP-led legislature nears special session debate on education measures. Carmichael said he put out the draft of the bill Friday to give lawmakers time to read it so they can come back this week and propose changes before the Senate reconvenes. Republican Gov. Jim Justice issued a statement praising the bill.\n\nWisconsin\n\nFifield: Rock music blared from speakers as spectators watched speedsters zoom around a track Sunday afternoon. It was a big day for racing, with NASCAR’s Coca-Cola 600 and the Indy 500, but the races in this northern Wisconsin community featured machines a bit slower than Indy cars – lawn mowers. While all the vehicles must start their careers as actual riding lawn mowers, racers make a few adjustments, resulting in mowers that can travel as fast as 60 mph. At Sunday’s races, which were a fundraiser for the Fifield Fire Department, 30 mowers competed in five classes on a dirt track an eighth of a mile long. Blades are removed from racing lawn mowers and steel welded on the frame for stability. In some classes, machines must run on original lawn mower engines. All must have hydraulic brakes.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The Wyoming Symphony Orchestra has named Christopher Dragon as its new conductor and music director after a search lasting a year and a half. The Casper Star-Tribune reports the Casper orchestra announced Thursday the selection of the Australia-born conductor, who was one of four finalists for the job. Dragon programmed and performed a concert in January with the orchestra. Search committee chair Eric Unruh says Dragon was a hit with the audience and musicians, and his creativity and innovation stood out. Dragon has been an associate conductor with the Colorado Symphony for four years. He will be the Denver orchestra’s resident conductor for the next two years. Dragon says every concert in Casper next year will feature a Beethoven piece in honor of the 250th anniversary of the composer’s birth.\n\nFrom staff and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/obituaries/2016/12/28/remembering-north-jerseyans-we-mourned-2016/94563750/", "title": "Remembering North Jerseyans we mourned in 2016", "text": "Jay Levin\n\nNorthJersey.com\n\nA pair of library pioneers whose bright idea has made it possible for you to get the book you want, even when your local branch doesn't stock it.

A professional historian who taught his neighbors to appreciate their region's heritage and who helped preserve a vital Revolutionary War site. A sheet metal worker who answered to \"Santa.\"\n\nNorth Jerseyans we lost in 2016 made contributions big and small, locally and beyond. A tribute to people who made a difference:\n\nThe two sitting North Jersey mayors who died this year were trailblazers. Elmwood Park's Richard Mola, 80, was first elected in 1971, when his borough was named East Paterson; at his death, he was New Jersey's longest-tenured hizzoner. A Republican in a heavily Democratic town, the old-school Mola won the hearts of voters by always being a phone call away. But he answered on a land line; he didn't use a cell. The death of Lizette Parker, 44, the first African-American woman to serve as a mayor in Bergen County, stunned Teaneck. Parker \"believed in looking for ways to change the lives of those she came in contact with,\" said Anthony Cureton, president of the Bergen County NAACP. \"She took great pride in Teaneck and desired it to be a place everyone would seek to live.\"\n\nGloria Kolodziej, 77, was a political force in Clifton for three decades, serving two terms as mayor. Her legacy includes the arts center that bears her name and two other projects she pushed for, a new library and an expanded Boys & Girls Club.\n\nMargaret Schak, 94, promoted prudent development of the Meadowlands during her Rutherford mayoralty. William Maresca, 86, provided a civics lesson for his industrial education students at Palisades High School through his service as a borough mayor and councilman.\n\nTHEATER: The 10 best shows of 2016\n\nDINING: 11 best restaurants in North Jersey in 2016\n\nLASTING IMPRESSIONS: Our photographers' favorite photos of 2016\n\nDINING: Best cheap eats of 2016\n\nThe Rev. Albert P. Rowe, 81, straddled faith and politics. A veteran of the civil rights movement, Rowe spent 45 years as pastor of Paterson's Calvary Baptist Church and sat on the City Council. He came up short in his 1990 bid to become the Silk City's first African-American mayor.\n\nAnother public servant, Birger M. Sween, 86, made his mark on the Superior Court bench in Bergen County. He brought the landmark Baby M case to a close by granting Mary Beth Whitehead broad visitation rights to the girl she bore under a surrogacy contract. Leonard I. Garth, 95, a Paterson lawyer early in his career, spent 46 years as a federal judge in New Jersey. His clerks included a future U.S. Supreme Court justice, Samuel Alito. Harry Galinsky, 90, earned national renown as an innovative Paramus schools superintendent.\n\nIn entertainment, guitar virtuoso Al Caiola, 96, of Oradell collaborated with a mind-boggling array of musical legends, including Frank Sinatra, Barbra Streisand and Simon and Garfunkel. He also had a hit recording of his own — a rendition of the theme from TV's \"Bonanza.\" The recording engineer Rudy Van Gelder, 91, of Englewood Cliffs, worked with jazz greats Miles Davis and John Coltrane and was synonymous with the genre. Velvet-voiced disc jockey Vaughn Harper, 70, of Teaneck, showcased jazz and blues on his late-night show, \"Quiet Storm,\" on radio station WBLS-FM.\n\nFrom the world of sports, North Jersey mourned Eddie Einhorn, 80. The Paterson-born broadcasting executive planted the seeds for March Madness by pioneering national college basketball telecasts. He also had an impact on baseball as co-owner of the Chicago White Sox. The New York Mets lost one of their own in media relations stafferShannon Forde. The 44-year-old Little Ferry mom, who endeared herself to players and reporters, succumbed to breast cancer. Her name will soon grace a youth baseball and softball field in her hometown.\n\nFootball's New York Giants bade farewell to John Johnson, 98, who worked as a team physical trainer for an incredible 60 years. The Cresskill resident's tenure spanned three Super Bowl championships and players from Frank Gifford to the current quarterback, Eli Manning. High school football coaching legend Pete LaBarbiera Sr., 78, guided Hasbrouck Heights to five state sectional titles and four undefeated campaigns in 15 seasons.\n\nAstute fans know the name Dave Sime. A three-sport star at Fair Lawn High in the 1950s, he was anointed the world's fastest human by Sports Illustrated, which placed him on its July 2, 1956, cover. Sime took home a silver medal in the 100-meter dash at the 1960 Summer Olympics but spurned an athletic career to become an eye surgeon. He was 79.\n\nSome of those we lost helped their fellow citizens and the larger community in meaningful ways. Rosemarie Kasper, 78, a disabled Hackensack resident, fought for curb cuts, wheelchair ramps, expanded transportation and other accommodations for Bergen County's physically challenged. Clifton's Edward Looney, 80, who quit gambling in his 30s, co-founded the state Council of Compulsive Gambling and launched its 800-GAMBLER help line.\n\nLen Rubin, 99, chronicled the yin and yang of Maywood as editor of Our Town, the weekly newspaper he and his late wife, Lillian, owned for more than 40 years. The Bergenfield Public Library's Mary Joyce Doyle, 87, a former nun, developed the Bergen County Cooperative Library System — often referred to as Buckles — which revolutionized the borrowing of books in North Jersey, and Robert White, 70, oversaw the library consortium's growth as its executive director for 30 years. River Edge's Kevin Wright, 64, dedicated his life to promoting New Jersey history. Most significantly, he championed the preservation of New Bridge Landing, the Revolutionary War site on the bank of the Hackensack River that was key to Gen. George Washington's retreat from the British forces. Wright's death left a void at the Bergen County Historical Society that is difficult to fill.\n\nSheet metal worker Ray Beesley, 65, one of North Jersey's busiest and most recognizable Santas — he was a Wayne Towne Center mall stalwart and even appeared on \"Late Night With David Letterman\" — died unexpectedly three weeks before Christmas, saddening families across the counties. Another favorite of the younger set was Englewood-bred children's author Anna Dewdney, 50, famous for her \"Llama Llama\" stories.

The exhausted crew dragged ashore an hour later and hid in the jungle, fearful they would be captured by Japanese soldiers. The next night, an American PT boat retrieved all 10 men.\n\nAs Conter told it, the story wasn't about punching sharks, or skulking in the jungle or chasing shadows to the waiting rescue boat. Conter was talking about survival, about coming back alive.\n\nHis time in the war started that way.\n\nHe was 20 when he escaped the burning wreckage of the USS Arizona in Pearl Harbor. He tried to save as many injured crewmen as he could, but when the sun set on Dec. 7, 1941, he was one of just 335 sailors who did not perish.\n\nConter fought on through World War II, scraped past a lot of close calls, then went to Korea. After that, he started teaching U.S. troops the skills of survival, evasion, resistance and escape. He wrote a training manual whose precepts the Navy still follows. Today, he tries to pass on what he knows to students of history.\n\nAt 93, he is one of the last survivors of the attack on the Arizona. He endured what he did, he says, because that was his job. And that's what he told every soldier and airman who took his courses.\n\nWhatever happens, find a way to survive.\n\nConter was stationed on the Arizona at Pearl Harbor in September 1941, when he turned 20. He and a buddy had been talking about their future in the Navy.\n\n\"Lou, let's go to flight school,\" Conter's buddy said one day.\n\n\"We won't get in,\" Conter said. \"We're right-arm rates.\" At the time, sailors wore patches designating their rates, the enlisted expression of rank, on the right or left sleeve, depending on their assignment. Aviators most often arose from left-arm rates.\n\nConter had made friends with a young lady in Honolulu. Her father was an engineer and a top executive for a dredging company with a big Navy contract. Conter was at the young lady's house one day when her father received an important visitor: Admiral William Calhoun, the commander of base force for the Pacific Fleet.\n\nCalhoun quizzed Conter about his posting, his job on the ship. Conter told the admiral he was interested in flight school, but doubted he would earn admission.\n\nCalhoun told Conter to put in for the assignment. A few weeks later, Conter and his buddy passed a flight test at sea and on Nov. 1, they got their orders: Report to Navy flight school in Pensacola, Fla.\n\nTwo weeks later, the Arizona's captain called the two sailors in and told them the ship was headed back to Long Beach in early December. They could ride to the mainland then and leave for Florida.\n\nTheir orders were lost on the Arizona when the battleship sank on Dec. 7. Conter and his buddy waited for new instructions, but heard nothing.\n\nIn early January, Conter visited his young lady friend again and again, Admiral Calhoun was there.\n\n\"I thought you'd be in flight school,\" he said.\n\nConter told him about the lost orders. Three days later, he and his buddy were on a ship to San Francisco and then a train to Pensacola.\n\nConter got his wings in November 1942. He was soon flying one of the Navy's Black Cats, a squadron of long-range patrol bombers painted black for night missions.\n\nThe Black Cats flew surveillance, search and rescue, sea patrol, but they proved especially valuable for nighttime assaults and nuisance raids on Japanese submarines and ships. The planes could fly at low altitudes, then buzz upward for a bombing run, confounding enemy gunners trying to calculate speed and distance.\n\nThe crews were based on tender ships moored in secluded harbors. Conter served on the San Pablo and Half Moon. The planes took off and landed on the water; the pilots tied up to buoys near the ship.\n\n\"We'd leave at 5:30 in the evening and stay out 12 or 14 hours, then return in the morning,\" Conter said. \"Sometimes, we'd come back, eat, then sleep on the beach.\"\n\nConter's crews flew missions across the South Pacific: New Guinea, Borneo, New Britain, the coast off Perth, Australia.\n\nThe crews learned the routines of the Japanese ships. The best time for a bombing raid was after 1 a.m., when the ship was quiet.\n\n\"We wouldn't get much fire back and by the time they sounded general quarters, we were on our way,\" Conter said. \"Sometimes they'd get shooting at you and you'd look at the shells and they looked like they were going to hit you. Then they'd go by.\"\n\nConter's plane hadn't been out long in September 1943 when enemy bullets pierced one of their rear hatches and hit a parachute flare. The flare exploded and started a fire, which forced the plane into the water.\n\n\"Say your prayers, men, we're seven miles off shore and we're in 10, 15-foot swells,\" one of the officers said as the crew abandoned the plane. \"I don't think we'll ever be able to swim to shore.\"\n\n\"Baloney,\" Conter replied. \"Knock it off. Just stay together, hold hands and kick slowly 'cause there'll be sharks around. If a shark comes too close, hit it in the nose with your fist as hard as you can.\"\n\nThe men helped one another, holding up anyone who weakened. Not long after, a second plane dropped a life raft and all 10 of the crew made to shore and, the next night, back to the base.\n\nIn late 1943, Conter flew a mission to rescue more than 200 coast watchers in New Guinea. Coast watchers were military intelligence operatives who gathered information about enemy activities on islands across the South Pacific.\n\nThe planes flew up the Sepik River from the northern coast of New Guinea. The river wound through dense vegetation, leaving 15 or 20 feet of clearance on each side of the plane. If a plane crashed, crocodiles awaited in the river.\n\n\"In three days, we rescued 219 coast watchers without losing anybody,\" Conter said. \"The Japanese were only a mile away. It was one of the biggest rescues in World War II, but no one knew about it because everything was top secret in those days.\"\n\nIn Korea, Conter flew 29 missions, but his work in Naval intelligence left him vulnerable if the North Koreans captured him, so he was shipped to Washington, D.C.\n\nHe was promoted to Lieutenant Commander in February 1954, the rank he held until he retired. His work turned toward survival training in a new military program called SERE, for Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape.\n\nConter helped establish training bases in Florida and California and in 1965, he returned to Pearl Harbor to write training materials for troops headed to Vietnam.\n\nHe had stopped at Pearl Harbor more than a decade earlier, on his way to a posting in Korea. A platform marked the wreckage of the USS Arizona. Conter and others in his group boarded a boat to go out to the platform and see his old ship.\n\n\"We got halfway there and I told them to turn around,\" Conter said. \"I wasn't going out there. I couldn't.\"\n\nIn 1967, Conter retired from the Navy. More than 20 years earlier, he had earned his real estate license in California and had maintained it. He settled in Palm Springs and built a career as a real estate developer, buying up land for commercial and residential projects.\n\nThat same year, he met his wife, Valerie, in Palm Springs. Her sister knew Jack Warner, the film studio mogul, and invited Valerie to a movie premiere party Warner was hosting in Palm Springs for his latest project, \"Camelot\".\n\nConter attended the same event and was seated next to Valerie. They struck up a conversation and, after a brief courtship, married.\n\nToday, Lou and Valerie Conter live in a two-level house at the end of a winding road on a golf course in Grass Valley, a mountain town about 60 miles outside Sacramento.\n\nTall pines tower over the house. Deer and rabbits wander the hillside. Golfers play through 50 yards from Conter's driveway.\n\n\"I'm going to be back out there one of these days,\" Conter said, his voice wistful as he watches a foursome trying to stay on the greens. Conter's doctor has sidelined him for now for health reasons, but he is certain he will return soon.\n\nHe took up golf seriously in Palm Springs and played in the Bob Hope Classic six times, once on a team with crooner Johnny Mathis. He keeps a photo from that tournament on a bookshelf in an alcove off the kitchen.\n\nOn the same bookshelf sit mementos from his time on the Arizona. Medals. Photographs. A painting of the Arizona hangs on the wall of a sitting room. He keeps a folder of newspaper clippings, magazine stories and copies of a telegram.\n\n\"Here's the one that told my mother I was missing in action on the Arizona,\" he says. It is dated Dec. 21, 1941.\n\n\"The Navy Department deeply regrets to inform you that your son Louis Anthony Counter quartermaster third class US Navy is missing following action in the performance of his duty.\"\n\nThe telegram, which misspelled Conter's last name, promises further information and asks his family not to divulge Conter's posting.\n\nA second telegram, dated Jan. 6 reported that Conter was alive and would contact his family.\n\n\"I'd already sent word, even before the first one got there,\" he says. \"So they knew.\"\n\nThough Conter turned around the first time he ventured toward the sunken Arizona, he has been back since, to see it with other survivors.\n\nHe joined the USS Arizona Reunion Association and stays in touch with a few of the remaining survivors. One, Joe Langdell, lives about 40 miles away in Yuba City.\n\nHe keeps up with what the military does, and some of it irritates him. Discipline seems less important than it was in his day. Too many strategic decisions come down from Washington instead of from the commanders on the ground.\n\nAnd he has watched with dismay the changes in survival training. He once helped design programs that sent soldiers into the wilds for days or weeks at a time. Now, some courses require less than a week of field time.\n\n\"You can't get a guy hungry in three or four days,\" Conter says.\n\nBut there are moments when he knows what he did meant something. His old co-pilot in the New Guinea days was asked once if he'd had survival training for the war.\n\n\"He said, 'I had survival training in the ocean. We had survival training on the job. And my co-pilot, Lou Conter, saved my life.'\"\n\nConter stares at his hands.\n\n\"Some things,\" he says, \"you don't know about what they'll mean until years later.\"\n\nLAS VEGAS\n\nOnce a month or so, Clarendon Hetrick's phone rings with a call from Utah. On the other end of the line is an old shipmate from the USS Saratoga, the aircraft carrier where Hetrick worked as a mechanic through most of World War II.\n\nFor an hour or so, the two men talk. They catch up. They trade stories. Not war stories, usually, not unless one of them has had it out with a doctor or a pushy clerk. Just stories, the kind buddies tell each other.\n\n\"He's there anytime I call him,\" Hetrick says. \"He's there for me. I guess he'd do anything he could for me. He's more like family than just a friend.\"\n\nHetrick, who is 91, has outlived most of the men he knew on the Saratoga. He is one of nine living survivors from the attack on the USS Arizona, the battleship he boarded in 1941 when he was 17.\n\nHe will answer questions about that December day when he escaped the burning wreckage of the Arizona, reciting as many of the details as he can remember. The new shoes he left on the deck of the sinking ship, the ones he intended to retrieve later. The shock of jumping into a harbor knowing he couldn't swim.\n\nBut he kept most of it to himself until he started meeting up with other survivors, years after he retired from the military.\n\n\"I was always wanting to learn more when I was younger,\" says Hetrick's younger son, Robert, who lives not far from his dad in Las Vegas. \"But I had a brother in Vietnam who didn't want to talk about it at all, so I guess I realized if they want to talk, they'll talk. That was the way it was.\"\n\nHetrick shrugs, trying to get comfortable in the recliner. \"It just didn't appeal to me to bring it up,\" he says.\n\nFires still burned on the broken USS Arizona the morning after the Japanese ambush. Hetrick slept on the battleship USS Tennessee, which had been moored just ahead of the Arizona along Ford Island.\n\nThe Tennessee took hits in the attack, but two of the armor piercing bombs, the kind that sunk the Arizona, failed to detonate. Debris from the Arizona showered the Tennessee's stern and started fires, but the vessel stayed afloat.\n\nHetrick took a motor launch to the receiving station on shore, where he and other survivors were allowed to shower and given a change of clothes. The men followed orders in a fog of wonderment and confusion.\n\n\"We didn't hear much from the outside at first,\" Hetrick said. \"It hadn't really sunk in what had happened.\"\n\nThe Navy began assigning sailors to new postings. Hetrick was sent to the USS Lexington, an aircraft carrier. The ship remained anchored outside Pearl Harbor for most of a month as U.S. commanders planned their next move against the Japanese in the South Pacific.\n\nOne day, a Navy officer came on board and asked if anyone wanted to volunteer for an assignment in the aviation section. Hetrick thought about it. He liked the idea of working as an aircraft mechanic, so he volunteered.\n\n\"They gave me 30 minutes to get off the ship and catch a transport to San Diego for training,\" he said. \"It didn't take me that long. I had one pair of dungarees and that was it, that and a towel and shaving gear.\"\n\nThe Lexington sailed out of Pearl Harbor not long after. It never returned, crippled in the Battle of the Coral Sea and scuttled by the Navy to keep the enemy from salvaging her.\n\nAfter about six months of training in San Diego, Hetrick returned to Honolulu and joined the USS Saratoga, the sister ship of the Lexington. He worked on board as a mechanic for a torpedo squadron and ended up in charge of the hydraulic shop.\n\nThe Saratoga sailed across the South Pacific, to Guam, the Philippines, around New Guinea. Hetrick was on board during battles at Midway and Wake Island and for the U.S. invasion of Iwo Jima early in 1945. The Saratoga was attacked by six Japanese suicide bombers within about 24 hours.\n\n\"I put on two life jackets,\" Hetrick said. \"I told another kid if they come back again tonight, I'm leaving.\"\n\nHetrick earned a Purple Heart for wounds during one of the bombing raids.\n\nThe Saratoga had returned to Pearl Harbor by the time the Japanese surrendered. The Navy loaded 5,000 bunks on board, along with a row of portable latrines, and the Saratoga sailed to San Francisco, passing under the Golden Gate Bridge with toilet paper streamers and thousands of sailors who needed something to do.\n\nHetrick was still just 21 by then, but a seasoned sailor who shared little in common with the 17-year-old kid who left high school and joined the Navy on his parents' signature.\n\n\"I didn't have the slightest idea what would happen when I signed up,\" he said. \"I decided I'd do whatever they told me to. When they said, 'grab your sea bags and let's go,' I did.\"\n\nWhen he first arrived at Pearl Harbor, Hetrick wasn't even old enough to buy a beer until he found a place where they didn't ask questions if a guy was in a service uniform.\n\nNow, stateside again, Hetrick reported to a Navy station in San Diego, where he met the woman who would become his wife, Jeanne. As his stint was about to end, the Navy decided to transfer him back to Pearl Harbor. He asked if Jeanne could come with him.\n\n\"They said, 'If you re-enlist, we'll send her over.' I said, 'You send her over, I'll re-enlist.' I'd been told things like that before. They wouldn't send her over so I didn't re-enlist.\"\n\nBut Hetrick couldn't find work, so inside of six months, he signed up for the Navy Reserve. He was sent to the Los Alamitos Naval Air Station up the coast in Orange County.\n\nIn 1949, the newly created U.S. Air Force was trying to fill it out its ranks with experienced support crews, almost begging for mechanics who knew the aircraft. Hetrick saw a new opportunity and joined.\n\n\"On the day I swore into the Air Force, I was still in my Navy uniform,\" he said. \"Three months later, I was in Korea.\"\n\nHe worked his way up to crew chief on a squadron of B-26 bombers,\n\nAfter 18 months overseas, he returned to Langley Field in Virginia. (\"Two of us with the same rank were up for the same kind of job,\" he said. \"He wanted the east coast, I wanted the west coast. He got the west coast and I got the east coast. So you see how that works.\")\n\nFrom Virginia, he went to Utah, to France and then to Albuquerque, where he retired in November 1961.\n\nHe was on his own once again, he and his young family. They moved to Modesto, Calif., where he got a job driving a produce truck in the fruit orchards.\n\n\"They paid me by the day,\" he said. \"After 36 hours, I still hadn't put in a day. I asked the boss, 'how many hours is in a day for you?' He said, 'whatever I can get out of you.' I quit. I wasn't working for nothing.\"\n\nHe hired on with a farm labor contractor and within a year, he and a guy he worked with started their own business, contracting with the orchard owners to harvest crops. They covered the growing seasons: cherries, peaches, nectarines, apricots, grapes.\n\nThe venture was working out well. Until his partner ran off with all the money.\n\nHetrick recovered. He built a reputation as a guy who could bring in the harvest on time.\n\nAround 2005, he and Jeanne moved to Bullhead City. A few years after that, they left for Las Vegas, where their son, Bob, and his family help them get around.\n\nLas Vegas seems to like Hetrick. He was at a restaurant last summer and someone noticed his USS Arizona cap. He didn't have to pay for dinner.\n\nHetrick turns a rusted chunk of metal over in his hands, running his fingers along the curves and edges. It is a piece of rigging used to secure a mooring line from a ship.\n\nFrom the USS Arizona.\n\nHe first visited the Arizona memorial in Pearl Harbor on the 50th anniversary of the attack and has returned since.\n\n\"It gets your breath when you first see it,\" he says. \"It's hard to explain.\" He thinks back. \"You know, you can see where I came out of, the hatchway. There's a little air bubble. It's the same place where the oil is leaking\" — oil stores aboard the ship that, even today, still seep to the surface — \"that's where I got out from below.\"\n\nIn 2006, Hetrick returned to Pearl Harbor for the 65th anniversary of the Japanese attack. He had visited before, but this trip meant more. He brought all of his family: his wife Jeanne, his three sons and their families. And he was allowed to visit a part of the Arizona few people ever see.\n\nDuring construction of the memorial, the Navy sliced off pieces of the Arizona's wreckage to make room for the structure that sits above the sunken ship today. The pieces – the largest is about as long as a bus – sit in a salvage yard on the Waipi'o Peninsula on Oahu. The Navy occasionally cuts away small bits of the wreckage for memorials.\n\nFor Hetrick, the section of mooring line links him to those final moments of the Arizona. He will tell his story if he's asked and he will remember details along the way.\n\n\"I remember hearing explosions at first,\" he says. \"It sounded like someone shooting guns. You don't fire guns in port, so I ran out real quick to see what was happening. I saw one airplane, with a big red meatball on the side. Nobody could debate what that was, no question about it.\"\n\nHe remembers the crewman trying to climb a ladder to escape through a hatchway on the deck. The man told him later he had broken both his hips in one of the explosions and had survived only because Hetrick was there to urge him on.\n\nHetrick still likes to talk about the new shoes he bought the day before the attack in Honolulu. As he prepared to jump off the burning ship, he took the shoes off and set them on the quarterdeck.\n\n\"I left them there and hoped to get them back,\" he says. \"I ain't seen 'em since.\"\n\nHe remembers when the order was given to abandon ship. He jumped into the harbor, even though he had never passed his swimming test.\n\n\"When somebody says get out of here and you're on a hundred tons of ammunition, well, you don't question it,\" he says. \"If somebody in authority said do something back then, you didn't question it. I think that's what kept me living to this day.\"\n\nHe's not sure he'd have learned that lesson if he hadn't enlisted in the Navy. He says that decision was the best thing he could have done.\n\n\"I'd do it a hundred times more,\" he says.\n\nPROVO, Utah\n\nKen Potts eases around the side of the pool table, waving toward items like a museum tour guide in a back room.\n\n\"This shows where all the ships were,\" he says, pointing at a map depicting Pearl Harbor on the morning of Dec. 7, 1941. \"There's the battleships … there's the Nevada, the Arizona, the Tennessee, the West Virginia, Maryland, the Oklahoma. The California was way down here.\"\n\nHe stops in front of a newspaper, the front page of the Honolulu Star-Bulletin with the headline: \"WAR! OAHU BOMBED BY JAPANESE PLANES\"\n\n\"That's one of the first extras that was put out that day,\" Potts says. \"I bought it at the receiving station in Pearl Harbor. It's in good shape for a paper.\"\n\nFarther down the paneled wall hangs a painting of the USS Arizona, the battleship Navy recruit Potts boarded in December 1939. By 1941, he worked the cranes on the ship, a job that entailed retrieving the Arizona's small seaplanes after they landed on the water.\n\nHe points out the cranes and the locations along the ship where he would tie up the motor boats he piloted to fetch supplies and ferry sailors to and from shore. He gazes at the picture.\n\n\"They were saying, when it first started, some of the ones whose station was up here – \"\n\nHe traces his finger up onto the main forward mast, to the crow's nest and the bridge. He clears his throat. \"They tried to jump off. Some of 'em made it, some of 'em landed on the deck. That was the end of it.\"\n\nA moment passes. He returns his attention to the cranes and the catapults that flung the seaplanes into flight.\n\n\"Once after we crossed the equator, one of the planes came back,\" he says. \"The sea was real rough when it came in and the sharks started gathering around. They called the Marines out with rifles to protect the plane and the guys while we hauled it in.\"\n\nPotts was returning to the Arizona with fresh produce when the first Japanese bombers dove into Pearl Harbor. He climbed aboard the ship, ducking to avoid bullets from the gunner planes. He helped rescue some of his shipmates. Seventy-three years later, he is one of just nine survivors of the attack on the Arizona.\n\nHe keeps the mementos from his experience – the maps, the photos, the clippings, the medals, the painting – in a room behind a door on the side wall of the living room in the house where he has lived for 54 years. He doesn't like to talk about the attack. Sometimes he can't control his emotions, so he declines speaking requests.\n\nBut he is proud of his service, of the other sailors on the Arizona. And there's a trophy in the corner the paneled room that means as much as anything else there.\n\nA few weeks after the war started, sometime in early 1942, Potts opened a letter from his mother. Why is the FBI checking up on you, she wanted to know. Someone from the bureau had been asking questions. He heard the same stories from his grandmother and his aunts.\n\nHe didn't know what to tell them. It scared him a little. Potts was working aboard an oil tanker, making short runs out of the harbor to refuel ships anchored off the coast. In the chaotic days following the Dec. 7 ambush, the Navy wasn't letting ships into the harbor, fearful the Japanese might send in more bombers.\n\nFinally, after a few weeks on the tanker, Potts was handed a new assignment. He would work in the port director's office, delivering sealed packets to the captains of Navy ships. Inside the packets were the captains' new orders, military secrets, classified information that required clearance to handle.\n\nThat's why the FBI was nosing around me, Potts thought.\n\n\"These captains of the ships, when they left the states, they had no idea where they were going, just that they're going via Pearl Harbor,\" Potts said.\n\nHe resumed one of his old jobs from the Arizona, piloting motor launches from the receiving station out to the Navy ships.\n\nPotts was based out of the port director's office – there were two, one at the harbor, one on the ninth floor of the Aloha Tower in downtown Honolulu – but he logged most of his hours at the controls of the motor boat, a Jeep or a station wagon.\n\n\"The station wagon was for the captains of some of the ships that would come in,\" he said. \"Not Navy ships, other ships. The Navy captain who lived on Waikiki Beach gave a lot of parties and invited these guys. I had to take them to the parties and sit there until it was over.\"\n\nThe parties sometimes dragged into the early morning hours.\n\n\"It was boring,\" Potts says. \"But it was a lot better than being shot at.\"\n\nHe tried to keep his thoughts on the work in the office. He tried not to remember the days after the attack. The day when they assigned him and a crew of divers to a motor launch and sent them to the Arizona to remove bodies of dead sailors.\n\n\"When they dropped that bomb that made our ammunition explode, it dang near broke the ship in two, so we couldn't go anywhere forward of that,\" he says. \"We took all the bodies we could find.\"\n\nWhen he reaches that part of his story, he stops. He can't relive those images anymore. He describes the store of booze they pulled out of safe and the money.\n\n\"One day our boat was stacked with two dollar bills,\" he said. \"They paid everybody in two dollar bills back then. We hauled it all back in.\"\n\nPotts stayed in Honolulu until the end of the war. He finally received his orders to return to the states. He would sail to San Francisco on one of the cruise ships refitted to move troops, the Lurline, or maybe the Matsonia.\n\nAs he was packing, a buddy warned him that his possessions would be searched at the port in San Francisco. If they found anything that belonged to the Navy or hadn't been approved, they'd take it.\n\nPotts picked up the Colt 45 he'd found on Ford Island on Dec. 7, 1941. The gun took away some of the terror he had felt from the moment he saw the first bomber, the panic he felt when he found the armories on board the ship locked. With a gun, he could defend himself. He had held on to it through the war.\n\nBut he didn't want to start his civilian life in the brig, so he left it in Honolulu.\n\n\"We got into San Francisco,\" he says, \"and they never even opened my bags. Never would've found it.\"\n\nHe bought another gun in the states and he is never far from it. A pistol sits on top of his television at home. He keeps it with him when he travels. And he keeps it loaded.\n\n\"It ain't worth a damn if it ain't loaded,\" he says.\n\nPotts returned to Illinois in late 1945 to await his formal discharge, hanging out in Chicago. He was still active, so would report to the Navy Pier each morning to check a list for the names of sailors who had been given duties for the day. His name never appeared and he would leave for the day.\n\n\"I came back to the pier one morning and my name was on the list to do KP work,\" he says. Kitchen patrol. Mess hall duty. Peeling potatoes.\n\n\"I went and found the head guy and by the time I got through explaining things to him,\" Potts says, \"my name was never on that list again.\"\n\nHis mother had moved to Decatur, Ill., by then, so he followed and took a job at a hardware store. He started chatting up a regular customer, a contractor, and got a job building houses.\n\n\"What houses they built!\" Potts says, shaking his head. \"That lumber was so damn green then, we used to kid we had to shoot the squirrels out of it.\"\n\nHe wasn't happy where he was, so he loaded up his big 12-cylinder Lincoln Zephyr and headed west. He stopped in the small town of Payson, Utah.\n\n\"They said what a wonderful place it was to live, with jobs and everything, so I bought a little place up in Spanish Fork,\" he says, \"I'm still looking for that easy money.\"\n\nWith his experience running cranes on the Arizona, Potts figures he could have landed a decent job at the Geneva Steel operation, but he didn't want to work shifts, so he worked as a carpenter again and eventually went into the used car business with a friend.\n\nHe moved to Provo and sold cars until 1990. He and his wife, Doris, have lived in the same house for 54 years.\n\nThe paneled room behind the door in the living room of the Provo house is filled with trophies of almost any imaginable sort. Two deer racks (his wife shot one, his son the other). Guns. Knives. A bow. An impressive collection of restaurant menus from 30 years of cross-country searches for used cars.\n\nAnd in the back corner, a real trophy. It sits a little higher than most items, but not necessarily on a platform. It fit in that location. And it holds deep meaning for Potts, even though he did nothing to win it.\n\nPotts had not returned to Honolulu in the decades since he left for San Francisco in 1945. He wasn't ready to see it all again, to sharpen the memories he'd tried to dull.\n\nIn 2006, one of his sons offered to take Potts to Hawaii for the 65th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack. He stayed on the 17th floor of a hotel on Waikiki Beach. He visited the memorial and was relieved to see the builders got it right.\n\n\"It's one of the best actual memorials I've seen,\" he says. \"It's where the war started.\"\n\nFive years later, in 2011, he got a call from the band director at Timpview High School in Provo. The marching band had been invited to fly to Pearl Harbor and perform at activities commemorating the 70th anniversary of the attack.\n\nThe band members had decided they wanted to honor survivors from that day. Would Ken be willing to go as a guest of honor? The band would cover all expenses for him and Doris.\n\nPotts was touched. He could see the band was sincere. To prepare for the trip, they were studying World War II history, attending lectures, writing research papers. They offered to perform at a gathering of Utah survivors. How could he say no?\n\n\"Talk about treating you like royalty,\" he says. He was able to visit the national cemetery at an area called the Punch Bowl. He watched the band perform and stood as a survivor of the Arizona, one of the sailors who lived. He went out to the floating memorial.\n\n\"I got the lay a wreath in front of the names of the fallen,\" he says quietly.\n\nWhen he returned home, he got another call from the band director. The band had won a trophy in one of the competitions during their stay in Honolulu. They had voted. They were dedicating it to Potts and wanted him to have it.\n\nHe squeezes past the pool table, past the photos and the maps and the medals. Here is a story he will tell, a memory he will keep.\n\nThe trophy sits on a small white base that raises it above other items on a shelf. It is about three feet tall, with a carved island figure on top and the silhouette of a Hawaiian warrior on a plaque. The inscription reads \"Spirit of Aloha Award, Timpview High School Marching Band.\"\n\nHe touches the trophy.\n\n\"It's my pride and joy.\"\n\nLA MIRADA, Calif.\n\nFor 30 years, Lauren Bruner punched a clock at a manufacturing plant south of Los Angeles, a World War II veteran in a landscape crawling with them.\n\nNo one knew much about Bruner's years in the Navy, not the early years anyway. The easy stories he'd tell. The ones that gave him nightmares, the stories from the day he nearly burned to death, he kept to himself.\n\nYet in a place where you couldn't cross the street without running into a war vet, Bruner was not just another ex-sailor who made it home. Only 335 men survived the bombing of the USS Arizona, the mighty battleship whose loss at Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, inspired a nation to go to war.\n\nBruner was one of them.\n\nBy 1991, the 50th anniversary of the attack, the number of living Arizona crewmen had shrunk. Survivors' groups wanted to find all of them so their stories would not be lost.\n\nA woman from Illinois drew Bruner's name. No one among the groups knew where he was or what he was doing, but the woman persisted. She tracked him to the Los Angeles area, then started a phone search.\n\nFinally, she located some of Bruner's tax records and found his address and telephone number.\n\n\"No one knew where the hell I was,\" Bruner says. \"I was here all the time. When they sent me my discharge, I just stayed here.\"\n\nThe woman helped connect Bruner with other survivors from the Arizona and Pearl Harbor. He finally found people who understood his experience.\n\n\"I never talked about it much then,\" he says. \"I just didn't want to. I still get to the point when I'm talking about it, first thing you know, I go to bed at night, wake up and can't sleep for a week.\"\n\nBruner, who turned 94 in November, is now one of nine living USS Arizona crewmen who survived the ship's sinking. He has been telling his story to an author, Ed McGrath, who is working on a book and a film about Bruner's escape from a collapsing tower on the ship.\n\nThe survivors' group that found him was right, he has concluded: The stories of the Arizona should not die with the men who lived them.\n\n\"The kids coming up now have never heard of it,\" he says, his voice tinged with sadness and dismay. \"Never heard of it.\"\n\nBruner was at his battle station in an anti-aircraft gun director, a metal box on the forward mast of the Arizona, when an armor-piercing bomb ignited the ship's powder magazine. The fireball from the explosion engulfed the six men in the box and trapped them.\n\nA sailor on the deck of the repair ship Vestal spotted the men and threw a line across. Their skin charred and falling off, the men crawled down the line to the Vestal. Bruner was the second-to-last man to leave the sinking ship.\n\nHe won't talk much about the escape, or about the men who didn't make it across. Nightmares invade his sleep when he remembers those final moments.\n\nFrom the Vestal, Bruner was taken to the USS Solace, a hospital ship in the harbor. The Solace dispatched motor boats to the Arizona to rescue wounded sailors and her crew pulled others from the water.\n\nBruner was burned over more than two-thirds of his body. He had taken a bullet to the back of his leg as he was climbing the tower, but the burns were far worse. He stayed aboard the Solace about a month. In January, another ship took him to San Francisco to the Navy hospital on Treasure Island.\n\nHe was treated there for four months. Before the war started, a hospital stay that long would have earned a sailor a discharge, but not anymore. He knew he was near release the day an officer came by and launched into a pep talk about the war and the Navy's role in it.\n\n\"I got another ship for you,\" the officer said at last.\n\n\"OK,\" Bruner said. \"What's up with this one?\"\n\n\"It's a brand new destroyer, the Coghlan, DD-606,\" he said, \"built right here in 'Frisco.\"\n\nAs the war with Japan intensified, the Navy was building new warships as fast as it could. And the ships needed experienced sailors.\n\nBruner was put in charge of the gun batteries. The ship carried four 5-inch anti-aircraft guns and six half-inch machine guns, and, initially, five 21-inch torpedo tubes. The guns used the same type of control mechanisms Bruner had mastered on the Arizona. Sight-setters and pointers would locate targets visually and determine their distance and range. An electro-mechanical computer would aim the guns.\n\n\"I had to start training the new recruits on every machine,\" Bruner said. \"The new ones, they didn't know beans.\"\n\nBruner looked each recruit in the eyes to determine the right job, but he wasn't testing their mettle, not yet. He wanted men with eyes set in the right place on their face. He looked for what he called medium spacing. With eyes too close or two far apart, a crewman could deliver faulty readings.\n\nThe Coghlan left San Francisco in September 1942 and sailed toward Pearl Harbor for an assignment. The ship was still a day away from Honolulu when the captain received new orders. The ship was to turn around and steam toward Alaska.\n\nThe Japanese military had established strategic outposts in the Aleutian Islands and had its eye on Alaska. Japan wanted the northern Pacific to control its shipping routes and block U.S. attacks from that direction.\n\nThe Coghlan approached the Aleutians in October, as winter was pushing fall aside. The sea turned rough, tossing the ship with 40-foot swells, bouncing the vessel like a rubber ball in a washing machine.\n\n\"When we got up into the Aleutians, we started banging on the Japanese that had already landed,\" Bruner said. \"We'd patrol at night. They were trying to replenish submarines or send smaller ships in. We'd go out and blow them up.\"\n\nBy winter, temperatures plunged below zero. The Coghlan's crew battled just to keep the guns free of ice as they headed toward their next target.\n\n\"We had to have two crews, a regular crew and a stand-by crew lined up waiting,\" Bruner said. \"We'd send two guys out to knock the icicles off the guns, then they'd high-tail it back in. By the time they were back, the icicles were forming again and two more guys would go out.\"\n\nThe Coghlan supported Army landings and Navy bombing runs. In March, the crew turned back Japanese forces in the Battle of Komandorski.\n\nLate in the year, after an overhaul in San Francisco, the Coghlan returned to patrol duty off the Aleutians with a half dozen other U.S. vessels. The ships encountered a Japanese fleet, two big cruisers, six destroyers, some troop ships, and engaged.\n\n\"We lit into them, started firing on them,\" Bruner said. \"This went on for four straight hours. We got into a run-and-gun battle. One of our cruisers, the heavy cruiser, got hit and water got into the oil. They were dead in the water.\"\n\nFinally, the four U.S. destroyers were ordered to mount a torpedo run.\n\n\"We took off,\" Bruner said, \"firing just as fast as we could. We got as close as 5,000 yards, which was point-blank for those ships. We cut the torpedoes loose.\"\n\nThe Americans stopped the Japanese ships and wiped out some of the top officers. The Coghlan turned back, almost spent. Another five minutes, Bruner figured, and they'd have run out of ammunition.\n\nBruner and the Coghlan returned to Honolulu and finished out the war in the South Pacific. The ship accompanied General Douglas MacArthur to the Philippines and was anchored in the harbor off Nagasaki, Japan, when the second atomic bomb exploded.\n\nBruner toured Nagasaki in a Jeep with other Navy officers and chief mates. A few days later, the drove through the crumbling streets of Hiroshima. The cities were in ruins. But the war was over.\n\n\"When I got back home, my doctors here wanted to know about my medical background,\" Bruner said. \"I would tell them. They said, 'You should have been dead a long time ago.'\"\n\nHe finished his stint in the Navy in Shanghai, working shore patrol the way he did back in Honolulu. He was cut loose in San Francisco and returned to Los Angeles, where he had married a girl back in late 1942.\n\nOne day, a young fellow knocked on his door.\n\n\"Hi,\" he said, introducing himself. \"I'm planning to marry your wife's sister, but I've got to have somebody take my place at work. I wanted to know if you could do it for a couple of weeks.\"\n\nBruner thought it an odd request. He asked what the fellow did.\n\n\"I'm a painter,\" he said. \"A brush painter.\"\n\nBruner laughs as he remembers the conversation.\n\n\"Well, I'd brushed enough paint on that damn ship, I figured I could do it,\" he says. \"I said, 'sure, I'll take it.' I still had to wait 29 years for that guy to come back and take his brush back.\"\n\nHis new employer manufactured industrial refrigeration units. Bruner started as a painter, trained as a carpenter, then helped start a new sheet-metal department. Almost three decades later, he was the plant manager, second-in-command.\n\nThree months before he would mark 30 years with the company, he was let go, bought out like a lot other older workers in those days.\n\nBy the time the woman from Illinois found him, he was ready to face his past.\n\nBruner lives alone , in a post-war neighborhood in the far northern edges of Orange County. Trains run close enough to hear the horns during the day, but not close enough to make them a nuisance.\n\nAn avocado tree grows in the backyard. Bruner's neighbor, who has become a close friend and a source of transportation, picks the fruit to keep it from rotting on the ground. Long a bachelor again, Bruner has also entertained lady friends from time to time.\n\nBruner keeps mementos of his time on the Arizona in the sitting room. Framed medals. Photos of the ship and other survivors at reunions in Honolulu. A sign over the arched door marks the room as \"Captain's Quarters.\"\n\nFor a long time, he didn't think he would ever return to Pearl Harbor.\n\nNow, Bruner prepares for his next trip in the Captain's Quarters. He will meet three other survivors in Hawaii for their last reunion. He looks forward to his time with the guys from his years in the Navy.\n\nThe first couple of trips back to Hawaii were difficult. The ones after that were, too.\n\n\"It never gets easy to go back,\" he says.\n\nSo why go back?\n\n\"To see the people I knew back in those days,\" he says. \"They were very good days before the war. I even had a couple of dates with girls.\"\n\nHis mouth quirks into a smile.\n\n\"I was on a date on that Saturday night with a gal I'd been running around with,\" he says. He doesn't need to say which Saturday night by now. \"We're were out and around. We were going to have a date the next day.\n\n\"The next day never came.\"\n\nMORRIS, Okla.\n\n\n\nLonnie Cook was born in this rural town south of Tulsa, not long after it was founded as a stop on the Ozark and Cherokee Central Railway. Only a few hundred people lived there then. Today, the population can almost reach 1,500 when everyone is home.\n\nCook enlisted in the Navy in 1940 and was assigned to the USS Arizona, one of the largest battleships in the fleet with a crew that, at full complement, numbered more than 1,500.\n\nAbout a year after he boarded the ship, he ran into a young recruit named Clyde Williams, a fellow from Okmulgee, Okla., a few miles down the road from Morris. All those sailors from all those places and here was a guy who was practically a neighbor.\n\n\"I was back here on leave before the war started and he was here too,\" Cook says. \"We picked up a couple of girls and made the rounds. Then we had to go back.\"\n\nCook was a gunner's mate on the Arizona. Williams was in the Arizona's band.\n\nOn the morning of Dec. 7, 1941, Cook was changing clothes at his locker, savoring the thought of a day in Honolulu with the $60 he'd won in a craps game the night before. Williams was on deck, tuning up to play for colors, an early call after the previous day's fleet Battle of the Bands on shore.\n\nMinutes later, the Japanese attacked and the Arizona was on fire, sinking beneath the surface.\n\nCook made it off alive. He returned after the war to his home along the railway in eastern Oklahoma. By then, he'd seen the world, witnessed history before it was history. His ships steamed across the Pacific, through the Panama Canal to Africa. He fought with other sailors in the Battle of Midway and watched the Marines raising the flag on Iwo Jima.\n\nBack on land, Cook followed welding jobs from Kentucky and Pennsylvania to New Jersey and Long Island, west to North Dakota and Wisconsin and finally to a ranch house in Salinas, Calif., where he raised a family and stayed put for almost 30 years.\n\nBut one day and one place in Cook's 94 years seem to embody all the rest, the day in December 1941 when the young sailor from Oklahoma escaped the ship that sent America to war.\n\nSeven decades later, he is one of nine living survivors from the Arizona. His story is always in demand, though he'd just as soon not tell it in front of a lot of people. He remembers all the details and most of what happened later.\n\nAnd he still likes to talk about that other young fellow from Oklahoma, the one who didn't make it home.\n\nWhen he left Morris the first time in 1939 after high school, Cook wasn't sure where he'd end up. Jobs were few, so he set off for Warner, Okla, with the idea of playing football at Connors State Agricultural College.\n\n\"They told me the team was already picked,\" he said. \"I said goodbye and left.\"\n\nHis mother suggested Hills Business College in Oklahoma City. He enrolled, but after a couple of weeks, the noisy streetcars and the police sirens kept him up all night.\n\n\"I went back and told my mother I wasn't going up there anymore,\" he said.\n\nBy April 1940, the Navy seemed like a good idea and by summer, he was on board the Arizona, stationed at Pearl Harbor on the Hawaiian island of Oahu.\n\nHe was assigned a battle station in the No. 3 gun turret. His job was to put the primer in the big 14-inch gun. Other crewmen would roll out the shell, use a mechanical device to ram it in, then load four bags of powder behind it. The primer went in last, before the end of the gun was sealed shut.\n\n\"From down inside, it wasn't too bad when they fired it,\" Cook said. \"It was like a hard jolt.\"\n\nCook made it to his battle station on Dec. 7, 1941, but the Arizona was moored in a cramped harbor and couldn't have fired the big guns even in a prolonged assault. Cook and the other men stayed below deck until the smoke from a fire forced them to leave.\n\nThe bomb that shattered the Arizona's bow exploded as Cook and the others climbed out of the turret. He stepped off the deck into a motor launch as the ship was sinking.\n\nThe next morning, the Arizona was still burning as oil flowed out of her full tanks. No one seemed to be in charge on Ford Island, where Cook had spent the night. He met up with some of the guys from the turret crew and they hopped a boat to shore, where there was a call for volunteers to join the Navy's destroyers.\n\n\"We said we'd volunteer if they'd put two or three of us together on the same ship,\" he said. \"They agreed.\"\n\nCook was assigned to the USS Patterson, then two months later, transferred to the Aylwin, a destroyer that had been moored at Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7 and engaged the bombers as the attack began.\n\nIn February, the Aylwin was part of a U.S. task force preparing for a raid on a Japanese base at Raubal, on the island of New Britain near Australia. Enemy patrol planes spotted the ships and the raid was canceled. As the ships turned around, a squadron of enemy bombers appeared. The ships sent up their own planes and turned back the assault.\n\nIn May 1942, the Aylwin joined a task force in the Coral Sea with the USS Lexington, one of the Navy's early aircraft carriers. On the morning of May 8, the fighting intensified as American aircraft tried to turn back the enemy planes.\n\nJapanese torpedo bombers hit the Lexington and crippled the big ship. Explosions rocked the vessel and fires burned into the evening. The crew was evacuated and another U.S. destroyer scuttled the Lexington to keep the Japanese from capturing her.\n\nYears later, at a reunion in Tucson, Cook learned that one of his buddies from the Arizona had been sent to the Lexington and was in the Coral Sea when the carrier was attacked. He had settled in New Mexico with his family.\n\nCook got the buddy's telephone number and tried to call him. The buddy wasn't home, but his son-in-law answered.\n\n\"Can you tell me what ship did he go on after the Arizona?\" Cook asked.\n\n\"The Lexington,\" the son-in-law said.\n\n\"Was he on it when it sunk?\" Cook asked.\n\n\"Yes, sir, he was.\"\n\nCook never got a chance to catch up with his buddy, but marveled at the connections he seemed to make from his short stint aboard the Arizona.\n\nA month after the Coral Sea battle, Cook's ship was part of the American forces in the critical Battle of Midway. After that, he steamed north to Kodiak, Alaska, where other Navy ships were trying to turn back Japanese inroads throughout the strategically important Aleutian Islands.\n\nBefore the year was out, Cook was sent to gunnery school in Washington, D.C., and to the South Boston Navy Yard, where he joined the new destroyer Pringle on its shakedown cruise.\n\nAbout halfway through the cruise, the Pringle was ordered to accompany the battleship Iowa to Africa, where President Roosevelt was to attend a conference with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill in Morocco.\n\nDuring the conference, the Pringle sailed into the Mediterranean Sea and anchored in a river. One day, some smaller boats sailed past. One of the men started yelling.\n\n\"Is there anybody there from Oklahoma?\"\n\nThere were: Cook and another crewman. The man in the boat was from Muskogee, a town about 40 miles east of Morris.\n\nLonnie and Marietta Cook met in Morris after the war, but the road to their home here today winds thousands of miles across the country.\n\nCook was discharged in 1948 in San Diego and stuck around California, where he worked as a metal finisher at Van Nuys manufacturing plant. That didn't last long and he headed back to Morris, where he met Marietta.\n\nShe likes the story of how they tied the knot. He tries to abbreviate it: \"We went to California and got married.\"\n\n\"Tell them the rest,\" Marietta prompts.\n\n\"She went to California and I followed her,\" Lonnie says.\n\nMarietta shakes her head. \"He called me one night and said if you won't let me come to California, I found a lady who's got a new black Buick and I'm going to move to Texas.\"\n\n\"It was a new Mercury,\" Lonnie says.\n\n\"I said, 'Well, come on, then,'\" Marietta says, and in 1950, they wed.\n\nThat's where the cross-country adventures begin. Cook worked in California, mostly welding jobs, until the union he belonged to called a strike. He headed east and landed in Paducah, Ky. From there, he worked jobs in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland and back to New York, where he welded 20-inch gas lines going through Brooklyn.\n\nHe returned to Oklahoma again and started his own business, outfitting a one-ton Ford pickup with a winch and other equipment that let him work the oil fields. A while later, he and Marietta were on the road again, to a missile base in Sturgess, S.D., to gas lines in Wisconsin and North Dakota.\n\nFinally, they made their way to Salinas, Calif., just inland from Monterey on the central coast. They bought a small ranch and, while Lonnie continued to work welding jobs, they grew walnuts, almonds, peaches, apples, nectarines, cherries and grapes.\n\n\"I canned 500 quarts of fruit one year,\" Marietta says. \"I really miss it.\"\n\nLonnie finally retired from welding in 1982 and in 1994, the Cooks moved back to Morris. Lonnie had taken up trap shooting and hoped to do a little hunting back home. It turned out little was the right word. He hasn't hunted in a while, though he still reloads his own ammunition on a garage workbench.\n\nAfter so many years of travel, the Cooks have settled into a more tranquil pace. They spoil their granddaughters and can now move on to a new great-granddaughter. Once a week, they motor on into Tulsa, where Marietta takes a china painting class and Lonnie wanders the aisles of sporting-goods stores.\n\nOccasionally, they head into Okmulgee for an evening out at the One Fire, a casino operated by the Muscogee (Creek) Nation.\n\nCook has returned to Pearl Harbor three times and he likes the Arizona memorial. It is respectful. He's not so fond of the crowds around Honolulu and doesn't plan to go back.\n\nAs he talks about Pearl Harbor again, other memories surface.\n\nCook was the gun captain on the Pringle at the battle of Iwo Jima in 1945. The ship provided fire support for the Marines going ashore. Cook stood on a shelf in the gun mount with his big binoculars and watched the Marines raise the flag to mark the U.S. victory.\n\nAbout a month later, Japanese suicide bombers sunk the Pringle near Okinawa.\n\nDuring his voyage to Alaska, Cook remembers the flying fish, which stirred up the water like a torpedo wake. That was enough to rattle nerves on board the ship, which was at general quarters every day an hour before sundown and an hour before sunrise.\n\n\"The nights up there were already short, so I didn't get much sleep,\" Cook says. \"That's what I'm catching up now. When she says anything, I tell her I'm catching up from the war.\"\n\nA few years ago, the Cooks attended a fund-raising dinner at a local American Legion post. Cook is invited to such events occasionally and sometimes introduced as an Arizona survivor.\n\nAt this one, he was looking around the room and he saw a picture of a sailor way back in the back, in a setting arranged like a memorial. He squinted and thought about where he was.\n\n\"That must be old Clyde Williams,\" he thought, the Arizona band member killed at Pearl Harbor.\n\nHe walked back there. Sure enough.\n\nIt was Clyde.\n\nROSWELL, N.M.\n\nHis name was Cactus Jack and to his fans in southeastern New Mexico, he was the dulcet-voiced host of Sagebrush Serenade, a program of country music on KSWS radio.\n\nHe was in the studio on Valentine's Day 1955 when a nervous young man walked in. He was the opening act for country superstar Hank Snow that night at the North High School auditorium. He had a record, a new song he was trying out.\n\n\"Would you like to listen to it?\" the young man asked.\n\nJack shrugged. \"Sure, let's see it.\" He put the disc on a turntable and dropped the needle.\n\nWhat he heard wasn't quite country music, but he liked it and he told the kid. Song's got some zip to it, he said. He agreed to play it on his show.\n\nThe song, \"Hound Dog\" and the singer, Elvis Presley, both went over pretty well, the way Cactus Jack remembers it.\n\nFor a lot of people, meeting Elvis and playing one of his first records on the air might sound like one of life's truly unforgettable days. But John Anderson, the Navy chief petty officer who called himself Cactus Jack on the air, had a good head start already.\n\nHe had chased Japanese soldiers along the coast of China three years before America declared war on Japan. In World War II, he fought at Guadalcanal, in the battle of the Coral Sea, at Okinawa and Iwo Jima. He fought cold and hunger on a ship nearly dead in the ocean off Alaska.\n\nAfter the war, he worked as a stuntman for Orson Welles and John Wayne and helped build Alan Ladd's house in the hills outside Hollywood.\n\nAnd he was aboard on Dec. 7, 1941, when the Japanese bombed the USS Arizona at Pearl Harbor, a pivotal moment in history, but one that struck Anderson to his core. There, he lost his twin brother\n\n\"It was a bloody catastrophe, a bloody mess,\" he says. \"I don't think I'll ever forget what I saw that day.\"\n\nAnderson always talks about his brother, Delbert \"Jake\" Anderson, when he tells the story of his own escape from the burning ship.\n\nHe is one of nine living survivors of the Arizona and, at 97, he has amassed a lifetime of unforgettable days.\n\nAnderson grew up in the Red River Valley of northern Minnesota, the son of a prominent local judge. He had five brothers, including Jake, and four sisters, all grouped so close in age that paying for college wasn't practical for their folks.\n\nAs a youngster, Anderson heard stories about the Navy from his uncle, a man named Ray Stokes. Uncle Ray was nearing the end of his career in 1937 when John and Jake both decided to enlist.\n\nJohn was sent from training camp in Illinois to Bremerton, Wash. He was assigned briefly to the Arizona, then to the Saratoga, an aircraft carrier, then, as the Navy tinkered once more with its troop alignment, back to the Arizona.\n\nBefore the big battleship could leave Puget Sound, Anderson volunteered for another mission, joining the small Asiatic Fleet along the coast of China.\n\nAnderson went aboard the USS Edsall, a destroyer that supported various military action at sea and ashore. Japan and China were at war again and America was trying to protect its interests without getting involved in the conflict.\n\n\"We saved people on commercial ships on the seas, we rescued missionaries in the interior of China, we shot up a bunch of pirates,\" Anderson said.\n\nAt Kulangsu, an international settlement on an island off the southern Chinese coast, Anderson's unit ran into the French Foreign Legion, who had been cornered by Japanese soldiers on a high ridge.\n\n\"I'd never seen so many guys with so much guts,\" he said. \"They were holed up behind sandbags, but they never got hit.\"\n\nThe Edsall sailed farther north, then headed to the Philippines, where they played baseball with a group of indigenous Moros, who had fought the United States more than 20 years earlier.\n\n\"We were told to watch out for them, these guys were assassins,\" Anderson said. \"We made friends. We left and never fired a shot at them.\"\n\nIn 1940, Anderson reported to the Arizona once more, joining his brother for the first time since they had enlisted. They would serve together for a little over a year.\n\nThe day after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Anderson volunteered for duty on the Macdonough, a destroyer that downed at least one of the Japanese attack planes on Dec. 7.\n\nThe ship steamed toward the Asiatic Pacific and soon Anderson was chasing Japanese forces again, only this time the United States was at war. This time the objective was clear.\n\nThat summer, the ship joined others for the invasion at Guadalcanal, in the Solomon Islands, one of the first major assaults against Japan by the Americans. The Macdonough stayed until September, then sailed back on patrol in the Pacific.\n\nIn the spring of 1943, the Macdonough headed north toward the Aleutian Islands, where Japan was trying to establish strategic strongholds that could control shipping lanes and thwart allied attacks on the Japanese islands.\n\n\"It was rough weather, foggy, raining cold,\" Anderson said. \"Here we are, we can't see the enemy. We can't see our own ships. Then we got hit.\"\n\nThe Macdonough had collided with another destroyer, the Sicard. The ship was dead in the water. The crew unloaded anything they could do without, to keep the damaged hull above the water line. They knew the oil tanker Tippecanoe was out there, but couldn't see her.\n\nFinally, the tanker spotted the destroyer. Anderson spoke to one of the tanker's crew about towing the Macdonough. The fellow he was talking with recognized Anderson's voice and they realized they had served together on the Yangtze Patrol before Pearl Harbor.\n\nThe tanker towed them to Adak, Alaska, and from there, another ship took the crippled destroyer to San Francisco for repairs.\n\nOver the next year, Anderson would sail across the South Pacific, joining other ships in the American assault on the Marshall Islands, Parry Island and the Palau Islands. The Macdonough pulled picket patrol often, protecting other troops and guarding against kamikaze attacks by Japanese planes.\n\n\"We made so many landings,\" Anderson said. \"We would go in with a landing party or we furnished artillery for the landing force. Sometimes we never landed, but we kept the line, always watching out for kamikazes.\"\n\nOn a fall day in 1945, John Anderson teetered on the base of a church steeple 110 feet above the ground. The steeple clock chimed and a statue of an angel wielding a sword emerged from an alcove and knocked Anderson off the steeple.\n\n\"Cut!\" a director yelled. A stunt coordinator helped pull Anderson from the pile of cigarette crates that had broken his fall. Anderson had finished his first day as a Hollywood stunt man.\n\nThe job wasn't what he expected in September, when he was discharged from the Navy. He had a ticket home to Minnesota, but decided to find a place to stay and come up with a plan.\n\nAs he walked past a bar, still in his Navy uniform, a fellow popped out the door and looked Anderson up and down, checking him out more closely someone would ordinarily.\n\n\"What are you looking at?\" Anderson demanded to know.\n\n\"You,\" the fellow said. \"Are you in the Navy?\"\n\n\"I was,\" Anderson said. \"I just got discharged. The war's over.\"\n\n\"Would you like a job?\" The fellow told him to report to the front gate of Sam Goldwyn's studio in Hollywood on Monday morning. He gave Anderson the name of a contact there.\n\nAnderson decided he had nothing to lose. After an initial run-in with the guard at the gate (\"Three weeks ago, I was shooting at people and killing them and I didn't even know who they were,\" he growled at the guard. \"You I know.\") he met his contact and not long after, he was standing in for Orson Welles in a scene from the movie \"The Stranger.\"\n\nIt turned out most of the regular stuntmen were still in the military. The studios needed tough men who could handle dangerous situations. The job paid $700.\n\n\"Next thing you know, I'm in a movie with John Wayne,\" Anderson says years later. \"I didn't have any speaking parts, but I was working for the studio and they paid me.\"\n\nHe got to know Alan Ladd, who had starred in a series of war movies. When the regular stuntmen returned and the studio cut loose the subs, Ladd hired some of them to work on his house in the Holmby Hills above Los Angeles.\n\nAt nights, Anderson was taking classes in meteorology and electronics, trying to learn skills that could help him stand out among all the returning servicemen and women.\n\nOne day, he stopped for coffee at the Brown Derby restaurant in Hollywood. He felt a tap on his shoulder. He saw Gene LaRocque, a man he'd served with aboard the Macdonough.\n\n\"Are you out of the Navy, Andy?\" LaRocque asked. When Anderson said he was, his old friend was incredulous. \"Andy, you had 12 years of the damnedest fighting I ever saw. You're the bravest man I ever know. You can't leave the Navy.\"\n\nLaRocque took Anderson to San Pedro, where his current ship was anchored. He introduced him to other officers. By the end of the day, had persuaded Anderson to sign up for the Navy Reserve. Put in eight years at least and you'll have a pension, he promised.\n\nAnderson would serve another 23 years before finally retiring once more.\n\nAnderson's road to the radio booth started in Hollywood, with a screen test at a studio where he had worked. He waited for the result. You have a great voice, he was told. Why not try radio?\n\nSo he did. He started on a small station, playing organ music. An administrator at Eastern New Mexico University in Portales, N.M., heard Anderson and talked him into joining the school to help improve its radio station and start a television station.\n\nAnderson picked up and moved to New Mexico. He clashed with the station manager of the radio station and finally quit. Or got fired. Or both. That led to a job in Roswell, the Sagebrush Serenade and Elvis Presley.\n\n\"They played country music because the people here loved that,\" Anderson says. \"Some of the ships I was on had guys who liked to play the guitar, so I knew something about it. The owner said, 'give it a name and say who are. Anything you choose is fine. You're on your own, every day.'\"\n\nAs Cactus Jack, Anderson made a few concessions to his seagoing past.\n\n\"I cleaned up my language,\" he says, admitting he deployed a salty vocabulary, even after leaving active duty. \"In the service, if you didn't use nasty words, you weren't a good sailor.\"\n\nA few years later, a new station owner showed Anderson his plans to start a TV station. He said he wanted Anderson to join the on-air staff. Did he know anything about meteorology?\n\nAnderson smiled. Did he ever. Soon, he became one of the earliest TV weathermen and an evening fixture in Roswell homes, or at least those with televisions.\n\nNot long after he returned to Pearl Harbor near the end of the war, Anderson searched out some of the battle reports from Dec. 7, 1941. He knew his brother hadn't made it off the Arizona alive, but he didn't know much else.\n\nHe found a report by a gunner's mate. The report said most of the guys in the anti-aircraft batteries, where Jake fought, were shot down early in the assault. When the fourth bomb detonated in the powder magazine, anyone left was blown over the side.\n\nAnderson has returned to the Arizona memorial often and has taken his family there. He has met many of his old friends and shipmates. Many have since died.\n\n\"It's always a great thing for me to see them,\" he says. \"That's what I want to remember. The things I don't want to remember was the blood.\"\n\nAlthough he is 97, he decided he couldn't miss a final reunion this year and he bought his tickets early. He wanted one last unforgettable day.\n\nUPDATE: John Anderson died in November 2015, less than a year after this report.\n\nCOLORADO SPRINGS, Colo.\n\n\n\nDonald Stratton completed the paperwork for a concealed weapons permit at the El Paso County Sheriff's Office and approached the counter to submit fingerprints.\n\nHe was still adjusting to his new life in Colorado, hundreds of miles inland from his old home in coastal California and more than a mile higher in elevation. He had turned 90 and was starting over again.\n\nAs he waited, he had a feeling he knew what would happen, but he didn't say anything. A clerk tried to complete the process, normally a routine, if messy, step to secure the permit. She returned, puzzled.\n\nThey were having trouble reading his prints, she told Stratton. It was as if he had none.\n\nStratton hesitated, then confirmed her suspicion. His fingers were almost smooth, lacking all but a few of the swirls that create an identity.\n\nStratton told her why: He had been aboard the USS Arizona when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on Dec 7, 1941. He survived, but was burned badly over two-thirds of his body. Doctors treated him and he recovered, but the his fingers never healed properly.\n\nThe clerks decided they could not send Stratton away without his permit. They found a way to take prints from the edges of his fingers, enough to satisfy the law.\n\nAs he recounts the experience, he rubs his hands together, then holds them out, turning them over. He pushes his shirtsleeves up to show his arms. He motions toward his gnarled ear. He catalogs the scars and their origin.\n\nThey are the marks of a survivor, 73 years on. They are reminders of a moment in time he can never escape, a moment he sees again and again.\n\n\"Through all that, I never did lose consciousness,\" he says. \"I knew everything that was going on.\"\n\nAs the USS Arizona burned and sunk into the harbor, Stratton and five other men had been trapped on an anti-aircraft gun control platform on the ship's foremast, burned in a fireball when below-deck ammunition exploded.\n\nA sailor on the repair ship Vestal, tied up nearby, spotted them and threw them a line. The men, their charred skin peeling away, climbed hand-over-hand across the line to safety.\n\nStratton and other men climbed into a small boat that took them ashore. They still had to climb onto the dock and then into a truck for a short ride to a Navy hospital. The burn ward filled with the injured. The smell of burned skin filled the air. Doctors and nurses wove among gurneys, administering morphine shots and looking for the victims most in need.\n\nWithin a day or two, someone came into the ward and said a few of the wounded would be sent to California. He asked for volunteers.\n\n\"I'll go,\" Stratton said.\n\n\"No,\" the worker said. \"We don't think you'd make it. Maybe next time.\"\n\n\"I want to go anyway,\" Stratton said.\n\n\"Fine,\" the worker said. \"If you can stand up and stay up while we change the linen on this bed, we'll see about it.\"\n\nStratton climbed to his feet and, biting back the pain, he stood and when his bed was ready, he collapsed back into it. By Christmas, he was in a hospital at Mare Island near San Francisco. He stayed there for months. He weighed 92 pounds by the time he was sent to rehabilitation in Corona, Calif. Finally, the Navy gave him a medical discharge.\n\nA year later, he felt better, so he re-enlisted. The Navy wanted to keep him in Idaho, working with new recruits at a boot camp, but he pushed for a seagoing assignment and wound up on the destroyer USS Stack as a gunner's mate.\n\nHe saw action across the South Pacific, patrolled areas where suicide bombers were attacking American destroyers. Once he was awakened by a loud noise and a flash and thought his ship was under attack.\n\nIt wasn't, but the flash was a reminder, as if he needed anything more.\n\nBefore the end of the war, he went to San Diego for gunner's mate school. He finished his training and was discharged in December 1945.\n\nStratton grew up in the tiny prairie town of Red Cloud, Neb., about as far away from an ocean as any place in the country. He joined the Navy because it seemed like a better environment.\n\n\"You either had a nice place aboard a ship and were high and dry or you didn't have anything,\" he reasoned. \"In the Army you were crawling around in the mud and everything else and I didn't want to do that.\"\n\nAfter his second discharge, he knocked around Nebraska again, working in his dad's tavern, then on a beer truck, but he grew bored. He decided to head back to the water. In California, he earned his naval seaman's license and went to work on a drilling rig offshore near Santa Barbara.\n\nHe made bargemaster on a huge drilling rig, but yearned for something more interesting, so he got a job as a tender with a commercial deep sea diving business. As a tender, he stayed on the surface, monitoring the divers working on rigs, piers, pipelines, any piece of seaside or seagoing equipment.\n\nStratton logged thousands of miles of travel. Nicaragua. Chile. Colombia. Kuwait. In Alaska, he helped set up platforms that could keep up with tides that rose and fell as much as 32 feet.\n\nIn his dining room in Colorado Springs, he keeps a replica of a hard diving helmet, the kind his divers used. The face plate is glass and around the bottom are screws that would secure it to the diving suit. Stratton falls easily into the memories of his years on diving boats.\n\n\"We worked with a crane barge capable of lifting 700 tons,\" he sys. \"I motioned to crane operator what we needed, what tools to send down.\" He touches the diving helmet. \"I ran the decompression chamber on jobs. Once, I made a dive in a two-man submarine, down in over 1,200 feet of water off Santa Barbara coast. One of the first people to do that.\"\n\nFor years, Stratton wore the scars from the Arizona without talking about them much. Lots of men brought home scars from World War II and Korea. The offshore diving business could leave its own kind of scars.\n\nIn 1966, 25 years after the attack, Stratton returned to Pearl Harbor with his family. In the waters off Honolulu, he confronted his memories. It was the first time Randy, his son, had seen his father cry.\n\nIn the years after, he became active in survivors' groups and started going back to Pearl Harbor more often. At the USS Arizona memorial, he became friends with a National Park Service historian and inspired a Pearl Harbor action figure that the service sold at the gift shop.\n\nIn time, he felt no anger toward the Japanese, but he couldn't forget what they did. Sometimes, Japanese pilots attended memorial ceremonies and some of the other survivors would shake their hands. Stratton could not.\n\n\"Listen, all those men down there on that ship, a thousand of them, they wouldn't do it and I don't think they'd want me to do it,\" he says. \"We can't forget what happened there that day. We can't let it happen again.\"\n\nA while back, Stratton and his wife Velma retired to Yuma and lived there about 15 years. He played a lot of golf, but missed California. They moved to Santa Maria, not far from Santa Barbara, to be near their oldest son, then to Colorado Springs to be near Randy. They will celebrate 65 years of marriage in April.\n\nThe Stratton men have taken up a more personal cause. He wants to secure a proper medal for Joe George, the sailor from the Vestal who helped rescue the six men from the gunner's control tower.\n\nA lot of people agree that what George did was heroic, but the Navy balks at every step, in part because George disobeyed a direct order.\n\n\"He should have the Navy Cross,\" Stratton says. \"He saved six people's lives. Joe saved six lives and he didn't get crap. He refused to cut the line no matter what. As far he was concerned he was saving lives.\"\n\nIn 1971, Stratton was working long hours with a diving outfit on a nuclear power plant project not far from Santa Barbara. He needed a truck to carry equipment back and forth, so he scouted out a car lot and bought a 1965 Chevrolet pickup.\n\nHe kept the truck, held on to it through repairs, engine overhauls, new paint jobs. It sits today in the carport outside his home. He still tools around town in the truck, but it's a classic now, so he drives it almost as often to car shows.\n\nHe can tell stories about his years with the diving crews, but the truck has evolved into a reminder of another time. The license plate reads USS ARIZ. A mural on a white bed cover depicts the USS Arizona and the memorial that floats above it in Pearl Harbor. It identifies Stratton as a survivor of the attack that sank the ship.\n\nWherever he goes on the pickup, people ask him about his experience. Yes, he'll say, he was on the Arizona and he survived. Yes, a lot of brave men died. Yes, some of them were his friends.\n\nHe still remembers the day he saw the Arizona in dry dock at Bremerton, Wash.\n\n\"It was quite a sight for an old flatlander like me to see a 35,000-ton battleship out of the water,\" he says. \"It was a big ship with a lot of metal, I'll tell you.\" He owns a chunk of the ship's burned deck, a reminder he keeps in a box with a few other items.\n\nOn a recent fall afternoon, Stratton ambles down the driveway and fires up the engine. He eases the truck out of the carport, far enough to show it off. He fiddles with the radio.\n\n\"Randy, come and turn on the music box.\" His son reaches in the cab and queues up one of the hundreds of songs he and his daughter downloaded onto the new MP3 player.\n\n\"Lots of big band songs,\" Randy says, as the first bars of a brass line pour from the speakers. \"The stuff he likes.\"\n\nHow lucky can one guy be?\n\nI kissed her and she kissed me\n\nStratton's eyes brighten. A smile spreads across his face as Dean Martin's voice fills the cab.\n\nLike a fella once said\n\nAin't that a kick in the head?\n\nThe smile widens. Almost imperceptibly, he sways.\n\nWEST WARWICK, R.I.\n\n\n\nThe six men stared straight ahead, almost as if they were back in line, at attention. They listened for their names and their service branch. They stayed composed as their stories were told, stories of bravery, of quick thinking. Stories of survival.\n\nEach of the six men were at Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, when Japanese planes swarmed the Navy fleet in an ambush that would provoke war. On the 70th anniversary of the attack, the men had been brought to the state capitol to receive new honors.\n\nAs each name was read, Rhode Island National Guard Maj. Gen. Kevin McBride presented the man with the Rhode Island Star, one of the state's highest military honors.\n\nWorld War II veterans are a special breed, Lt. Col. Denis Riel said as the men accepted the medals. Without them, Riel said, who knows where we'd be today.\n\nMcBride reached the last man, Raymond Haerry, a 20-year-old coxswain on the day of the assault. Haerry straightened in his seat as his story was told. He had escaped the USS Arizona, the battleship whose losses surpassed any other.\n\nFor Haerry, McBride had a the state's highest military honor, the Rhode Island Cross. Haerry accepted the medal, but found he could not speak. He handed the microphone to his son, Raymond Haerry, Jr., who spoke of his father's courage and resilience.\n\nThree years later, Ray Haerry Jr. holds the cross in his hand, fighting back tears.\n\n\"I hadn't told him he was going to be individually honored that day,\" he says. \"I had to help my father out of his seat. He stood strong and tall right in front of this general. I heard the general say, 'You're a remarkable guy.' I think it was one of the proudest days of my father's life.\"\n\nHis dad has never sought recognition for his service on the Arizona and barely talks about the day of the attack. He will tell his story to people he knows well and trusts, but he is 93 and the details are fading from his memory.\n\nIn 2011, he was one of six Rhode Islanders who had lived through the attack on Pearl Harbor, the only one from the Arizona. Today, he is one of nine remaining survivors from the mighty battleship.\n\n\"I do as much as I can to keep his story alive,\" his son says. \"It's always been my fear that people are going to forget that day, that people are going to forget the sacrifice that was made that day.\"\n\nHaerry ran away from home to join the Navy. He grew up in New Jersey and after high school, enrolled at MIT in Boston. He was smart enough to excel, but started cutting classes not long after the start of his first semester.\n\nHe and a buddy would sneak off campus and hop freight trains to see how far they could get. He missed enough of his classes that he was finally asked to leave. As soon as he turned 18, he enlisted in the Navy.\n\nOn the Arizona, he worked on the deck crew. He cleaned and painted day after day, but he also operated the motor boats used to ferry crew members to shore, a job that let him leave the ship periodically.\n\nHaerry had made two runs to shore on the morning of Dec. 7, 1941. It was Sunday and some of the crewmen with liberty wanted an early start. He was eating breakfast when he heard the first pops of the attack planes strafing Battleship Row.\n\nHe ran to the anti-aircraft battery, his battle station, but there was no ammunition ready. He could see the planes were flying too low for his guns anyway, but before his crew could figure out their next move, an armor-piercing bomb detonated near the powder magazine beneath the No. 2 gun turret.\n\nHaerry felt the entire ship life out of the water. As it fell, he was thrown from the ship into the harbor. He half-swam, half-walked the 70 yards to Ford Island and manned a mounted machine gun. He spent the rest of the day retrieving bodies from the harbor.\n\n\"He remembers body parts in the water, charred burned bodies that he swam by,\" his son Ray, Jr., says. \"Something had happened that no one could comprehend.\"\n\nHaerry sailed on Navy ships through World War II and again during the Korean conflict. He spent long months on a tender, a vessel that carries equipment, parts and other supplies for ships at sea.\n\nOn one mission, Haerry's tender was tied to a larger ship as the crew delivered supplies and completed maintenance tasks. The sky began to darken and the wind grew. A storm was approaching, a big one by the looks of it.\n\nThe tender didn't want to be tied to the larger ship when the worst of the storm blew through. High winds could slam one ship into the other and sink one or both of the vessels.\n\nHaerry held the rope that connected the ships as another crewman swung an ax to cut it. As the boat heaved, the man with the ax missed and hit Haerry's hand, nearly severing it from his wrist. He did not reach a hospital for several days, but doctors still saved his hand.\n\nA year after World War II ended, Haerry went home for a while and married a girl he'd met not long before. He and Evelyn had their first son, Ray, Jr., in 1947.\n\nFor a while, the young family lived in Puerto Rico as Haerry, now a chief boatswain's mate, drew new assignments aboard his tender.\n\n\"He was out to sea nine months out of the year, only home for three months,\" Ray Jr. says. \"He was very military by then, very disciplined.\"\n\nAfter he returned from Korea, Haerry was promoted to master chief petty officer, signifying his experience and level of service. He had turned down a promotion to ensign, preferring the camaraderie of the enlisted ranks.\n\nAt his request, he was assigned to the officer candidate school in Newport, R.I. He left home at 5 every morning and took a ferry from Jamestown to the Navy base. He liked teaching and liked the chance to instill discipline.\n\n\"I've gotten letters from some of the officer candidates who had my father as an instructor,\" Ray Jr. says. \"They said he was a tough bastard, but that's exactly what they needed.\"\n\nHis service on the Arizona also seemed to give him added credibility among the young sailors. They respected a guy who survived such a horrific attack.\n\nThere was a tradition at the end of training that the graduates would give the chief a silver dollar. Haerry would come home on those days with cigar boxes full of the coins.\n\nFor a long time, Haerry never talked about his experiences at Pearl Harbor. He displayed no pictures, kept no mementos that his family knew about. He would answer questions, but in short bursts of description, with no emotion.\n\n\"The only people he would talk to were either very close friends or relatives,\" his son says. \"He'd always have to be prompted.\"\n\nIt took Ray Jr. years, decades to piece together his father's story. He would draw out snippets and stash them away, collecting them until he would weave the barest narrative.\n\nAs anniversaries of the attack passed, Ray Jr. would asked his dad if he wanted to visit the USS Arizona memorial at Pearl Harbor.\n\nNope. He wanted to part of it. He's never been back.\n\n\"I can understand that,\" Ray Jr. says. \"To go through that to me is incomprehensible. Nobody was expecting anything like that.\"\n\nHis dad will return finally at his death. Ray Jr. has arranged for his father's remains to be interred in the sunken Arizona, an honor accorded any of the sailors or Marines who survived the attack.\n\nThree years ago, Ray Jr. received a call from a lieutenant colonel in the Rhode Island National Guard. He told Ray about the plans to honor Pearl Harbor survivors at the statehouse. One of the survivors would receive the Rhode Island Cross.\n\nAs they talked, Ray mentioned that his dad had been aboard the Arizona. That caught the lieutenant colonel's interest. He called back a few days later.\n\n\"We found our guy,\" he told Ray Jr.\n\nFive years ago, Haerry moved into a nursing home, He stays in a room on the second floor. Thickets of tangled shrubs and rows of trees are visible from his window.\n\nThe nurse who checks in on him regularly likes Haerry. She prods him to move around more and to leave the room for meals. He has told her about his escape from the Arizona.\n\nRay Jr. seems surprised. \"He told you the story?\" She nods and smiles.\n\nHaerry accepts the chocolate bars his son has brought him. He likes chocolate and is disappointed if Ray Jr. forgets it. There are a few personal photos on the table, but nothing from his years in the Navy.\n\nExcept the cap. The USS Arizona ballcap that almost every survivor owns and wears.\n\nHe doesn't want to answer questions about his war service, shrugging them off or insisting he can't remember the details anymore. But he clutches the cap and puts it on as he sits in an easy chair by the window.\n\n\"These guys were the first heroes of the war, even though the war hasn't been declared,\" Ray Jr. says. \"I think my dad was one of the first American heroes of World War II.\"\n\nHe and his father chat a little. Haerry says he wants lunch delivered to his room, but the nurse says no. You need the exercise. Haerry nods and like a good sailor taking orders from the chief, he pulls himself up with a walker and shuffles off to lunch.\n\nYUBA CITY, Calif.\n\nJoe Langdell found a table in the wardroom of one of the ships moored in Pearl Harbor and sat down with his breakfast.\n\nThree days had passed since Japanese bombers had punched a fiery hole in the Navy's Pacific fleet. Three days since the war started.\n\nCrippled ships still floated around the mooring posts along Ford Island. Repair crews were already at work on the battleships that had survived. Salvage work would begin soon on others. Sailors found food and shelter wherever they could.\n\nLangdell's ship, the USS Arizona, lay dead in the water where she sank 14 minutes into the attack. The mast and towers near the bow tilted at a sickening angle. Fire had blackened much of the structure still visible.\n\nLangdell heard someone enter the room.\n\n\"Are there any officers from the Arizona here?\" he said.\n\nLangdell was an ensign, an entry-level officer, not yet a year in the Navy. He was nervous about volunteering for anything, but he raised his hand.\n\nThe man walked over and looked at Langdell's name tag.\n\n\"Mr. Langdell,\" he said, \"when you're done with your breakfast, you'll report to the pier and you'll be met by a motor whale boat and a party of 20 enlisted men with sheets and pillow cases.\"\n\nWhat is this? Langdell thought.\n\n\"You will go to the Arizona and you will take off all the bodies and body parts above the water line,\" the man said. \"Cover the decks, anywhere you can find them up to the top of the masts.\"\n\n\"So that's what we did,\" he says, staring out at the harbor nearly seven decades later.\n\nLangdell is one of the last nine survivors from the Arizona. At 100, he is the oldest.\n\nHe was on Ford Island when the Japanese attacked, training for new assignment. His own battle station was beneath the gun turret shattered by the last bomb to hit the Arizona. From the shore, he helped wounded men from the water, men whose bodies had been torn apart by bombs and bullets and fire.\n\nBut he could not be prepared for what he found on the charred hulk of the battleship. He still will not talk about it. His younger son believes the experience changed his dad forever.\n\n\"How could it not?\" the son wonders.\n\nLangdell says only this: \"It took two days to take all the bodies. We carefully wrapped them in sheets. The body parts we put in pillow cases. We swept the decks and took the small bones. Everything was taken ashore and properly taken care of.\"\n\nLangdell arrived at Pearl Harbor along a different path than many of the young sailors, who signed up for the service because they were unable to find work as civilians.\n\nBorn in 1914, seven months after the first bolts were tightened on a new battleship in Brooklyn, Langdell grew up wooded agricultural area along the Souhegan River in southern New Hampshire.\n\nHis dad operated a livery stable and a small dairy and later earned money as an auctioneer. The family sold maple syrup distilled from the trees on their farm.\n\nAfter high school, Langdell enrolled at Boston University, working nights to pay for his classes, and in 1938, he earned a degree in business administration. He went to work as a junior accountant for a prominent Boston firm.\n\nBut he became restless. He signed up for a Navy program that allowed college graduates to attend officer candidate school and emerge as ensigns within three months. By early 1941, Langdell was one of the \"90-day wonders\" and drew his first assignment: The USS Arizona.\n\nAfter Pearl Harbor, Langdell asked for a posting on one of the new destroyers the Navy was set to launch. He was soon aboard the USS Frazier, which left the shipyard at San Francisco in July 1942.\n\nThe Frazier patrolled the South Pacific at first, but in early 1943, steamed northward toward Alaska, where Japan was trying to secure positions in the Aleutian Islands.\n\nOne day in May, crewmen spotted two periscopes in the water and the Frazier opened fire. The guns hit the periscope. Using its sonar equipment, the ship fired depth charges and eventually sank the enemy submarine.\n\nToward the end the war, Langdell was stationed in the Philippines, at a base in Manila. Among his responsibilities was overseeing the naval officers' clubs in the area.\n\nOne morning, he was at his desk, catching up on paperwork, when he heard a vehicle screech to a halt outside. A young sailor ran in, out of breath.\n\n\"Mr. Langdell, Mr. Langdell, you've got to come here quick,\" he said.\n\n\"What is it?\" Langdell asked.\n\n\"It's easier if you come see it,\" the sailor said.\n\nThey hopped in a Jeep and head up the hill toward one of the Quonset huts, the one where liquor for the officers' clubs was stored. As they walked toward it, Langdell reeled at an odor. Alcohol.\n\nInside, he found broken bottles scattered in a soggy soup of booze and cardboard. Someone had stacked the boxes too high and in the humid environment of the island, the cardboard had grown damp and weak.\n\nThe boxes had collapsed.\n\nLangdell was discharged at the war's end and returned to Massachusetts, where his wife, Libby, waited.\n\nJoe had met Elizabeth McGauhy in Chicago half a decade earlier. He was attending midshipman's school at Northwestern University. She was attending an art academy to learn dress designing. They met at a dance at the YWCA on North State Street.\n\nThey danced. They went out for coffee afterward. They continued to see each other and, when Langdell left for Hawaii, they corresponded, often.\n\nAs he prepared for his new posting on the Frazier, Langdell decided to make a move. He asked his brother, Ted, to visit Libby and see if she could cook. The report: Oh, yes, she can cook.\n\nJoe proposed and Libby accepted. They would be married in San Francisco, before the Frazier set sail. The only question was how Langdell would send Libby word about his arrival from Pearl Harbor. The Navy censors would never allow such information in a letter.\n\nLangdell knew Libby was friends with a skater in the Ice Follies, which was summering in San Francisco. He wrote Libby a letter and suggested it would be a good idea if Libby visited her friend on or about a particular date. Libby got the message.\n\nThey were married in an Episcopal Church on Van Ness Avenue. Langdell had borrowed a car, a Dusenburg, for the honeymoon. Libby had arranged stays north of the city. Friends told them when the left the church, keep the water on their left.\n\nWhat they didn't count on was the side-street parking. Langdell took a right turn instead of a left and the newlyweds didn't realize their mistake until they stopped for gas in Gilroy, about 80 miles south of San Francisco.\n\nThe Langdells ended up honeymooning in Monterey and Carmel on the central California coast.\n\nAfter the war, Langdell returned to the family auction business in Massachusetts, but after all those years in Hawaii, the Philippines and in the tropical South Seas, he couldn't readjust to the cold. He and Libby moved west to Walnut Creek east of San Francisco.\n\nThey eventually bought a home-furnishings outlet farther inland and finally built their own store in Yuba City, north of Sacramento. They ran Joe and Libby Langdell's Village Mart for more than 20 years until they retired.\n\nOccasionally, they would close the store and hook a 33-foot trailer to a pick-up truck. They traveled around the country, meeting up with other USS Arizona survivors, with shipmates from the Frazier. Keeping the memories alive.\n\nLangdell returned to Pearl Harbor in 1976. His oldest son had joined the Navy and his first posting was aboard the USS Ouellet, a frigate. The family visited the Arizona memorial and toured other sites near the harbor.\n\nBefore the trip, Langdell hadn't talked much about his years in the war, about his time on the Arizona. Afterward, Langdell sought out other survivors who had formed reunion organizations. He was active in those groups for many years, serving as president of one devoted to the Arizona.\n\nAs the 50th anniversary of the attack neared, Langdell got a call from a documentary filmmaker. He wanted to interview Langdell for his project. He was also interviewing a Japanese pilot named Zenji Abe, a pilot who had taken part in the raid on Pearl Harbor in 1941. Would Langdell agree to meet Abe on film?\n\nThe two men not only met, they took a boat to the USS Arizona memorial and laid a wreath in front of the wall with the names of the crewmen who died on the ship.\n\nIn the documentary, \"The Life and Death of a Lady,\" Langdell and Abe speak, side by side on the memorial. Abe offered condolences and said he prayed that all their souls were at peace.\n\nLangdell said much more.\n\n\"It is only by the grace of God that I stand here today,\" he said. \"I witnessed your attack from Ford Island. Helpless, I watched your bomb sink the Arizona in nine minutes.\"\n\nSentiment ran high against the Japanese, he said, but also against U.S. leaders whose decisions many questioned in the aftermath. He acknowledged the wreath.\n\n\"I appreciate your thoughtfulness. It took more courage on your part to present this wreath than it did for me to accept it.\"\n\nIn 2006, Langdell walked along the steep shoreline of Ford Island, the Arizona memorial in the background. He told his story as his son, Ted, recorded it on video.\n\n\"The lesson I've learned from that experience is that the 1,177 men entombed on the ship right now will never know the love of a wife or the joy of grandchildren,\" he said. \"It's just not going to happen. We all have to remember that they did not die in vain.\"\n\nOn Oct. 12, Langdell celebrated his 100th birthday with with his older son, John, who flew in from Spearfish, S.D. On Veteran's Day, he participated once more in a parade through Marysville, the next town over from Yuba City. But he doesn't tell his story anymore, not on his own.\n\nLangdell lives now in a skilled nursing center. He has trouble remembering the past. He struggles to speak at times (though when he's feeling good, he likes to flirt with the nurses). He sits in his wheelchair as his son recites the narrative, keeping his father's story alive.\n\nPhotographs hang on the walls of his room. His wife, Libby, who died two years ago. His kids and grandkids. Pictures of past parades. A framed painting of the Arizona, the repair ship Vestal next to it.\n\nHe likes to wear a cap that identifies him as a veteran of the Arizona.\n\n\"Why do you like the hat, dad?\" Ted asks.\n\n\"It acknowledges to people that I'm a survivor,\" Joe replies, his voice soft. \"The hat represents the Arizona.\n\nTed asks him about the ship.\n\n\"The Arizona was a fighting battleship,\" Joe says. \"One of the last ones…\" He talks about going aboard the Frazier.\n\nLangdell will return to the Arizona once more. When he dies, his remains will be interred under the No. 4 gun turret, with the men who died there and survivors who had died since.\n\nA final tribute.\n\nUPDATE: Joe Langdell died in February 2015, months after this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/12/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/18/china/china-eastern-crash-wsj-report-inlt-hnk/index.html", "title": "China Eastern plane crash: Black box data suggests plane ...", "text": "Hong Kong CNN —\n\nBlack box data recovered from a China Eastern flight that crashed in March suggests someone in the cockpit intentionally downed the plane, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing a preliminary assessment from United States officials.\n\nThe Boeing 737-800 was flying from Kunming to Guangzhou when it nosedived from 29,000 feet mid air into the mountains, killing all 132 passengers and crew on board. It was China’s deadliest air disaster in decades.\n\nInformation extracted from the plane’s damaged flight-data recorder shows human input orders to the controls sent the plane into its deadly dive, according to the Journal, citing people familiar with the probe.\n\n“The plane did what it was told to do by someone in the cockpit,” the Journal quoted a person who is familiar with American officials’ preliminary assessment as saying.\n\nThe plane’s flight-data recorder and cockpit voice recorder were recovered from the crash and sent to the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in Washington DC for analysis, Chinese state media earlier.\n\nAmerican officials involved in the investigation are focusing on the actions of a pilot, the Journal reported, adding that it is also possible that someone else on the plane could have broken into the cockpit and deliberately caused the crash.\n\nChinese investigators have not revealed any mechanical or technical problems with the aircraft that could have caused the crash and might require further action across the industry – as is typical in such events – a fact American officials believe lends credibility to their assessment, the journal reported.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) and China Eastern Airlines for comment.\n\nIn a statement to the Journal, China Eastern said no evidence has emerged that could determine whether or not there were problems with the aircraft involved in the accident. The airline told the Journal that the pilots’ health and family conditions were good, and added that their financial status was also in good shape.\n\n“Any unofficial speculation may interfere with the accident investigation and affect the real progress of the global air transport industry,” the airline told the Journal.\n\nOn Wednesday, China’s state-run newspaper the Global Times cited a statement from the CAAC, which said it had reached out to the NTSB investigators who denied “releasing information on the investigation to any media outlets.”\n\nAccording to the Global Times, the CAAC said the investigation is ongoing in a “scientific and rigorous” manner, and pledged to release “timely and accurate” updates.\n\nIn a summary of its preliminary report released on April 20, the CAAC said the two black boxes were “severely damaged” and “the data restoration and analysis work is still in progress.”\n\nThe report said the flight crew and maintenance personnel “met the relevant standards” and there were no items on board that had been declared as dangerous goods, nor were there any forecasts of dangerous weather.\n\nBefore the plane deviated from the cruising altitude, the radio communications between the crew and the air traffic control department did not show any abnormality, according to the report.\n\nRumors about a copilot intentionally crashing the plane had circulated widely on China’s internet by early April, with some pointing to the CAAC’s remarks on the mental health of aviation staff following the crash.\n\nAt a meeting on aviation safety on April 6, CAAC director Feng Zhenglin urged Communist Party officials at all levels to “stabilize the thoughts of their teams, make utmost efforts to solve employees’ problems in their work, life and study, and ensure their physical and mental health.”\n\n“In particular, officials should do their best in the ideological work of pilots to lay a solid foundation for the front line to operate safely,” Feng said.\n\nThe speculations about pilot suicide causing the crash have previously prompted the CAAC to issue a denial. “These rumors…have seriously misled the public and interfered with the investigation of the accident,” Wu Shijie, a CAAC official, told a press conference on April 11, adding that police were carrying out investigations to hold the rumor mongers responsible.", "authors": ["Nectar Gan"], "publish_date": "2022/05/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/memphis200/2019/04/17/memphis-bicentennial-history-trivia/3301701002/", "title": "Memphis Bicentennial: Here are 200 Bluff City historical facts", "text": "Memphis — the city established on the bluffs of the Mississippi River and named after an ancient capital on the Nile delta — turns 200 this year.\n\nIn recognition of this bicentennial, here are 200 markers along the road of history that led to the present day.\n\nThe events cited range from the comic to the tragic, from the risible to the world-shaking, from the all-but-forgotten to the never-to-be-forgotten.

Planned as a grid of streets along the river, the city is named for a former great river town, the ancient capital of Egypt.\n\n2. Progress was slow. \"From its founding in 1819 until about 1840, Memphis was a primitive and pestilential little mudhole striving to survive as a town.\" — John E. Harkins, \"Metropolis of the American Nile,\" 1982.\n\n3. The city's founding came 270 years after the first Memphis-area encounter between American Indians and Europeans, led by Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto. Both France and Spain would build forts on the \"Chickasaw bluffs\" in the 18th century.\n\n4. Memphis' first grand jury indictment arrives in 1820, when Patrick Meagher is charged with two counts of assault and battery after indulging in too much \"fire water\" and brawling with bartenders. His fine: $2.\n\n5. 1826: Encouraged by Memphis Mayor Marcus Winchester, Davy Crockett is elected to the U.S House of Representatives, representing Tennessee's 9th Congressional District — the seat (with very different boundaries) later held by Harold Ford and Steve Cohen.\n\n6. Memphis' oldest noise ordinance, from 1827, prohibits \"whooping, halloo-ing and swearing loudly,\" punishable by a $5 fine — or $10, if the offense occurs on a Sunday.\n\n7. In Memphis, traffic problems predate automobiles: An 1837 law makes driving a horse-drawn conveyance \"faster than a trot\" punishable by a $10 fine.\n\n8. April 21, 1841: Henry Van Pelt publishes the first issue of The Appeal. The paper later merges or buys out the Monitor, the Western Mercury and the Avalanche; in 1894, it is renamed The Commercial Appeal.\n\n9. 1848: Free public school opens.\n\n10. 1851: Nathan Bedford Forrest moves to Memphis and opens a slave trading company, one of a dozen in the city during the decade.\n\n11. March 15, 1851: Memphians pay an astronomical $20 per ticket to see Jenny Lind, the so-called \"Swedish Nightingale,\" perform at Odd Fellows Hall. Her manager for the tour: P.T. Barnum.\n\n12. 1852: Construction of St. Peter's Catholic Church begins.\n\n13. 1853: The first synagogue in Tennessee, B'nai Israel, is established by Jewish German immigrants. In 1943 it adopts its current name: Temple Israel.\n\n14. July 15, 1853: Elmwood Cemetery opens for business, so to speak, when the late Mrs. R.B. Berry is laid to rest as its first occupant. The 75,000 interred since then have included slaves, suffragists, yellow fever victims and author Shelby Foote.\n\n15. \"May God bless Memphis, the noblest city on the face of the earth.” — Mark Twain, in an 1858 letter to his sister, after visiting the Memphis hospital where his brother Henry was taken after a steamboat explosion that took \"hundreds of lives.\"\n\n16. June 6, 1862: The Mississippi River churns as Union gunboats defeat Confederate naval forces at the first Battle of Memphis.\n\n17. Also June 6, 1862: To avoid \"Yankee\" takeover, the presses and plates of the pro-Confederacy newspaper, The Appeal, are loaded into a boxcar and moved to Grenada, Mississippi, where the newspaper resumes publication. Keeping one step ahead of Union confiscators, The Appeal later journeys to Jackson, Mississippi; Meridian, Mississippi; Atlanta; Montgomery, Alabama; and Columbus, Georgia.\n\n18. Aug. 21, 1864: Nathan Bedford Forrest's troops raid the Union-occupied city but ultimately withdraw; this incursion becomes known as the second Battle of Memphis.\n\n19. Bright kid, promising future: In 1865, 18-year-old Thomas Edison works as a telegraph operator in Memphis.\n\n20. April 27, 1865: The greatest maritime disaster in U.S. history occurs on the Mississippi River at Memphis when the boilers of the overloaded Sultana explode. Close to 1,800 of the 2,400 people aboard the 260-foot wooden steamboat are killed or drowned (about 50 more than will be lost in the sinking of the Titanic). The boat's legal capacity was 376.\n\n21. Forty-six black people and two white people are killed when white civilians and police officers rampage through black neighborhoods for two days of mob violence, May 1-3, 1866. The event becomes known as the \"Memphis Massacre.\"\n\n22. 1869: The foundation stone is laid for Beale Street Baptist Church (also known as First Baptist Church — Beale Street), a congregation organized by freed slaves.\n\n23. The city's oldest degree-granting collegiate institution, Christian Brothers University, is established in 1871 (as Christian Brothers College) by members of a Catholic congregation founded by France's St. Jean-Baptiste de La Salle, the patron saint for \"teachers of youth.\"\n\n24. 1875: Walter Burke Sr. opens the original Burke's Book Store at 180 N Main. Now located at 936 Cooper, the store has remained independent and Memphis-owned ever since.\n\n25. Jan. 15, 1877, becomes known as \"The Day It Rained Snakes.\" According to newspaper reports that inspired an investigation by Scientific American, a \"torrential downpour\" left behind great numbers of snakes in the area of Vance and Lauderdale. The Monthly Weather Review reported the snakes were dark brown or black and \"very thick in some places, being tangled together like a mass of thread or yarn.\" Whether the reptiles were driven from subterranean hiding places or deposited on the Bluff City via some sort of storm-driven snakenado remains a mystery.\n\n26. Aug. 13, 1878: Restaurant owner Kate Bionda becomes the city's first recorded victim of yellow fever, having contracted the disease from a man who had escaped a quarantined steamboat. She would be followed by close to 5,000 others by the end of the year, as the epidemic devastates the city.\n\n27. One of the most significant figures to ever call this city home, former slave Ida B. Wells moves to Memphis in 1882 at the age of 20. A few years later, she launches her anti-lynching campaign through her newspaper, the Memphis Free Speech and Headlight.\n\n28. Wells makes an international reputation: \"Miss Ida B. Wells is a negress, a young lady of little more than twenty years of age, a graceful, sweet-faced, intelligent, courageous girl. She hails from Memphis, Tenn. She is not going back there just now, because the white people are anxious to hang her up by the neck in the market place, and burn the soles of her feet, and gouge her beautiful dark eyes out with red-hot irons.'' — The London Sun, 1894.\n\n29. An estimated 50 men, women and children, are killed on March 30, 1882, when a broken lantern causes a fire aboard the steamer Golden City, as the boat is about to dock. According to a newspaper account, the \"howls of a burning menagerie ... mingled with shrieks of women and children.\"\n\n30. 1887: Artesian well water becomes available for the first time, establishing Memphis as a city with notably pure drinking water.\n\n31. On Oct. 15, 1887, Grover Cleveland becomes the first president to visit Memphis while in office. Thousands lined the streets (and were infiltrated by gangs of pickpockets, according to The Commercial Appeal), but the joy gives way to shock when a prominent local citizen, Judge Henry T. Ellett, grandly introduces the 24th president of the United States and then promptly drops dead on stage. The newspaper calls it “one of the saddest incidents that ever characterized a gala occasion,\" and offers this recounting: \"Judge Ellett was placed upon the platform, his shoes removed, and all that mortal effort and medical science could suggest applied to bring resuscitation. It was useless, his spirit had fled.\"\n\n32. A Memphis community designed expressly for black residents, Orange Mound — named for the area's many Osage orange trees — begins to be developed in 1890, on former plantation property. For much of its history, the neighborhood is said to represent the largest concentration of African Americans outside of Harlem.\n\n33. Feb. 23, 1892: \"Tomboy\" Alice Mitchell, 19, uses her father's razor blade to cut the throat of her former Higbee School for Young Ladies classmate, Freda Ward, 17; the sensational murder trial that follows exposes what the one newspaper calls \"the Perverted Affection of One Girl for Another.\" Alice — who apparently had dreamed of dressing as a man and marrying Freda — is sentenced to what was then called the Western State Hospital for the Insane in Bolivar, Tennessee.\n\n34. The city's first public library, the Cossitt Library, opens on April 12, 1893. However, a public campaign for donations is necessary to stock its shelves with books.\n\n35. Memphis' first skyscraper, the 10-story Porter Building at 10 N. Main, is constructed in 1895.\n\n36. A May 1901 reunion of Confederate troops ends with a parade of 15,000 veterans, according to The Commercial Appeal. \"Never before in the history of Memphis were the people so enthused as they were yesterday,\" the newspaper reported, while also praising \"the survivors of the most superb soldiery that ever bore a part in making world's history.\"\n\n37. In about 1901, Natch the black bear — who over a century later would be weirdly reimagined as NBA mascot Grizz’s chief romantic rival — is put on display in Overton Park, stoking the public interest that results in the April 1906 founding of the Memphis Zoo. Natch, who lived chained to a tree, is poisoned by a bruincidal maniac in 1906; his head is removed, stuffed and put on display at the zoo, but reportedly is petted and hugged so often by the Natch-loving public that it literally falls to pieces.\n\n38. Prohibition advocate Carrie Nation, notorious for attacking bars and taverns with her signature hatchet, makes the rounds of several Memphis saloons on Oct. 23, 1902. Although she \"dashed to the floor a glass of liquor just as a thirsty person was turning it down his throat,\" according to The Commercial Appeal, she delivered tongue-lashings and temperance lectures instead of her so-called \"hatchetations.\"\n\n39. 1906: One of Memphis' most influential citizens, Robert R. Church, known as the South's first African American millionaire, becomes founding president of Solvent Savings Banks, Memphis' first \"black\" bank, vital to the development of black-owned business.\n\n40. Marion Scudder Griffin in 1907 becomes the first woman to be granted a license to practice law in Tennessee; then, in 1923, she is the first woman elected to the state legislature. She practices law in Memphis for 40 years.\n\n41. The nation's largest Pentecostal denomination, the Church of God in Christ is organized by \"disfellowshipped\" black Baptist preachers and formally incorporated during a 1907 meeting in Memphis. The church's founding bishop is a Memphis advocate of Holy Ghost-inspired \"speaking in tongues,\" Charles Harrison Mason.\n\n42. The city's first speed limit is instituted in 1910. It is 8 mph.\n\n43. Edward Hull Crump is elected mayor of Memphis in 1909. He serves only one full term but he nevertheless essentially runs the city until the mid-1950s, as was known throughout the nation. In 1946, he appears on the cover of Time, identified as \"Memphis' Boss Crump.\"\n\n44. The Memphis Zoo begins to establish its reputation as the \"Hippo Capital\" of America with the 1914 arrival of its first hippopotamuses, Venus and Adonis. Enthusiastic parents, the proud pachyderms produce 16 calves.\n\n45. In 1914, the LeMoyne Normal and Commercial School — which traces its origins to a movement to provide education for free black people and runaway slaves — relocates to the Walker Avenue address where it remains, now greatly expanded and known as LeMoyne-Owen College.\n\n46. 1916: The Memphis Brooks Museum of Art opens in Overton Park.\n\n47. \"I'd rather be here/ Than anywhere I know.\" — W.C. Handy, 1916, \"The Beale Street Blues.\"\n\n48. Clarence Saunders, Part 1: A Virginia-born grocer who moved to Memphis in 1904, Saunders creates the self-service grocery store when the first Piggly Wiggly opens at 79 Jefferson Ave. on Sept. 11, 1916.\n\n49. In December 1919, the city fire department auctions off its 37 horses to make way for motorized vehicles. The horses, according to newspaper accounts, have full names: Among the veteran hay-burners to find buyers are Charlie Fitz, Mike Haggerty and Mike Fitzmorris.\n\n50. In 1923, The Commercial Appeal is awarded the Pulitzer Prize for public service for \"the publication of cartoons and the handling of news in reference to the operations of the Ku Klux Klan.'' Leading the charge in the newspaper's battles with the Klan are editor C.P.J. Mooney and cartoonist J.P. Alley.\n\n51. May 8, 1925: Immortalized as \"a very worthy Negro\" on an obelisk in the park that bears his name, 39-year-old levee worker Tom Lee — who could not swim — makes four trips in his small skiff, the Zev, to rescue 32 of the 72 people in danger of drowning in the swift currents of the Mississippi after the 1925 sinking of the M.E. Norman, a steamboat. Lee's effort remains Memphis' most famous act of heroism.\n\n52. \"The Mississippi Delta begins in the lobby of the Peabody Hotel,\" journalist David Cohn wrote in 1935. And that lobby has been at 149 Union Avenue since Sept. 1, 1925, when \"The South's Grand Hotel\" reopened at its second and still current location.\n\n53. Founded in Clarksville in 1848 as the Masonic University of Tennessee, the school that in 1984 would become known as Rhodes College relocates to Memphis in 1925.\n\n54. Operating out of a Midtown house on Poplar Avenue, infamous black market baby trafficker Georgia Tann makes millions selling thousands of infants from the 1920s until her death in 1950, which preceded the public revelation of her scam. Tann used pressure tactics and legal threats to dupe single mothers into giving up their babies, which she sold to wealthy or desperate couples through her \"adoption\" agency.\n\n55. Billed as one of the largest stores in the U.S., the Crosstown neighborhood Sears-Roebuck opens on Aug. 27, 1927, attracting a crowd of 2,000 before its art-deco doors are even unlocked. Closed and empty by 1993, the gargantuan building is re-imagined and redeveloped as the Crosstown Concourse \"vertical village\" of apartments and businesses, which has its grand opening Aug. 19, 2017.\n\n56. 1927: Lloyd T. Binford is appointed head of the Memphis Censor Board; he reigns as America's most inflexible, eccentric and subjective censor until 1955, banning movies with Charlie Chaplin (\"a London guttersnipe\") and Ingrid Bergman (due to her \"notorious adultery\"), and penning the types of condemnations that transformed the targets of his ire into instant must-sees. Banning David O. Selznick's \"Duel in the Sun\" in 1947, Binford wrote: \"It is sadism at its deepest level. It is the fleshpots of Pharaoh, modernized and filled to overflowing. It is a barbaric symphony of passion and hatred, spilling from a blood-tinted screen. It is mental and physical putrefaction.\"\n\n57. Aviator Charles Lindbergh, 25, visits Memphis in October 1927, some five months after his solo flight across the Atlantic makes him one of the world's most celebrated men. Reports The Commercial Appeal: \"A tousle-haired boy, slender and shy, weighted down with plaudits of nations and tired of it all, captured the heart of Memphis yesterday with a simple smile as his only weapon.\"\n\n58. Welcome Wagon, a company that attempts to connect new homeowners with local stores and businesses, is launched by Memphis entrepreneur Thomas Briggs in 1928. Now a \"direct marketing\" company based in Coral Springs, Florida, Welcome Wagon in the days before TV and social media employed gift basket-bearing \"hostesses\" who made home visits.\n\n59. \"I left Memphis to spread the news/ Memphis women don't wear no shoes\" — Furry Lewis, \"Kassie Jones Part 2,\" 1928.\n\n60. Filmed in and around Memphis in 1928, King Vidor's classic \"Hallelujah\" — the story of a sharecropper and a seductress — is one of the first major-studio films with an all-black cast. Released by MGM in 1929, the movie earned Vidor a Best Director Oscar nomination.\n\n61. Clarence Saunders, Part 2: Now known as the Memphis Pink Palace Museum and Planetarium (or \"Pink Palace,\" for short), the \"Memphis Museum of Natural History and Industrial Arts\" opened in 1930 in a Georgia pink marble mansion on Central Avenue that Saunders built in the 1920s. The city acquired the property after Saunders went bankrupt.\n\n62. Insurance statistician Frederick L. Hoffman on March 20, 1930, issues a report declaring Memphis the murder capital of America, based on the 1929 homicide rate. Memphians object, pointing out that Chicago, for example, had hosted the \"St. Valentine's Day Massacre\" that same year.\n\n63. 1932: Duck decoys placed in the ornate Italian marble fountain of The Peabody prove so popular that the hotel institutes a tradition of live ducks in the lobby. Edward D. Pembroke becomes \"duckmaster\" in 1940 and keeps the job until 1991, ensuring that the chatty mallards — who waddle the elevator-to-fountain red carpet twice daily — remain Memphis' most popular runway models.\n\n64. The bootlegging and kidnapping gangster career of former Central High School student George \"Machine Gun\" Kelly comes to an end when the FBI's first Public Enemy No. 1 is arrested on Sept. 26, 1933, at 1408 Rayner. Also arrested: Kelly's \"Titian-tressed\" (to quote The Commercial Appeal) wife, Kathryn.\n\n65. Ice Ice Baby: According to \"Memphis: A Folk History,\" by Linton Weeks, the \"first wedding between two people encased in ice'' occurs during the 1935 Cotton Carnival when a pair of circus performers — Freezo, the Human Polar Bear, and Ginger, the Guillotine Girl — are sealed in cakes of ice with microphones that allow them to broadcast \"I-I-I d-d-d-do.\"\n\n66. A globe-trotting Indiana Jones of the 1920s and '30s whose adventures spellbound millions of newspaper readers, Memphian Richard Halliburton (namesake of Halliburton Tower on the Rhodes College campus) disappears in 1939 while attempting to cross the Pacific Ocean in a Chinese junk.\n\n67. 1934: Written by local political leader George Washington Lee, \"Beale Street: Where the Blues Began\" becomes the first book by a black author to be a Book-of-the-Month Club selection.\n\n68. 1937: The Goldsmith's department store on Main Street becomes one of the first major Memphis stores to adopt \"all-the-year-round air-conditioning,\" in the form of an old-school refrigeration system installed by an ice company.\n\n69. 1939: Memphis Light, Gas and Water is born after the city purchases a private electrical system, to augment its 37-years-earlier purchase of a private water delivery system.\n\n70. 1940: Struggling entertainer Amos Muzyad Yakhoob Kairouz — known professionally as Danny Thomas — enters a church in Detroit, falls to his knees, and prays \"specifically\" to St. Jude Thaddeus. \"If he was supposed to be the saint of the hopeless, that certainly included me,\" Thomas wrote in his autobiography. \"I blurted out those words, 'Help me to find my way in life, and I'll build you a shrine.'\" Twenty-two years later, Thomas — by then a top TV and nightclub star — founds St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, which becomes the world's leading institute in the battle against childhood cancer.\n\n71. The notorious \"Goat Gland Doctor,\" John Romulus Brinkley, earns a fortune and international fame by transplanting the testicular glands of goats into the testicule sacs of men, to restore the recipient's \"potency.\" Buried in Forest Hill Cemetery, Brinkley lives much of his life in Memphis, but performs most of his quackery in Kansas; he is bankrupted by lawsuits a few years before his 1941 death.\n\n72. Named by pilot Robert K. Morgan for his Memphis sweetheart, Margaret Polk, the Memphis Belle — a B17 \"Flying Fortress\" bomber — completes 25 combat missions from 1942 to 1943, becoming one of the most celebrated airplanes of World War II.\n\n73. WDIA AM-1070 begins broadcasting on June 7, 1947. After the success of Nat D. Williams' \"Tan Town Jubilee\" show aimed at black listeners in 1948, WDIA abandons country and pop and switches entirely to programming aimed at black audiences, hosted by black on-air personalities. It soon becomes Memphis' top radio station, with a staff of disc jockeys that includes B.B. King and Rufus Thomas.\n\n74. A decade after TV came to New York, it arrives in Memphis when WMC — then co-owned by The Commercial Appeal — signs on the air on Dec. 11, 1948. After an hour of test patterns, dedications, political proclamations and backstage tours, the \"entertainment\" programming begins with Santa Claus, live on the air, reading letters from kids. WHBQ-TV Channel 13 followed in 1953, then WREC-TV (now WREG) Channel 3 in 1956.\n\n75. Memphis businessman Kemmons Wilson opens the first Holiday Inn — a single-story motor court — in August 1952, at 4925 Summer. The name is inspired by the title of the 1942 Bing Crosby movie that introduced the song \"White Christmas.\" In 1965, the growing chain introduces a centralized reservation system, and by 1968 Wilson is operating 1,000 Holiday Inns across America. A 1972 Time magazine cover story labels Wilson \"The Man with 300,000 Beds.\"\n\n76. Broadcasting at \"1,000 Beautiful Watts,\" radio station WHER AM-1430 — \"The First All-Girl-Radio-Station in the World\" — goes on the air in October 1955, from a South Third studio dubbed \"The Doll Den,\" decorated with nylon stockings draped over clotheslines. The station is the creation of two of Memphis' most famed innovators: Sun founder Sam Phillips and Holiday Inn founder Kemmons Wilson.\n\n77. A mere satellite compared to the nuclear furnace of Sun, Cordell Jackson's Moon Records label in 1956 releases Jackson's double-sided holiday single, \"Rock and Roll Christmas,\" backed by \"Beboppers' Christmas.\" The latter song contains perhaps the most memorable introduction of St. Nick since Clement Moore's: \"He had white fuzz all over his chin/ He came boppin' up and said, 'Give me some skin.'\"\n\n78. Reviewing Elvis' acting debut in \"Love Me Tender\" in 1956, an unimpressed Time magazine critic wrote: \"Is it a sausage? It is certainly smooth and damp-looking, but who ever heard of a 172-pound sausage, 6 feet tall? Is it a Walt Disney goldfish? It has the same sort of big, soft beautiful eyes and curly lashes, but who ever heard of a goldfish with sideburns?\"\n\n79. Known for his black outfits, Bogart sneer and prowess with a bullwhip, movie cowboy Lash LaRue is arrested for buying and concealing stolen property — sewing machines — in connection with car thefts that occur while he is a \"Wild West\" performer at the 1956 Mid-South Fair. Acquitted of the charges, LaRue returns to Memphis frequently in the 1970s and '80s as a guest of the nostalgia-oriented Memphis Film Festival. Said one organizer: \"Occasionally, when things would be a little bit dead in the dealers' room, he would break out the whip.''\n\n80. A prime example of 1950s Polynesian exotica, the Luau restaurant opens at 3135 Poplar in February 1959. The Memphis Press-Scimitar lauded the establishment for its tiki statuary, war clubs, stuffed sharks and waterfall entrance, \"with a banyan tree rising toward the roof, dotted with coral and giant clam shells.\"\n\n81. Jan. 13, 1960: Striking a body blow against the establishment, professional wrestler Sputnik Monroe is arrested on a disorderly conduct charge for what an officer describes as the crime of \"drinking in a negro cafe with negros,\" according to The Commercial Appeal. In what the judge said was \"the first time he can recall that a white man was represented in City Court by a negro attorney,\" Sputnik's lawyer was Russell B. Sugarmon Jr., the future General Sessions judge. Sputnik was fined $26.\n\n82. Easter Sunday 1960: In a dramatic blaze that old-timers still talk about, fire destroys Russwood Park, the mostly wooden ballpark built in 1896 at 916 Madison Ave. that was home to the Memphis Chicks minor league baseball team.\n\n83. \"I've never been to Chicago/ They say it's a mighty fine place/ I never could get past Tennessee with Mississippi all over my face\" — Johnny Cash, \"Going to Memphis,\" 1960.\n\n84. Sculpted by Leone Tommasi and cast in Florence, Italy (and not in Handy's hometown of Florence, Alabama), a bronze statue of W.C. Handy, the \"Father of the Blues,\" is erected near Beale Street in 1960, two years after the Memphis composer's death.\n\n85. \"4 City Schools Are Integrated — Order Reigns.\" That's the front-page headline in The Commercial Appeal on Oct. 4, 1961, after 13 black first-graders are enrolled in four previously all-white elementary schools. Some 200 police officers are assigned to the schools for the week; but what broke out, according to the newspaper, was not trouble but games of Farmer-in-the-Dell and Drop-the-Handkerchief.\n\n86. Hosted by \"your monster of ceremonies,\" Sivad (Malco marketing maven Watson Davis), WHBQ-TV’s horror movie program “Fantastic Features” debuts on Sept 29, 1962, with “The Giant Behemoth” (1959), about a resurrected radioactive dinosaur that terrorizes London. Wildly successful, the show lasts 10 years, ending with the \"Us\"-anticipating “The Human Duplicators” (1962).\n\n87. Its striking modern design by Memphis architect Roy Harrover now partially obscured by an ugly parking garage, the current Memphis International Airport terminal opens on June 7, 1963.\n\n88. In perhaps the greatest convergence of talent since the Million Dollar Quartet, the 1963 Mid-South Fair brings the Three Stooges — Moe, Larry and Curly-Joe — and three of the Beverly Hillbillies — Granny (Irene Ryan), Jethro (Max Baer) and Elly May (Donna Douglas) — to Memphis for sold-out shows on consecutive days in the rodeo arena.\n\n89. A beloved and seemingly ubiquitous harbinger of summer from the 1960s through the mid-1970s, the Memphis-born circular ice-cream delivery vehicle known as the \"Merrymobile\" roams the streets at a puttering 15 mph, making it easy prey for loose change-wielding, popsicle-craving urchins. During its late-1960s heyday, the Merrymobile company operates dozens of the iconic vehicles, which — with their striped canopy roofs — resemble circus tents or fairground carousels on wheels.\n\n90. On Christmas Eve 1963, Memphis earns the distinction of being the coldest spot in the nation when the city records a temperature of 13 degrees below zero; this remains the record low for Memphis.\n\n91. Killed in a Viet Cong ambush, Army Sgt. 1st Class Jesse Alexander Gray is the first of an estimated 214 Memphis and Shelby County casualties of the Vietnam War. Gray is honored during a city ceremony on July 29, 1964.\n\n92. The $3.7-million city-built Memphis Memorial Stadium — later renamed Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium — opens in 1965 as the home football field for the Tigers (who previously played at Crump Stadium). The first rock band to play there is Three Dog Night, in 1972, with opening act Black Oak Arkansas; subsequent concert headliners include the Rolling Stones, Van Halen, Paul McCartney and U2.\n\n93. Calling himself \"Mr. Magic,\" WMC-TV Channel 5 \"weather man\" Dick Williams in 1965 debuts \"Magicland,\" a weekly program for kids that showcases his talents as an illusionist and prestidigitator. The program ends in 1989 after some 1,200 episodes, making it TV's longest-running magic show, according to the Guinness Book of World Records.\n\n94. 1966: The city's first enclosed shopping mall, Southland Mall, opens on Shelby Drive in Whitehaven. It is followed by Raleigh Springs Mall (1971); the Mall of Memphis and Hickory Ridge Mall (both 1981); and Oak Court Mall (1988), among others.\n\n95. According to the Memphis Press-Scimitar, the Beatles hope to begin recording tracks for their \"Revolver\" album at Stax on April 9, 1966, but the plans are scuttled due to security concerns.\n\n96. Now the city's last remaining open-air cinema, Malco's ballyhooed two-screen Summer Drive-In opens on Sept. 1, 1966, with \"23 Acres - No Dust, No Gravel or Mud\" (according to newspaper advertisements). Opening night movies include \"The Glass Bottom Boat,\" with Doris Day, and \"How to Stuff a Wild Bikini.\"\n\n97. 1967: Inspired by Oakland's Black Panthers, young Memphis militants organize a \"black power\" group called the Invaders. The moniker is inspired by the ABC science-fiction series of the same name, which depicts the infiltration of America by humanoid aliens. Said Invaders leader Coby Smith: \"The kind of things we were talking about were as alien to our communities as if somebody had brought in these ideas from outer space.\"\n\n98. Legendary lawman Buford Pusser is rushed to Baptist Hospital here after being shot in McNairy County during an April 12, 1967, ambush in which his wife, Pauline, is killed. Pusser, the McNairy County sheriff known for his one-man campaign against moonshine, prostitution and illegal gambling, was the inspiration for the movie \"Walking Tall.\" He survived the ambush but died in a 1974 car accident while returning home from a Memphis news conference where it was announced he would play himself in a sequel.\n\n99. On Feb. 1, 1968, sanitation workers Echol Cole and Robert Walker are crushed to death in a garbage compactor while taking shelter from the rain. The deaths help inspire the strike that will bring Dr Martin Luther King Jr. to Memphis.\n\n100. Feb. 12, 1968: Some 1,375 city workers do not show up for their jobs, launching the sanitation strike.\n\n101. Strike news took second place to weather news when a storm dropped 17.3 inches of snow — the second heaviest snowfall on record — on Memphis from March 21 to 23, 1968.\n\n102. Mitchell High School student Larry Payne is fatally shot in the stomach by police officer Leslie Dean Jones on March 28, 1968, in the aftermath of a demonstration led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in support of striking sanitation workers.

Willis and Benjamin L. Hooks in partnership with Jackson and the Minnie Pearl's Chicken franchise company. The union of white country and black gospel vocalists was intended to \"set an example of racial partnership\" in the wake of King's assassination, according to publicity, but both chains folded, in part because a major investor was financially embattled Tennessee gubernatorial candidate John Jay Hooker.\n\n107. About a dozen Memphis and Shelby County library titles — including \"Valley of the Dolls,\" \"Myra Breckenridge\" and \"Portnoy's Complaint\" — are placed off limits to readers under 18 in the summer of 1969 after Mayor Henry Loeb attended a library board meeting and \"shooed all women out of the room and read aloud passages he had underlined in red ink\" from \"Portnoy,\" according to The Commercial Appeal. Asked one board member: \"Is this book fit for women to read?\" After the newspaper's story appears, demand for \"Portnoy\" increases so much that the library orders 10 extra copies to join the five already in circulation.\n\n108. According to a report in The Commercial Appeal, Memphians on July 20, 1969, are so engrossed by the Apollo 11 moon landing that for a period of seven minutes water pressure rises so high from lack of usage that MLGW is forced to shut down all five main pumping stations.\n\n109.

Visionary Memphis State University theater director Keith Kennedy courts controversy and causes a sensation in March 1970 by staging a student production of Broadway's Age-of-Aquarius \"tribal love-rock\" musical, \"Hair\" — the first licensed production outside New York.

May 21, 1970: Inspired by the new availability of liquor-by-the-drink, Memphis investors open the first Friday's restaurant and bar outside of New York, spurring what would become the Overton Square-centered nightlife explosion of the next two decades. (The location currently is occupied by Babalu, a Mexican restaurant.)\n\n113. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Memphis is founded on June 20, 1970. Prior to that decision by Pope Paul VI, the entire state of Tennessee had been encompassed by the Diocese of Nashville.\n\n114. 1971: Outraged by the use of nude models and an exhibition of nude photography at Memphis College of Art (then known as the Academy of Art), brick mason Newton C. Estes kidnaps the 14-year-old son of art instructor Richard Batey, in order to force the school to remove the offending pictures. College officials quickly comply, and the boy is released unharmed two hours later.\n\n115. March 1971: In a victory for the citizens who organized to fight plans to extend Interstate 40 through Overton Park, the U.S. Supreme Court overturns decisions by district and appellate courts and rules that the federal Secretary of Transportation had failed to demonstrate the lack of “feasible and prudent” alternatives to the park route, as required by a 1966 highway bill intended to protect public spaces. The decision preserves the park.\n\n116. June 7, 1971: After years in Ellis Auditorium, professional wrestling relocates to the Mid-South Coliseum, attracting 9,253 fans for opening-night matches showcasing such suplex superstars as Tojo Yamamoto, Bearcat Brown, the Fabulous Moolah, Len Rossi and Sputnik Monroe.

April 20, 1972: U.S. District Judge Robert McRae Jr. orders the Memphis Board of Education to implement a desegregation plan that will require the busing of an estimated 13,789 students during the following school year.

In what comes to be regarded as a revolutionary moment in the history of photography, an exhibit of color work by William Eggleston goes on display on May 24, 1976, at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, establishing the Memphis photographer as arguably the Bluff City's most influential artist outside the realm of music.\n\n125. Nov. 23, 1976: A pistol-toting and inebriated Jerry Lee Lewis is arrested after pulling up to the gates of Graceland in a new Lincoln Continental and demanding to see Elvis.

Hooks of Memphis becomes national executive director of the NAACP.\n\n127. Jan. 15, 1977: Three months after hitting No. 1 with his novelty dance hit \"Disco Duck,\" Memphis deejay Rick Dees — recording as \"Rick Dees and His Cast of Idiots\" — releases a follow-up single, \"Dis-Gorilla.\" Even an appearance on \"The Brady Bunch Hour\" that finds Dees introduced by the kids from \"What's Happening!!\" and performing in front of a pair of swinging King Kong arms couldn't lift the song above No. 56 on the Billboard pop charts.\n\n128. The Memphis in May International Festival is organized in 1977. The first \"honored country\" is Japan.\n\n129. Out of office less than five months, former president Gerald Ford sinks a hole-in-one during the June 1977 pro-am portion of the Danny Thomas Memphis Classic golf tournament at Colonial Country Club.

It comes as an ugly shock.\" The next month, police also go on strike.\n\n134. 1979: Adrian Rogers, senior pastor at Bellevue Baptist Church, is elected to the first of the three terms he will serve as president of the Southern Baptist Convention.

Organized by a coalition of bar owners, restaurateurs and devotees of blarney that calls itself \"Irish Eyes of Memphis,\" the St. Patrick's Day \"pub crawl\" reaches its bacchanalian height (or depth) in 1982, when an estimated 50,000 revelers stagger from Main Street to Overton Square in search of green-dyed beer. Legal fees and other complications eventually reduce the event to its current manageable form, a parade on Beale.\n\n146. 1982: The Mud Island river park opens to the public, complete with concert amphitheater and monorail transportation between the park and the \"mainland.\" Its most impressive aspect may be its \"Riverwalk,\" a scale reproduction of the 954 miles of the lower Mississippi River, with \"every sandbar, oxbow, and topographic contour faithfully reproduced in cement,\" according to Roadside America. Starting at \"Cairo, Illinois,\" the Riverwalk ends at a \"Gulf of Mexico\" that for several embarrassing years was rebranded as a Budweiser-sponsored water park named \"Bud Boogie Beach.\"\n\n147. When the New York Metropolitan Opera brings a touring performance of \"Macbeth\" that features a topless witch to the Auditorium North Hall on May 10, 1983, a group calling itself MASH — Memphians Against Social Harassment — stage a \"strip-in\" to protest the unequal enforcement of the city's anti-nudity ordinance. When the witch appears onstage, MASH members in the audience — mostly dancers at \"adult\" nightclubs — remove their tops. The ordinance later is declared unconstitutional.\n\n148. \"Memphis — A Diamond in the Bluff'\" is the winning entry in a 1983 contest to pick a slogan for Memphis, sponsored by The Commercial Appeal and the Rotary Club.

Jan. 7, 1984: Restored to its former glory, The Orpheum — Main Street's historic \"palace\" of a theater — reopens with a public \"Champagne and Gershwin\" party. A harbinger of Downtown's revival, the theater was built in 1928, on the site of the Grand Opera House, which had burned to the ground in 1923.\n\n152. The bizarre and \"epic\" (in the characterization of The Commercial Appeal) Georgian Hills Day Care child sex abuse scandal dominates much of the news from 1984 to 1988 and results in the indictments of four adult workers in connection with the alleged molestations of at least 19 children. Eventually, all charges are dropped and the one conviction overturned, due in part to the implausibility of much of the testimony of the child witnesses (one boy said child victims were \"baptized to the devil\"). The investigation is now regarded as a textbook case of 1980s \"satanic panic.\"\n\n153. Sept. 5, 1986: In a predecessor to the current \"Mighty Lights\" display, the \"M\"-shaped structure of the Hernando de Soto Bridge (still referred to as \"the new bridge,\" if you're old) is illuminated with 200 sodium lights, following a fundraising campaign by fashion designer Pat Kerr Tigrett and developer Henry Turley.\n\n154. \"After we moved to Memphis, I don't recall Mother's ever once saying: 'A gentleman must always' do so and so. Or: 'A lady will never' do so and so ... The old delicate balance between her wild nature and her strict Presbyterian, genteel upbringing was gone in Memphis ... When we were all in the doldrums, she more than once said: 'I sometimes think a shooting in the family would have been better than a move to Memphis.'\" — Peter Taylor, \"A Summons to Memphis,\" which wins the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1987.\n\n155. 1988: Michael Hooks becomes the first black candidate elected to countywide office when he wins the race for assessor.\n\n156. 1989: Self-promoting promoter Sidney Shlenker makes a deal to take over Mud Island, announcing plans to convert the river park to a $100 million entertainment complex called \"Rakapolis,\" a name intended to suggest ancient Egypt and modern rock 'n' roll. Rakapolis was to come complete with a huge crystal sphinx, a \"time machine\" ride and a re-created Egyptian village. Shlenker — who already had the contract to manage the then-under-construction Pyramid arena — predicts 3 million visitors a year. For some reason, people believe him. Eventually, local government has to sue to regain control of the attractions.\n\n157. Commodities trader Charles D. McVean invests about $8 million into the development of a new type of \"horse\" racing: indoor Hackney pony races with remote-controlled robots for jockeys, the reins attached to the robots' tiny metal arms. \"You put 10,000 people in here with a six-pack of beer apiece, and then by God you've got something!\" McVean told the Wall Street Journal, during a test run at the Fairgrounds in 1989. The state Racing Commission rejects the idea.\n\n158. Memphians are all shook up when the news media hypes \"self-proclaimed climatologist\" Dr. Iben Browning's prediction that a major earthquake will rock the New Madrid Fault on Dec. 3, 1990. When the much-feared date arrives, Memphis fails to shake, rattle, or even roll, at least tectonically.\n\n159. Writing in his book \"Rythm Oil\" in 1991, Stanley Booth sticks up for the Bluff City when confronted by skeptics: \"I told them that in this century, Memphis, Tennessee, had changed the lives of more people than any other city in the world. I used, I regret to report, the phrase 'cultural influence' ... I never had a chance to tell them that, like it or not, they had shopped at supermarkets, eaten at drive-in restaurants, slept in Holiday Inns, and heard the blues because people in Memphis had found ways to convert these things into groceries.\"\n\n160. July 4, 1991: Constructed around the Lorraine Motel, where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, the National Civil Rights Museum is dedicated. It opens to the public in September 1991.\n\n161. Oct. 4, 1991: Former city schools superintendent W.W. Herenton is elected mayor, defeating incumbent Dick Hackett by 172 votes out of about 250,000 cast. (Proving joke candidates can make a difference, Robert \"Prince Mongo\" Hodges, who claimed to be a resident of a planet named Zambodia, received 2,921 votes.) The city's first elected black mayor, Herenton will be elected to five terms; he resigns in 2009 to pursue an unsuccessful bid for Congress.\n\n162. Memphis' distinctive Pyramid arena opens with a concert on Nov. 9, 1991. The headliners? The mother-and-daughter country act, the Judds.\n\n163. On Nov. 16, 1991, patrons burst like scalded cats from the doors of the Madison Avenue punk club, the Antenna, when shock rocker GG Allin lived up to his reputation and began flinging his own feces into the crowd. The cover charge: $5.\n\n164. \"They left Chickasaw Gardens and drove west with the traffic toward downtown, into the fading sun ... The warm, sticky, humid Memphis summer air settled in with the dark. Softball fields came to life as teams of fat men with tight polyester pants and lime-green and fluorescent-yellow shirts laid chalk lines and prepared to do battle. Cars full of teenagers crowded into fast-food joints to drink beer and gossip and check out the opposite sex.\" — John Grisham, \"The Firm,\" 1991.\n\n165. Lionel Linder, 60, editor of The Commercial Appeal since 1988, is killed in a 1992 New Year's Eve accident on Union Avenue when a drunk driver plows into his car. Linder spearheaded the campaign to bring President George H.W. Bush to Memphis in 1989 for an event on the newspaper's lawn, where Bush designated The CA as the first \"Point of Light\" in a program honoring the nation's volunteers.\n\n166. \"In his prime, he was one of the three greatest jazz pianists of all time,\" wrote critic Leonard Feather. He was Phineas Newborn Jr., whose classic albums include \"A World of Piano!\" (1961) and \"The Newborn Touch\" (1964). He is found dead of natural causes at his Memphis home on May 26, 1989, at the age of 57.\n\n167. 1992: \"Several visitors to a zoo exhibit called 'Dinosaurs Live!' asked for refunds after discovering that dinosaurs ceased to roam the Earth 65 million years ago,\" the newspaper reports, in a story about zoo patrons who expected to find real live dinosaurs when they attended an exhibit that actually featured motorized mechanical replica dinosaurs. \"People have watched too much Fred Flintstone,\" says zoo vice president Ann Ball.\n\n168. Artist Carroll Cloar, 79, who had been suffering from cancer, dies of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on April 10, 1993. In The Commercial Appeal, critic Fredric Koeppel writes that the Arkansas-born Cloar \"drew on memories of rural life to compose canvases whose realism was tempered with touches of whimsy, folklore and mystery.\" Many of Cloar's paintings are on display at the Memphis Brooks Museum of Art.\n\n169. Feb. 11, 1994: Memphians wake to the warzone-like cracks of explosive timber after the region is blanketed by a devastating ice storm that snaps trees — at least one person is killed by a falling limb — and cuts power to close to 425,000 MLGW customers, some of whom are without electricity for 17 days.\n\n170. On April 7, 1994, the crew of a Federal Express DC10 flight leaving Memphis overpowers a hammer-wielding company employee and safely lands the plane after a hijacking-suicide attempt by Auburn Calloway, 42, a pilot facing termination for falsifying his job application. Calloway is sentenced to life terms for attempted murder and attempted air piracy; he said he planned to crash the aircraft so his family could collect his $2.5 million life insurance policy.\n\n171. On July 1, 1994, Memphis State University becomes the University of Memphis — the fifth name change since its founding in 1912 as the West Tennessee Normal School.\n\n172. Longtime WHBQ-TV kiddie-show host and toy store impresario Harold \"Happy Hal\" Miller, 74, dies on Nov. 28, 1997. From the 1950s to 1973, Miller was Memphis' answer to \"Captain Kangaroo\"; his hand-puppet sidekick was the blue-hued and taxonomically indeterminate \"Lil' Bow,\" described by Miller in a 1988 interview as a bow-tie-wearing \"cross between a mouse and a chipmunk-type thing.\"\n\n173. In 1998, University of Memphis student Kelly Chandler hangs a sheet on the wall of The Edge coffee shop in Cooper-Young and hosts a group of local filmmakers, who project their work on the sheet. This is the humble origin of what is now the region's largest film event, the Indie Memphis Film Festival.\n\n174. Downtown's gem of a baseball diamond, AutoZone Park, opens on April 1, 2000, with an exhibition game between the Memphis Redbirds and the St. Louis Cardinals.

Ben Affleck, Michael Jordan and Donald Trump are among the 15,327 who reportedly attend the Mike Tyson-Lennox Lewis heavyweight boxing match at the Pyramid on June 8, 2002. Lewis knocks out Tyson in the 8th round in what at the time was the highest-grossing event in pay-per-view history.\n\n177. In 2002, former Shelby County Public Defender A C Wharton is elected the first black mayor of Shelby County. In 2009, he is elected the 63rd mayor of Memphis, but he loses his 2015 re-election bid to Jim Strickland.\n\n178. During Elvis Week 2002, Sun Records founder Sam Phillips, then at the height of his leonine majesty, sits atop the base of a large upwardly tilted silver \"rocket\" ship during the Elvis Beale Street parade. The suggestion that this man is the literal father of rock 'n' roll is hard to miss.\n\n179. Nicknamed \"Hurricane Elvis,\" the most damaging wind storm in Memphis history strikes on July 22, 2003, toppling trees and telephone poles, cutting service to 340,000 homes and businesses, and introducing Memphians to the term \"derecho,\" which refers to a type of devastating straight-line wind.\n\n180. After some five years of planning, the $250 million FedExForum opens to the public with a Sept. 6, 2004, \"open house.\"\n\n181.

A movie about a North Memphis hustler who \"dares to dream the pimpossible dream\" (to quote Time magazine), Craig Brewer's future Oscar-winner \"Hustle & Flow\" has its Memphis premiere at the now vanished Muvico Peabody Place 22 on July 6, 2005. Police report that some 6,000 \"well-behaved\" fans crowd the red carpet to see such celebrities as Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson; producer John Singleton; members of Three 6 Mafia; Brewer (“resplendent” in a Girbaud denim suit, gold Versace sunglasses, straw cowboy hat and a 3-carat diamond ring that had belonged to Sam Phillips); and — incongruously — martial-arts star Steven Seagal.\n\n183. In a spectacular blast that attracts hundreds of spectators, the 50-year-old Baptist Memorial Hospital on Union Avenue — where Elvis was declared dead, among other historic happenstances — is razed at 6:45 a.m. on Nov. 6, 2005, by the controlled detonations of 600 pounds of explosives placed on six of the building's 21 stories.\n\n184. March 5, 2006: Thirty-four years after Stax legend Isaac Hayes earned an Oscar in the same category for \"Theme from Shaft,\" Memphis hip-hop artists Jordan Houston (Juicy J), Paul Beauregard (DJ Paul) and Cedric Coleman (Frayser Boy) win the Academy Award for Best Original Song for \"It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp,\" their contribution to writer-director Craig Brewer's made-in-Memphis \"Hustle & Flow.\"\n\n185. Graceland is known for celebrity visitors, but on July 1, 2006, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi visits Elvis' home in the company of President George W.

An off-course manatee appears on Oct. 24, 2006, in Wolf River Harbor, some 720 miles north of its usual coastal habitat.

April 9, 2011: Funeral services are held for former University of Memphis basketball player and coach Larry Finch, 60, arguably the most significant sports figure in local history.

May 23, 2015: The Memphis in May Sunset Symphony ends its 39-year annual run at Tom Lee Park. The event was perhaps best known for its 17 years of “Ol' Man River,” the \"Showboat\" tune that was a centerpiece of the symphony until the 1998 retirement of James Hyter, the sonorous-voiced singer who each year led thousands of riverside revelers in multiple singalong encores.\n\n194. In association with nationwide actions organized by Black Lives Matter in response to the police killings of black civilians, almost a thousand protesters shut down the Interstate 40 bridge over the Mississippi River for close to four hours on July 10, 2016.\n\n195.

A source familiar with the dinner confirmed to CNN that Trump on Tuesday met with Fuentes and West, who became engulfed in controversy after repeating antisemitic conspiracy theories and making other offensive claims during an appearance on a podcast in October.\n\nThe source said that Fuentes was a guest of West, who attended the dinner along with Karen Giorno, who ran Trump’s 2016 Florida campaign, and another unidentified man. The group feasted on a Thanksgiving dinner for roughly two hours at Trump’s outdoor patio table.\n\nTrump was engaged with Fuentes and found him “very interesting,” the source said, particularly Fuentes’ abilities to rattle off statistics and data, and his familiarity with Trump world.\n\nDuring the dinner, Fuentes told Trump that he was familiar with “Trump’s base,” which preferred Trump being natural and himself, speaking off the cuff and ad-libbing. Trump said that his advisers don’t like that, and want him reading from the teleprompter.\n\nAt one point during the dinner, Trump declared that he “liked” Fuentes.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback GOP governor calls Trump's dinner with a Holocaust denier and Kanye West 'very troubling' 02:21 - Source: CNN\n\nAccording to the source, the dinner grew tense at various times, including after West asked Trump to join his 2024 campaign ticket for president as vice president, which Trump “laughed off.” The source could not pinpoint the exact moment the former president’s mood shifted.\n\nTrump acknowledged the dinner in a post on Truth Social Friday stating: “This past week, Kanye West called me to have dinner at Mar-a-Lago. Shortly thereafter, he unexpectedly showed up with three of his friends, whom I knew nothing about. We had dinner on Tuesday evening with many members present on the back patio. The dinner was quick and uneventful. They then left for the airport.”\n\nTrump repeated later Friday that he “didn’t know” Fuentes and had offered West business as well as political advice.\n\n“I told him he should definitely not run for President, ‘any voters you may have should vote for TRUMP,’” the former president wrote on Truth Social. “Anyway, we got along great, he expressed no anti-Semitism, & I appreciated all of the nice things he said about me on ‘Tucker Carlson.’”\n\nThe White House on Friday condemned Fuentes’ appearance at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Former GOP lawmaker identifies 'larger problem' after Trump's dinner 02:15 - Source: CNN\n\n“Bigotry, hate, and antisemitism have absolutely no place in America - including at Mar-A-Lago. Holocaust denial is repugnant and dangerous, and it must be forcefully condemned,” White House spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement to CNN.\n\nDavid Friedman, Trump’s former Ambassador to Israel, also condemned the former president’s association with West and Fuentes.\n\n“To my friend Donald Trump, you are better than this. Even a social visit from an antisemite like Kanye West and human scum like Nick Fuentes is unacceptable. I urge you to throw those bums out, disavow them and relegate them to the dustbin of history where they belong,” he said in a pair of tweets Friday afternoon. “Antisemites deserve no quarter among American leaders, right or left.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Kanye West's Hitler 'obsession' helped create hostile work environment, source says 03:25 - Source: CNN\n\nWest’s recent antisemitic remarks caused companies that he was affiliated with – including Adidas and Balenciaga – to sever their relationships with him. He has made numerous inflammatory statements over the years, including assertions that slavery was a “choice” and “racism is a dated concept.”\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League has identified Fuentes as a White supremacist and he has been banned from most major social media platforms for his White nationalist rhetoric. Fuentes was present on the grounds of the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, and he has promoted Trump’s unsubstantiated claims about fraud in the 2020 election. The House select committee investigating the events of January 6 issued a subpoena to Fuentes in January.\n\nWest tweeted late Tuesday night that he had kept Trump waiting during his first visit to Mar-a-Lago due to rain and traffic.

But in posts on his social media platform, Trump has argued that he had declassified all of the documents in his possession.\n\n“Number one, it was all declassified,” he wrote in a post on August 12. “Lucky I Declassified!” he wrote in a post this Wednesday.\n\nTrump’s comments about this supposed declassification have been very vague. But conservative writer John Solomon, one of the people Trump named as a representative in his dealings with the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), was more specific in a Fox appearance on August 12. Solomon read a statement, which he said was from Trump’s office, claiming that Trump “had a standing order…that documents removed from the Oval Office and taken to the residence were deemed to be declassified the moment he removed them.”\n\nFacts First: Trump and his team have not provided any proof that Trump actually conducted some sort of broad declassification of the documents that ended up at Mar-a-Lago – and, so far, his lawyers notably have not argued in their court filings that Trump did so. Eighteen former top Trump administration officials, including two former White House chiefs of staff who spoke on the record, told CNN in August that they never heard of a standing Trump declassification order when they were serving in the administration and that they now believe the claim is false. The former officials used words like “ludicrous,” “ridiculous” and “bullsh*t.”\n\n“Total nonsense,” said one person who served as a senior White House official. “If that’s true, where is the order with his signature on it? If that were the case, there would have been tremendous pushback from the Intel Community and DoD, which would almost certainly have become known to Intel and Armed Services Committees on the Hill.”\n\nIt’s important to note that the laws under which the Justice Department is now investigating possible crimes – statutes about the willful retention of national defense information, obstruction of a federal investigation, and the concealment or removal of government records – do not require documents to be classified for a crime to have been committed. (A grand jury subpoena in May and the search warrant in August both sought documents with “classification markings,” not specifically documents that are currently classified.) Also, there would be major questions about the legal validity of any broad “standing order” to automatically declassify any document Trump carried out of a certain room.\n\nBut first things first: Trump has shown no corroboration for the claim that he did issue such an order.\n\nThe Justice Department said in the court filing this week that Trump’s representatives never asserted that documents had been declassified either when they voluntarily turned over 15 boxes that included 184 unique documents with classification markings in January (after an extended back-and-forth with NARA) or when responding to the grand jury subpoena in June, when they returned another package of documents that included 38 additional unique documents with classification markings.\n\n– CNN’s Jamie Gangel, Elizabeth Stuart and Jeremy Herb contributed to this item.\n\nThe claim: The feds could’ve just asked for the documents\n\nTrump has argued that the search was unnecessary because the federal investigators could have simply asked for the documents from his team, which he claimed had been fully cooperative.\n\n“They could have had it anytime they wanted—and that includes LONG ago. ALL THEY HAD TO DO WAS ASK,” Trump posted on his social media platform on August 12.\n\nFacts First: It is not true that federal investigators could have long ago obtained the government records in Trump’s possession just by asking. By the time of the search, the federal government had been asking Trump for more than a year to return records from his presidency. Even when the Justice Department went beyond asking in May and served Trump’s team with the subpoena for the return of all documents with classification markings, Trump’s team returned only some of these documents – and then, in June, Trump lawyer Christina Bobb signed a document certifying on behalf of Trump’s office that all of the documents had been returned, though that was not true.\n\nIn other words: Trump claimed that the Justice Department could have just asked for the documents “LONG ago” even though his team explicitly and inaccurately told the department in June that there were no documents left to ask for. Relatedly, the department has called into question how cooperative Trump’s team was.\n\nIn its court filing this week, the department asserted that investigators “developed evidence that government records were likely concealed and removed from the Storage Room” at Mar-a-Lago “and that efforts were likely taken to obstruct the government’s investigation.” They said of the August search: “That the FBI, in a matter of hours, recovered twice as many documents with classification markings as the ‘diligent search’ that the former President’s counsel and other representatives had weeks to perform calls into serious question the representations made in the June 3 certification and casts doubt on the extent of cooperation in this matter.”\n\nThe claim: It was the bureaucrats’ fault\n\nA member of Trump’s team has tried to pin blame on the General Services Administration, a federal agency that provides transition office space and assistance services to the outgoing president.\n\nKash Patel, a former Trump administration official whom Trump named as another representative to NARA, said on Fox on August 12 on that “the GSA has since come out, the Government (sic) Services Administration, and said they mistakenly packed some boxes and moved them to Mar-a-Lago. That’s not on the President. That’s on the National Archives to sort that material out.” Patel said that even if material was classified, which is “highly unlikely,” the fact that the GSA boxed the material “should have been the end” of the matter.\n\nFacts First: The GSA has repeatedly rejected Patel’s claim. The agency says it had no role in deciding which documents from Trump’s outgoing transition office in Virginia would be placed in boxes or which boxes would be shipped to Mar-a-Lago – and that these decisions were made by Trump’s team alone.\n\nA GSA spokesperson said in a statement last week that it was Trump’s team, not the GSA, that packed the boxes and that it was Trump’s team, not the GSA, that put these boxes on pallets and shrink-wrapped them for shipping from Trump’s transition office in Virginia. GSA did enter into a support contract for the actual September 2021 shipping, but “not for the packing of the boxes,” the spokesperson said – and “GSA did not examine the contents of the boxes and, accordingly, had no knowledge of the contents prior to shipping.”\n\nIt is not clear how many of the government documents recovered at Mar-a-Lago were part of the September 2021 shipments from Virginia. It is theoretically possible that some documents were taken to Mar-a-Lago at other times and in other ways.\n\n- CNN’s Kristen Holmes contributed to this item.\n\nThe claim: The FBI may have planted evidence\n\nTrump lawyer Alina Habba said on Fox on August 9: “I’m concerned that they may have planted something; you know, at this point, who knows?” The next day, Trump suggested on social media that it was shady that the FBI would not allow witnesses, such as his lawyers, to be in the rooms being searched and “see what they were doing, taking or, hopefully not, ‘planting.’”\n\nFacts First: There is zero evidence that the FBI planted anything at Mar-a-Lago. And it is routine, not suspicious, for searches to be conducted without witnesses such as lawyers being in the room; lawyers don’t have a right to watch.\n\nThe claim about possible “planting” is impossible to definitively debunk at this point. Once more, though, Trump and his allies have not shown even a hint of proof that it is true.\n\nThe claim: Obama took tens of millions of documents\n\nThe week of the search, Trump turned to a familiar tactic under pressure: confuse the public by making false claims about former President Barack Obama. Trump asserted that Obama had taken tens of millions of documents to Chicago, Obama’s adopted hometown and the location of his future library and museum.\n\nIn a social media post on August 11, Trump wrote, “What happened to the 30 million pages of documents taken from the White House to Chicago by Barack Hussein Obama? He refused to give them back! What is going on? This act was strongly at odds with NARA. Will they be breaking into Obama’s ‘mansion’ in Martha’s Vineyard?” In another statement on August 12, Trump claimed: “President Barack Hussein Obama kept 33 million pages of documents, much of them classified.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims about Obama are comprehensively untrue – and the National Archives and Records Administration issued an official statement making that clear. The statement explained that all of Obama’s presidential records remain in NARA’s “exclusive legal and physical custody”; that it was NARA, not Obama, that took about 30 million records to a NARA facility in the Chicago area; that the records it took to the Chicago-area facility are unclassified; and that classified Obama records are at a different NARA facility.\n\nNARA has more information here about the plan for Obama’s presidential records.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale"], "publish_date": "2022/09/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/03/26/truth-social-djt-stock-price/73098540007/", "title": "DJT had a good first day: Trump's Truth Social media stock price ...", "text": "Buoyed by legions of avid supporters, Donald Trump made a bubbly debut on the Nasdaq stock exchange Tuesday.\n\nShares of Trump Media & Technology Group soared like helium from the opening bell and maintained most of those gains until late in the trading day when a selloff brought Trump's namesake social media company closer to earth with a closing market value of nearly $8 billion, on par with ride-hailing company Lyft and online marketplace Etsy.\n\nIt was also an epic trading day for Trump, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee and Trump Media's largest shareholder. Shares rose as high as $79.38 before flagging at the end of trade to close at $57.99, close to their low of the day.\n\nHis 60% stake in Truth Social’s parent company, which now trades under the ticker DJT, is worth about $4.5 billion on paper. And, if the stock price stays above $17.50 per share for an extended period, tens of millions of additional shares would be issued, most of them to Trump.\n\nHigh-flying DJT stock hits turbulence:More volatility ahead for Trump's Truth Social\n\nEnthusiasm in the MAGA ranks was undercut by the more sober assessment of stock market observers. They say Trump Media’s valuation is divorced from the business realities it faces.\n\nIts flagship product Truth Social, Trump’s bullhorn of choice, is a minor player in a social media landscape dominated by megacorporations like Facebook owner Meta. Trump Media, on the other hand, has racked up tens of millions of dollars in losses and generated sparse sales. And it has struggled to attract advertisers and users since its launch in 2021.\n\nIt owes its success to Trump, who is one of Truth Social's most prolific users and has among the most followers on the platform with nearly 6.8 million. Trump has 34 million followers on Facebook, 24 million on Instagram and more than 87 million on X.\n\n\"It's hard to come up with any reasonable metrics that would get you to this valuation,\" Derek Horstmeyer, a finance professor at George Mason University in Virginia, told USA TODAY.\n\nThe one-day pop was typical of so-called meme stocks in recent years, like video-game retailer GameStop.Trump supporters banded together on social media to lift the stock even before it completed the merger with Digital World Acquisition Corp., a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, that was already listed on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe difference here may be that the former president's fans may continue to lift − rather than dump − the stock.\n\nTrading was exceptionally heavy, according to University of Florida finance professor Jay Ritter. The number of shares available to trade – called the public float – is about 28 million. But more than 52 million shares traded Tuesday. In fact, trading was so intense that Nasdaq temporarily halted it following the opening bell. Typically, trading in most stocks is less than 1% a day.\n\n“Clearly a lot of the buyers and holders are people who are buying it for ideological reasons and plan on holding it for a while,” Ritter said.\n\nThat’s not so different from the online traders, mom-and-pop investors, small brokers and others who organized on social media platform Reddit to drive up the price of GameStop and face down hedge funds that were betting against the company and shorting the stock.\n\n“In that regard, GameStop investors were doing it for ideological reasons, too,” Ritter said. “But after the stock price went up, they then sold and the stock price collapsed.”\n\nNobody knows when the Trump Media bubble will burst, he said. Just because you are a Trump supporter doesn’t mean you will hold it forever, Ritter said.\n\n“In the short run, anything can happen,” he said. “But in the long run, I am highly confident there is going to be a huge percentage decline.”\n\nHow much is Truth Social worth?\n\nThose Trump Media shares have handed Trump a crucial lifeline in posting bond as he appeals the civil fraud judgment against him.\n\nA New York appeals court gave Trump 10 more days to post his bond and slashed the amount to $175 million. Trump has been struggling under the weight of not just the $454 million civil fraud judgment, but also an $83.3 million defamation trial loss to advice columnist E. Jean Carroll.\n\nTrump's gains are all on paper for the time being. He would need Trump Media’s seven-person board to lift a restriction that prevents Trump and other insiders from selling shares or using them as collateral for a bond for the next six months.\n\nThe board, which is stacked with allies including his son, Donald Trump Jr., and three former members of his administration, could also hold a secondary offering that would allow Trump to cash out some of his stake in coming months.\n\nWhat is Trump’s net worth?\n\nTruth Social going public means a massive boost to Trump’s net worth, at least on paper.\n\nHis shares in Trump Media and the reduction in the bond that Trump must post in a New York civil fraud lawsuit increased his net worth by more than $4 billion Monday, catapulting him into the world’s wealthiest 500 people on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index for the first time.\n\nWhy is Truth Social’s ticker DJT?\n\nResearch shows that familiar names, such as a former president’s initials, can help a company’s stock performance.\n\nOne 2006 study by Princeton University psychologists found that stocks with tickers that are easier to pronounce tend to perform better in the first few days of trading. Another study from Pomona College in 2019 verified earlier research that found clever tickers tend to perform better, partly because they are more memorable to investors.\n\nWhat is Digital World Acquisition?\n\nDigital World is a SPAC, also known as a blank check company. These publicly traded shell companies exist to acquire or merge with private companies and take them public.\n\nTruth Social’s merger with Digital World was first announced in 2021 when the number of companies going public via SPACs surged. The investment vehicles have since faced criticism for being bad deals for retail investors.\n\nWhy did Trump launch Truth Social?\n\nTruth Social was founded after Trump was booted from major social media platforms following the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/03/23/donald-trump-truth-social-merger-financial-woes/73077478007/", "title": "Can Donald Trump's Truth Social deal solve his money problems?", "text": "WASHINGTON – Former President Donald Trump is facing money challenges as he contends with legal fights on multiple fronts while trying to raise cash for his bid to reclaim the White House.\n\nIn a civil fraud case, Trump has been ordered to pay a half-billion dollar bond which his lawyers have called a “practical impossibility.” And in the 2024 presidential campaign, President Joe Biden has been lapping him in fundraising.\n\nBut a deal to take his social media platform, Truth Social, and its parent company public could provide the former president and business magnate a critical lifeline and could more than double his net worth and net him more than $3 billion.\n\nThe deal isn’t set in stone yet and Trump still has a few hurdles to clear if he wants immediate access to his newfound wealth. Here’s what to know about Trump’s social media deal and his financial woes.\n\nWhat is Truth Social?\n\nTruth Social is Trump's social media platform he launched after the 2020 election. The app is similar to X, formerly Twitter, and is Trump's favored messaging tool after his X account was permanently suspended for his false claims of election fraud. His account has since been reinstated after Elon Musk took control of the platform, but Trump has stayed on Truth Social.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nThe app is marketed as an alternative social media platform for conservatives. Trump said in a statement he started the platform to \"stand up to the tyranny of Big Tech.\"\n\nWhat is the Truth Social merger?\n\nInvestors on Friday green lighted a merger with Trump’s media and technology company, aptly named Trump Media & Technology Group. The company, which owns Truth Social, will merge with Digital World Acquisition Corp, an SPAC – companies aimed at raising cash and merging with other entities.\n\nIf all goes well with the agreement, Truth Social can start trading on Monday labeled DJT – Trump’s initials.\n\nTrump’s stake in Truth Social’s parent company values over $3 billion but a prior agreement bars Trump from selling any of his shares or borrowing cash against them for six months. If the agreement sticks, Trump's financial problems won't be going away anytime soon.\n\nWhat are Trump’s financial problems?\n\nTrump’s most immediate problem is a nearly half billion dollar bond he is ordered to post by Monday.\n\nLast month a New York judge ruled in a civil fraud case that the former president inflated the values of his properties and delivered a penalty of almost $454 million. Trump is seeking to appeal the ruling and must put up a bond equal to the penalty. His lawyers however, told an appeals court it was a “practical impossibility” to put up the bond.\n\n“Despite scouring the market, we have been unsuccessful in our effort to obtain a bond for the Judgment Amount for Defendants for the simple reason that obtaining an appeal bond for $464 million is a practical impossibility under the circumstances presented,” his lawyers said in a court filing.\n\nIf Trump can’t post the bond by Monday, New York Attorney General Letitia James can begin collecting the penalty from last month’s case. If Trump can’t pay up, James could begin seizing his assets.\n\nTrump's fundraising numbers\n\nTrump is also significantly trailing Biden in campaign fundraising as he runs for a second term while he is mired in legal trouble.\n\nBiden raised $21.3 million in February, nearly double what Trump raised the same month – $10.9 million – according to filings with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nNot only that, Biden’s campaign has $71 million cash on hand compared to Trump’s campaign which falls behind at $33.5 million.\n\nCan the Truth Social deal save Trump?\n\nMaybe.\n\nTrump could ask the company Truth Social is merging with to waive the six-month waiting period – called a “lock-up” provision – before he could turn his stake into cash but that has its own set of complications.\n\nBut waiving the requirement could lower the company’s value and might not even allow Trump to tap into all of his shares as he could be limited to how much stock he can sell.\n\nWith the Monday deadline quickly approaching, it’s still unclear how Trump will be able to post up the $464 million bond. In the meantime, Trump’s lawyers are attempting to either reduce the bond requirement or completely waive it.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/06/03/tiktok-donald-trump/73954119007/", "title": "Donald Trump joined TikTok with a UFC appearance video.

Rivals like former Vice President Mike Pence hit Ramaswamy on his lack of government experience. Ramaswamy called than an asset.\n\nDeSantis, who is second to Trump in many polls, emerged from the debate relatively unscathed, but had no memorable quotes. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum used the debate to promote their own platforms.\n\nSome highlights from debate day:\n\nMike Pence and Vivek Ramaswamy spar about age on the debate stage\n\nWhen asked whether an elected president should pass a mental or physical test if above a certain age, Pence, 64, said Americans can make their own judgment. But he added that the country doesn’t need a president who’s too old, or a president who’s too young.\n\nRather, he said that the country needs a president who’s been there and knows how the government works.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy, 38 and the youngest candidate on the debate stage, said that there needs to be a person of a different generation leading the country forward, and that he is the only candidate to do that.\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRepublican candidates push to eliminate Education Department\n\nSeveral of the Republican candidates showed their support for eliminating the federal Department of Education.\n\n“We need education in this country, not indoctrination in this country,” Ron DeSantis said.\n\nRamaswamy agreed that the Department of Education should be shut down and said he supports parents choosing where they send their kids to schools. He said he believes high school students should have to pass a civics test, like individuals in the process of becoming American citizens.\n\nDoug Burgum, also in favor of removing the Department of Education, said the country forgets that education differs by state. He emphasized the need for schools to innovate.\n\nNikki Haley pushed for transparency in the classroom.\n\n“There’s a lot of crazy, woke things happening in schools,” she said, later adding, “Parents need to be deciding which schools their kids go to because they know best.”\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\n'C'mon, man': Chris Christie doesn't like UFO question\n\nThe former governor of New Jersey took umbrage at a \"lighting round\" question on whether presidents should \"level\" with the American people about UFOs.\n\n\"I get the UFO question? C'mon, man,\" Christie told Fox News' Martha MacCallum.\n\nHe did answer the question by saying: “The job of the president of United States is to level with the American people about everything.\"\n\n− David Jackson\n\nSparks fly over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Nikki Haley and former Vice President Mike Pence tore into entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy for saying he’d freeze the current lines of control in Ukraine in return for a promise from Russia that it would not form a military alliance with China.\n\nPence told Ramaswamy “if we do the giveaway that you want to” and give Putin eastern Ukraine, “it's not going to be too long” before he rolls across the border into a NATO nation.\n\n“Ukraine is not a priority for the United States of America,” Ramaswamy argued, raising China as a bigger threat.\n\nHaley argued that a win for Russia is a win for China and said Ukraine is the first line of defense.\n\n“You have no foreign policy experience, and it shows,” Haley told Ramaswamy.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nOther GOP candidates said Pence did the right thing on Jan. 6\n\nMike Pence got some back up for the issue that has been the biggest anchor on his candidacy: his refusal to interfere in the congressional counting of electoral college votes as Donald Trump wanted.\n\nAsked if Pence did the right thing on Jan. 6, 2021, other candidates said he did – though it took longer for some to get there than others.\n\nAfter Ron DeSantis tried to dodge the question, Pence said the American people deserve to know if everyone on stage would’ve done what he did.\n\n“Answer the question,” Pence said.\n\n“Mike did his duty,” DeSantis responded. “I’ve got no beef with him.”\n\nPence got his biggest backing from Chris Christie who said the former vice president stood up for the Constitution and deserves thanks, “not grudging credit.”\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nVivek Ramaswamy says he would pardon Donald Trump\n\nDonald Trump’s indictments over his handling of classified documents and the 2020 election have raised the question among his GOP rivals of whether they would pardon the former president if they're elected.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy said on the debate stage that he would pardon Trump, a position he has long held. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said she was \"inclined in favor\" of a pardon in an interview, though Haley noted that the discussions were still premature.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence said pardons would only be appropriate to weigh if Trump was found guilty. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, Trump’s two most vocal critics, have leaned against a pardon.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nNikki Haley targets Donald Trump's electability\n\nDuring the 14-minute discussion of Donald Trump's legal problems, Nikki Haley was the only candidate who mentioned a political issue: His ability to win a general election.\n\n\"We have to face the fact that Trump is the most disliked politician in America,\" Haley said. \"We can’t win a general election that way.\"\n\nTrump will no doubt disagree with this assessment, but don't be surprised if other GOP candidates echo Haley's argument in the coming weeks.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nDonald Trump finally comes up: Most candidates will support him even if he is convicted, but not Chris Christie\n\nThe first Trump question came at 9:56 p.m., eastern, nearly an hour in: Would you support him if he is convicted?\n\nMost of the candidates raised their hands, while Christie raised an objection.\n\n\"Someone's got to stop normalizing this conduct,\" Christie said, drawing boos from the crowd and criticism from Ramaswamy, who said the Justice Department is being weaponized against Trump.\n\nScott also criticized the Justice Department. So did DeSantis, though he said the party also needs to stop talking about this and look forward - presumably with him as president.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nVivek Ramaswamy says we are in a \"dark moment;\" Mike Pence disagrees\n\nMike Pence and Vivek Ramaswamy went at it again, this time over the moral climate of the nation.\n\nPence bashed Ramaswamy over his negativity, saying \"we just need government as good as our people.\"\n\nRamaswamy's reply: \"It is not morning in America. We are living in a dark moment and we have to confront that,\" an apparent reference to former President Ronald Reagan.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nGOP lacks uniform abortion message\n\nNikki Haley and Mike Pence’s exchange on abortion shows the hopscotch Republicans have to deal with since the Supreme Court knocked down Roe v. Wade.\n\nSix states have had reproductive rights questions on their ballot since then, and liberals have won all of those.\n\nOn the stage, most of the GOP contenders talked about a 15-week national ban being the standard, but Ron DeSantis talked up signing a 6-week ban in Florida. At one point Tim Scott, who often talks about his anti-abortion views, said that Congress should aim for a 15-week ban at least.\n\nBut others such as former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, don’t support a federal prohibition at all, saying it should be left up to the states.\n\nEach touted how they are a “pro-life” candidate, but there isn’t a uniform standard.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nNikki Haley, Mike Pence tangle on abortion\n\nNikki Haley tried to argue to Republicans that they need to be honest with Americans when discussing a national abortion ban. Because any federal legislation will require 60 votes in the Senate, she said, party leaders should be trying to find a consensus on abortion issues, such as banning later abortions and agreeing not to jail women who get them.\n\nMike Pence, the strongest anti-abortion advocate on the stage, wasn’t having it.\n\n“Nikki, you’re my friend,” Pence said, “but consensus is the opposite of leadership.”\n\nPence said abortion is not an issue for the states to decide.\n\n“It’s a moral issue,” he said.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nMore than 45 minutes in − and no discussion of Donald Trump\n\nAfter more than 45 minutes, the debate moderators, and the candidates, have yet to discuss a big campaign issue: Donald Trump.\n\nMike Pence made passing references to the president who put him on the ticket in 2016, but neither he nor his rivals mentioned Trump's indictments or big poll leads.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nVivek Ramaswamy falsely claims climate change agenda is a hoax\n\nVivek Ramaswamy during the debate claimed that climate change is a hoax, but that is inaccurate.\n\nThere is a wide range of proof that climate change is real, including research on increasing global temperatures, rising sea levels and and decreasing Antarctic ice sheets.\n\nScientific data show warming has accelerated since the mid-20th century and that human activities have contributed to that trend.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nChris Christie on Vivek Ramaswamy: ‘A guy who sounds like ChatGPT’\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie didn’t hesitate to attack entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy after the candidates were asked whether they believe in climate change.\n\n“I’ve had enough already tonight of a guy who sounds like Chat GPT stand up here…” Christie said, interrupting Ramaswamy.\n\n“The last person at one of these debates who stood in the middle of the stage and said, 'what’s a skinny guy with an odd last name doing here' was Barack Obama, and I’m afraid we’re dealing with the same type of amateur,” Christie added.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nTim Scott tells opponents to stop being childish\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott sought to bring order to all the noise, telling colleagues that \"going back and forth\" and \"being childish\" will not help the American people.\n\nHis opponents are likely to continue being feisty.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nHaley draws attention to being sole woman on stage\n\nAs several of the candidates traded insults, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley saw a chance to draw attention to her status as the only woman on stage.\n\n“This is exactly why Margaret Thatcher said, `If you want something said, ask a man. If you want something done, ask a woman,’” Haley said.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nNo one has 'the sway': South Carolina young Republicans on the GOP debate\n\nPedro Mateo, 29, said he thinks the debate will be more about setting the stage for determining a vice president or even 2028 candidate.\n\n“I don’t think anyone on the stage really has the sway to upend Trump,” Mateo said.\n\nMateo is the chairman of the political engagement committee for Young Greenville, a Republican club in South Carolina. He said regardless of who ultimately wins the nomination, he’ll support any candidate over the Democratic opponent.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nVivek Ramaswamy takes heat from Mike Pence\n\nSo far, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy is getting the most heat, with former Vice President Mike Pence attacking him for a lack of government experience.\n\nAfter Pence called the rising Republican a \"rookie,\" Ramaswamy said his business background is a better asset to lead a \"revolution.\"\n\n\"We're just going to have some fun tonight,\" he said.\n\nLater, several candidates hooted at Ramaswamy for claiming he is the only candidate not \"bought and paid for.\" Chris Christie compared him to another guy with a \"funny name:\" Barack Obama.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nNikki Haley comes out swinging\n\nWhereas the other candidates played nice when they first spoke, Nikki Haley wasn’t having it.\n\nThe former South Carolina governor, who is the lone women running for the GOP nomination, drew first blood by attacking her rivals for supporting COVID-19 stimulus spending.\n\n“The truth is that Biden didn't do this to us, our Republicans did this to us too,” she said.\n\nHaley mentioned multiple candidates on the stage by name and Trump when slamming Republicans for raising the U.S. debt and supporting earmarks.\n\n“You tell me who are the big spenders,” she said. “I think it’s time for an accountant in the White House.”\n\n– Phillip M. Bailey\n\nRon DeSantis starts with an attack on Joe Biden\n\nThe moderators opened with a question about a song that bemoans the state of the nation. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis used it as an excuse to bash President Joe Biden, and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie followed suit.\n\nThe eight candidates on stage were quick to criticize Biden over a slate of economic issues, from inflation to job opportunities.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nThe lineup: The candidates' positions on the stage - and the polls\n\nThe candidates were introduced in the order of their place in political polls: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, former Vice President Mike Pence, former South Carolina Gov Nikki Haley, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson.\n\nDeSantis and Ramaswamy are first and second, so they are in the center. They are flanked by Pence, Haley, Christie, Scott, Hutchinson and Burgum.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nBrian Kemp chides Donald Trump for skipping debate\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp remains one of the few popular Republicans who won’t spare Donald Trump a criticism.\n\nKemp, who is mentioned as a possible 2024 contender, trekked to Wisconsin for the first GOP debate. He said the former president, who remains the clear front-runner, is making a big mistake by not joining the discussion.\n\n“Fight it out,” Kemp said on a podcast appearance.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nNew Hampshire voters turn to Republican debate: ‘I’d like to see how everybody conducts themselves’\n\nEven though Kenneth Biel has narrowed down his vote for a few specific candidates in New Hampshire’s crucial first-in-the-nation primary, the debate he said, could sway him.\n\n“I’m open to hearing somebody change my mind,” said the 47-year-old software engineer from Chester. Biel said he is eyeing former President Donald Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. But if a different candidate has a standout performance, the debate could change his mind.\n\n“I’d like to see how everybody conducts themselves,” Biel said, adding he’s open to “people who I disagree with.”\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nWill Donald Trump attend the Republican debate?\n\nFormer President Donald Trump will be skipping the first Republican primary debate, citing his lead in GOP polls.\n\nThe former president had previously hinted he would not attend the event in Milwaukee, saying he did not want to give trailing rivals free shots at him on a debate stage.\n\n“The public knows who I am & what a successful Presidency I had,\" Trump said Sunday on his Truth Social platform, before adding: \"I WILL THEREFORE NOT BE DOING THE DEBATES!”\n\nMeanwhile, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson posted his taped interview of Trump on the X social media site at 8:55 p.m., eastern.\n\n– Rachel Looker and David Jackson\n\nJoe Biden's campaign mocks Donald Trump for ‘softball’ interview with Tucker Carlson\n\nAhead of Wednesday’s debate, the Biden campaign mocked former President Donald Trump for taking part in a “softball” interview with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson that will air online simultaneously.\n\n“In his softball 'interview' posting tonight, Donald Trump will again make clear that he’s running on the same extreme and deeply unpopular MAGA agenda the American people have rejected time and time again,” Biden campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz said in a statement.\n\nMunoz said that instead of explaining his “broken promises” to bring manufacturing jobs to Wisconsin, Trump will likely “double down on his most out-of-touch positions, including his support for wild, debunked conspiracy theories and a national abortion ban.”\n\nThe Biden campaign has circled the first Republican primary debate as an opportunity to ramp up their attacks against the GOP field after staying mostly quiet since Biden announced his reelection bid in April.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nWhere do the Republican candidates stand on student loan forgiveness?\n\nEarlier this year, the Supreme Court struck down President Joe Biden’s plan to forgive $400 billion in student loan debt, a move 2024 GOP candidates applauded.\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley wrote on X that a president “cannot just wave his hand and eliminate loans for students he favors.” South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott has supported legislation prohibiting Biden from cancelling student loan debt.\n\nLikewise, biotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy also supported the court’s decision, sharing at the time: \"We have a bad habit in America of paying people to do the exact opposite of what we want them to do.\"\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nFollow along as we fact-check the first Republican debate\n\nWas that fair criticism or cherry-picked data?

Follow our live fact-check file as we dig through the data, documents and transcripts to sort fact from fiction.\n\nFact-checking the GOP debate: What the Republican candidate hopefuls get right and wrong\n\n− Eric Litke\n\nBashing Biden: Democrat likely to be a GOP punching bag\n\nGOP candidates will be eager to demonstrate they have the best chance of beating President Joe Biden in the general election.\n\nA strategy memo put together by Ron DeSantis’ political action committee, which the candidate and his campaign have denounced, suggested the Florida governor focus his attacks on the Democratic president.\n\nDebaters will need little prompting to criticize Biden, although entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and several others have said they intend to use the primetime event to introduce themselves to voters and make the case for their own candidacies. Vice President Kamala Harris is also likely to be a target. DeSantis has been sparring with Harris over slavery, and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley has been critical of the vice president’s record. Haley has made a point of arguing that if anything happens to Biden, who is 80, Harris would succeed him as president.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nA crowd gathers in Milwaukee for Republican debate night\n\nIt's party time in Milwaukee: the Republican Party. As the debate approaches, ticket holders, Republican supporters and curious bystanders are enjoying the restaurant-and-bar areas near the city's sports arena.\n\nOthers have more organized activities.\n\nMore than 100 union members marched behind the arena, promoting labor rights and chanting \"we are the union/the mighty, mighty union.\" Another chant included the line \"Republicans hear our call!\"\n\nDown the avenue, an old-fashioned fife-and-drum corps led a group of Vivek Ramaswamy supporters dressed in Revolutionary War-era garb, topped by bonnets and tri-cornered hats, all in 99 degree weather.\n\nSpecial guests gathered in the plaza right beside Fiserv Forum, the home of professional basketball's Milwaukee Bucks. Food trucks, television tents, and a bandstand dotted the \"Block Party\" hosted by Young America's Foundation, one of the debate sponsors.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nDonald Trump declared Republican debate victory hours ago\n\nHours before the first Republican presidential debate even began, Donald Trump’s campaign was claiming victory, mocking his rivals and the network hosting the event.\n\n“President Trump has already won this evening’s debate because everything is going to be about him,” Chris LaCivita, who serves as a campaign senior adviser, said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nLaCivita added how Fox News hosts will \"show an unnatural obsession\" with Trump by asking the other GOP contenders their reaction to the front-runner's policy positions. He said the campaign will even be looking for how many times the former president's name is brought up.\n\n“In fact, tonight’s Republican undercard event really shouldn’t even be called a debate, but rather an audition to be a part of President Trump’s team in his second term,\" he said.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nVivek Ramaswamy Googled most, Mike Pence least before Republican debate\n\nWhich candidate were Googlers most curious about leading up to the debate? That would be political newcomer Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nHe was the subject of 40% of searches for candidates by name this past week, according to Google. Former President Donald Trump was next at 33%.\n\nThen there was a drop-off in interest with everyone else appearing in no more than 10% of searches.\n\nMike Pence, Trump’s former running mate, was last at 1%.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nWhich Republican candidates go beyond bashing Biden over inflation?\n\nWhen the candidates go after Joe Biden on the debate stage tonight, there’s a good chance they’ll bring up inflation. Although price increases have cooled over the past year, pocketbooks are still pinched and Republicans love to blame Biden.\n\nSome of the candidates have been more specific than others about what they would do differently.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence has an entire “Ending Inflation” plan that includes specific spending cuts, such as eliminating the Environmental Protection Agency. Both Pence and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy want to change how the Federal Reserve manages the economy.\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott has backed a proposal to bar Congress from passing any legislation that would increase inflation when the inflation rate is 4.5% or higher.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nHow have the GOP candidates prepared for the Republican debate?\n\nFrom the tennis courts – entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy called his tennis practice this week “three hours of solid debate prep” – to the basketball courts – North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum tore his Achilles tendon while playing basketball. GOP candidates employed a range of tactics to prepare for the debate.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis brought in debate coach Brett O’Donnell, who has experience prepping former President George W. Bush, former Arizona Sen. John McCain and Utah Sen. Mitt Romney for debates.\n\nOthers like former Vice President Mike Pence and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley relied on their prior political experience, with Pence falling back on the way he approached one-on-one vice presidential debates in 2016 and 2020 and Haley relying on her experience from 80 town halls she held in Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nSen. Tim Scott will likely lean into his faith and role as the \"nice guy” in the race. Scott campaign spokesperson Nichole Morales told USA TODAY earlier this week he “will share his positive, conservative message on the debate stage in Milwaukee.”\n\n– USA TODAY staff\n\nFact-checking the GOP debate:What the Republican candidate hopefuls got right and wrong\n\nConservative advocacy groups descend on Milwaukee before presidential debate\n\nThe Republican presidential campaigns aren't the only political organizations in town for the debate − advocacy groups are also hanging around the city's pro basketball arena promoting their issues.\n\nEconomic conservatives, like the Club For Growth, and social conservatives, like the Faith & Freedom Coalition are represented in Milwaukee to lobby lawmakers and candidates, many of whom they back with money and voter turnout.\n\n\"We want to make sure they hear what our message is,\" said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America.\n\nIt's not just conservative groups taking advantage of the big political event.\n\nDeath Penalty Action, which describes itself as the only national organization strictly focused on stopping the death penalty, is also in town solicitating support for a national ban on capital punishment.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nWhat to know ahead of the debate: Here's where candidates stand on China, potential invasion of Taiwan\n\nRepublicans agree on what they argue is an urgent need to combat the military and economic threat from China. But that’s where their agreement on the issue ends.\n\nThe United States has traditionally had a policy of strategic ambiguity on whether it would send troops to Taiwan to defend the island in the face of a Chinese invasion. Former Vice President Mike Pence supports this policy and says the U.S. should keep providing Taiwan with military assistance.\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has described China as the “most dangerous foreign threat we face since the second world war” and said it’s clear that Beijing is preparing for war. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie says he would do everything he could to avoid using the U.S. military against China, “but if it was unavoidable, I would do what needs to be done.”\n\nEntrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy says he would aggressively defend Taiwan – but only until the U.S. has semiconductor independence, which he has pledged to do by 2028. At that point, he said, would not risk war for “some nationalistic dispute between China and Taiwan.”\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nGOP candidates who won't be at presidential debate blast polling requirement\n\nGOP candidates Larry Elder and Perry Johnson announced on Tuesday that they planned to sue the Republican National Committee after not making the debate stage.\n\nElder alleged on X that the RNC notified him after he turned in his debate qualification package that one of the polls he cited would not count. Johnson’s campaign also sent an email claiming that the committee had rejected him because they weren’t accepting certain polls.\n\nGOP candidate Francis Suarez said on X that his campaign also faced a similar issue on Monday night, though he added that he respects the rules set forth by the RNC.\n\n“I am sorry that this debate will not include my perspectives from the largest growing voting block in our country - young, conservative Hispanics,” Suarez wrote.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nFlying the flag: Donald Trump aides, supporters and surrogates swarm presidential debate site\n\nDonald Trump himself may not be in Milwaukee, but Trump World has a definite presence at the debate site.\n\nSurrogates like U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., are out and about, giving television interviews promoting their favorite absent candidate. Trump campaign aides are also milling about the area around the Fiserv Forum and speaking to reporters.\n\nEveryday supporters have also flocked to downtown Milwaukee, despite temperatures in excess of 90 degrees, adorned in red or white Trump t-shirts and carrying signs. Part of their job, apparently: Wave the signs while standing behind television correspondents during live shots.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nPlanned Parenthood highlights Mike Pence, Tim Scott and other GOP candidates’ position on abortion\n\nPlanned Parenthood launched this week its first ad in the 2024 presidential campaign, highlighting what five of the GOP candidates have said about abortion.\n\nThe first clip is of former Vice President Mike Pence, who has for decades tried to end government funding for Planned Parenthood and has taken the strongest anti-abortion stand in the 2024 field.\n\n“Every Republican candidate for president should support a ban on abortion,” Pence says in the clip.\n\nThe ad is running on social media and in Wisconsin.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nUkraine war a pressure point for the GOP field\n\nThe Ukraine war could prove to be fertile ground for the large group of presidential hopefuls to differentiate themselves.\n\nSupport for U.S. military assistance to Ukraine is flagging inside the GOP electorate with Kyiv’s counteroffensive against Russian President Vladimir Putin’s army making slow progress. Still, any suggestion that Ukraine is at fault for Russia’s violation of its sovereignty is likely to drive away establishment Republican voters.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ description of the conflict as a “territorial dispute” helped fuel his decline, even though he later backtracked the comment and called Putin a “war criminal.” Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has also come under scrutiny for his views, including a proposal to allow Putin to keep parts of eastern Ukraine.\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley and former Vice President Mike Pence are among the candidates who say that stopping Putin is vital to U.S. national security and helps to deter Chinese aggression toward Taiwan.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nAsa Hutchinson, Chris Christie and other GOP candidates weigh in on Trump's indictments\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s indictments in both federal and state criminal cases have led some of his rivals to defend him, while others have sharply criticized him over the charges.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott have condemned the indictments on the campaign trail. Meanwhile, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum have largely dodged questions about his criminal cases.\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson have been some of Trump's most vocal critics, particularly after he was indicted for allegedly trying to steal the 2020 election from President Joe Biden. After Trump's federal indictment over the 2020 election, former Vice President Mike Pence said anyone who puts themselves above the Constitution should not be president.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nVivek Ramaswamy: The newcomer on the presidential debate stage\n\nBiotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has faced scrutiny in recent days over conspiracy theories about the 9/11 attack, something his rivals could use to their advantage during the debate.\n\nIn an interview on CNN earlier this week, Ramaswamy claimed he was misquoted in an article about his 9/11 comments, though that wasn’t the case according to a recording released later.\n\nRamaswamy, a Trump-loving candidate who embraces meritocracy and anti-wokeness, has previously drawn scrutiny over comments on the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack, Juneteenth and more.\n\n– Rachel Looker and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nConservative Supreme Court could factor into GOP debate\n\nSeven years ago, during the first GOP debate of the 2016 election, the Supreme Court was criticized by several candidates.\n\n“It's time that we recognize the Supreme Court is not the supreme being,” then candidate Mike Huckabee quipped.\n\nWhat a difference a few years makes.\n\nThe nation’s highest court, which today is more conservative than it has been in decades, has already factored into the GOP primary. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former President Donald Trump have swiped at each other over whether the bench is conservative enough. Last month, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy released a list of candidates he said he would nominate to the court, including Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah.\n\n– John Fritze\n\nPresident Biden hopes to watch ‘as much as I can’ of Republican debate\n\nPresident Joe Biden is among the millions of Americans expected to tune in to tonight’s Republican primary debate.\n\n“I’m going to try to see — get as much as I can, yes,” Biden, who is vacationing in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, told reporters when asked if he plans to watch the debate.\n\nAsked about his expectations, Biden smiled and laughed. “I have none,” he said.\n\nWhile Republican frontrunner Donald Trump skips out on the debate in Milwaukee, Biden’s reelection campaign is going on the offensive during the event.\n\nThe Biden campaign launched a $25 million television ad blitz to coincide with the first Republican debate and dispatched surrogates to Milwaukee as Democrats seek to paint the eight Republicans on the debate stage as part of an extreme “MAGA” Republican Party.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nDonald Trump opts for interview with Tucker Carlson\n\nTrump may not be on the stage in Milwaukee, but he is expected to weigh in on the proceedings.\n\nA pre-taped interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson is scheduled to be posted at 9 p.m., eastern, the same time as the debate.\n\nTrump - who has also threatened to skip a second GOP debate scheduled for Sept. 27 in California - will likely comment on whatever happens in Milwaukee on Truth Social.\n\n“The public knows who I am & what a successful Presidency I had,\" Trump said Sunday on his social media platform, before adding: \"I WILL THEREFORE NOT BE DOING THE DEBATES!”\n\n- Rachel Looker and David Jackson\n\nTrump, absent from the debate, remains frontrunner in GOP primary polls\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is still leading the polls for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, according to an average calculated by RealClearPolitics.\n\nHe has garnered 55.4% in an average of polls, while Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis trails behind him with 14.3%. Biotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy is in third with 7.2%, and former Vice President Mike Pence leads behind with 4% of support.\n\nIn line after those candidates are former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum.\n\nTrump aides are all over media set-ups outside the debate venue in Milwaukee, promoting those polls and proclaiming the race all but over. “You can’t stop the Trump Train,” senior adviser Jason Miller said.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi and David Jackson\n\nDoug Burgum rushed to emergency room a day before the GOP debate\n\nNorth Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, 67, was rushed to a Milwaukee emergency room on Tuesday after he tore his Achilles tendon while playing basketball. He is currently using crutches.\n\nHowever, he will still be on the debate stage, according to a post he shared on X, the platform previously known as Twitter.\n\nBurgum, who did an early afternoon “walk through” said he wants to debate. A candidate with little name recognition, Burgum previously told USA TODAY his focus in the debate will be to introduce himself to Americans.\n\n– Francesca Chambers,David Jackson and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nDemocrats look to get in a word at the Republican debate\n\nDemocratic Party officials are also zeroing in on the Milwaukee debate, trying to promote their messages in favor of President Joe Biden.\n\nSpeakers are doing national and local media hits, arguing that the Republicans are too extreme and too beholden to the missing debater, Donald Trump.\n\nDemocrats also have paid advertising on local and national media, as well as billboards on highways surrounding Milwaukee. The signs feature Biden answering various Republican proposals.\n\nOne section of the billboard says \"tax cuts for yacht owners?\" Biden's response: \"Good luck with that, champ.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nGOP debate location: Why it's in Milwaukee\n\nThe debate will take place at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nWisconsin is one of several swing states that could decide the presidency in 2024. Out of the last six presidential elections, four have been decided by less than one percentage point in Wisconsin.\n\nThe debate will be held ahead of the Republican National Convention, which is also set to take place in the city next year.\n\n– Rachel Looker\n\nHow can you watch the Republican debate?\n\nThe first Republican primary debate is scheduled for Wednesday at 9 p.m. Eastern.\n\nThe debate, hosted by Fox News, will air on Fox News Channel as well as Fox Business Network. It will also be streamed at foxnews.com and on the streaming service Fox National as well as on Rumble, an online streaming platform.\n\n– Rachel Looker\n\nWho is in the Republican debate tonight?\n\nThe Republican National Committee formally announced that eight GOP candidates will take the debate stage Wednesday.\n\n- Rachel Looker, David Jackson\n\nWhat time is the GOP debate?\n\nThe debate is scheduled for 9 p.m. Eastern time. It's set to last two hours until 11 p.m. Eastern time.\n\n– Rachel Looker", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/03/28/truth-social-trump-media-slide/73131957007/", "title": "Truth Social slips into the red as Trump Media stock hits turbulence", "text": "They say the bigger they come, the harder they fall. That reckoning always comes eventually for meme stocks ‒ and Trump Media & Technology Group appears to be no exception.\n\nDonald Trump’s namesake social media company burst out of the gate on its first day of trading Tuesday, opening at $70.90 and soaring as high as $79.38 as Trump fans and opportunistic traders bought up shares. But the price faded late in the session and has bounced along at lower levels ever since. The stock closed at $48.66 Monday, down 21.5%.\n\nTrump Media's market valuation, just over $6.5 billion as of Monday, is still stunning for a social media fledgling with an unproven business model that has struggled to attract users and advertisers, burned through cash and racked up losses.\n\n“The valuation of the company should be several hundred million, not the billions it is currently valued at,” University of Florida professor Jay Ritter said.\n\nThursday’s slide into the red could be just the beginning, market observers say. Ritter predicts the vanity stock ticker DJT will bottom out around $2 a share – or worse.\n\n“The stock will continue to be very volatile, with sharp moves up and down. But the long-term trend will be down,” he said. “The company has about $2 in cash per share, but it will probably burn through that money and the most likely outcome is eventual bankruptcy.”\n\nTrump also used a vanity ticker for his Atlantic City casino business, Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts, when it went public in 1995. The company never turned a profit and ended up bankrupt in 2004.\n\nTrump Media trading like meme stocks\n\nTrump Media’s trading has mimicked meme stocks like GameStop and AMC Entertainment, which rose to improbable heights in 2021 after individual investors organized on social media platform Reddit to drive up the stock price. Those investors aimed to strike back against hedge funds that had bet against the company and shorted the stock.\n\n“It has all the ingredients to be a volatile stock,” said Jonathan Brogaard, a finance professor at the University of Utah who has researched meme stocks.\n\nWhat’s tricky is predicting when a meme stock will collapse, said Derek Horstmeyer, a finance professor at George Mason University in Virginia, who specializes in corporate finance. The only hard-and-fast rule? “Eventually, it does,\" Horstmeyer said.\n\nStock price is still high: Is Trump Media overvalued?\n\nLike typical meme stocks, Trump Media is overvalued compared with other social media companies, at least by conventional Wall Street standards. It recorded $3.3 million in revenue in the first nine months of 2023 and a loss of $49 million, but its market value is more than 2,000 times its estimated annual revenue compared to Reddit at 10 times, Meta at seven and Snap at six.\n\n“The only way to get to that number is to imagine some sort of immense growth in the platform,” said Brent Goldfarb, a professor at the University of Maryland’s business school and co-author of “Bubbles and Crashes,” a book on financial market bubbles.\n\nBut Goldfarb sees \"no path to profitability\" for Truth Social.\n\n“Unless you believe that Truth Social is the next Facebook or TikTok, I don’t see a reason (for it to be valued this high),\" he said.\n\nTruth Social trades on Trump brand, following\n\nTrump Media’s flagship product, Truth Social, trades on Trump’s personality and brand and, while powerful, that comes with risks. Just ask Trump Media.\n\nIn addition to Trump’s \"death, incarceration or incapacity,\" there’s his checkered business history that includes the bankruptcy of the Trump Taj Mahal in 1991 and the Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts bankruptcy, according to the risk factors listed in a Trump Media regulatory filing.\n\n\"A number of companies that were associated with President Trump have filed for bankruptcy,\" the filing states.\n\nTrump's Truth Social has far fewer users than Facebook, TikTok\n\nAnd, unlike other social media and tech companies that trade on the expectation of growth, the number of users of Truth Social has declined.\n\nTrump Media was formed in 2021 after the former president was barred from major social media platforms after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. Truth Social debuted in 2022 as an alternative to Twitter, now known as X, and serves as Trump’s preferred bullhorn.\n\nIn February, Truth Social had 5 million desktop and mobile visitors, according to Similarweb, a data and analytics company. Facebook, on the other hand, has 3 billion monthly active users. Truth Social does not release user figures.\n\n“The stock is a way to invest in Trump. The ticker DJT is not a coincidence in any way,” Goldfarb said. “It’s a perfectly above-board way to push money into his pockets.”\n\nTrump supporters are propping up stock price\n\nTrump supporters banded together on social media to lift the stock even before Trump Media completed the merger with Digital World Acquisition Corp., a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, on Monday. It started trading on Tuesday.\n\nTeri Lynn Roberson couldn’t care less about the business fundamentals.\n\nRoberson, 52, from the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex in Texas, said she purchased five shares of Trump Media at about $72 a pop, right around the stock price’s Monday peak, to show her support for the former president.\n\n“It’s mainly to support Trump and his legal battles,” she said.\n\nHorstmeyer expects Truth Social’s stock price to swing 10% or more on a daily basis in the coming months. However, because the stock’s price is based on sentiment, not hard metrics like revenue and cash flow, the pattern is difficult to anticipate.\n\n“It could either go down to $10 or up to $150,” he said. “The only thing I can predict is volatility.”\n\nHow much is Donald Trump worth with DJT stock gains?\n\nTrump Media’s Nasdaq debut padded Trump’s wealth by about $5 billion – though only on paper.\n\nAnd cashing out won’t be easy. Trump Media has restrictions that prevent insiders from selling shares or using shares as collateral for loans for at least six months.\n\nThe board which is stacked with Trump allies could waive those restrictions. It could also hold a secondary offering to allow insiders an earlier opportunity to sell.\n\nThe risk for Trump Media: If Trump sells shares, it could deflate the stock price.\n\n“Donald Trump has substantial paper wealth in the stock, but the ability to turn it into cash is limited,” Ritter said. “By the time that he can sell shares, the price is likely to be in the single digits. And the more shares that he sells, the lower will be the price.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/28"}]}

I have never heard from anyone in our community about reducing Twin Pairs.\"\n\nTwin Pairs feedback is key\n\nThe city hired consultant Kimley-Horn to study the feasibility of reducing the lanes. It's feasible to reduce the number of lanes, based on current traffic needs and future needs, the study found, and the newfound areas would be repurposed for parking, bike lanes, pedestrian walkways and green zones.\n\nPart of the study depends on gathering public feedback for the city, and specifically the council, to consider when when the plan comes up for a vote.\n\n\"I am very pleased with the involvement and comments we got this evening,\" said Brian Good, of Kimley-Horn. \"There were a lot of comments that will give us things to digest over the next several days.\"\n\nMembers of the City Council agreed.\n\n“I thought the turnout tonight was amazing,” said Councilwoman Tracey Zudans. “I love seeing this kind of engagement. It is important that everyone is heard.”\n\nAdditional workshops are scheduled Oct. 25, Nov. 16 and Dec. 12.\n\n\"I was pleasantly surprised that a majority of people were against reducing the lanes,\" said Zudans. \"I think it is really important to take into consideration the cost to taxpayers that this will cause if it goes forward.\"\n\nCouncilman Rey Neville expressed optimism following the meeting, but looked at the benefits of lane reduction, which the minority of speakers supported.\n\n\"The benefits that we get from all the proposed changes are really significant,\" said Neville. \"I have to believe the engineers, and in the past their forecasts have been quite accurate. They tell us that the traffic will be manageable on that road.\"\n\nWhat's next?\n\nAfter getting more feedback at the next three meetings, the City Council plans to vote on how to move forward. If the council backs the lane-reduction plan, the city will submit an application to the Florida Department of Transportation by Dec. 31.\n\nConstruction likely would begin in 2026, according to Good.\n\nUntil then, one philosophical question remains, according to resident Peter Moor.\n\n\"Do we want to support the pedestrian or the automobile?\" Moor asked.\n\nMore:Vero Beach area must rally behind review stand, memorial to greatest military veterans\n\nMore:Vero Beach sets meetings to cut 3 lanes, add parking on downtown SR 60; your views sought\n\nNick Slater is TCPalm’s Indian River County Watchdog reporter.

The pumps had been busy, but not overrun with customers, all day, according to the clerk.\n\nA few blocks south, there were still two pallets of bottled water available at the Winn-Dixie at DeBary Commons at the intersection of 17-92 and Highbanks Road, although the shelves behind them had been temporarily stripped bare of gallon jugs of both drinking water and distilled water.\n\nThere, short lines of customers waited to fill shopping carts without any restrictions limiting how many cases could be purchased per shopper.\n\nAsked about the purchase limits that traditionally arrive ahead of a storm, an employee responded, “That will be coming tomorrow.”\n\nThe store also still had plenty of batteries, unless you were looking for a size “D.” And there was still plenty of toilet paper, which has recently become a trendy item to hoard in emergencies.\n\n― Jim Abbott\n\nPalm Coast declares state of emergency\n\nPalm Coast Mayor David Alfin signed a proclamation declaring a local state of emergency for the city as Tropical Storm Idalia threatens Florida.\n\nThe proclamation allows the city to obtain resources on an emergency basis.

The barbershop has repeatedly flooded, as has the rest of Midtown, and was badly damaged by the deluge of water from last year's Tropical Storm Ian.\n\nLast year Harris drove a large, lifted truck into Midtown to help rescue residents trapped by floodwater. He and others also rescued people with boats.\n\n\"I hope we don't get flooded again,\" he said Monday morning.\n\n― Eileen Zaffiro-Kean\n\nDaytona Beach NAACP leader helps Midtown get ready\n\nCynthia Slater, head of Daytona Beach's branch of the NAACP, was busy Monday morning coordinating efforts to get ready for the incoming storm.\n\n\"I sent out a message for people to prepare,\" said Slater, who has lived in the flood-prone Midtown neighborhood for more than 60 years. \"We don't know where it's going, but it's coming. You never know about storms in Florida. It can easily shift.\"\n\nSlater was telling Midtown residents, many of whom are still recovering from last years pair of tropical storms that deluged the neighborhood, to get batteries, flashlights, water, medicine and important papers together.\n\n\"The main thing is to keep an eye on where the storm is going, and know where you can evacuate to if you need to,\" said Slater, who evacuated to Jacksonville last year during Tropical Storm Ian when floodwaters overtook her Midtown home.\n\nShe said she's in touch with the Red Cross and the city of Daytona Beach about emergency measures.\n\n\"A little rain is like a flood in Daytona,\" she said.\n\n― Eileen Zaffiro-Kean\n\nVolusia to open shelters for Tropical Storm Idalia\n\nVolusia County Director of Emergency Management Clint Mecham said the county plans to release details today about opening a couple of shelters for Tropical Storm Idalia.

A new date hasn't been announced. ― Sheldon Gardner\n\nVolusia officials remind residents to be careful with generators\n\nPeople might experience power outages with Tropical Storm Idalia. Those who plan to use a generator should do so safely, and emergency officials in Volusia County shared the following tips:\n\nNever use generators indoors or outside near windows, vents or air intakes that could allow carbon monoxide to come indoors. This can be fatal.\n\nProper ventilation is critical to reducing the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator’s engine exhaust. Carbon monoxide poisoning is a common, serious danger that can cause death if generators are used improperly; this is particularly true when the fuel is not burned completely.\n\nMaintain plenty of air flow space around the generator.\n\nGet fresh air immediately if you begin to feel sick, dizzy or light-headed or experience flu-like symptoms.\n\nBuy a carbon monoxide detector. Because carbon monoxide is invisible and odorless, buy a carbon monoxide detector (similar to or sometimes combined in a smoke detector) to warn of rising carbon monoxide levels.\n\nCarefully follow all instructions on properly “grounding” the generator.\n\nKeep the generator dry. Short circuits may occur in wet conditions, which can cause a generator fire. If needed, place the generator under an open canopy-type structure.\n\nBe prepared. Always keep a fully charged fire extinguisher nearby.\n\nLeave it to the professionals. To avoid electric shock or electrocution, do not try to fix or otherwise work on a generator.\n\nOrganize your cords. Keep cords out of the way to avoid injury, but keep them in plain view to keep track of cord damage (such as fraying or cuts) that could cause a fire.\n\nNever back-feed power. Do not plug the generator into a wall outlet. Back feeding will put you and others, including utility line workers, at serious risk because the utility transformer can increase low voltage from the generator to thousands of volts.\n\nDon’t touch. It’s hot. The exterior portions of a generator, even if operated for only a short period of time, can become hot. Avoid touching the generator without protective gear and keep debris clear to avoid a fire.\n\n― Sheldon Gardner\n\nVolusia businesses prepare for Idalia\n\nAs of late Monday morning, Hurricane Idalia's potential arrival later this week has yet to cause customers to hit the panic button at Daytona Beach area Ace Hardware stores.\n\n\"We've had a lot of phone calls, but no lines at this time,\" said Stacey Crafton, who owns the two Ace Hardware stores in Ormond Beach along with her father Jeff Gross and sister Shannon Woten.\n\n\"It's a good time to have a sales tax holiday. We've already ordered extra supplies but we're already well stocked.\"\n\nCrafton said top-selling items whenever there's a threat of an impending hurricane typically include batteries, gas cans, tarps and Flex Seal (water-resistant) tape.\n\n\"If it (Hurriance Idalia) looks like it's coming this way, it'll pick up, but right now it's business as usual,\" she said.\n\nMark Madden who, along with his daughter Jennifer Allen, owns the Ace Hardware stores in Holly Hill, Daytona Beach Shores and South Daytona, said they have yet to see a rush on hurricane supplies.\n\n\"It's not a panic yet, but our stores are stocking up on supplies just in case,\" he said.\n\n― Clayton Park\n\nTropical Storm Idalia postpones Bunnell Elementary community forum\n\nFlagler Schools has postponed a community forum scheduled for Tuesday due to Tropical Storm Idalia, which has put the county under a tropical storm watch.\n\nInterim Superintendent LaShakia Moore scheduled the forum to bring the community together after Bunnell Elementary called its Black fourth- and fifth-graders into the cafeteria for a PowerPoint presentation to discuss low standardized test scores.\n\nThe district has not yet rescheduled the event. ― Mary Ellen Ritter\n\nVolusia land purchase meeting postponed\n\nThe hearing to discuss a proposal to buy the Tomoka/Ford Marsh property through the Volusia Forever and Florida Forever programs has been postponed.

Tina Kotek declares state of emergency in Lane County\n\nGov. Tina Kotek late Tuesday night declared a state of emergency in Lane County, to support the county’s response and recovery from the severe ice storm that created widespread infrastructure damage and power outages.\n\nThe governor's office said the declaration was issued at the unanimous request of Lane County Board of Commissioners, who also declared a state of emergency Tuesday evening. She directed the Oregon Department of Emergency Management to provide assistance, support a damage assessment, and seek federal resources for recovery and reconstruction due to damages.“This emergency declaration will support the county in accessing critical federal resources to aid in reconstruction and recovery efforts,\" Kotek said in a prepared statement announcing the declaration. \"My office is monitoring the ongoing weather conditions and will continue to support local communities in their response and recovery efforts.”\n\nLane County Board of Commissioners declares emergency\n\nThe Lane County Board of Commissioners unanimously declared a local emergency throughout Lane County Tuesday evening.\n\nCounty Administrator Steve Mokrohisky said the main pieces of an emergency declaration are to recoup costs and to loosen procurement rules.\n\nThe county government, city governments, public utilities and rural fire districts in Lane County have collectively spent more than $2 million to respond to the ice storm. The emergency declaration lets the county commissioners appeal to the governor and president to recoup those costs and it lets Mokrohisky buy supplies or contract for assistance in ways he would normally need commissioner approval for during the next 14 days.\n\nCommissioners approved the emergency declaration with little discussion and thanked county staff.\n\n“All day, on and off, staff has been in meetings working on the logistics of the response,” Commissioner Laurie Trieger said. “I just want to very much appreciate our whole staff, the leadership team, the line staff, the folks who are out in the thick of it: both Lane County staff, but also of course all emergency responders, utility crews, and particularly our sheriff’s office and public works folks.”\n\nThe county has set up a nonemergency call center for the ice storm and recovery efforts. The center is open from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. and can be reached at 541-682-3977. Emergency calls should be directed to 911.\n\nThe City of Springfield also declared an emergency on Tuesday.\n\nState parks closed due to snow and ice\n\nNine Oregon state parks have closed or partially closed due to ice, snow and downed trees along the north coast and in the Willamette Valley.\n\nMore from icy Eugene:Eugene bar offers warming shelter during ice storm\n\nVisitors are encouraged to check park pages on the state parks website before visiting as well as local forecasts and TripCheck for road conditions.\n\nThe current closures include:\n\nSaddle Mountain State Natural Area\n\nElijah Bristow State Park\n\nJasper State Recreation Site\n\nBald Peak State Scenic Viewpoint\n\nDay-use area at Nehalem Bay State Park\n\nVista House in the Columbia River Gorge\n\nCampground at L.L.

The picturesque Northern Colorado city — and frequent \"best of\" list lander — is becoming increasingly known for its quality of life and has a steadily growing population to match.\n\nIt's large enough to have some big city amenities, but hasn't lost the small-town charm that sprinkles its quaint downtown blocks. While Old Town is perfect for a fancy date night among gleaming restaurants and sparkling storefronts, a short drive will take you to an array of no-frills eateries and watering holes fit for an unfussy college town.\n\nYou can often get from your doorstep to a hiking trail in a half hour. Or go entirely pedal-powered on the city's network of bike-friendly streets or bike trails.\n\nKnown for its growing brewery scene, your cup runneth over with craft beer in the Choice City.\n\nWhether you're in the final stages of your Fort Collins research or just starting to looking into making it your adopted home, here's are some tips to make a smoother move.\n\nFinding a place to live\n\nFort Collins' population has quadrupled in the past 50 years, steadily increasing decade-by-decade to an estimated 174,871 residents in 2020, according to the city.\n\nIt's gone from a fledgling Army outpost to a flourishing western college town to a burgeoning city — attracting newcomers to the area with its charming downtown streets, vast network of trails and community feel.\n\n\"It's the quality of life,\" Brandon Wells said when asked what draws people to Fort Collins.\n\n\"It's a beautiful place to live and has some of those core fundamental tenants — low crime rate, good schools — that tend to attract younger families,\" added Wells, president of Fort Collins real estate company The Group Inc.\n\nBut with that desirability comes competition.\n\nSchool choice:How it works in Poudre School District, Fort Collins school\n\nNewcomers to the area, especially those who have moved here during the COVID-19 pandemic, have arrived to a swift and unforgiving housing market, according to Wells.\n\n\"The demand has been so high that properties are moving off the market at a velocity we're not accustomed to,\" Wells said.\n\nMedian prices of detached single-family homes in Fort Collins have nearly doubled in seven years, going from $285,450 in 2014 to $498,750 as of March, according to earlier Coloradoan reports.\n\nFort Collins real estate:5 things home buyers, sellers should do to prepare for housing dogfight\n\nMedian rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Fort Collins has increased an estimated 20% in that same time, according to the latest Colorado Multi-Family Housing Vacancy & Rental Survey. Fort Collins apartments with two bedrooms and one bathroom have seen an increase in median rent of 32% from 2014 to 2020.\n\nAs of mid-2020, 24,351 apartment units were available, a 15% increase from 2014, according to the survey.\n\nBecause of high demand and a lower inventory, finding housing in Fort Collins can present a challenge to those not sure where to look.\n\nGet to know Fort Collins neighborhoods\n\nWhether you're looking for a Bed Bath & Beyond or a century-old dive bar bursting with character and beer memorabilia, Fort Collins has both — you just have to know where to look to find them.\n\nStart here, with this rundown of six distinct, and very different, areas of Fort Collins.\n\nNote: These are loosely defined areas in Fort Collins. Sections of the city not included in a selected area often take on some of the characteristics of its nearby defined areas.\n\nCampus West\n\nBoundaries: Roughly within the rectangle formed by Shields Street, Prospect Road, Overland Trail and Mulberry Street\n\nMedian single family home price in May 2021: $450,000\n\nThe area directly west of Colorado State University’s main campus is a melting pot of decades-old strip malls, newer student housing, restaurant and retail developments, and a network of established neighborhoods with tree-lined streets and single-family homes largely built during Fort Collins’ population boom of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nWhile it’s just a quick drive from Old Town’s bustling shops and restaurants, Campus West has a main drag all its own.\n\nWest Elizabeth Street, from Shields Street to just south of City Park Avenue, is lined with no-fuss bars and restaurants that largely cater to the casual college crowd – think a few pints of beer at quintessential Colorado bike bar Road 34, beer-ritas at Fuzzy’s Taco Shop or a quick chicken shawarma sandwich from the to-go window of legendary Lebanese favorite, Yum Yum Social.\n\nA short bike ride south through the Brown Farm subdivision will take you to Intersect Brewing, a family-friendly spot with a sprawling back patio and weekly trivia and bingo nights. Or head in the other direction and pedal a mile north of Campus West and you’ll find yourself at City Park – home to grassy knolls fit for frolicking, a lake, a public outdoor pool, baseball fields, a city pottery studio and a weekly summer food truck rally.\n\nWhat’s even better? The area’s proximity to the Fort Collins foothills leads to killer views and a shorter drive to all the hiking, biking, swimming, boating and paddling Horsetooth Reservoir and Horsetooth Mountain Open Space have to offer. Just be sure to plan your trip on a weekday or early weekend morning to beat the crowds.\n\nWith an array of student-focused apartment complexes and smaller single-family homes-turned-rentals, Campus West would be a good option for young people planning to live with roommates or small families who want a little space to breathe.\n\nPro tip: If you’re looking to split a house with some roommates in Fort Collins, beware of the city's \"U plus 2\" occupancy ordinance, which prohibits more than three unrelated people from living together. While the polarizing ordinance particularly affects student-heavy areas like Campus West, it is enforced throughout the city.\n\nOld Town\n\nBoundaries: Roughly south of Cherry and Jefferson Streets, west of Stover Street, north of East Laurel and West Mulberry Street and east of Shields Street.\n\nMedian single family home price in May 2021: $625,000\n\nWhen Grace Marroquin and her wife, Nicole, were looking to move from Michigan to Fort Collins earlier this year, they threw themselves into researching the area and getting a feel for the city.\n\nOne of their biggest surprises when they officially made the move? Old Town.\n\n\"We literally watched YouTube videos to pick where to move to in (Colorado) and they didn’t even (do) Old Town justice,\" Marroquin told the Coloradoan, raving about the area's walkability, restaurants and shops.\n\nAs its name implies, the area largely encompasses \"old\" Fort Collins — the city's historic downtown that oozes charm and boasts quaint brick blocks that hearken back to Fort Collins' pioneer town roots.\n\nOld Town is packed with quirky gift shops, bars, eateries and businesses. Want to enjoy a cool Colorado summer night? There's truly nothing better than an ice cream cone or patio beer in the whimsically lighted Old Town Square.\n\nA short walk away, you can also find The Exchange, a new open-air plaza packed with trendy shipping container breweries and restaurants where you can mingle from container to container with a drink in hand.\n\nMusic from donated, painted pianos that passer-by pianists occasionally play can often be hear wafting from Old Town's alleyways. The blast of freight train horns is also a common occurrence — railroad tracks have stitched Northern Colorado together for nearly 150 years and still stop traffic often, especially along Old Town's Mason Corridor.\n\nEven with the trains, Old Town has a one-of-a-kind vibe, which can come at a cost. It's a busy spot on weekends, so prepare to navigate through crowds. And if you're looking to live in the area, its quaint 800-square-foot bungalows largely do not come at quaint 800-square-foot bungalow prices.\n\nWhether you're looking to rent or buy, housing costs can really stack up in Old Town's network of sweet but sought-after streets. You'll really have to dig for an affordable rental, which will likely be a small basement apartment in a house or a unit in one of Old Town's older — and harder to find — multifamily complexes.\n\nMarroquin said she and her wife ended up renting an apartment on the northern edge of Old Town, and finding it took patience and resourcefulness.\n\nIf you can make it work, like Marroquin, enjoy your afternoon grocery strolls to the legendary Beaver's Market, hop on your bike to return a book at Old Town Library and enjoy the view of Fort Collins' restored streetcars, which chug along Mountain Avenue on Saturday and Sunday afternoons every summer.\n\n\"We love it,\" Marroquin said. \"It has a small-town feel, but is still large enough that it has everything you need within a couple miles. And everyone's so nice.\"\n\nPro-tip: If you're hanging out in Old Town on a weekend evening, don't be a hero and try to find street parking. Save yourself a headache and take cover in one of Old Town's pay-to-park garages.\n\nMidtown\n\nBoundaries: Roughly within the square formed by Prospect Road, Lemay Avenue, Harmony Road and Shields Street.\n\nMedian single family home price in May 2021: $480,000\n\nWant in on the action in Fort Collins but don't feel like battling Old Town parking or sharing a bike lane with the youths of Campus West?\n\nHead to Midtown, a sprawling swath of Fort Collins that's home to the city's busiest retail stretch of South College Avenue — and all the bars, restaurants, breweries, shopping and amenities that come with it.\n\nMidtown’s southern border of Harmony Road is home to newer retail strips, big box stores and chain restaurants. Travel north on College Avenue and you can't miss Foothills, Fort Collins’ embattled mall and central Midtown anchor.\n\nDespite a $313 million revitalization in recent years, the mall's fate has been shaky with more storefront vacancies and less visitation than expected. Still, the shopping center boasts big retailers like H&M, Nordstrom’s Rack and Dick’s Sporting Goods.\n\nIt's also home to a city-run gym and recreation hub, Foothills Activity Center, entertainment offerings like the Cinemark Movie Bistro and a sprinkling of new restaurants and modern multifamily housing that has filled in around it.\n\nTravel further north through Midtown and you’ll see an array of grocery stores, coffee shops, drive-thrus and older strip malls with established local eateries like La Creperie & French Bakery, Tortillas Las 4 Americas and Music City Hot Chicken.\n\nDon't feel like driving? Tackle Midtown on the MAX bus, a rapid transit line with a dozen stations and stops that largely fall within Midtown's boundaries. Plan your ride here.\n\nBranched off from the hustle and bustle of Midtown’s main drag, you’ll find quiet established neighborhoods filled with single-family homes and family-friendly parks. Meadowlark, Village East, Scotch Pines, Willow Park and Warren Farms number among them.\n\nPro tip: Escape Midtown traffic by slipping onto the Spring Creek Trail, which cuts through the area’s northern reaches, or the Mason Trail, which runs parallel to College Avenue through Midtown. The Spring Creek Trail is a popular spot and follows the tree-lined curves of the picturesque Spring Creek. Make a day of it and bike or walk to the Gardens on Spring Creek, home to the city’s expansive botanical gardens and butterfly house. Or take it easy at Creekside Park or Spring Park before treating yourself to a blizzard at Midtown’s nostalgic Dairy Queen, 1805 S. College Ave.\n\nNorth Fort Collins\n\nBoundaries: Generally north of Mulberry Street from Overland Trail to Interstate 25\n\nMedian single family home price in May 2021: $470,000; $534,000 (northwest)\n\nOnce home to sprawling farmland, empty industrial lots and sparse businesses along stretches like North College Avenue, the northern reaches of Fort Collins are on the up and up.\n\nAt the edge of north Fort Collins and Old Town, the city's burgeoning river district is becoming a hip new hangout with the recent addition of the Poudre River Whitewater Park — a summer haven for kayakers, tubers and the occasional weekend food truck.\n\nTravel up North College Avenue and you'll find a mix of established and new businesses, including The Lyric, Fort Collins' only independent movie theater, at 1209 N. College Ave. The theater and events space offers a quirky respite from real life, where you can pop in for a movie and beer or plan your weekend around its array of live music or outdoor movie nights.\n\nCraft beer abounds in north Fort Collins with New Belgium Brewing, Odell Brewing, Snowbank Brewing, Horse & Dragon Brewing and Funkwerks spanning from the northern edge of Old Town to the no-frills industrial park further east.\n\nTres Colonias — made up of the tidy rows of homes in the Alta Vista, Andersonville and Buckingham neighborhoods — still stand strong in north Fort Collins around East Lincoln Avenue and East Vine Drive.\n\nAs the longtime home to Fort Collins' Hispanic families and sugar beet farmers, history is around every corner there, including at The Romero House — or Museo del las Tres Colonias — and the city's new Sugar Beet Park, which features a large sugar beet play structure and a nod to the families that farmed the major Northern Colorado cash crop.\n\nTravel further northeast and you'll find newer housing subdivisions replete with families and neighborhood parks. Looking to buy in Fort Collins? This area is a good bet with its decent inventory of single-family homes in neighborhoods like Waterglen, Storybrook and Maple Hill.\n\nWhile tucked away from larger Fort Collins and its amenities, it has easy access to Interstate 25.\n\nIf you don't want to hop on a busy highway, head to Anheuser-Busch for a beer and basket of fish and chips instead. Though its Biergarten is still closed to the public due to COVID-19, the brewery typically boasts fun events like visits from the Budweiser Clydesdales and sparkling arrays of holiday lights each winter.\n\nPro tip: On the hunt for authentic Mexican food in Fort Collins? Look no further than North College Avenue, which is lined with an array of food trucks and taquerías. Also head to Pabre Pancho's, a family-owned Fort Collins fixture that has served up traditional Mexican fare — and the one-of-a-kind enchilada-stuffed burrito, the Paco Macho — since Nixon was president.\n\nSoutheast Fort Collins\n\nBoundaries: Roughly within the square of Lemay Avenue, Prospect Road, Interstate 25 and Harmony Road.\n\nMedian single family home price in May 2021: $548,000\n\nIf you're a busy bee who wants to be a short drive from shopping and restaurants, as well as easy access to Interstate 25, let's talk about southeast Fort Collins.\n\nOnce a no-man's land, the area — especially the corridor along East Harmony Road — has grown tremendously in the last 20 years.\n\nWhile some parts of the city are largely home to single-family houses, southeast Fort Collins has a more diverse mix of apartment and condominium complexes, which are a quick jaunt to the buzzing shopping centers, restaurants and entertainment offerings of the area.\n\nThe Shops at Rigden Farm have almost anything you could need, from a big King Soopers grocery store to a yoga studio, hair salon and popular spots like Krazy Karl's Pizza and William Oliver's Publick House.\n\nAlong the East Harmony Road corridor, you'll find a spread of big box stores and chain restaurants, as well as the Cinemark Fort Collins movie theater and Front Range Village shopping center, which offers everything from a Lowe's Home Improvement to a public library branch.\n\nWhile now home to vast amenities, signs of southeast Fort Collins' agricultural roots remain. Jessup Farm Artisan Village, located just south of Prospect Road along Timberline Road, boasts a network of trendy restaurants and shops that were built out of restored farm buildings from Fort Collins' historic Jessup Farm.\n\nLook hard enough along buzzing Harmony Road and you'll see the nearly century-old Harmony School building as well as Harmony Cemetery, an established pioneer graveyard that once served the former Harmony farming community.\n\nHistory podcast:Wait, Harmony was a town? Kind of...\n\nPro tip: Had your fill of shopping, dining and driving? Get back to southeast Fort Collins' roots by visiting Twin Silo Community Park, 5552-5564 Ziegler Road. It has everything from community gardens and pickleball courts to a BMX park and the city's tallest slide — which extends between two 48-foot-tall farm silos that were relocated to the park from Prospect and Timberline roads.\n\nWest Fort Collins\n\nBoundaries: Roughly within the square of Shields Street, Overland Trail, Vine Drive and Harmony Road (minus the defined Campus West area)\n\nMedian single family home price in May 2021: $483,950 (southwest); $450,000 (midwest); $534,000 (northwest)\n\nTucked against Fort Collins' foothills, the western-most stretches of the city often give off an established, and sometimes untouched, vibe.\n\nWhile home to several single-family housing subdivisions, west Fort Collins is also sprinkled with farmland that can make you feel like you're in the country.\n\nPast its northernmost stretches, you'll find the entrance to Laporte, a small riverside town that's minutes from Fort Collins and offers a notably slower pace. Head there for a slice of pie at Me Oh My or a beer and bluegrass show at The Swing Station.\n\nThe further east you go in the area, the more you'll find more housing subdivisions, multifamily complexes and strip malls filled with different amenities.\n\nThe further west you travel, the closer you are to the slower vibe of Overland Trail and — across it — Horsetooth Reservoir or Horsetooth Mountain Space.\n\nPro tip: Flanked between the foothills and growing subdivisions of newer homes, you'll find The Holiday Twin Drive-In, Northern Colorado's last drive-in movie theater and biggest dose of nostalgia. Head there on a summer night for a double feature and hot dog from its old-fashioned concession stand.\n\nFort Collins rental resources\n\nFor renters, a good place to start is Neighbor to Neighbor's rental resource packet, which lists out dozens of apartment complexes and property management companies in Larimer County — running you through each one's lease terms, rent ranges and deposit, criminal background, credit and pet policies.\n\nNeighbor to Neighbor also offers a community resource guide, a one-stop shop for educational and counseling services, employment help and training, and a guide to child care and after-school programs.\n\nIf you need help with your first month of rent in Larimer County — and qualify through Neighbor to Neighbor — you can apply to the nonprofit's rent assistance program, which provides up to $750 to go toward first month's rent for homeless or near homeless households.\n\nFinding a job in Fort Collins\n\nIf you're looking to secure a job before moving to Fort Collins, or want to better understand the labor landscape before deciding, head to Larimer County's bevy of online resources.\n\nThrough the county, job seekers can find online assistance with career exploration, resume and cover letter writing, interview skills and information on different industries and occupations in the area. Dates for job fairs and hiring events are also posted on the county's website.\n\nCreate a profile on Larimer County's online job board even if you're not a Larimer County resident yet, or set up a free phone or video conference appointment with a county career consultant to get questions answered in real time by a local job search expert.\n\nWhat to know about living in Fort Collins\n\nMoving to a new city can be tough, especially if you don't know your way around or feel like the odd man out during conversations with new friends.\n\nThere are so many Fort Collins tips and tricks to wrangle and, while we can't cover every area of interest, here are some to help you adjust to the city.\n\nA Fort Collins decoder ring\n\nIf you hear these common words or phrases, here's what they mean.\n\nThe Poudre: This is short for the Cache la Poudre River (pronounced cash la pood-er). Fort Collins was founded as a Civil War-era Army outpost along the banks of the river in what is now present-day Laporte. The river is lined with mountain homes, cabins and hiking trails. It’s also your go-to local spot if you want to try whitewater rafting, fly fishing or — once the river is at safe levels — tubing.\n\nThe Mish: Speaking of the Poudre River, you’ll probably hear references to “the Mish,” which is short for Mishawaka Amphitheater. Located on the river’s banks up the Poudre Canyon Highway, Mishawaka Amphitheater is a legendary concert venue and restaurant. The rustic space dates back to 1916, when it was homesteaded by a Fort Collins music shop owner and built as a mountain retreat and dance hall. More than a century later, the Mish still remains a mountain music retreat and boasts a slate of outdoor shows every summer. You don’t have to attend a concert to enjoy it, though. Take a leisurely drive up the Poudre Canyon and stop at The Mish for an afternoon burger and beer on its patio overlooking the rushing river.\n\nHorsetooth: If you keep hearing mentions of a horse's tooth — and you're not hanging around a lot of equine dentists — they're likely references to Horsetooth Mountain or Horsetooth Reservoir. The two spots are super popular options for outdoor recreation just west of Fort Collins. The trek to Horsetooth Mountain — as well as the easier Horsetooth Falls route — is a bucket list hike for Northern Coloradans. Horsetooth Reservoir is a favorite for summer boaters, beach-goers, kayakers and paddle boarders. If you want to get out on the reservoir without breaking the bank, try renting a kayak, hydrobike, canoe or paddle board at the Inlet Bay Marina. Also be prepared to pay a $9 entrance fee to get into the Larimer County land. If you're ready to commit, you can also shell out $90 for an annual pass that will also get you into Larimer County's Carter Lake.\n\nFourteener: Coloradans wear fourteeners, or 14ers, like badges of honor, so what are they? Fourteener is short for a mountain that's peak elevation is at least 14,000 feet. Colorado has 54 of them, and brave hikers and climbers take to them each year to tick another off their list. Do so at your own risk, though. Climbing to such high elevations can lead to altitude sickness, especially for people not used to such heights. If you want to start planning your first fourteener adventure, start here with the Coloradoan's list of five beginner fourteeners as well as these 10 tips from an expert.\n\nNewWestFest: Each nonpandemic summer, Old Town Fort Collins is typically booked solid with weekend events and an array of festivals. None of them really compare in size or scope, however, to Bohemian Nights at NewWestFest. The behemoth festival — often called simply NewWestFest — typically takes over Old Town for a weekend of free live music, activities and vendors in late August. While the COVID-19 pandemic canceled last year's event, festival organizer Bohemian Nights is tentatively planning a pared-down in-person festival for 2021. To keep up with the status of Fort Collins' other summer festivals, check out the Coloradoan's ever-evolving festival tracker.\n\nChoice City: If you read references to \"the Choice City\" or see it on various business signs throughout town, that's just one of the many attempted nicknames for Fort Collins that actually stuck. The origins of the nickname itself are iffy, but possibly come from Fort Collins' \"safe\" location in the state during the Cold War, given its distance from Denver and any fallout from a potential nuclear attack on the major city.\n\nOnline communities to join\n\nIf you're looking to get questions answered about Fort Collins — good mechanic recommendations or tips before tubing the Poudre River — head to public online groups like the Fort Collins subreddit or the Fort Collins Question and Answer Site on Facebook.\n\nIf you're curious about more serious things, like police activity on your street or a power outage affecting your neighborhood, try Fort Collins Neighborhood Watch instead. The Facebook group is open to the public and run by the Coloradoan in partnership with city and school agencies and Fort Collins Police Services.\n\nA fun Facebook group, \"You Know You Grew up In Fort Collins, Colo. If You Remember...\" is your one stop shop for old photo and memories from longtime residents as they reminisce about what Fort Collins used to look like.\n\nOf course, if you want to really immerse yourself in your new home, get a digital subscription to the Coloradoan. During our special offer, you can access our steady stream of Fort Collins news for just $1 for your first six months. Not only will you be staying up to date on all things Fort Collins, you'll be supporting local news. A win-win!\n\nA history lesson\n\nWant to dive into the history of your adopted home? Binge the Coloradoan's local history podcast, \"The Way it Was,\" which takes on topics from the bright and cheery — and dark and dreary — chapters of Fort Collins' past.\n\nAlso be sure to check in weekly for Coloradoan columnist Barbara Fleming's latest history column. After writing hundreds of columns for the Coloradoan, I once asked Fleming — while researching a story about her life — if she was afraid of ever running out of column topics. She gave me a resounding \"no,\" guaranteeing you're in for plenty more historical lookbacks from Fleming.\n\nSome food recommendations\n\nThe Coloradoan rounds up new Fort Collins restaurants monthly, but if you're looking to try classic spots in the city, here are a few recommendations:\n\nStopping in Old Town? Cinnamon rolls at the Silver Grill Cafe — Fort Collins' oldest restaurant — is a must. A short walk up Linden Street will take you to longtime Mexican favorite El Burrito, and further down Mountain Avenue you'll find The Rio, another Mexican restaurant known for its margaritas.\n\nFeeling fancy? Hit up The Regional for its happy hour or venture down Mountain Avenue to cozy neighborhood spot, little on mountain. If you're looking for Old Town watering holes, try The Town Pump, a tiny dive bar that's been on South College Avenue for more than a century and teems with kitschy character as a result. Or head underground to Ace Gillett's Supper Club & Lounge or to Social — two different downtown cocktail bars — if you're looking for a speakeasy vibe.\n\nNear CSU's main campus, try out unpretentious lunch spots like The Colorado Room, which serves up plates of tasty sliders and poutine; Avogadro's Number, a local favorite known for its expansive menu, live music offerings and picturesque back patio; and Saigon Grill III, a must-stop for steaming bowls of pho.\n\nFar from the maddening Old Town crowds, head to Midtown for gems like The Fox and the Crow cheese shop and bistro; Cafe Mexicali, a Tex-Mex favorite among the college crowd; and Totally 80's Pizza, a wacky yet one-of-a-kind pizza shop that's part 1980s museum.\n\nFor an unfussy atmosphere in south Fort Collins, head to DC Oakes Brewhouse and Eatery for burgers and beers or Sally's Kitchen — located in a Timberline Road gas station — for some Chinese food to rave about.\n\nThe start of your social calendar\n\nAs in-person events reemerge amid loosened COVID-19 restrictions, get out and enjoy all that the Fort Collins area has to offer. The Choice City — you know what that means because you read this guide, yay! — boasts endless activities, events and festivals to try. Here are some you must mark down.\n\nFind a festival: See Fort Collins through its various summer festivals, including food and music festival Taste of Fort Collins, live music behemoth Bohemian Nights at NewWestFest, the cute-as-can-be Fort Collins Peach Festival and the wacky and weird New Belgium bike parade, Tour de Fat. All of these typically take place each summer, so be sure to get them on your schedule this season.\n\nTake a trolley ride: If Old Town Fort Collins couldn't get any cuter, just hang out on Mountain Avenue each summer weekend. A pair of restored streetcars — both of which were used when Fort Collins had an active streetcar system — regularly chug from City Park up Mountain Avenue from 12 to 5 p.m. each Saturday and Sunday from May through September.\n\nCatch a concert: I told you all about concerts at Mishawaka Amphiteatre, but if you're looking to hear some tunes without heading out of town, try some free summer concert series like the Lagoon Summer Concert Series, Thursday Night Live or the FoCoMX Drive and Jive series at The Holiday Twin Drive-In.\n\nHead out on a hike: You officially know what a fourteener is. If you're wanting to work up to one, though, start out easy with some of these recommended hikes in Northern Colorado. If you're looking for something for the family, try these five family-friendly hikes. And if you've been in Fort Collins for a bit and are already burnt out on hiking Horsetooth Mountain, take a whack at these.\n\nAwait Old Town's holiday lights: Each winter, Old Town Fort Collins turns into a snowglobe when thousands of LED lights are strung around its tree-lined blocks and illuminated nightly. The tradition of decorating Old Town with holiday lights dates back to the 1920s and has since become a beloved market of the holiday season. The lights are typically turned on during a lighting ceremony in November and stay up in Old Town through Valentine's Day.\n\nErin Udell reports on news, culture, history and more for the Coloradoan.

Rochester stands as one of the prime locations to witness the breathtaking Great North American Solar Eclipse, where the moon will align perfectly with the sun. Anticipation is high as tens of thousands of sky watchers are expected to flock to the Flower City to witness this celestial spectacle. We’ll be providing updates throughout the day, including information, sights, scenes, photos, and videos. Follow along for an unforgettable experience.\n\nHospitals along eclipse path ramp up preparedness efforts\n\nHospitals along the solar eclipse path of totality, including the Rochester area, executed on emergency preparedness plans put in place last summer. Select medical providers closed for the day as elective surgeries and care were canceled due to the celestial event. Some emergency departments and urgent cares boosted staffing to deal with potential added patient demands linked to the spike in tourists and traffic, while health systems statewide maintained mass casualty incident posture under state Department of Health guidance.\n\nDoctors also braced for an uptick in eye injuries due to unprotected eclipse viewing, though prior eclipse events, such as in 2017, didn’t result in a surge in blinded patients. Concerns about overstimulated patients suffering mental health crises or eclipse anxiety and sickness – ranging from fatigue and balance issues to flu-like symptoms – also helped shape some strategies.\n\nWebster teacher's solar eclipse pact fulfilled as former students reunite\n\nIn the 1970s, Webster teacher Patrick Moriarty, then in his 20s, made a pact with students that he wasn’t sure they’d ever keep. He asked them to meet him in 2024 - then a lifetime away for the teenage students - for the next total solar eclipse in Rochester. But on Tuesday, nearly 100 of his students from 16 years of teaching science at local schools took him up on the invite. They showed up in droves at Moriarty’s Brighton home with their camping chairs, cookies, champagne and specially-made t-shirts, ready to take in the rare celestial event.\n\n“When he said we were going to meet for the eclipse and he held true to it, here we are,” said Ric Mintz, of Penfield, who was a student in Moriarty’s first science class at Webster in 1978.\n\nThen in his 20s with long sideburns, Moriarty handed out sheets to students that showed eclipses over the coming decades, and told them to mark this one on the calendar, Mintz said. Now in his late 60s, Moriarty, standing with a corded microphone in his driveway, said the moment of gathering with his former students was less about the eclipse itself, and more about the people who surrounded him.\n\n“It’s not about the eclipse. It’s about you guys being here, sharing this time with my family, me and each other. I wish every educator had this,” he said.\n\nRochester home-schooled 12-year-old aids NASA, documents eclipse experience\n\nJosiah Tapp, a home-schooled Rochester 12-year-old, had an eclipse experience with his two siblings unlike that of most kids his age. He helped gather data for NASA as the moon came in front of the sun and turned Rochester fully dark for three minutes Monday afternoon. He and 14-year-old sister Rehani and 9-year-old brother Manuel took steps like monitoring the drop in temperature as the sun’s light became obscured. They were to upload the data for a NASA program called GLOBE. Separately, the children observed the eclipse’s effects on the family’s chickens and on a tortoise.\n\n“They woke up pretty curious,” father Reuben Tapp said of his children. Josiah looked at the sun Monday morning when it was still evident in the sky, he said.\n\nJosiah has been part of The Avenue Blackbox Theatre’s STEAM2Stage programs, which encourage early engagement with science, technology, math and other school subjects as well as promoting pathways to careers in the arts and in technology, Avenue founder Reenah Golden said. She said Josiah is one of the youngest theater technicians in Rochester and will operate sound for a production of ‘Steal Away” by Ramona King at The Avenue on Thursday.\n\nWhen totality came, of course, cloud cover meant all those eclipse glasses the Tapps and the rest of us obtained were of no use. If other parts of the country could look up and see the round moon blocking the sun, Rochestarians could not.\n\n“We wanted to see what we could see with them on, which was absolutely nothing,” Reuben Tapp said afterward of the glasses.\n\nRochesterians adapt to eclipse disappointment amidst cloudy skies\n\nWith a cloud-covered sky, the eclipse was not visible in Henrietta. But the moon covered the sun anyway, pitching the afternoon into darkness. Across the Tinker Nature Park, frogs croaked and birds sang, and the people lit up the dark with the light of their phones, clamoring to take photos of the sky as dark as midnight. As the sky lightened, streaks of pink raced across the clouds, and it began to mist. Kaitlyn Gargano watched the eclipse with her sister Sarah Gargano.\n\n“It would have been nice to see it, but it was really Rochesterian,\" Sarah Gargano said of the cloud coverage.\n\nJason Reynolds described the eclipse as similar to a wedding.\n\n“It was kind of like a wedding where there’s so much build up, and then it’s over,\" Reynolds said.\n\nReynolds added, “I’m like let the party go on.\"\n\nSolar eclipse time lapse video from Rochester NY\n\nRochester NY eclipse watchers experience moments of magic amidst cloudy skies\n\nThe energy at Ontario Beach Park was peaking around 1 p.m. Monday. Footballs were flying, children were laughing and longtime Rochester friends Salvadora Guzman and Arinda Molina-Collins were cranking out the late-‘70s Pandora tunes while sipping red wine. The two arrived by 10:30 a.m. “We wanted to get a nice spot to experience this,” said Arinda Molina-Collins, 57.\n\n“And it’s great people watching,” added Guzman, 59, as Michael Jackson’s “Rock with You” played. “It’s gonna clear up.”\n\nThen the optimism dissipated with every passing hour – and with every new layer of clouds. Forecasts had called for cloudy skies but many remained optimistic, especially with brilliant blue skies Saturday and Sunday.\n\n“The hope was to make this the first one,” said Kyubum Shim, 26, a Ph.D student in electrical engineering at Cornell University. “It’s a natural phenomenon and we won’t see one for the next for 20 years.”\n\nThe sky from the southwest slowly became darker, like a storm moving in. And by 3 p.m., gloom had set in too. The sun wasn’t even visible. Then it happened: The sky darkened faster than it does after sunset, and cheers erupted by 3:20 p.m. as darkness set in. People hollered, screamed, whistled and wooooed as fireworks exploded in the distance.\n\n“It’s nighttime, wow!” exclaimed Jason Christides, 49, who was with Josette Cicacci, 39, both of Philadelphia.\n\nThen as quickly as the sky went dark, the light returned even faster. Molina-Collins raised her arms in triumph.\n\n“It’s one of those things you can’t imagine,” she said. “You can’t fully capture it on camera. It was amazing. We obviously didn’t get the full experience but we actually did. The whole darkness and how everyone was feeling, the vibe, it was incredible.”\n\nEclipse event draws families, music and enthusiasts despite overcast skies in Henrietta NY\n\nIn the hour leading up to the eclipse, a teen strummed folksy tunes on a guitar. Children chased after their parents on the grass in front of the guitar player and his accompanying drummer, and adults chatted around telescopes, hoping to catch a view of the eclipse in mere minutes. The Tinker Nature Center's events were the largest in Henrietta on Monday. As an education center, the crew wanted to do the once-in-a-lifetime event justice, said Emily Bradford, assistant director of Tinker Nature Park.\n\n“This is a good time to come and bring your family and see the eclipse,\" Bradford said.\n\nLaura Olivares, a high school Spanish teacher from New York City, traveled more than five hours to make the event. Olivares said she woke up in the middle of the night last week, did a deep YouTube dive on eclipses and became determined to see Monday’s event. Patti Pirz, who owns The Bird House in Rochester, brought her telescopes to Tinker.\n\n“We're having a blast. We’re hoping,\" Pirz said, gesturing toward the overcast sky.\n\n“It’s something that I won’t ever see again in my lifetime,\" Pirz added.\n\nFor Tony Kemmer, this outing marked the first time he has been in public since the pandemic.\n\n“We don’t get out that often, and to me, it’s special because it’s my first time out after COVID,\" Kemmer said. He later added, “It’s very exciting to be a part of this.\"\n\nRochester freshman embraces campus eclipse picnic despite cloudy skies\n\nUniversity of Rochester freshman Caleb Granda, a mechanical engineering student from Massachusetts has never seen the campus’s main quad fronting Rush Rhees Library as jam-packed with students as it is Monday afternoon. It has become a giant picnic, complete with blankets, snacks, music and the obligatory tossing of Frisbees and footballs. Sadly, for Granda and for the throng of thousands, the Rochester sky is filled with clouds within an hour of the 3:20 p.m. time of totality.\n\n“I’m expecting some darkness for three minutes,” Granda said, and not much else.\n\nDespite the overcast skies, Granda saw a silver lining.\n\n“I think it’s bringing the campus together,” he said of the eclipse. “Very cool.”\n\nEclipse-themed doughnuts a hit at Donuts Delite in Rochester NY\n\nDuring the lunch rush on eclipse day, trays of chocolate eclipse-themed doughnuts soared above the heads of busy workers behind the counter at Donuts Delite. With the line extending out the door, the convergence of the lunchtime rush and eclipse excitement was evident. As one of the few cities in New York in the path of totality on Tuesday, Rochester became a focal point for visitors from across the region. Businesses had been gearing up for weeks to seize the opportunity presented by this rare event, knowing that the next total eclipse visible from the U.S. won’t occur until 2044, with the path of totality bypassing the Northeast.\n\nBehind the counter, Deanna DeNoto offered eclipse glasses to young Khani Casanova, 5, of Rochester, emerging with a handful of pink, Donuts Delite-branded glasses. Brittnay Henderson, from Rochester, and Jeremy Klace, from the Buffalo area, proudly displayed their Donuts Delite haul, including Galaxy and Solar Eclipse doughnuts.\n\nThe trays of eclipse-themed doughnuts joined the lineup of \"Galaxy\" doughnuts in the glass-fronted cabinet. The Eclipse doughnuts boasted a generous dollop of bluish icing with a smaller swirl of yellow, topped with an oversized Oreo cookie that made them unmistakable from the front door.\n\nOwner Nick Semeraro revealed that Donuts Delite had been tirelessly producing doughnuts almost around the clock for days, with Semeraro himself clocking 17- or 18-hour days through the weekend. He estimated they had already sold thousands. The unique designs stemmed from the bakery's reputation for creative flair, with final concepts emerging from brainstorming sessions involving Semeraro, his wife, and sons.\n\nRochester solar eclipse 2024: Watch livestream of historic eclipse from path of totality\n\nRochester NY solar eclipse: Photos from Lake Ontario\n\nSolar eclipse 2024 photos: The sun watchers in Rochester NY\n\nTotal eclipse 2024: Scenes from downtown Rochester NY\n\nDogtown in Rochester NY draws eclipse crowd\n\nThe line at Dogtown, \"where the best hot dogs live,\" stretched more than 37 people before noon on Monday. Eclipse-goers in cars stretched up Monroe Avenue and blocked a whole lane of traffic. Logistics and, well, weiners were on their minds. Emotions on the patio and inside were ebullient. A group of college-age youths piled into garbage plates, a Hawaiian dog and a Golden Retriever. Of course, the hots got the best reviews. \"The bread is so good,\" moaned a student wearing pink anime ears. \"This is what my parents worked so hard for,\" she said, with a giggle. Inside, a Shih Tzu — a visitor not a lunch order — waited patiently for its bun. Every seat and open space inside was filled with people. The Dogtown cashier sent back order after order. Saturday night set records for the business. Today, for the total solar eclipse event? \"This is going to be the greatest day in Dogtown history. Probably. At least for a Monday!\"\n\nRochester barber shrugs off eclipse hype on Monday\n\nRamon Rayford has owned Mass Appeal barber shop at 515 East Main St. for about 10 years. To him, today is just another Monday, made special only by his father’s 81st birthday.\n\n“I think it’s overhyped,” he said Monday morning of the afternoon’s total solar eclipse.\n\n“I don’t think it’s going to change much of anything going on,” Rayford said. “I think people are making a big deal out of nothing.”\n\nStill, he’ll see if the event in the sky is of significance to his father on his birthday. And when totality arrives at 3:20 p.m., Rayford allowed, “I’m going to see what happens.”\n\n2024 Eclipse excitement takes over Henrietta Senior Center\n\nEighty Monroe County residents gathered at the Henrietta Senior Center, many donning shirts emblazoned with 2024 Eclipse. They were at the center for the lunch it offers every Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, but everyone was talking about the solar eclipse. Florence Brown and Julie Adams sat together at a table, where they examined eclipse-themed artwork from area students. They agreed that the one with the aliens was the best. Both women plan to watch the eclipse. Adams lives in an apartment complex and is taking extra solar-protected glasses from the center to her neighbors.\n\n“It’s history in the making,\" Brown said.\n\nAdams said it may be her last time to see a solar eclipse, and she wanted to make the most of it. At a table across the cafeteria, Goody Freed was less impressed.\n\n“I don’t know what, it goes dark. It gets light again,\" Freed said, adding that he did not see what all the fuss was about.\n\nMany other residents are excited, said Nicole Bubel, the assistant recreation leader at the center. The center's staff has been leading up to the eclipse for a year. Jessie Daniel said she was praying for a clear sky, so she could see the total eclipse.\n\n“I hope the Lord let the sun come out, so we can see it. That’s what I’m praying for,\" Daniel said.\n\nSolar eclipse photos: Images from around Rochester NY as eclipse nears\n\nFrom Baltimore to Rochester: Family fulfilling solar eclipse promise\n\nWhen Maze Pelham of Baltimore was a fifth-grader, he watched news of the 2017 solar eclipse and vowed he would be present in person for the next solar eclipse of note. That eclipse, and that day, has come. And this is why he and his parents, Janice and Sonney Pelham, left Maryland around 1 Monday morning to make the nearly seven-hour drive to Rochester.\n\n“I said to myself I would go to the next one,” Maze Pelham said while seated with his parents on lawn chairs at downtown Rochester’s Parcel 5 park. “It’s a promise I made to myself.”\n\nWhy did the Pelhams choose Rochester as their viewing spot? Maze Pelham did his research and found the city’s Parcel 5 eclipse-watching plans.\n\n“It’s got all the amenities,” he said, referring to temporary bathrooms and food trucks. And the view of Monday afternoon’s eclipse looking to the south is ideal, he said.\n\nAnd when the moment comes, Maze Pelham plans to shift his gaze back and forth between the celestial wonder in the sky and the look of his surroundings, filled with many hundreds of people with whom he is sharing this awe-inspiring moment in the heart of a city his family and he had never visited but will always cherish.\n\nSolar eclipse photos: Images from around the U.S.\n\nRochester's South Wedge comes alive with coffee and eclipse talk\n\nBy mid-morning, the South Wedge was finally waking up. The skateboarders had passed through, the delivery trucks had left for now and the line started to snake around for coffee inside LGBTQ+ hangout coffeeshop Equal Grounds. Inside the excited chatter rose and people were patient with the wait. Gregory Alan Rogers, 71, walked off the tidy street and past the city's namesake, Nathaniel Rochester, who had purchased land here after the Revolutionary War and laid out the orderly grid of early avenues. Rogers sat on cold stone, like Rochester, and unlike him was eating a blueberry muffin. The birds noticed.\n\n\"Beautiful day,\" he said. \"Sixty degrees!\" The Indiana man was in town again to see a friend. He had come a long way and had brought his solar eclipse glasses: three pairs. Was he going to wear all the pairs at once? \"One at a time,\" Rogers said laughing. He unbent his long frame and walked into the day, leaving sparrows and Colonel Rochester to their morning.\n\nWhat's the difference between a lunar eclipse and a solar eclipse?\n\nThe major difference between the two eclipses is in the positioning of the sun, the moon and the earth and the longevity of the phenomenon, according to NASA.\n\nA lunar eclipse can last for a few hours, while a solar eclipse lasts only a few minutes. Solar eclipses also rarely occur, while lunar eclipses are comparatively more frequent. While at least two partial lunar eclipses happen every year, total lunar eclipses are still rare, says NASA.\n\nAnother major difference between the two is that for lunar eclipses, no special glasses or gizmos are needed to view the spectacle and one can directly stare at the moon. However, for solar eclipses, it is pertinent to wear proper viewing glasses and take the necessary safety precautions because the powerful rays of the sun can burn and damage your retinas.\n\nRochester's Ontario Beach Park buzzing with solar eclipse excitement\n\nSean Tudisco of Rochester usually takes his daily walks at Ontario Beach Park after 2 p.m. But Monday, he was on the park’s Charlotte Pier by 7:15 a.m.\n\n“I figured I’d get out early today because I knew it would be crowded later,” said Tudisco, 41, a Best Buy installer. “Yesterday it was jampacked.”\n\nThe park is often filled during the summer but not this time of year, he said. The eclipse has drawn out-of-towners from across the U.S. and Canada, he said.\n\n“I started driving around the parking lot Sunday and saw license plates from all over,” he said, naming off states including Georgia, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maine, Pennsylvania and New Jersey.\n\nNear the park entrance, Donald Dedie set up a stand where he was selling necklaces and bracelets and posted a sign for face paint - $7 for children and $9 for adults. Dedie said he paints the moon, stars, crosses and may try facepainting a sun for the eclipse. He even camped out overnight, arriving at 4 p.m. Sunday.\n\n“I have my comforter and laid right here,” he said, pointing to the ground where he slept.\n\nHis spot didn’t last long, though, as a county worker asked him to leave unless he had a permit.\n\n“That’s a bummer,” said Dedie, 57, of Rochester.\n\nDedie relocated just outside the park entrance, selling his creations and painting faces.\n\n“That was a blessing for me to move,” he said. “It’s a perfect spot.”\n\nSolar eclipse 2024 preparations continue in Rochester, New York\n\nHow will your dog react during the eclipse?\n\nJeff Reibert, pet supplies buyer for CountryMax, a New York-based farm supply and feed store said in a release that on a normal day, dogs don’t try to look at the sun, making it unlikely they will during the eclipse. But like their human counterparts if they do there could be damage to their eyes. The advice is to keep pets inside during the eclipse. He noted to watch for excessive barking, cowering or signs of stress.\n\nRochester NY weather: Solar eclipse forecast for April 8, 2024\n\nThe possibility of clear skies in Rochester for the April 8 solar eclipse remains, although it's quite slim, as indicated by multiple weather sources.\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service in Buffalo, the Rochester airport location is forecasted to have an 82% cloud cover at 3 p.m. The total coverage of the sun by the moon, lasting just over three minutes, is expected to begin at 3:20 p.m.\n\nAs for the AccuWeather forecast for Rochester, it predicts a RealFeel temperature of 63 degrees in the sun this afternoon, with mostly cloudy conditions. The afternoon cloud cover chance is estimated at 87%, with an 18% chance of precipitation. However, there's no measurable precipitation in the forecast.\n\nWhat time is eclipse in Rochester NY?\n\nStarting at 2:07 p.m. April 8 in Rochester, the moon will begin to appear to move in front of the sun. Totality begins at 3:20 p.m. and will last for 3 minutes and 38 seconds (plus or minus a few seconds depending where you are standing.) By 4:33 p.m. the moon will have moved past the sun returning the light to normal.\n\nWhere is the best place to see the solar eclipse in Rochester NY?\n\nThe best places to witness the eclipse in Rochester include open parks or waterfront areas with unobstructed views of the sky. Here are some ideal locations for experiencing the celestial event in our area.\n\nHigh Falls\n\nParcel 5\n\nCobbs Hill Park\n\nHighland Park\n\nGenesee Valley Park\n\nOntario Beach Park.\n\nThe Rochester Museum and Science Center on East Avenue is also hosting a Roc the Eclipse Festival.\n\nElsewhere in Monroe County, suggested viewing sites include:\n\nMendon Ponds Park\n\nDurand-Eastman Park\n\nThe campus at the State University College at Brockport\n\nHamlin Beach State Park\n\nYou can also watch the eclipse online. NASA and other organizations will create a link for live eclipse viewing closer to the event.\n\nAre schools closed due to solar eclipse in Rochester, New York?\n\nYes, schools in the Rochester region will be closed on the day of the eclipse.\n\nThe eclipse is scheduled to occur on the Monday following a week-long spring break in Rochester, coinciding with the time when most classes are typically dismissed for the day.\n\nConsequently, most Rochester area school districts have chosen to extend their spring break by a day and have canceled classes on April 8.\n\nBrighton Central School District had initially planned a half-day for students on April 8 but tweaked the school calendar to cancel classes on the day of the eclipse. Until this change, Brighton was the lone Monroe County public school district that asked students and staff to report on April 8 for instruction.\n\nHow to record, photograph solar eclipse with smartphone or camera\n\nFollow the solar eclipse path of totality 2024\n\nWhat time is the total solar eclipse 2024 across the US", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/chrysler/2015/06/16/italy-fca-fiat-chrysler-snavely-blog-trip-alfa-/28826399/", "title": "Final thoughts after nine days in Italy", "text": "Brent Snavely\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\nThis is an occasional blog chronicling my adventures in Italy.

With this blog, I will provide updates along the way about my experiences.\n\n\n\n\n\nDay 9, June 25: Leaving Italy\n\nWell folks, this is it. My last day in Italy.\n\nWhile I am happy to be heading home, there is a lot I will miss about Italy. Here, I offer a few general thoughts and observations about this country and its culture:\n\nThe drivers: Italians are crazy drivers. They give each other precious little space when traffic is congested, frequently stop just inches away from the car in front of them, and turn whenever they damn well feel like it. Fortunately, I did not have to do any driving here.\n\nThe parking: Parking in most cities is difficult to find. The result: Italians park their small cars anywhere and everywhere. It would simply be impossible to own a full-size pickup truck or SUV here. You would not find a place to park it in a city.\n\nParking in most cities is difficult to find. The result: Italians park their small cars anywhere and everywhere. It would simply be impossible to own a full-size pickup truck or SUV here. You would not find a place to park it in a city. What they drive : Of course there are Fiat's and Alfa Romeo's everywhere. But the big surprise? Peugeot Citroën. This is a company that has zero presence in the U.S., so we never see these cars. But in Italy? Cars made by the French automaker are surprisingly popular.\n\n: Of course there are Fiat's and Alfa Romeo's everywhere. But the big surprise? Peugeot Citroën.

Scooters and small motorcycles: For many Italians, the smallest car isn't small enough. In both Milan and Naples scooters and motorcycles nearly outnumber the cars. Simply seeing how the Italians drive and park their cars has provided me with a vastly deeper appreciation for the reasons behind their preference for smaller cars.\n\nFor many Italians, the smallest car isn't small enough.

Airports and trains: Italian airports are surprisingly lax on security and confusing. I clearly have some work to do to become an adept international traveler. And Let's just leave it at that. I also experienced my first trip on a high speed train this week in a trip from Bologna to Naples. The train station and the train was clean and efficient. I had a comfortable seat, free Wi-Fi and was served a nice cup of free espresso.\n\nItalian airports are surprisingly lax on security and confusing.

The coffee: Speaking of the coffee,I knew I would get lots of great coffee in Italy and I wasn't disappointed.In Italy, you can get top-notch cappuccino and espresso in the airport, at roadside gas stations, on trains and at most hotel bars.

I had Starbucks coffee on the my flight back to Detroit and it tasted weak. The meat and cheese: Most hotel breakfasts offer wide range cured meat including Prosciutto, Parma Ham and Capocollo along with amazing cheese. I will miss my quick but filling breakfasts of meat, cheese and sometimes some yogurt and fresh fruit.\n\nFinally, a word of thanks to any and all readers who have kept up with this blog or have just occasionally checked it out. It took some work after some very long days but I enjoyed the opportunity to share my experiences and observations and hope that this format provided some value.\n\nDay 8, June 24:Alfa Romeo's rebirth\n\nWhat would you do if you were tasked with the challenge of hosting the perfect event to symbolize the resurrection of a once-great Italian brand known for its design and racing prowess?\n\nWould you see if famous opera singer Andrea Bocelli is available? That's exactly what Fiat Chrysler Automobiles did Wednesday to unveil the Alfa Romeo Giulia.\n\nBocelli's appearance shocked the crowd and his performance, which occurred as the Giulia was unveiled, drew a standing ovation from the hundreds who attended.\n\nBocelli gave the event the quintessential Italian flair that served to drive home the point that FCA CEO Sergio Marchionne made during his speech earlier -- that Alfa Romeo must draw on its roots as an Italian brand to be successful.\n\nThe hourlong event in Milan was heavy on style and and culture and bold statements even as details about the new car were sparse. Because of that, I predict that you will see grumbling from the automotive media in the coming days and weeks about all of the questions that remain unanswered about the Giulia.\n\nAnd, of course, it will be months before we know how the car really drives, how the company plans to market it in the U.S., if there are enough dealers to support the sales goals or if its quality is truly comparable to the likes of Audi, BMW or Mercedes-Benz.\n\nBut all of those questions miss the point of Wednesday's event in Milan. This was about more than simply revealing a new car. This event was designed to lay out the philosophical context behind the company's decision to spend 5 billion euro ($5.6 billion) over five years in an attempt to turn a struggling brand into a global contender.\n\n\"Alfa Romeo is our Turandot,\" Marchionne said, in reference to the famous opera by Giacomo Puccini, completed by Franco Alfano. \"It is a masterpiece that has been a long time in coming.\"\n\nThe other important message delivered by Marchionne and FCA Chairman John Elkann on Wednesday was aimed straight at Italians who have been worried for years that the automaker is abandoning Italy.\n\nElkann, great-great-grandson of Fiat founder Giovanni Agnell, later told those attending a dinner at the museum that followed the event that founding family remains committed to making cars and remains committed to Italy. Elkann also was one of several of the Agnelli family members who attended the event.\n\nThe Giulia will be produced in the southern Italy plant in Cassino. It is one of several plants in Italy that will produce Alfa Romeo's, Maserati's or Jeeps as Marchionne tries to turn Italy into an automotive export hub rather than a producer of lower priced Fiat cars.\n\nThere is skepticism about Marchionne's plan because a number previous efforts to revive Alfa Romeo have fallen flat.\n\nBut whatever happens, this much is clear: This plan is rooted in Italy's deepest hopes and dreams.\n\n\"From ice princess and perennial quest to a triumph of art and passion,\" Marchionne said. \"(Alfa Romeo) will once again be one of the leading symbol of Italian engineering and style, an icon of Italy's technological excellence and creative spirit.\"\n\nDay 7, June 23: Milan\n\nWe are now in Milan, Italy's financial and fashion capital. This city, with it's bustling downtown and congested traffic, feels more like New York than any other city we've been in.\n\nThe fashion consciousness of Italians also was more evident here than anywhere I have been this week. And, as you can see, the street entertainers here bring a level of creativity that is beyond anything you see in America.\n\nMilan also is the birthplace of Alfa Romeo, which was founded in 1910, and the reason for this trip. On Wednesday, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles will reveal the Alfa Romeo Giulia, the first of what is expected to be a total of eight new cars and crossovers that will be introduced by 2018.\n\nThe most impressive structure in Milan is the Duomo di Milano -- a massive cathedral with stunning attention to detail that took hundreds of years to complete. And while I have seen my share of impressive churches this week, this may be the most stunning of all.\n\nWe took an elevator up several floors and then climbed, huffing and puffing, up several more floors as we ascended marble stairs and looked out over the city of Milan.\n\nDay 6, June 22: Melfi\n\nThe Jeep Renegade may have been designed in America, but here in Melfi, where it is made, it is obvious that the new SUV has quickly become a source of pride for Italian workers as well as a godsend when it comes to jobs.\n\n\"American styling, Italian heart,\" is the theme of a poster that Italian workers crafted after a one-week training course.\n\nThe poster symbolizes how Italian workers have fully and seriously embraced the challenge of making Jeep SUVs for America and the rest of the world, said Bartolomo Callari, the plant's body shop manager.\n\n\"They are very proud,\" Callari said of the workers.\n\nWe arrived at the Jeep plant in Melfi, a town in Italy's southern half, at about 9 a.m. eager to see how the Italians make the Jeep Renegade and what they think about the Jeep brand.\n\nBut frankly, the tour far exceeded expectations. The pride of the workers was immediately clear because the plant was spotless. And by spotless, I mean that the blue floors with white stripes looked as clean as a car after it is waxed and buffed.\n\nUnderstand that I say this fully knowing that American automotive workers will probably recoil and will say that their automotive plants are just as clean. But I will tell you from experience, from having toured multiple Ford, Chrysler, Nissan and Mercedes-Benz plants in the U.S., that FCA's plant in Melfi is the cleanest mass-production plant that I've ever seen.\n\nTo understand this plant and the way the workers have embraced the Jeep brand, it's necessary to understand where this plant is and its history.\n\nSince it opened in 1992 the Melfi plant mostly made the Fiat Punto -- a successful small car sold in Europe.\n\nBut as a deep recession hit Europe in 2010, workers here feared for their jobs as auto sales plummeted. And workers at the Melfi plant had it worse than autoworkers elsewhere because there is little else here when it comes to manufacturing. Even today, unemployment in southern Italy for workers under 35 is close to 30%.\n\nBut then FCA CEO Sergio Marchionne, who was looking both for a way to turn Jeep into a larger global brand and a way to keep the company's Italian plants producing cars, decided to invest 1.8 billion euro to renovate and retool the plant to build the Jeep Renegade and the Fiat 500X.\n\nSuddenly, this plant became the first to benefit directly and substantially from the combination of Fiat and Chrysler. The workers also understand that Jeep is an internationally recognized brand from America that symbolizes toughness.\n\n\"There is a pride here to make Jeep because it is American,\" said Gianfranco Cinquefiori, manager plant's stamping division.\n\nMelfi's workers celebrated the start of production for the Renegade in September.\n\nToday, the plant employs 7,690 workers and churns out an average of 1,450 Jeep Renegade SUVs, Fiat 500 crossovers and Fiat Puntos per day.\n\nAnother 3,330 work for 18 suppliers at an adjacent supplier park.\n\n\"Two years ago, because of lower production volume, the workers were working about one week per month,\" said Ennico Meccia, manager of the final assembly shop at the plant. \"Now, we work 20 shifts per week and operate seven days per week,\"\n\nThe renovation, he said, \"was a dramatic change in the life of the people of this region in southern Italy.\"\n\nDay 4, June 20: Naples\n\nNaples is a port city, a prime tourist destination, a city filled with centuries of deep -- and at times painful -- history, a city of wealth and a city of poverty.\n\nHere, the \"newer\" churches are several hundred years old. These churches soar majestically into the air. Inside, stained glass and marble shimmer in gold and silver.\n\nThese churches bring Catholicism alive in a deeply mystical and vibrant way that goes far beyond the way most Americans experience Christianity.\n\nSettled long ago by the Greeks, conquered later by the Romans and after that by the Spanish, Naples is a city that has occupied, conquered and also been the seat of power.\n\nThe people of Naples live very closely together. About 1 million people dwell in homes and buildings that are seemingly piled on top of each other in the tightly packed region of 3 million people. There are even thousands of homes at the base Mt. Vesuvius -- a volcano that has been deadly in the past and remains active today.\n\nThe people of Naples are proud of their history. They are from Naples first and Italy second. Pizza wasn't invented in Italy, a tour guide tells me. Pizza was invented in Naples. True Neapolitan Pizza can only be purchased here, she said.\n\nA main street that hugs the Mediterranean Sea is alive both day and night. By day, it is filled with tourists and residents who are walking, biking and rollerblading up and down the street. At night, teens, families and adults fill the street until well after midnight.\n\nThere is a gritty, edgy underside to Naples. The mafia remain active here. Rules -- including traffic rules -- appear to be a matter of opinion.\n\nOur tour guide urges us to remember the good things about Naples. I tell her that won't be hard.\n\nEarlier, when I described this city as warm, I was referring to both its culture and the temperature. The temperature was in the 80s and the air was humid but cooled by a breeze from the sea.\n\nCulturally, this is a tolerant city. It appears to be a city that welcomes all kinds of people.\n\nIt's not unusual to stumble on a band set up in a public square or near a church playing what I can only describe as world music or a modern take on music from the Renaissance.\n\nSo, what does Naples have to do with this business trip? Why are we here? For us, Naples serves as a wonderful midpoint between Bologna and Melfi. We came here so that we could be closer to Melfi, where we will tour Fiat's first Jeep plant in Italy on Monday.\n\nBut if I had any real choice in the matter, I would easily scrap the rest of this business trip and hang out in Naples for a few more days.\n\nExploring the tiny stores selling pasta, pastries, gelato and coffee on ancient cobblestone streets by day? Late dinners of clams, octopus, shrimp, pasta and white wine at night? Drinking a few beers after that on the patio of a restaurant overlooking the Mediterranean Sea?\n\nYep. I could easily do this for a few more days. Unfortunately, we are on the move. Next up: The city of Melfi and the plant where the Jeep Renegade is made.\n\nDay 3, June 19\n\nFerrari logos, signs and cars are visible the moment a visitor arrives in Maranello, Italy. There is a Ferrari restaurant, a Ferrari museum and Ferrari cars whip by on public streets every few minutes.\n\nThis is where Enzo Ferrari founded the the world's most successful race car company in 1947.\n\nHere, the stoplights are Ferrari red. Heck, even the trash cans surrounding the factory, the restaurant and the museum are Ferrari red.\n\nAbout 17,000 people live in Maranello and Ferrari's factory employs about 2,000.\n\n\"Ferrari is like a religion,\" I am told shortly after arriving in Maranello, -- the birthplace of one of the world's most valuable brands.\n\nI hear my host say that but don't fully appreciate it until about three hours later when I am shown a warehouse full of actual Ferrari Formula One race cars that have been driven in races from the past.\n\nThese rows of amazing, carbon-fiber cars are either for sale or have been purchased by some of the world's richest car enthusiasts. The going price? They start at $1.5 million. And if you want one that Michael Schumacher drove to win a world championship? Well, that takes you into unknown territory.\n\nAnd get this: If you buy one of these cars, you really can't drive it anywhere other than a race track. For that reason, many of the owners just leave them here in Maranello so they can visit once or twice a year and drive it on Ferrari's Fiorano Track.\n\nThe Ferrari assembly plant itself is cleaner and quieter than any automotive plant I have ever visited or could even imagine.\n\nEvery Ferrari ever built is made here.\n\nStefano Lai, Ferrari senior vice president of communications, said founder Enzo Ferrari believed deeply that the cars would not be the same if they were built somewhere else -- even if they were built in another part of Italy.\n\n\"Ferrari is like wine, you cannot build the Ferrari if you move the plant to another place.\"\n\nFerrari could easily sell far more than the approximately 7,000 cars that it makes. But selling more would violate one of the core principles established by the company's iconic founder, who often said the company should sell fewer cars than the market demands.\n\nToday, the company takes this mandate seriously and zealously protects the value of the brand by keeping production low and prices high.\n\nLai insists this will not change even after Fiat Chrysler Automobiles spins Ferrari off into a separate, standalone company later this year.\n\nFiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne announced its plans last year to conduct an IPO this year for up to 10% of Ferrari shares and distribute 80% of its shares to Fiat Chrysler shareholders. The remaining 10% of Ferrari is owned by Piero Lardi Ferrari, a son of Enzo Ferrari.\n\nWhen the tour began, Daniela Levoni, a Ferrari spokeswoman, said the company has adopted a philosophy called \"Formula One.\"\n\n\"It means that we put the man at the center of the factory and we try to create the best working conditions,\" Levoni said.\n\nWhen I heard that, I rolled my eyes. I hear that from just about every automotive manufacturer. Then the tour guide shows me the two \"green areas\" inside the machine shop. Let me repeat that so it sinks in: There are two areas set aside for bushes and trees inside the machine shop.\n\nThe other striking thing about the machine shop, where 8-cylinder and 12-cylinder engines are made is how quiet it is. This is NOT an assembly line. This is a pristine workshop -- an automotive craftsman's paradise.\n\nHere, you don't hear an endless hum of machines, as you do in most automotive plants. Instead, you hear the tapping of hammers, the clicking of machining tools and, occasionally, quick conversations among workers dressed in their red uniforms.\n\nAnd, in the assembly area, employees can take a walk along a path that takes them through thick trees.\n\nFour hours after my tour of the Ferrari campus, I am ready to say that I agree that Ferrari is much like a religion. I may not be a member, but I recognize that it exists and that the scale of its power is profound.\n\nDay 2, June 18\n\nWhat I learned today: Fiat made much more than cars.\n\nActually, I knew that. But I did not know the extent. Did you know Fiat made airplanes, airplane engines, train engines, tractors and tractor engines? The breadth and depth of the automaker's manufacturing history is stunning.\n\nI was able to see Fiat's historical products both by touring the building where several entrepreneurs first agreed to create the company and by touring Museo dell'Automobile di Torino -- a separate historical museum here in Torino. The Museo dell'Automobile di Torino offers an extensive collection of early 19th-Century automobiles made by most of Europe's early automotive manufacturers as well as gems from Ford, General Motors and Packard.\n\nAnd, of course, there were plenty of Fiat Cinquecentos and Topolinos from over the decades.\n\nI also toured Maserati's plant in Torino where the Ghibli and Quatraportte are made. But I will save that tale for another time.\n\nDay 1, part IV, June 17\n\nAfter traveling for about 24 hours straight with about 3 hours of sleep, the first day still wasn't over.\n\nI was treated to a two-hour walking tour of historic Torino and was absolutely\n\nblown away by the history of this city, the beauty of its architecture and the influence that the House of Savoy had for several hundred years. The history of royal family is interesting for its historical significance, its political significance, and for the reverence that the people in this city have for a ruling family that is no longer in power.\n\nDo you have any doubts about the architectural achievements of the Savoys or their power in this region? Well, the photo posted with this blog is where they lived for awhile.\n\nDay 1, part III, June 17\n\nWell, I finally arrived in Torino after an extended layover in Rome. First thing I noticed -- even is Rome -- is that Fiat has vast influence here. Fiat cars are all over the place. And I know what you are thinking -- you are thinking that's obvious and I should have expected that.\n\nWell, I did. But knowing and expecting something is vastly different from the appreciation you get when you actually see something up close.\n\nLike this Jeep Renegade plastic handle attached to the crossbeam of a transit bus at the Rome airport. You can grab onto this handle if you lose your balance on the airport bus.\n\nAnd, of course, the taxis in Italy are Fiat taxis.\n\nDay 1, part II: Ju ne 17\n\nSo, Delta screwed up my luggage transfer that was supposed to occur in Rome and, as a result, I am stranded in this airport for the next several hours until the next flight arrives.\n\nSimply put, my luggage should have been transferred to my connecting flight but wasn't.\n\nIt's 6 a.m., and I've had little sleep. The Alitalia agents were stunned by Delta's mistake and did their best to help me. Despite their pleasant effort, it took a long time because of what I only vaguely understand to be bureaucratic hoops that the agents had to go through to fix the issue.\n\nOn the bright side, I did just have a wonderful cappuccino from a very nice Italian bistro. Was it the best I've ever had? Possibly. It's up there. Also, the sandwiches at this place look really good and I will buy one soon, when the crowd dies down.\n\nI can only offer one automotive observation so far: I saw a whole bunch of Fiat taxi cabs while I was running around Rome's airport.\n\nDay 1: Tuesday, June 16\n\nWell, here we go! This trip to Italy, in the works for about four months, is finally under way. Checking in at Detroit Metropolitan Airport took forever. That was OK because I arrived early, so I wasn't stressed out.\n\nNext up: A 10-hour flight across the Atlantic at night to Rome, followed by a mad dash scramble in an country I've never been to before to catch a connecting flight to Turin, or Torino -- the hometown of Fiat.\n\nIf all goes well, I will arrive at my hotel by noon tomorrow — Brent.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/06/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/03/28/solar-eclipse-warnings-say-traffic-eyesight-at-risk-on-april-8/73122224007/", "title": "Solar eclipse warnings pile up: Watch out for danger in the sky, on ...", "text": "Editor's note: An updated cloud forecast for the April 2024 total solar eclipse is in.

Looking at the spectacular event requires special glasses to prevent eye damage. Plus, tourists from around the country will be flocking to a narrow band of land from Texas to Maine — the path of totality, where the shadow of the moon will plunge the Earth into darkness.\n\nWarning issued about fake eclipse glasses\n\n\"Counterfeit and fake eclipse glasses are polluting the marketplace,\" the American Astronomical Society announced in a statement in late March.\n\nUsing fake eclipse glasses – or no glasses at all – to look at the eclipse is dangerous to your eyes: Overexposure to sunlight \"can cause severe eye injury, ranging from temporarily impaired vision to permanent blindness,\" the AAS said. They recommend buying from a vetted vendor and testing the glasses before the eclipse.\n\nHere's how to tell if your glasses are legit.\n\nIt's also worth noting that you may be able to score a free pair of eclipse glasses.\n\nBad traffic and deadly traffic accidents\n\nTraffic is predicted to be bad and potentially deadly — especially after the eclipse ends. Millions of people will crowd into the narrow path of totality, then most will attempt to leave all at once as soon as the eclipse is over.\n\nExperts warn the excitement could create dangerous and busy automobile traffic conditions as people pack into the small part of the country with the best view.\n\nRoads could be especially packed at the center of the eclipse's path as Americans who want the best view crowd into cities, towns and remote areas, many without the infrastructure to handle big crowds.\n\nIn Texas, which is expected to bear the brunt of the crowds, the state's Department of Transportation is preparing highway signs that will say, “NO STOPPING ON HIGHWAY TO VIEW ECLIPSE” and “NO PARKING ON SHOULDER, KEEP MOVING.”\n\nCrews in Texas are also pausing some road construction and maintenance work on major corridors in the path of the eclipse April 7-9, based on traffic volumes.\n\nMore:The April total solar eclipse could snarl traffic for hours across thousands of miles\n\nWhen a total solar eclipse passed over the U.S. in 2017, reports say some traffic jams didn't fully clear for more than 12 hours in some areas.\n\nEven worse, a recent study reported that the 2017 eclipse \"was associated with increased risks of a fatal traffic crash\" – potentially as much as a 31% increase, the study said.\n\nAir travel also impacted\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is offering guidance to commercial planes and private aircraft ahead of the eclipse.\n\n\"Due to the high volume of traffic along the eclipse path, (airport) arrivals can expect lengthy delays during peak traffic periods,\" the FAA said.\n\nAirports in Texas, Vermont, Maine, Canada, New Hampshire, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky and Missouri will be primarily affected by the eclipse, the FAA said.\n\n\"The purpose of this notice is to inform airmen of the possible impacts to air traffic and airports along the eclipse path during the period April 7, 2024, (6 a.m. EST) through April 10, 2024, (midnight EST),\" the FAA said.\n\nMore:What travelers should know about FAA advisory on total solar eclipse before April 8\n\nContributing: Jonathan Limehouse and Kayla Jimenez, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/2021/12/20/holiday-traffic-worst-times/8917016002/", "title": "Traveling for the holidays?

But there was one undeniably positive nugget at the end of the list: Late in the weekend of Jan. 20 and 21, the weather appears likely to take a turn for the better.\n\n\"There is a consistent signal for a pattern change arriving around next Sunday and Monday, Jan 21-22 that may result in much warmer temperatures,\" it said.\n\nThe guidance added that it's too early for a forecast of just how much higher temperatures will go.\n\n\"That is in the day 7-8 time range and not all included in this forecast,\" it said. \"Until then, stay warm!\"\n\n3:20 p.m. Return to normal will be slow on Iowa roads, IDOT says\n\nThe Iowa Department of Transportation in a Facebook posting says condition on the state's roads have improved since Saturday, when sections of Interstate 80 and other highways around the state were impassable because of ice and blowing snow. But there are still trouble spots.\n\n\"We'll be using snow blowers to move the snow further back away from the road, but this is a slow process,\" IDOT said, adding \"It could take up to a week to get the mess cleaned up because ditches are full and high winds will continue to cause drifting snow.\"\n\nIt cautioned motorist to slow down, use extra caution and pay attention to what's on the road ahead.\n\n2:15 p.m. Where was it coldest overnight?\n\nThe National Weather Service says the lowest temperature it recorded before dawn Sunday was in Pocahontas in northwest Iowa, with a reading of 21 degrees below zero. Here are other lows from around the state on a day when the high in Des Moines is slated to reach just minus 9 degrees:\n\nAmes -17\n\nBoone -20\n\nCedar Rapids -18\n\nCouncil Bluffs -17\n\nDavenport -15\n\nDes Moines -17\n\nDubuque -15\n\nFort Dodge -18\n\nIowa City -16\n\nMason City -15\n\nOttumwa -20\n\nWaterloo -14\n\nWind chills ranged as low as 45 degrees below zero.\n\n1:30 p.m. Authorities clear path through storm for mom in labor\n\nFrom the Marshall County Sheriff's Office comes an account of how deputies and other first responders worked in blizzard conditions to ensure a woman in labor got the care she and her baby needed.\n\nA news release from the sheriff's office said the call for help came at 11:20 p.m. Saturday, while a blizzard warning remained in effect, and deputies were dispatched to the woman's home. Unable to reach her home because of road conditions, they hiked a half mile to reach her as Marshall County communications center personnel remained in contact with her, it said.\n\nThe Clemons Fire Department, meanwhile, was able to secure a tractor to clear a path so a Unity Point ambulance could reach the home, the release said. It said the woman gave birth at 12:38 a.m. and she and the baby were taken to the hospital.\n\n8:30 a.m. A very low high in Iowa\n\nThe overnight temperature at Des Moines International Airport on Saturday into Sunday, minus 17 degrees, didn't set a record, but the forecast daytime high today could match the one for a Jan. 14: 9 degrees below zero, last seen in 1888, 136 years ago, Allan Curtis, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Johnston, said Sunday morning. With gusty winds, the wind chill could hover around minus 40.\n\nAnd even the low is impressive, if not record-breaking: It's the lowest temperature recorded for a Jan. 14 in Des Moines since 1901 ― 123 years ago ― and tied for second place after a reading of minus 19 in 1888.. It's also the lowest for a January day, or any winter day, since a minus 20 reading in January 2019 ― five years. Wind chill, a more modern statistic, bottomed out at minus 43 degrees just before midnight.\n\nBrace for more. The overnight low for Sunday into Monday is forecast to be only slight less low, at minus 17, with a high on Monday, Iowa Caucuses day and the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, of minus 5 degrees. The temperature is expected to fall to minus 11 degrees Monday night, with a wind chill of minus 30.\n\nThe low temperature isn't expected to return to positive territory until Wednesday, when it will be 5 degrees.\n\n\"That'll feel awfully warm and balmy by that point,\" said Curtis.\n\nAnother wave of sub-zeros lows is forecast to arrive Thursday and Friday, at minus 3 and minus 12, respectively.\n\nWant some good weather news? At least the blizzard warning is gone in Iowa. It expired at midnight for the 17 counties in which it remained in effect.\n\n10:05 p.m. Another reel of weather photos from the Iowa State Patrol\n\nHere's yet another Facebook collection of shots from Iowa State Patrol troopers patrolling the state's icy roads in a historic winter storm.\n\n10 p.m. Saturday overnight could be worst of cold snap\n\nThe latest National Weather Service forecast has dropped tonight's overnight low to 18 degrees below zero ― the lowest expected in a period of frigid arctic air that's not expected to produce a low temperature above zero until Wednesday, and then only barely. The low and accompanying wind chill of 45 degrees below zero ― yes, you read that right ― is expected around 3 a.m.\n\nThis is the kind of weather when pipes can freeze and burst. If you haven't already taken precautions, here are some things you can do:\n\nLeave faucets slowly dripping to keep water flowing through the pipes. The water can be captured in a bucket and used for other purposes around the home, like watering plants and washing dishes.\n\nOpen under-sink cabinets to allow warm air to circulate near your pipes.\n\nWhat if there’s no water coming out of your faucets? Check your water meter. If water is leaking or spraying from your meter or the bottom is cracked, your water meter is frozen. Feel for frozen pipes. Pipes located along exterior walls are most susceptible to freezing. To thaw pipes, contact a licensed plumber or use hot towels or a hair dryer. Never use an open flame.\n\nAlso, if you can, get your car into a garage or at least under a carport. Extreme cold is murder on the battery. Even a few degrees can make a difference.\n\nAnd above all, stay inside if you can. Even if tonight is the coldest, it won't be much warmer Sunday or Monday nights.\n\n7:30 p.m. Another speeder on slippery roads\n\nFor the second time in a matter of hours, the Iowa State Patrol reported that a trooper had stopped a vehicle traveling at more than 90 mph on roads so slick with snow and ice that travel was not advised. In a posting on Facebook, it said the SUV, clocked at 94 mph, was stopped on Interstate 80 near Council Bluffs on Saturday morning. The other car, traveling at 92 mph, had been stopped Friday in northwest Iowa.\n\n\"Most people would say that 94 MPH is unbelievable during a blizzard,\" the state patrol commented. \"Unfortunately, these speeds are still happening...\"\n\n7 p.m. Blizzard warning extended to midnight\n\nThe planned 6 p.m. conclusion for a National Weather Service blizzard warning came and went, but the blizzard conditions didn't.\n\nThe weather service instead chose to continue the warning for 17 Iowa counties until midnight. It said up to an inch of additional snow is expected in the affected area along and north of Highway 30, mainly in the state's northwest but also including Story and Boone counties in central Iowa. Winds will continue to gust up to 40 mph, above the 35 mph threshold for blizzard conditions, and visibility will fall to a quarter mile or less, another blizzard criterion.\n\nThe winds are expected to abate somewhat after midnight, the weather service said, and the focus is turning to the extreme cold building over the state. It said in forecast guidance that the temperature at its Johnston office was zero just before noon Saturday and fell to 5 below by 2 p.m. Maurice in far northwest Iowa reported a temperature of minus 15 and if certain conditions align, the Nishnabotna River valley in western Iowa also could see temperatures plummet, it said.\n\nThe wind chill warning blanketing all but the northeasternmost portion of Iowa will remain in effect until noon Tuesday, with the forecast calling for lows of minus 16 both Saturday and Sunday nights in Des Moines and minus 11 on Monday, Caucus Day and the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. The high that day is expected to be minus 3, and only on Wednesday night will the forecast low creep back above zero, at 3 degrees.\n\nThroughout, wind chills will be life threateningly low: 40 below on Saturday and Sunday nights and 35 below on Monday night.\n\nAnother round of deep subzero temperatures is expected to begin Friday.\n\n6:10 p.m. Despite historic storm, crime goes on in Des Moines, keeping police busy\n\nDes Moines police said they have received more than 778 calls for service since Friday morning during the blizzard. But three-quarters of them weren't for what you'd expect: weather-related crashes and stalled vehicles.\n\nInstead, police spokesman Sgt. Paul Parizek said in a Facebook posting, the calls involved the sorts of cases that officers handle whether or not there's bad weather: multiple thefts, assaults, stabbings and a shooting report.\n\nAmong them:\n\nAn alleged violent attempted theft of a car. Parizek said a motorist picked up a pedestrian who seemed to need assistance shortly after 6 a.m. Friday, and that the man, identified as Jermaine Shetworth Ware, 28, began to assault the 50-year-old in an attempt to steal the car. When Ware failed, Parizek, said he flagged down another motorist on Interstate 235 and stole that car. The Iowa State Patrol stopped the car after a brief chase north of Des Moines and arrested Ware, Parizek said. Ware remained in the Polk County Jail late Saturday.\n\nA hit-and-run accident shortly after 1 p.m. Friday at Southeast 14th Street and Park Avenue. A patrol officer witnessed the accident but because of the weather was unable to pursue the driver, who sped away. A short time later, Parizek said, the apparently intoxicated driver was found with his vehicle stuck in a snowdrift not far from the accident scene. He said the man, 42, was charged with OWI and hit and run.\n\nA stabbing around 2:30 p.m. in the 2300 block of Dean Ave. The victim was taken to a hospital in serious condition was expected to survive, Parizek said. A suspect was identified and the investigation continues.\n\nA report of gunshots just after 10 p.m. Friday in the 6100 block of Winona Ave. Officers called to the scene found evidence of gunfire, Parizek said, but no one apparently had been wounded. He said detectives continue to investigate.\n\n6 p.m. Johnson County requests no travel until noon Sunday\n\nCiting continued poor travel conditions, despite the lifting of a blizzard warning, Johnson County officials are asking resident and visitors to stay put and remain off roads until noon Sunday.\n\n\"Road conditions remain poor and light snow and blowing snow is expected to reduce visibility and road conditions in the overnight hours,\" they said in a news release. \"Whiteout conditions and significant blowing and drifting snow is occurring in open areas and this will create dangerous conditions. These coupled with the danger(ous) temperature and wind chill are not safe for anyone to be outdoors.\"\n\nThey cited not only the risk to stranded motorists, but to the law enforcement and emergency services dispatched to rescue them.\n\n\"There will be enough emergencies in these conditions, please stay home to reduce the potential to create more,\" they said.\n\nMotorists are encouraged to utilize the Iowa DOT 511 site, https://511ia.org\n\nto evaluate road conditions. If you have an emergency and must travel, please dress appropriately and prepare your vehicle with first aid and winter travel supplies.\n\nThe priority message from the Johnson County Emergency Management –\n\nDo your part; stay home, stay safe, and help keep Emergency Services off the roads.\n\n3:40 p.m. West Des Moines extends parking ban\n\nThe city of West Des Moines has extended its emergency parking ban until 5 p.m. Sunday.\n\nThe ban, which began on Thursday at 10 p.m., applies to all streets in West Des Moines. Parking while under the ban could result in a $50 fine and towing.\n\n3:25 p.m. Des Moines metro out of blizzard warning\n\nThe National Weather Service has lifted the blizzard warning for the Des Moines metro, reducing it to 17 counties, including Story and Boone, through 6 p.m. Most are in northwest Iowa.\n\nThe lifting of the warning, which had been in effect since Friday, came as wind gusts dropped below the 35 mph threshold for blizzard conditions. But roads remain extremely hazardous, with slippery conditions, occasional whiteouts and plenty of accidents. And the forecast calls for unfavorable conditions to continue, with gusting winds through at least Monday night.\n\n1:45 p.m. I-80 finally passable\n\nImpassable since Friday evening, the stretch of Interstate 80 from Victor in Iowa County to Tiffin in Johnson County is now more-or-less drivable, the Iowa 511 road conditions site reports. But the Iowa State Patrol and other police agencies, including Des Moines police, continue to advise against any unnecessary travel. And numerous other parts of Iowa's road system, including a stretch of I-80 from Stuart to west of Brayton and Interstate 35 from Highway 5 in West Des Moines to Van Wert, remain in sketchy shape, covered with snow.\n\nEarlier, several cars were stuck for five hours in blowing snow on I-80 after semitrailers jackknifed in the slippery roadway, blocking traffic and leaving 100 vehicles trapped, according to The Associated Press. Altogether, state troopers handled 86 crashes and 535 motorist-assist calls since Friday, State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla told the AP on Saturday afternoon.\n\n1:15 p.m. Des Moines firefighters: Please lend a hand\n\nThere's nothing much more challenging than fighting a fire in the middle of heavy snow and extreme cold. So in a posting on X, formerly known as Twitter, the Des Moines Fire Department has a request for residents: If you're out shoveling and see a fire hydrant buried in a snowbank, please clear it off.\n\n11:45 a.m. Des Moines Catholic diocese says mass not obligatory in dangerous weather\n\nThe Roman Catholic Diocese of Des Moines on its home page says parishioners are not obligated to attend weekend masses amid blizzard conditions and dangerous wind chill. Some pastors may choose not to hold mass, it said.\n\n\"While situations differ across the diocese, canceling a Mass is a legitimate option for pastors during such weather,\" it said. \"If someone is concerned about making it to Mass on Sunday because of the weather and road conditions, know they are not obligated to do that which is unsafe.\"\n\nOther churches and religious institutions also may be canceling in-person services, so check before setting out.\n\n11:30 a.m. Grimes and Waukee have a message for drivers: Don't\n\nGrimes and neighboring Waukee in Saturday news releases are advising residents to stay off the roads.\n\n\"The Iowa DOT is still listing roads in the metro as 'travel not advised'. Please stay home unless you have to leave for an emergency and check the latest road conditions at 511ia.org,\" Grimes said in its message, adding that it is extending its snow ordinance banning parking on city streets to 8 p.m. Sunday.\n\n\"Our crews are still out, but the winds are continuing to cause significant drifting,\" it said. \"They will be able to clear more extensively tomorrow.\"\n\nWaukee's message was similar.\n\n\"Blizzard conditions continue. Stay home and off the roads unless it absolutely necessary to be out,\" its release said. \"Lots of cars are getting stuck in the snow which slows down the plows and makes roads more hazardous. Wind gusts will continue to make travel dangerous with low visibility and drifting snow.\"\n\nIt said a street parking ban has been extended to 5 p.m. Sunday to keep thoroughfares clear for plowing. Violators will be fined $25 and/or towed, it said.\n\nDes Moines Public Schools announced they were canceling all Saturday activities.\n\n10:10 a.m. Despite warnings, motorist getting stranded; speeder clocked at 92\n\nThe Iowa Department of Transportation's Iowa 511 road conditions page posts warning about roads that are impassable. Despite that, the Iowa State Patrol says, motorists continue to attempt to traverse those roads and are becoming stranded. Meanwhile, temperatures across the state are in single digits and dropping.\n\nThe recklessness was even more extreme in one case: The state patrol reported stopping a driver on Interstate 35 in northern Iowa who was going 92 mph in the winter storm. \"Ridiculous and unacceptable,\" it commented on Facebook.\n\n8:45 a.m. Cancellations, flight delays continue at Des Moines airport\n\nAfter a day of flight delays and cancellations Friday because of blizzard conditions, the flight disruptions continued early Saturday at Des Moines International Airport. The airport's online flight status page showed cancelations beginning at 6 a.m. with an American Airlines flight to Washington and a United Airlines flight to Houston.\n\nThe airport said its crews were working to keep runway clear, and urged travelers to consult their airline's website or app before leaving to catch flights.\n\n7:30 a.m. Blizzard warning ends for much of Iowa, but continues in Polk, Story, other counties; I-80 has detour\n\nThe National Weather Service early Saturday reduced the blizzard warning that had blanketed most of Iowa, leaving it in place until 6 p.m. for 22 counties including Polk and Story.\n\nA wind chill warning is in effect throughout the state, with a winter weather advisory for extreme northeast Iowa.\n\nThe weather service said in forecast guidance that the eastern portion of the state can expect blizzard-strength winds, with gusts above 35 mph, to \"level off,\" and visibility to improve to 1 mile through the early afternoon, above the quarter-mile limit of blizzard conditions.\n\nIt said the other counties also will see some lessening of wind speeds, but that with another inch of snow expected, it was not enough to warrant lowering the blizzard warning.\n\nThe wind chill forecast remained unchanged: For the Des Moines metro, an early morning high of 3 degrees Saturday, falling to temperatures below zero by about 3 p.m. and bottoming out overnight around 14 below, with wind chill as low as minus 40.\n\nConditions are expected to be similar on Monday, Iowa Caucuses day and the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, with a midafternoon high of minus 2 and an evening low of 14 below, accompanied by life-threatening wind chill of 30 or more below zero.\n\nTravel remains hazardous, but the Iowa Department of Transportation reported that a portion of Interstate 80 from Victor to Tiffin, impassable because of blowing snow and accidents, could be bypassed via U.S. 6. Still, it warned on its Iowa 511 website that that route also is snow-covered, and \"travel is not advised.\"\n\n3 a.m. Travel remains extremely hazardous, but some improvement expected\n\nThe historic onslaught of winter weather continues across Iowa.\n\nThe Iowa 511 website shows both east- and westbound Interstate 80 remain impassable from Victor in Iowa County to Coralville in Johnson County because of blowing snow. Even with less-than-expected snowfall north and west from Audubon to Hampton, wind gusts to 45 mph and whiteouts are expected to continue to make travel throughout most of Iowa hazardous throughout the day Saturday.\n\nAs of 10 p.m. Friday, the Iowa State Patrol said on its Facebook page it had provided 436 motorist assists and responded to responded to 72 crashes, including one in which a trooper's cruiser was damaged by a semi unable to stop on I-80 near Williamsburg because of icy conditions. The trooper was uninjured.\n\nThe National Weather Service office in Johnston says blizzard conditions are expected to abate later Saturday morning in east and northeast Iowa, where the blizzard warning will be lowered to a winter weather advisory. But it said that from I-35 west and I-80 north, the warning will continue, and travel should be restricted to emergencies only.\n\nThe chief hazard will gradually shift to life-threatening cold. The temperature is forecast to fall continually over the next 24 hours, hitting a low of minus 14 degrees in Des Moines early Sunday, with a windchill of nearly 45 degrees below zero. Sunday's high is expected to be minus 6 degrees. Another inch-plus of snowfall is expected, adding to what already is projected to be the second-greatest accumulation in a five-day period recorded in the state.\n\n\"The period of extreme, life threatening wind chill will continue Sunday night into Monday with late morning and afternoon wind chills rising to the 20 to 30 below, only to fall to 30 to 35 below Monday evening,\" the weather service said in 3 a.m. forecast guidance, adding, \"Our only day of respite from the cold will be Wednesday as a weak wave tracks southeast from the Northern Plains.\"\n\n7:35 p.m. Road conditions deteriorate across Iowa; I-80 impassable\n\nConditions on Iowa roadways deteriorated dramatically as the blizzard intensified across the state.\n\nInterstate 80 west of the I-80/Interstate 380 interchange near Victor was impassable in both directions due to drifting snow, icy conditions and crashed vehicles, according to the Iowa Department of Transportation.\n\nThe DOT in a news release traffic should avoid that section of Iowa's main east-west highway until conditions improve.\n\nSurrounding roadways like I-380 and U.S. 218 also were experiencing significant amounts of drifting snow, which the DOT said may make them \"difficult or impossible to travel on as the night progresses.\"\n\nThe Iowa 511 traffic conditions page also reported numerous other Iowa roadways as blocked or impassable because of accidents and drifting snow and recommended against travel on I-80 and Interstates 235 and 35 in Des Moines, as well as much of U.S. 65.\n\nSeveral counties, including Johnston and Story, and cities, including Urbadale and Altoona, suspended snowplowing, say high winds and drifting snow made the work too hazardous to continue.\n\n6:45 p.m. Storm close to record\n\nThe National Weather Service says the snowstorm that began Thursday and the one that preceded it this week have dumped snow at a nearly record-setting pace.\n\nMeteorologist Chad Hahn at the weather service's Johnston office said Friday night that by the end of the current snowstorm, an estimated 21.3 inches of snow that will have fallen in the past five days.\n\nThat would about an inch-and-a-half shy of the all-time record for Iowa and ahead of the second-place snowfall, making it the most five-day snowfall in 82 years.\n\nThe current top five-day snowfalls are:\n\n22.7 inches from Dec. 28, 1941, to Jan. 1, 1942. 20.2 inches from March 14-18, 1923. 17.7 inches from Dec. 5-9, 2009\n\n5:18 p.m. Latest snowfall totals\n\nThe National Weather Service says 8 inches of snow had fallen in Des Moines by 5 p.m. in the latest storm, on top of 11.2 inches that fell in the previous winter storm that concluded Tuesday. Other totals include 8 to 10 inches in the Iowa City area, 10.5 inches in Osceola, 11 inches in Davenport, 11.5 inches in Council Bluffs, about 12 inches around Washington and Clinton, 13 inches in Muscatine, and, tops for the state, 14 inches around Fairfield. Snow is expected to continue for several hours.\n\n5 p.m. Urbandale suspending snow plow operations\n\nSnow plowing operations in Urbandale will be suspended starting at 7 p.m. Friday due to sustained high winds and significant drifting, according to a news release from the city.\n\nPlowing is expected to resume at 5 a.m. Saturday, when it is anticipated that wind conditions will be better suited for plowing.\n\n3:45 p.m. Wind chills not expected to reach positive numbers again until Wednesday\n\nBundle up and stay indoors! The wind chill at 3:45 p.m. Friday had dipped to minus 4 and it's only going to go lower.\n\nWind chills are expected to dip into the negative 20s on Friday night and could reach as low as minus 45 degrees over the weekend.\n\nDes Moines won't see a wind chill index above 0 until Wednesday, said NWS meteorologist Alexis Jimenez.\n\n4:30 p.m. Des Moines Public Schools cancels Saturday activities\n\nAll events at or involving Des Moines Public Schools are canceled Saturday, due to weather conditions.\n\n3 p.m.: Iowa State Patrol responds to dozens of crashes, helps hundreds of motorists\n\nDespite pleas for Iowans to stay off the road, the Iowa State Patrol has been called to help hundreds of Iowans in the blizzard on Friday.\n\nTroopers have been dispatched to 34 crashes, including seven with injuries between 12:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. on Friday. They've also been called for 355 motorist assists.\n\n3:15 p.m.: Travel not advised in more than half of Iowa\n\nIf you're planning to travel anywhere east of Des Moines, you're likely to encounter difficult conditions and dangerous roads.\n\nTravel is not on most highways east of I-35 in central and southern Iowa. Most highways in the southern third of the state are also rated travel not advised. All highways in the state are at least partially covered by snow and ice, according to the DOT.\n\nVisibility in most of Iowa was less than a mile at times. In central Iowa visibility ranged between 0.8 mile to 0.5 mile because of blowing snow, according to the Iowa Environmental Mesonet.\n\n\"As expected, road conditions are going downhill fast this morning with heavy snow and strong winds decreasing visibility and causing drifting on some Iowa roads,\" the Iowa DOT wrote on social media.\n\nThe DOT has more than 600 snowplows treating roads throughout the state, but high winds and snows are making travel conditions treacherous, according to Iowa 511. In rural areas snow is drifting across roads quickly after plows clear roads.\n\nMore:How to check Iowa road conditions, DOT cameras amid winter storms\n\n3:30 p.m.: Some flights are finally arriving at Des Moines airport\n\nFew flights got in and out of the Des Moines International Airport on Friday, but a handful were able to land by early afternoon.\n\nA single commercial flight landed Friday morning — a Frontier flight from Orlando. But, two American Airlines flights and one United flight were able to land as of 2 p.m. and two flights from New York were in the air toward Des Moines as of 3:30 p.m.\n\nAs of 3:30 p.m., 69 flights scheduled to go into or leave from the Des Moines International Airport were canceled, according to FlightAware.com. Six other flights were delayed.\n\nThat represents 59% of flights originally scheduled to take off from the airport on Friday and 53% of inbound flights.\n\nAt least 10 commercial flights have taken off Friday.\n\nFlights across the Midwest were delayed by Friday's storm. At Chicago O'Hare Airport hundreds of flights were delayed or canceled, according to Flight Aware. The Eastern Iowa Airport in Cedar Rapids also experienced numerous cancelations Friday morning.\n\n12:30 p.m.: HHS cancels MLK Day event\n\nIowa HHS has canceled its Martin Luther King Junior celebration scheduled for Saturday, Jan. 13, due to the weather conditions. The capitol building will also be closed.\n\nQuestions can be directed to Kim Cheeks, Office on the Status of African-Americans, at kim.cheeks@iowa.gov , or 515-281-3274 or 800-351-4659.\n\n11 a.m.: MidAmerican Energy crews work to prevent power outages\n\nMidAmerican line crews have been surveying overhead lines in areas that were impacted on by storms earlier this week to reduce threats from tree debris and address any equipment concerns, according to an update Friday morning. MidAmerican's electric and gas delivery teams are fully staffed should any outages occur.\n\nA main concern for MidAmerican is the wind as the storm transitions into blizzard conditions. High winds can cause overhead lines with a freezing precipitation buildup to bounce — known as galloping — which can interrupt service.\n\nNoon: How much snow did Iowa get?\n\nSnow has started to wind down in central Iowa. Reports from across the state are nearing the one-foot mark.\n\nDes Moines (airport): 6.1 inches\n\n6.1 inches Johnston (National Weather Service): 7.2 inches\n\n7.2 inches Fairfield: 11.5 inches\n\nSee more:Top snowfall counts from across Iowa\n\nWhat's the Iowa radar show and what should we expect throughout the day on Friday?\n\nThe morning will start with periods of heavy snow, continuing until about 10 a.m. for central Iowa. An additional 3-5 inches of snow is possible by the end of the day. Snowfall rates of about .75 inch to one inch per hour are possible throughout the morning, according to the NWS.\n\nBut the weather service warned that blizzard conditions will make travel dangerous or impossible. A blizzard warning will be in effect from 10 a.m. Friday to 6 a.m. Saturday for central Iowa as wind speeds pick up and reduce visibility. Winds could gust as high as 45 mph and wind speeds between 35 and 45 mph are likely.\n\nTemperatures are expected to plunge throughout the day to 13 degrees by 5 p.m. Wind chills could feel as low as -10 degrees, according to the NWS, adding to the danger for motorists stuck outside.\n\nSnow is expected to taper off over central Iowa tonight. But even after snow stops falling it will continue blowing and make travel difficult. \"Blowing snow impacts will linger well beyond the end of falling snow, especially in rural and open areas,\" the NWS in Des Moines warned in its 6 a.m. update.\n\nBlizzard forces GOP presidential candidates to cancel events Friday\n\nNikki Haley's campaign has canceled three in-person events scheduled Friday in Fort Dodge, Le Mars and Council Bluffs due to the weather.\n\nInstead, campaign officials said they would be hosting telephone town halls.\n\n“Stormy weather won’t stop us from ensuring Iowans hear Nikki’s vision for a strong and proud America,” Pat Garrett, a Haley spokesperson, said in a statement. “With only three days until the caucuses, we’re going to keep telling voters why they should Pick Nikki.”\n\nRead more:Blizzard warning forces GOP candidates to cancel some Friday events days before Iowa Caucuses\n\nRon DeSantis also canceled two events Friday morning.\n\nHowever, candidate Vivek Ramaswamy said he would continue on with every event as \"long as we can physically make it.\" His campaign went into a ditch earlier this week and needed the help of a passerby to get out.\n\nIn 2016, a volunteer for Ben Carson's campaign died when a campaign vehicle lost control on an icy Interstate 80 and crossed the median.\n\nTraveling on Interstates 35 or 80 and need to escape the blizzard? These are safe places to park.\n\nWith difficult travel conditions likely, Polk County has designated the following locations as safe places for interstate travelers to pull over and wait out blizzard conditions.\n\nPrairie Meadows: 1 Prairie Meadows Drive, Altoona\n\n1 Prairie Meadows Drive, Altoona Flying J Travel Plaza: 3231 Adventureland Drive, Altoona\n\n3231 Adventureland Drive, Altoona Pilot Travel Center: 11957 Douglas Parkway, Urbandale\n\n11957 Douglas Parkway, Urbandale Love's Travel Stop: 11820 Hickman Road, Clive\n\nAfter warm December, winter arrives with a vengeance\n\nIowa had the warmest December on record, dating back to 1895. On Dec. 24, Des Moines had a high temperature of 58 degrees, 15 degrees above average. Now, within about a week in January the NWS has issued almost every type of winter weather watch or warning, except for an ice storm warning. In the last week the NWS has issued a blizzard warning, winter storm warnings, winter storm watches, winter weather advisories, wind chill warnings, wind chill watches and wind chill advisories.\n\nOn Wednesday night the weather service even issued a rare snow squall warning when a snow squall hit the Des Moines Metro area. The snow Friday will make travel conditions dangerous, but sub-zero temperatures will settle in through at least Tuesday, according to the NWS. Arctic air will spill into the Midwest, and could lead to record low temperatures of negative 20 degrees or negative 30 degrees, according to an NWS forecast.\n\nDes Moines Public Schools, others cancel classes for Friday ahead of blizzard; Some city buildings close.\n\nDes Moines Public Schools announced Thursday afternoon that classes will be canceled for Friday due to the forecast. All activities are canceled, and Metro Kids Care is closed. All offices will be closed.\n\nOther large metro school districts including Johnston, Southeast Polk and Waukee have also canceled Friday classes. Urbandale had a previously scheduled professional work day without classes on Friday. Staff will work remote and child care will not be available.\n\nStory County offices and buildings will be closed on Friday because of the snow. Grimes also announced its buildings were closed.\n\nNWS issues blizzard warning for most of Iowa on Friday\n\nA blizzard warning will be in effect from 10 a.m. Friday until 6 a.m. Saturday in northwest and central Iowa, according to the National Weather Service. In eastern Iowa, a blizzard warning starts at 5 p.m. Friday and extends until noon on Saturday.\n\nWind gusts as high as 40 mph are expected Friday afternoon and night, which will blow around snow and reduce visibility. Travel is expected to be very difficult, and is recommended to be avoided if possible.\n\nWhat's the difference between a blizzard warning and a winter storm warning?\n\nBlizzard warnings are issued for frequent gusts greater than or equal to 35 mph accompanied by falling and/or blowing snow, according to NWS. Blizzards frequently reduce visibility to less than 1/4 mile for three hours or more.\n\nA blizzard warning means severe winter weather conditions are expected — as in the case right now — or already occurring. Falling and blowing snow with strong winds and poor visibilities are likely, leading to whiteout conditions making travel extremely difficult.\n\nNWS recommends Iowans not travel during a blizzard warning. If you must travel, have a winter survival kit with you. If you get stranded, stay with your vehicle and wait for help to arrive.\n\nWinter storm warnings are issued for a significant winter weather event that includes snow, ice, sleet or blowing snow or a combination of these hazards. Travel is often difficult or impossible when winter storm warnings are in effect. If a winter storm warning is in effect, you should consider delaying your travel plans until conditions improve.\n\nDes Moines Performing Arts postpones STOMP performances\n\nPerformances by musical group STOMP, originally scheduled Jan. 12-14 at the Des Moines Civic Center, have been postponed due to “anticipated weather conditions,” according to a Thursday evening press release.\n\nAccording to the release, all four performances have been rescheduled for June 21-23. All previously purchased tickets will be honored on the new dates.\n\nTicketholders can contact the Ticket Office at 515-246-2300 or info@dmpa.org.\n\nWhen is snow supposed to start in Iowa and what does the forecast show?\n\nSnowfall will begin over western Iowa late Thursday afternoon, according to National Weather Service's Des Moines office.\n\nOn Thursday, there's a 70% chance of snow in Ames at 6 p.m., an 85% chance in Carroll at 6 p.m. and a 75% chance in Des Moines at 6 p.m.\n\nHeaviest snowfall rates will be early Friday morning through mid-day. There is also a chance of freezing rain in the morning on Friday.\n\nHow much snow will Iowa get?\n\nThe NWS says significant snow will come to most of the state. Snow could fall at as much as an inch an hour during the overnight hours on Thursday. Wind gusts of 35-45 miles per hour will create \"near-blizzard\" conditions and could create whiteout conditions.\n\nMost of the state is looking at 5-10 inches of snowfall with the heaviest areas landing around Des Moines, Ames and Carroll. Heavier pockets are also possible around Waterloo and Dubuque.\n\nDes Moines has gotten a lot of snow this week. Will it set another record?\n\nMaybe! The official total at the Des Moines International Airport from the first snowstorm this week was 11.2 inches.\n\nThe current 5-day record in Des Moines is 22.7 inches (Dec. 28, 1941 - Jan. 1, 1942), according to a post from the NWS. If Des Moines gets 10 more inches, we won't break that record. But, we could break the second-place record of 20.2 inches (March 14-18, 1923).\n\nDART expects bus service delays as snow approaches\n\nWinter weather will likely delay metro bus services Thursday evening through Saturday, and especially on Friday, according to a news release from the Des Moines Area Regional Transit Authority.\n\nThose using DART Paratransit, On Demand, or Flex Connect services, should prepare for ride delays depending on the amount of snowfall and blizzard-like conditions, DART officials said. DART officials will not be able to pick up or drop off passengers in parking lots that have not been plowed.\n\nHere are the possible service delays depending on the amount of snowfall, according to DART:\n\n2 to 3 inches of snow: Pick-up times could be delayed by 30 to 60 minutes.\n\nPick-up times could be delayed by 30 to 60 minutes. 3 to 5 inches: Pick-up times could be delayed by 60 minutes or more.\n\nPick-up times could be delayed by 60 minutes or more. 5 to 8 inches: Pick-up times could be significantly delayed by more than 60 minutes. Customers with non-critical trips are asked to reschedule trips for another day.\n\nBuses running more than 20 minutes late will be posted on ⁠DART's website.\n\nHow cold will temperatures get in Iowa?\n\nThe winter storm will also be accompanied by bitter cold temperatures.\n\nHighs across the state will be in the teens to mid-20s on Thursday and will drop into the single digits by Saturday.\n\nWind gusts will be in the 30-40 miles per hour range through the weekend. Wind chills will reach their lowest levels on Sunday with ranges in the -20 to -45 range across the state.\n\nAre snow ordinances and parking bans in place in central Iowa?\n\nParking restrictions automatically kick in for most cities in central Iowa once 2 inches of snow have fallen. Often cities will activate restrictions in advance of major snowstorms.\n\nMore:Des Moines snow parking rules: Where and when it's safe, and where you could be ticketed\n\nHere are the metro cities that have announced restrictions ahead of this winter storm:\n\nAltoona: The snow removal parking ban is in effect in Altoona beginning at 5 p.m. on Thursday, Jan. 11 through 5 p.m. on Saturday, Jan. 13 or until all city roadways are cleared.\n\nThe snow removal parking ban is in effect in Altoona beginning at 5 p.m. on Thursday, Jan. 11 through 5 p.m. on Saturday, Jan. 13 or until all city roadways are cleared.

For the latest news on the weather, view our live updates file for Tuesday, Feb. 6.\n\nSAN DIEGO − The tail end of a powerful atmospheric river storm that knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of California homes and businesses was deluging the state Monday with more heavy rain, mudslides, flooding, and several feet of snow in the mountains.\n\nThe brunt of the storm's fury Monday centered on the Los Angeles area, where 1.4 million people were under a flash flood warning – including the Hollywood Hills and Beverly Hills. A local state of emergency was issued for the city of Los Angeles by Mayor Karen Bass on Monday afternoon.\n\nAcross Southern California, the heavy winds that blasted the region Sunday were diminishing, but the National Weather Service warned that an unstable weather pattern could generate waterspouts or small tornadoes.\n\nFlash flooding \"is a much greater threat than any weak tornado that the storm may spawn,\" the weather service said, and dangerous flooding was likely across much of the region from the atmospheric river − the equivalent of a river in the sky that is responsible for extreme rain and snow in the West.\n\nAdditional rainfall totals of 5-8 inches were forecast in some areas, which would bring 48-hour totals as high as 14 inches for some locations, the weather service said. A state of emergency was declared in eight Southern California counties.\n\n\"Life-threatening conditions may evolve extremely fast in some communities,\" AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Alex Sosnowski warned.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ A debris flow caused significant damage to about five homes in Beverly Hills on Monday, the Los Angeles Fire Department said. Although no one was trapped, about 10 people have been displaced, the LAFD said.\n\n∎ The Los Angeles Fire Department reported that 1,000 firefighters were responding to 49 mudslides and debris flows, 130 reports of flooding, half a dozen structure fires and other rescues of motorists stranded in vehicles.\n\n∎ Los Angeles recorded more than 4 inches of rain Sunday, breaking the record for the day by more than an inch. It was the most rain in one day in more than 20 years, and surpassed the average for the month of February.\n\n∎ The AT&T Pebble Beach Pro Am golf tournament in Monterey County, which had postponed Sunday's final round to Monday, canceled play Monday and declared Wyndham Clark the winner despite playing only 54 holes of the scheduled 72-hole tournament.\n\n∎ Officials have attributed three deaths to the storm. In Yuba City, 40 miles north of Sacramento, a man was killed when a redwood tree toppled on him in high winds, police said. Two other men were killed by fallen trees Sunday in Carmichael, a suburb of Sacramento, and in Boulder Creek in Santa Cruz County.\n\nSan Diego residents advised to remain vigilant\n\nSan Diego Mayor Todd Gloria issued an evacuation warning for low-lying, flood-prone areas that were battered by heavy rains last week and flooded out two weeks ago. Some areas outside the city saw up to 7 inches of rain in the last two days.\n\n\"I understand the weariness that must come from these repeated warnings,\" Gloria said. \"I recognize that fatigue may be settling in. But I can assure you this decision to issue this warning is not taken lightly. I ask that everyone remain prepared and vigilant.\"\n\nA flood advisory was issued for the entire county coastline and will be in effect until 8 p.m. Monday, according to the National Weather Service. A flood watch for the county will be in effect until Tuesday.\n\nAccording to Gloria's office, nearly 160 households were referred for temporary placement in hotel rooms.\n\nSanta Barbara cancels evacuation orders\n\nEvacuation orders for Santa Barbara County were canceled Monday after the worst of the storm hit the area overnight.\n\nOfficials had made an early recommendation to close schools in preparation for dangerous conditions, according to Camilla Barnwell, director of communications for the Santa Barbara County Education Office. The office said most schools across the county will reopen Tuesday.\n\n\"One or two schools had some debris that needed to be removed,\" Barnwell told USA TODAY. \"The storm just barely lifted yesterday evening so they were out on campuses today assessing the damage... heavy trees coming down, maybe one school (had) some power issues.\"\n\n'Non-stop rain' in Los Angeles as shelters aid city's homeless population\n\nBetween 5 and 10 inches of rain had fallen in the Los Angeles area with more expected, according to the National Weather Service. Dave Bruno, a meteorologist with the weather service in Los Angeles, said Monday was the third wettest two-day period on record in downtown.\n\nShelters were adding beds for the city’s homeless population of nearly 75,000 people.\n\nGeorgia Berkovich, chief communications officer of The Midnight Mission, said there has been \"non-stop rain.\" She added that The Midnight Mission, which is a Los Angeles-based human service organization, has opened its dining room for shelter and provides resources to people, including hot meals and 24-hour restrooms.\n\nAbout 100 people came to The Midnight Mission \"just to get out of the element,\" Berkovich told USA TODAY.\n\n\"Once your clothes are wet it’s over. People are freezing to their core,\" she said. \"So strange in LA we have this great climate but people die of exposure, die on our streets all the time.\"\n\nStorm by the numbers\n\n∎ A rough calculation estimates that 5.6 trillion gallons of water has fallen across California the past two days, according to FOX Weather meteorologist Greg Diamond.\n\n∎ AccuWeather estimates the preliminary total damage and economic loss from the intense storms and record rainfall in California this week will be between $9 billion and $11 billion.\n\n∎ The 11.87 inches that fell in 24 hours at UCLA’s weather station was a 1-in-1,000 year rainfall event. Technically known as a \"1,000-year recurrence interval event,\" according to meteorologist Jacob Feuerstein, a 1-in-1,000-year rain event is a statistical way of expressing the probability of such a huge rainfall occurring in any given year in a given location, according to NOAA.\n\nMud flows through multimillion-dollar homes\n\nSeveral multimillion dollar houses in the Hollywood Hills were damaged as mud, rocks and debris oozed and rolled through the area Monday. Sixteen people were evacuated, city officials said.\n\n“I can’t believe it,\" Keki Mingus of Studio City, California, said, as water rushed down her road around dawn on Monday. \"It looks like a river that’s been here for years. I’ve never seen anything like it.”\n\nWind, snow hammer Mammoth Mountain\n\nThe storm unleashed howling winds and huge snow totals in the mountains. The National Weather Service recorded a wind gust of 125 mph at the Mammoth Mountain Ski Area late Sunday. That same location received a storm total of 39 inches as of Monday morning.\n\nWhere is the storm headed next?\n\nAfter battering California on Monday, the storm's moisture will help fuel heavy snow across the West, and heavy rain in the normally arid Desert Southwest over the next few days, forecasters said. \"Rainfall totals generally between 1-3 inches may lead to some scattered instances of flash flooding,\" the National Weather Service said.\n\nFlood watches were in effect throughout portions of southern Arizona and southern Nevada because of the threat of heavy rain and flooding.\n\nClimate change, El Nino conspire to fuel storms\n\nMultiple weather and climate phenomena are conspiring to make these storms particularly damaging. Warm water provides energy to storms, and record-high ocean water temperatures, likely from climate change, are being detected around the world. Additionally, the Pacific Ocean is also seeing the effects of El Nino, where weakening trade winds reduce the upwelling of ocean waters and allow surface waters to bake in the sun and grow warmer still. And California, coming off years of drought and wildfires, is particularly vulnerable to mudslides and flooding.\n\n\"The atmospheric river firehose is aimed at Los Angeles,\" tweeted meteorologist Ryan Maue. \"The onslaught has just begun from this treacherous bomb cyclone.\"\n\n102-mph wind gust recorded in San Francisco Bay area\n\nIn Northern California, the storm swamped streets and toppled trees and power lines across the San Francisco Bay area. A rare hurricane-force wind warning had been posted for the area, and winds exceeded 60 mph with wind gusts recorded as high as 102 mph in Marin County − the equivalent of a Category 2 hurricane.\n\nIn nearby San Jose, first responders went door-to-door warning residents of the flood threat and removing unhoused people from riverbeds. They pulled travelers out of the windows of a car stranded by floodwaters and rescued several people and dogs from an island in the Guadalupe River as it became overwhelmed by high waters.\n\nUnited States Weather Alerts\n\nStorm is second to blast state in days\n\nThe storm slammed California just days after much of the state was soaked with up to 6 inches of rain by the first storm in the \"Pineapple Express,\" so-called because moisture builds up in the tropical Pacific around Hawaii and can roll across the ocean and pound the U.S. and Canada's west coasts with heavy rainfall and snow. The current storm is packing more moisture and overwhelming already-saturated regions.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom's office said the state had a record number of emergency assets responding to the \"serious storm with dangerous and potentially life-threatening impacts.\" Those impacts included almost 600,000 homes and businesses without power Monday.\n\nLife-threatening flood threat:Heavy rain and powerful winds clobber California\n\nLandslide hits Hollywood Hills\n\nIn the Hollywood Hills the weather serviced warned Monday of an \"extremely dangerous situation unfolding\" with life threatening landslides and flash flooding. Several families had to evacuate when a mudslide caused a gas leak. A neighborhood in Studio City was forced to evacuate after a slide severely damaged multiple homes. In suburban Tarzana, three homes were swamped by debris flow with firefighters aiding the evacuation of residents.\n\nFlooding and small mudslides were also reported across Santa Monica, West Hollywood, Malibu and Beverly Hills.\n\n“Life-threatening flash flooding is ongoing and will continue into the morning hours of Monday,” the weather service said.\n\nLos Angeles County Supervisor Lindsay Horvath urged residents near wildfire burn areas of Topanga and Soledad canyons to get out ahead of possible mudslides. The county set up shelters for evacuees.\n\n“If you have not already left, please gather your family, your pets, your medications and leave immediately,” Horvath said at a Sunday briefing.\n\nContributing: Dinah Voyles Pulver, USA TODAY; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/05"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/environment/953574/worlds-most-extreme-weather-events-2021", "title": "The most extreme weather events in 2021 | The Week", "text": "This year was regarded by scientists, politicians and environmentalists as pivotal in the global effort to take action on climate change.\n\nStark warnings and alarming forecasts were issued, as regions that were previously not considered to be on the frontline of climate change saw unprecedented weather events destroy homes and claim lives. As mercury levels in Moscow hit record-breaking highs in June, the United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned that the world was reaching a “point of no return”\n\nIn August, Boris Johnson described the latest global assessment from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as a “wake-up call to the world”. The “most comprehensive” climate report from the panel issued a “code red for humanity”, said The Independent, and stated the link between global warming and the increased rate and severity of extreme weather events.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Record-breaking snowfall, Madrid\n\n(Image credit: Pablo Blazquez Dominguez/Getty Images)\n\nIn the first weeks of 2021, Storm Filomena brought record-breaking levels of snow for Madrid and elderly Spanish citizens were warned to stay at home as temperatures plummeted. The heaviest snow for 50 years brought transport in and out of the city to a “standstill”, Euronews reported. The snowstorm caused around €1.4bn (£1.2bn) of damage, The New York Times said.\n\n2. Storm Christoph, UK\n\n(Image credit: Ian Forsyth/Getty Images)\n\nThe period from 18 to 20 January 2021 was “one of the wettest three-day periods on record” for North Wales and North-West England, according to the Met Office. Homes in Cheshire were flooded, and residents were evacuated from homes in Manchester and Merseyside. Once Storm Christoph cleared, significant snowfall also led to travel disruption with icy conditions and road closures. Liberal Democrat councillor Richard Kilpatrick told the Manchester Evening News the atmosphere was one of “anxiety and disbelief”.\n\n3. Cyclone Ana, Fiji\n\n(Image credit: Leon Lord/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nCyclone Ana “pummelled” Fiji towards the end of January, “just a month after category 5 Cyclone Yasa tore through the country’s northern islands”, The Guardian said. Satyendra Prasad, Fiji’s ambassador to the United Nations, said the cyclone – which caused more than 10,000 people to take refuge in 318 evacuation centres across the country – had left behind “a difficult recovery”.\n\n4. Winter storms, Texas\n\n(Image credit: Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nThe Week US reported that 3.5 million businesses and homes were left without power in February as temperatures dropped to -13℃ in some areas of Texas. Power went out across the state, leaving many vulnerable people in extremely cold conditions. The total death toll rose from 151 to 210 in July, after a decision was made to include deaths caused by the collapse of the state electric power grid in the final count, The Guardian reported.\n\n5. Dust storm, China\n\n(Image credit: Kevin Frayer/Getty Images)\n\nFlights were grounded and schools shut in what the South China Morning post reported as the worst sandstorm in a decade. But what was widely reported as a sandstorm in China was, in fact, a dust storm - “and that’s much worse”, said The Conversation. The miniscule particles can travel “much, much further” than sand, and can cause health risks if they are “drawn deep into the lungs”. In Beijing, the sky became orange as dust and pollution caused hazardous air quality.\n\n6. Flooding, New South Wales\n\n(Image credit: Jenny Evans/Getty Images)\n\nIn March, Sydney and New South Wales (NSW) residents felt the effects of extreme flooding. The NSW State Emergency Service (SES) urged residents to take care of both their physical and mental health as heavy downpours lead to rivers and dams overflowing, with thousands evacuated from their homes.\n\n7. Cyclone Seroja\n\n(Image credit: Alfred Ike Wurin/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nIn April 160 people died in Indonesia after a tropical cyclone “hit a remote cluster of islands”, Climate Home News reported. Landslides and flash floods displaced at least 22,000 people, the news site adds. Reaching Western Australia days after it made landfall in Indonesia, residents in the town of Kalbarri, north of Perth, said the storm was “absolutely terrifying”, the BBC reported. Western Australia Premier Mark McGowan said Cyclone Seroja was \"like nothing we have seen before in decades”.\n\n8. Record temperatures, Moscow\n\n(Image credit: Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nAs temperatures reached 34.8℃ in Moscow, “the absolute record for any day in June was hit”, The Moscow Times reported. The “abnormal temperatures” of the “record-breaking heatwave” weren’t just recorded in the capital; Penza, Vologda and Petrozavodsk also broke heat records during the month.\n\n9. Heat dome, Pacific Northwest\n\n(Image credit: Nathan Howard/Getty Images)\n\nSoaring temperatures across the Northwest United States “rewrote the record books” this year, National Geographic reported. The “heat dome” was the “most dramatic example” of an extreme weather event, said The Guardian’s global environment editor Jonathan Watts, and the meteorological phenomenon led to evacuations across states that weren’t “remotely prepared for the heat”. Lytton, a village in Canada’s British Columbia, was “engulfed and largely destroyed by a wildfire” as a result of the temperatures, National Geographic continued.\n\nBlistering Pacific Northwest temperatures should act as a wake-up call\n\n10. Bootleg fire, Oregon\n\n(Image credit: Payton Bruni/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nA “heavier-than-normal start to the US wildfire season” saw “one of the largest blazes in Oregon’s history” consume more than 364,000 acres of land, the BBC reported in July. More than 2,000 firefighters tackled the wildfire, which took more than a month to contain. The fire “generated its own weather system”, noted Oregon Live, and thousands of homes were threatened by the blaze, which saw residents temporarily housed in evacuation centres in the state.\n\n11. Flooding, west Germany\n\n(Image credit: Christof Stache/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nFloods destroyed homes and bridges along the River Ahr in July, while in the German village of Schuld, water “engulfed streets and swallowed homes” CNN reported. Victims will be supported by a government-approved €400 million recovery package, as ministers have promised to move quickly on rebuilding affected areas, Euronews reported. A study by World Weather Attribution found that this event was between 1.2 and nine times more likely to happen in 2021 compared to pre-industrial periods.\n\n12. Flooding, China\n\n(Image credit: STR/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nMore than 300 people died when China’s Henan province experienced severe rainfall and flooding in July. Twelve people lost their lives in a Zhengzhou metro train, with survivors describing how water leaked through the carriage’s doors until it became difficult to breathe. While the country typically experiences flooding in the summer months, this year’s occurrence was “exacerbated by rapid urbanisation, conversion of farmland and the worsening climate crisis, as well as overwhelmed flood mitigation systems,” The Guardian reported.\n\n13. Wildfires, Greece\n\n(Image credit: Angelos Tzortzinis/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nHuge wildfires “ravaged” large regions of southern Europe in August, claiming lives in Greece, Turkey and Italy, The Guardian reported. The blaze came as a heatwave swept the region, and Greece’s second largest island - Evia - was evacuated. Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis apologised for the blazes, and said that more than 580 fires have broken out in the past seven days. More than 20 countries offered to send firefighting resources, and the “camaraderie” that’s developed between Greek and British firefighters “is testament to the scale of the job before them”, Sky News reports.\n\n14. Hurricane Ida, US\n\n(Image credit: Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nMore than one million homes and businesses were left without power in the southern US states of Louisiana and Mississippi after Hurricane Ida made landfall on 29 August, the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. Ida hit with maximum sustained winds of 150mph. It was later downgraded to a tropical depression, and moved from a category four storm to category one. “Katrina followed a similar trajectory”, Sky News said. In the following days, Storm Ida moved up the northern-eastern coast of America. Subway stations and roads were flooded in New York, where the lives of at least nine people - including that of a two-year-old boy - were claimed by the storm. For communities in New Orleans, Ida has brought “painful reminders of the death and devastation” caused by the 2006 hurricane which killed more than 1,800 people, The New York Times reported.\n\n15. Monsoon floods, India and Nepal\n\n(Image credit: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nSeveral Nepalese regions and two Indian states were hit by “heavy late monsoon rains” in October, Reuters reported. “Deadly flash floods” took the lives of more than 180 people as “homes were submerged or crushed by rocks”, said the BBC. The Nepalese government committed to giving each of the victims’ families $1,700 (£1,220) in response.\n\nThe unseasonal rainfall was attributed to the climate crisis, but some experts indicated that hydro-power projects in the Himalayas, and “excessive and often unchecked construction on steep slopes”, had contributed to the damage caused to the region’s “fragile ecology”, said the broadcaster.\n\n16. Tornadoes, Kentucky\n\nBrett Carlsen/Getty Images\n\nJoe Biden said that Kentucky had experienced “one of the largest tornado outbreaks in US history”. More than 30 tornadoes “tore through” Kentucky and seven other states, claiming the lives of at least 90 people, and leaving thousands of residents homeless, said Sky News.\n\nThe state’s governor, Andy Beshear, said that this was “the most devastating, most deadly tornado event in Kentucky’s history”.\n\nTwo brothers, aged 15 months and three months old, were placed in a bathtub before being carried away by the severe winds. Their grandmother, Clara Lutz, later learned that both boys had been found alive in her garden under the upturned bath.\n\nBiden’s infrastructure bill has allocated billions of dollars to climate resilience projects, in the hope of strengthening infrastructure and defence against future extreme weather events.\n\n17. Typhoons, Philippines\n\nThe Philippine Red Cross described “complete carnage” in coastal areas of the country after Super Typhoon Rai “sent some 400,000 people running for safety” on 16 December, said the BBC. Thousands of military and service personnel were working to assist with search and rescue efforts in the worst-hit areas.\n\nWinds of around 120mph ripped through the nation’s south-eastern islands, injuring at least 500 people. A further 375 people are known to have died. “There are some areas that look like it has been bombed worse than World War Two,” Red Cross chair Richard Gordon told the BBC.", "authors": ["Julia O'Driscoll", "The Week Uk", "Last Updated", "The Week Us", "Peter Weber", "Justin Klawans", "Devika Rao", "Joel Mathis", "Harriet Marsden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/weather/2024/01/12/winter-storm-warning-forecast-snow-wind-live-updates/72183202007/", "title": "Winter storm live updates: Extreme cold weather descends across ...", "text": "Weather advisories were issued for most parts of the country Friday as a powerful storm moved over the Plains and Midwest regions, unleashing freezing temperatures and heavy snowfall that blanketed roadways, grounded flights and closed schools.\n\nMorning and afternoon highs were not expected to surpass zero degrees across much of Montana and North Dakota on Friday while temperatures in the Central Plains states, including Iowa and Minnesota, were expected to peak around the 10s, according to the National Weather Service. Temperatures could drop as low as minus 40 in parts of the northern Plains. Amid such conditions, wind chills can cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 10 minutes, the weather service said.\n\nBy 6 a.m. local time, more than 4 inches of snow had fallen in parts of Iowa. Areas across the Midwest are expected to receive snowfall in the double digits by early Saturday morning. The weather service in Chicago reported Friday morning that 2 inches of snow had blanketed the metro area with more expected through the weekend. Flights at Chicago O'Hare International Airport were temporarily grounded.\n\nIn the Southeast, damaging wind gusts threatening to produce tornadoes concerned meteorologists, especially in the Gulf Coast region. The weather service issued a tornado watch from eastern Texas to western Mississippi. Wind advisories were in effect in eastern Texas, across the Gulf Coast and up through Vermont.\n\nIn the Northeast, the poleward advance of Gulf moisture will lead to yet another round of heavy rain stretching northward into the mid-Atlantic and southern New England by Friday night. Much of the Northeast is still reeling from a winter storm earlier this week that dumped torrential rain over the region, flooding coastal neighborhoods and low-lying areas from New Jersey to Maine.\n\nThe Pacific Northwest will also face the frigid combination of arctic air and gusty east winds making temperatures below zero degrees possible. The weather service has placed widespread wind chill advisories and watches and has advised people to take precautions to avoid frostbite and hypothermia.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Blizzard warnings were issued Friday morning for areas of South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin and Michigan, according to the weather service.\n\n∎ Roads across eastern Nebraska, Iowa and northern Illinois were \"completely\" covered with snow, slush or ice, according to a regional map of road conditions from the Iowa Department of Transportation. Iowa State Patrol issued a \"Life-Threatening Winter Weather Alert\" asking people to cease non-essential travel overnight.\n\n∎ More than 240,000 households were without power as of 10 a.m. Friday, according to a tracker maintained by USA TODAY. Most outages were reported in Illinois, where nearly 100,000 utility customers lost power amid freezing temperatures and intense snowfall.\n\n∎ Parts of Utah and Wyoming are expected to receive \"impressive snowfall\" over the weekend, the Salt Lake City National Weather Service announced.

Kathy Hochul says National Guard deployed ahead of New York storm\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a press briefing on Friday that the National Guard will be in place Saturday morning ahead of a major storm expected to impact much of the state.\n\nHochul said 11,000 crew members stood ready to assist if the power goes out, with 5,500 already stationed in the western part of the state.\n\n\"It's going to be bitter cold,\" she said. \"Do whatever you can to stay safe and warm.\"\n\nOfficials are preparing for blizzard-like conditions and for temperatures to drop below freezing starting Saturday, with wind gusts of up to 70 mph posing a danger of power outages, Hochul's office said in a press release on Thursday.\n\nStorm triggers widespread state of emergency declarations in Wisconsin counties\n\nCounties throughout Wisconsin on Friday issued and extended state of emergency declarations as a winter storm brought blizzard-like conditions to some areas. Several counties closed courthouses and county offices early for the day.\n\nIn Waukesha County, non-essential county employees were sent home at 1 p.m. on Friday because of treacherous road conditions.\n\n“The rate of snowfall and blowing winds has caused deterioration of our roads county-wide,” read a statement from County Executive Paul Farrow. The declaration will remain in place through Saturday afternoon.\n\nTiffany Lorence, a resident of the county, told USA TODAY that powerful gusts of wind and rapid snowfall began overnight and piled up to more than a foot of snow outside her home by the time she woke up on Friday.\n\nLorence, who owns a martial arts school in Waukesha with her husband, said she and her children, who are homeschooled, are going to “enjoy the snow.”\n\n“We've waited a long time for it this year,” she said, noting that the first lasting snow they got fell on Tuesday when an earlier winter storm barreled across the Midwest. “We can't really complain now.”\n\nIllinois residents woke up to ferocious storm\n\nChristine Forwell, a longtime resident of Romeoville, Illinois, a village about 25 miles southwest of Chicago, said the most intense snowfall began at about 4 a.m. local time.\n\n“It started snowing real, real heavy and it did that for about two hours,” she told USA TODAY. “It got pretty rough.”\n\nForwell was one of nearly 90,000 utility customers who lost power Friday morning as the storm swept across the Midwest. Her power went out at about 7 a.m. and remained out through most of the morning.\n\nThe heavy wind and snow was eventually replaced by “light flakes” after a few hours, she said. There were snow mounds at least 2 feet high when conditions cleared up.\n\nWarming centers open as cities nationwide brace for winter storm\n\nCities around the country are opening warming centers and winter shelters ahead of a winter storm expected to bring frigid temperatures and inches of snow to some areas.\n\nIn Chicago, which could receive up to 12 inches of snow amid temperatures that could descend 30 degrees below zero with wind chill, the city designated six community centers as \"warming centers.\"\n\nThe mayor of Akron, Ohio announced on Friday that a local community center would extend its hours from Sunday to Tuesday to operate as a warming center. The area is bracing for strong winds and snow showers this weekend, according to the Weather Channel.\n\nDown south, Houston also opened six warming centers throughout the city as the region prepares for an arctic front to move in late Saturday and Sunday. The city will also provide free rides to the centers, according to KHOU-11.\n\nColorado Gov. Jared Polis also announced the opening of warming centers noting that temperatures in the area could drop below ten degrees with sub-zero wind chills. Polis issued a disaster declaration that freed up resources to address the winter storm.\n\nBlizzard forces GOP presidential candidates to cancel events Friday\n\nBlizzard conditions bearing down on Iowa complicated the event schedules of Republican presidential candidates ahead of the start of the state's caucuses.\n\nNikki Haley's campaign canceled three in-person events scheduled Friday in Fort Dodge, Le Mars and Council Bluffs due to the weather. Instead, campaign officials said they would be hosting telephone town halls.\n\n“Stormy weather won’t stop us from ensuring Iowans hear Nikki’s vision for a strong and proud America,” Pat Garrett, a Haley spokesperson, said in a statement to the Des Moines Register, part of the USA TODAY Network. “With only three days until the caucuses, we’re going to keep telling voters why they should Pick Nikki.”\n\nRon DeSantis also canceled two events Friday morning.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy, however, said he would continue with every event as \"long as we can physically make it.\" His campaign team went into a ditch earlier this week and needed the help of a passerby to get out.\n\n– Des Moines Register\n\nSevere weather causes ground stop at Chicago airport\n\nPoor weather conditions on Friday led to more than 1,000 flights at airports across the country being canceled.\n\nIn Illinois, Chicago O'Hare International Airport temporarily grounded all flights on Friday morning due to snow and ice, said the Federal Aviation Administration. Just before 9 a.m., officials reported a 2-hour delay at the airport that was anticipated to last until 8 p.m. local time.\n\nWeather service forecasters warned people throughout the state to consider staying off the roads as snow fell between 1-2 inches per hour and limited visibility. \"Expect hazardous to downright dangerous travel conditions today across much of the area,\" the weather service in Chicago said.\n\nSchools close amid winter storm, severe weather\n\nSchool closures were ubiquitous throughout the Midwest and Plains regions as a powerful winter storm dropped temperatures into single digits and below zero.\n\nHundreds of public schools canceled classes or transitioned to e-learning from Idaho to Illinois. Dozens of schools were closed earlier this week when a storm barreled across the country and brought blizzard conditions to the Midwest.\n\nIn the Southeast, schools throughout Georgia, Alabama, Missouri and Tennessee canceled classes ahead of expected storms bringing high winds, rain and the threat of tornadoes to the region.\n\n2 men rescued, 1 believed dead in Idaho avalanche\n\nTwo men were rescued and a third was believed dead after an avalanche in Idaho swept across the backcountry on Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe avalanche happened near Stevens Peak in Shoshone County in the state's northern panhandle near the Montana and Washington borders, about 100 miles from Spokane, Washington.\n\nThe Shoshone County Sheriff’s Office in a statement posted on social media said authorities received a GPS alert of a possible fatality near Steven's Peak shortly before 3 p.m. Law enforcement assembled a rescue team and were able to locate two of the three men while searching in their last known location. Authorities believe the third man is dead.\n\n\"While debriefing the two males, we received information causing us to believe the third male was deceased at the site of the avalanche,\" the sheriff's office said. Authorities began searching the area again on Friday.\n\nWinter storms barreling through the western United States throughout the week led forecasters to issue avalanche warnings from northern California up through Washington. The area where Thursday's avalanche occurred was under a warning.\n\nOn Wednesday, an avalanche at a ski resort near Lake Tahoe, California, killed one man and injured three others.\n\nSevere weather to continue into next week\n\n\"The storms and winter weather are yet only the first part of the story as a surge of arctic air into the heart of the country will follow in the storm system's wake,\" the National Weather Service said.\n\nA polar plunge will bring century-old record low temperatures to most of the country at the end of this week and into next week, the NWS reported.\n\nThe subfreezing temperatures that have reached the northern Rockies and Plains will head farther south and east, the service reported.

The Smokehouse Creek Fire, the largest blaze, closed highways and remained 0% contained as of Tuesday afternoon.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Weather Service warned Tuesday that a major winter storm will primarily impact the Northwest on Wednesday and Thursday before hitting the mountains in California later in the week. Multiple feet of snow were forecast for higher elevations, including the Cascade and Sierra passes.\n\nThe Storm Prediction Center said \"scattered strong to severe thunderstorms, associated with large hail, damaging gusts, and a few tornadoes will be possible from late Tuesday afternoon into the evening and overnight\" in the upper Midwest. By Tuesday evening, preliminary reports showed four possible tornadoes in Illinois.\n\nTornado in Chicago\n\nTornado warnings were issued across parts of Indiana, Michigan, and Illinois, including Chicago. Preliminary reports showed four possible tornadoes in Illinois on Tuesday evening, including one just west of Chicago in Schaumberg, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Flooding also had closed lanes on Interstate 55 near Lawndale in Cook County, Illinois, and the weather service had reported wind gusts of more than 70 mph.\n\nMore than 50 million people faced a threat of severe weather threat Tuesday night, stretching north and east from Arkansas into New England.\n\nIn Wichita, Kansas, the weather service reported the office plunged from a daily record high temperature of 80 degrees at 2 p.m. to snow within hours and residents are expected to wake up to single-digit wind chills on Wednesday morning.\n\nWind-driven fires in central, south U.S.\n\nThe warmer temperatures also brought an increased risk of fires across the Great Plains. The National Weather Service said dry, gusty winds were creating critical fire weather conditions and issued red flag warnings and fire weather watches in parts of New Mexico, Colorado, Texas and Oklahoma, up to Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota and east to Iowa, Illinois and Missouri.\n\nWildfires in Texas' rural Panhandle prompted evacuation orders in small towns and shut down a nuclear facility. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued a disaster declaration for 60 counties as the Smokehouse Creek Fire burned more than 250,000 acres, according to the Texas A&M Forest Service.\n\nMultiple fires were also reported across Hemphill and Hutchinson counties near the Oklahoma border, where some evacuations were ordered. And in central Nebraska, a mower sparked a prairie fire that has burned more than 70,000 acres of land, state officials said Tuesday.\n\nRecord warmth from Plains to Midwest\n\nHow warm? On Monday, dozens of record highs were set across the central U.S., as temperatures rocketed to the 80s as far north as Nebraska, according to Weather.com meteorologist Jonathan Erdman. By Tuesday, he said, all-time February records will be in jeopardy in Chicago; Green Bay, Wisconsin; and St. Louis, among other locations.\n\nAccuWeather meteorologist Alex DaSilva called the temperatures \"springlike\" and said the warmth will be in store for much of the center of the country from the southern Plains to the Midwest. \"Some cities will have high temperatures rising as much as 15-30 degrees above typical late-February values\" on Tuesday.\n\nSaid Mark Gehring, a weather service meteorologist in Sullivan, Wisconsin: “We’re blowing away the records in northern Illinois into south central and southwestern Wisconsin.”\n\nA golden glow:Watch as Yosemite's Horsetail Fall glows golden during annual 'firefall' event: Video\n\nWinter almost a no-show for much of the country\n\nThe warmth will be another reminder that \"winter\" has been practically a no-show for a large chunk of the central and northeastern U.S. over the past few months. Several states, including Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin, were on track for their warmest winter on record, Erdman said, and other Midwest and Northeast states were targeting their top-five warmest winters.\n\nClimate scientists define winter as the three months of December, January and February.\n\nBlizzard-like conditions, dangerous travel expected in the West\n\nIn the West, the storm will create near-blizzard conditions, resulting in dangerous travel, the National Weather Service said. Snowfall rates of 1-2 inches per hour will move into the Great Basin and Central Rockies on Tuesday.\n\n\"These snow rates combined with winds gusting 50-65 mph will produce near-blizzard conditions with significantly reduced visibility and snow-covered roads, leading to dangerous travel,\" the weather service said.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/04/08/total-solar-eclipse-2024-forecast-updates/72869293007/", "title": "Solar eclipse: See video and photos of the sky spectacle", "text": "EAGLE PASS, Texas − In a moment of cosmic alignment that was precisely predicted yet undeniably mysterious, the moon crept across the face of the sun as seen from Earth, casting its shadow onto the United States on Monday.\n\nAnd then it was over: A total eclipse of the sun has come and gone.\n\nThe partial shadow crossed into the U.S. in Texas just after noon local time, and a bit more than an hour later, the minutes of “totality” began. The total eclipse of the sun then traced a path from southern Texas to northern Maine, where it exited into Canada and the ocean beyond.\n\nThe rare event was an astronomical experience like no other. Monday's eclipse was unusually accessible to millions of people. It was widely anticipated not only for its remarkable period of darkness, but for its rare timing: No total solar eclipse would be visible from the contiguous United States again until 2044. While millions of Americans may have seen today’s eclipse, a small group in Texas was among the very first.\n\nEdge of eclipse shadow began in south Texas\n\nAlejandra Martinez, a seventh-grade science teacher from the south Texas border city of Eagle Pass, peered up at the gray, gauzy sky, anxiously awaiting the solar eclipse’s entrance into the USA.\n\nSitting with a telescope under a camping canopy in a corner of the county airport, Martinez, 42, and two other science enthusiasts had been recruited by NASA to participate in an effort called Citizen CATE 2024, where more than 30 teams perched in the eclipse’s path will record the shadowy trek across the country.\n\nIn this spot, less than five miles from the U.S.-Mexico border, she and her team would be among the first people in the U.S. to witness the phenomenon. Eagle Pass sits near the very beginning of the eclipse’s track from southwest to northeast across the country. It also sits very near dead-center of it, where the period of “totality” will be the longest. That total shadow was still more than an hour away when the edge of the shadow began to darken the sky.\n\nMartinez, dressed in a “This Totality Rocks” T-shirt and eclipse-themed skirt, watched as the penumbra crept across the airfield, about 10 minutes past noon local time. She put on her eclipse glasses and peered up at the sky. The gauzy clouds parted. “There it is! There it is!” she yelled. “First contact. It’s begun!”\n\nClouds came and went as the shadow grew for the next hour. As totality approached Eagle Pass, the sky shaded a dull gray then a heavy brown and the temperature dropped a few degrees. Only a sliver of the sun remained.\n\nA few seconds before 1:27 p.m. CT, the crowd counted down, “3..2..1…” The sun was gone, completely covered by the moon. Darkness spread over the small airport grounds. “Oh my god,” Martinez said, a hand covering her heart. “This is so cool!”\n\nHow to tell if you have eye damage from looking at a partial eclipse?\n\nFor those who took a chance and looked at the sun without protective eyewear during the eclipse, concerns may arise if their vision starts to seem impaired. Have they suffered eclipse blindness?\n\nLooking directly at the sun even briefly without the proper safety glasses can result in eye damage, either temporary or permanent. The body's natural squinting reaction in normal circumstances prevents people from staring directly at the sun, but that reflex may not be activated during partial eclipses, even though a partly shielded sun can still burn the retina.\n\nThe American Academy of Ophthalmology says pain won't be an indication of damaged eyes because the retina lacks pain nerves. Worrisome signs are instead blurry vision, headaches, light sensitivity, blind spots in the central vision, distorted vision and changes in color perception. Anyone experiencing those symptoms should see an ophthalmologist, the AAO says.\n\nWhat was the timeline of the 2024 solar eclipse?\n\nThe total eclipse began in Mexico at about 11:07 a.m. PDT, Monday before crossing into Texas at 1:27 p.m. CDT. It ended in Maine at 3:35 p.m. EDT. Even those who weren't in the path of totality could see a percentage of the eclipse.\n\nTo find out exactly when the eclipse occurred in your area, you can search by USA TODAY's database by ZIP code for a viewing guide.\n\nStudents in Washington get hands-on learning\n\nDozens of students spilled out of Ida B. Wells Middle School in Washington, D.C., gripping cardboard solar eclipse glasses and chatting with excitement. “Why is the sun shaped as a moon?” one student asked after looking toward the sun. “Why is it not getting dark?’’ asked another.\n\nTeacher Troy Mangum, who the students called “Mr. Mango,’’ slowly explained the science behind the experience as he cautioned others to put on their glasses. Students at the school in northwest D.C. had had lessons about the eclipse leading up the day’s teaching outside the classroom.\n\n“Anytime we can get hands on or dynamic learning … it’s invaluable,’’ said Mangum, a social emotional learning coach. “We talked about it so much. It’s nice to see them get excited about qeeky Mr. Mango type of stuff.”\n\nSkylar Cruel, 12, had come outside with her science class. “I just really wanted to see it,’’ she said. “You get to see it turn from light to dark.”\n\nSteps away at Whittier Elementary School, which focuses on science, technology, engineering and math (STEM), younger students put on their glasses and tilted their heads up toward the sun behind their school.\n\nMichael Haile joined his daughter, Markan Worku, 9, a student at Whittier, and brought along his 5-year-old son, Keab. He called it a memorable experience for his children. Markan, who had been learning about solar eclipses in her third-grade class, simply said, “This is cool!’’\n\n− Deborah Berry\n\nIn Michigan, a bonding experience for a mother and her three kids\n\nIn Michigan, eclipse enthusiasts packed a watch party along the Detroit Riverwalk near Cullen Plaza. They sat on the grass, on benches and berms. For Janelle Ikonen of Waterford, it was a chance to bond with her three children − Hannah, 9; Elim, 12; and Isaac, 14 − whom she took out of school for the day.\n\n“I wanted to experience a unique event with them,” said Ikonen, 47. “It’s one of my big deals to me, to experience things with my kids. … I hope they’ll remember spending time with me.”\n\nIn Grand Rapids, where 94% coverage of the sun was expected, viewers gathered on the city's “Blue Bridge,” which offered a view of the eclipse over the Grand River. With no cloud cover over the city, visitors had an unobstructed scene. The Grand Rapids Public Museum set up a series of solar telescopes.\n\nJill and Wes Johnson, 50 and 14, were among those awaiting max coverage. They’d considered traveling from Grand Rapids to a place with total coverage, but decided 94% coverage was worthwhile enough to stay home.\n\n“I think people are excited to see something unique,” Jill Johnson said.\n\n− Georgea Kovanis and Arpan Lobo, Detroit Free Press\n\nUS women's soccer team takes in eclipse ahead of title game\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio − The U.S. women’s national soccer team took a break from SheBelieves Cup preparation to watch the eclipse.\n\nSeveral team members, including World Cup veterans Crystal Dunn, Alyssa Naeher, Naomi Girma and Trinity Rodman, coaches and staff members donned eclipse glasses and went outside their hotel to see the rare event.\n\nAs the sky darkened and the moon moved in front of the sun, someone yelled, “Come on, keep going!” Columbus is just outside the path of totality, so all but a sliver of the sun wound up being covered.\n\nThe USWNT is in Columbus for the final of the SheBelieves Cup on Tuesday night against Canada.\n\n− Nancy Armour\n\nWitnessing the first total eclipse from a cruise ship\n\nPassengers aboard Holland America's Koningsdam cruise ship eagerly gathered on the top decks at 10 a.m. local time to watch the spectacle of a solar eclipse.\n\nPositioned off the coast of Mazatlan, Mexico − the first city in North America to witness the total eclipse − the ship provided an ideal vantage point for viewing the celestial event. Accompanied by an astronomer, the captain meticulously adjusted the ship's position to ensure the best possible view.\n\nDan Fueller, an experienced eclipse observer who had previously seen similar phenomena from ships in 1991 and 1998, emphasized the advantages of viewing the eclipse from a cruise ship. He noted the flexibility of the ship's mobility allowed for optimal positioning along the eclipse's path, ensuring unobstructed views.\n\n\"You're on a cruise ship and (the best view) is a little bit farther to the west or a little bit farther to the east − along the path, there's a clear sky − the ship can move. If you're on land and there's not a road there, you better have a tank.\"\n\n− Joshuan Rivera\n\nPartial eclipse 'like a little Pac-Man taking a bite out of the sun'\n\nIn Parthenon, Arkansas, the eclipse began near the Buffalo National River. Five friends traveled from Florida to be on a rock outcropping to witness the celestial event.\n\n“Yes! I see it!” Angie Printiss exclaimed.\n\n“Oh ya! You can see it,” said Kate Estes. “It’s like a little Pac-Man taking a bite out of the sun.”\n\nAt 20 minutes before totality, the sky got noticeably darker. The shadow of crescent sun shapes played off the limestone rocks.\n\n“It looks like water − like fish scales,” Estes said. “That is so weird, when the trees move you can really see it.”\n\n− Jennifer Portman\n\nNew Englanders travel for better view of the eclipse\n\nCrowds ballooned into the thousands midday Monday in the center of St. Johnsbury, Vermont, as the nearly cloudless sky and warm sun boosted temperatures to an unseasonably 60 degrees.\n\nJim and Kim Cooper drove over from New Hampton, New Hampshire, their first time doing more than just passing through the town locals call St. Jays. Their son had proposed to his girlfriend in Tennessee during the 2017 eclipse and then had an eclipse-themed wedding, but the Coopers had never seen a total eclipse for themselves, so they decided to come to the closest place where they could be assured of a good view.\n\nJeffrey Breau had seen that 2017 eclipse for himself and was so impressed that he convinced family members to join him this time. Breau’s girlfriend, Nell Hawley, came up with him from Cambridge, Massachusetts, while his brother Alex and his girlfriend Diana Ventura drove up from New York City. The Breau brothers' father, Walter, joined them in taking in their first eclipse.\n\n“I would have been OK watching it in the yard,” Walter said, though he would only have seen a partial eclipse from there. “That’s what you think now,” Jeffrey said quickly. “Talk to me in two hours.”\n\n− Karen Weintraub\n\nKids bring homemade eclipse viewers to National Mall\n\nLucas and Lucy Porto Banco didn’t need to buy fancy eclipse glasses – the 7- and 10-year-old siblings made their own eclipse viewers from two cardboard shoe boxes left over from a couple of their mom’s recent shoe purchases.With the help of a YouTube tutorial video, they made two holes in each box with a whittling knife and taped tin foil over. Then they used dry spaghetti to poke holes in the tin foil for the sun’s light to pass through and project onto the dark inside of the box.The kids put together the viewer in little more than five minutes, Lucy said. “Maybe 15, with covering all the gaps in the shoe box,” she said.Even with his own eclipse-viewing creation, Lucas said he may still take advantage of his eclipse glasses. “I’m going to do both,” he said.\n\n− Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nWhat is an 'umbra?' − and other eclipse words\n\nAstronomers and eclipse enthusiasts used a bunch of specialized words Monday as the nation experienced its first solar eclipse since 2017 and the last one for until 2044. Here are a few of those terms and what they mean, according to the American Astronomical Society.\n\nBaily's Beads – This refers to the beaded appearance of the moon's edge as the eclipse nears totality. Shafts of sunlight shine through deep valleys on the moon's surface, which causes the effect known to observers as Bailey's Beads.\n\nUmbra – The darkest part of the moon’s shadow, within which the entirety of the sun's bright face is blocked. An observer standing in the umbra sees a total solar eclipse.\n\nPenumbra: The lighter part of the moon's shadow, making up its outer portion, where light can reach.\n\nCorona – The sun’s upper atmosphere, visible as a pearly glow around the eclipsed sun during totality.\n\nTotality – The maximum phase of a total solar eclipse, during which the moon’s disk completely covers the sun's bright face. It can last from a fraction of a second to a maximum of 7 minutes, 31 seconds, depending on viewing location and other factors.\n\n− Dale Denwalt, The Oklahoman\n\nA last-minute search for glasses for 'a perfect spot'\n\nPatsy Faoro walked toward a half dozen people gathered at the gate of Turner Farm Park in Great Falls, Virginia. The people were awaiting the opening of an eclipse viewing event complete with telescopes and educational presentations.\n\nFaoro, who lives near the park in this upscale Northern Virginia neighborhood, just wanted glasses to safely view the eclipse.\n\nShe visited CVS, Safeway and a 7/11 convenience store, all of which had advertised the availability of glasses to view the eclipse. None of the retailers had any glasses remaining when Faoro checked this morning.\n\n“We have this great big open space that’s a perfect spot,” said Faoro, who viewed her first eclipse in the 1970s. “We just need some glasses.”\n\n− Ken Alltucker\n\nIndianapolis Motor Speedway event draws tens of thousands\n\nTory Patrick, 41, is hoping to give her four children a once-in-a-lifetime learning opportunity. Patrick and her family traveled 160 miles to Indianapolis Motor Speedway from their home in Granger, Indiana. They were expected to have 97% totality at home, but it’s not the same as total coverage, she said.\n\n“They will be getting the full experience that they can’t read about in textbooks,” Patrick said.\n\nPatrick and her sister Cally Gannon, 39, from Cincinnati, met in Indianapolis to view the eclipse from the speedway. They camped outside IMS over the weekend ahead of the event and on Sunday afternoon saw a double rainbow over the speedway’s iconic pagoda. An estimated 50,000 tickets were sold for the day’s festivities, presented in partnership with NASA and Purdue University.\n\nElsewhere in the stands, Ryan Harper, 30, knows today is special.\n\n“We’re right in totality,” he said. “This sometimes doesn’t happen in people’s lifetimes.\n\n— Sarah Bowman and Jade Thomas\n\nFamily travels from Baltimore to Rochester, N.Y., to view the eclipse\n\nWhen Maze Pelham of Baltimore was a fifth-grader, he watched news of the 2017 solar eclipse and vowed to witness the next notable solar eclipse. That eclipse, and that day, has come. And this is why he and his parents, Janice and Sonney Pelham, left Maryland around 1 a.m. on Monday and drove nearly seven hours to Rochester, New York.\n\n“I said to myself I would go to the next one,” Maze Pelham said while seated with his parents on lawn chairs at downtown Rochester’s Parcel 5 park, where he and hundreds of others are awaiting a view of the full eclipse. “It’s a promise I made to myself.”\n\n– Democrat and Chronicle, part of the USA TODAY Network\n\nIn Brooklyn: Eclipses glasses, check. Lawn chair, check.\n\nRalph Emerson held a pair of paper sunglasses in his hands while riding the subway to Brooklyn's sprawling Prospect Park on Monday. He exited the train with a folded lawn chair strapped across his shoulder, and said he felt energized and full of anticipation.\n\n\"This is special,\" Emerson, 61, said. \"I haven't woken up with this much excitement since the Super Bowl.\"\n\nWalking to the park's botanic garden, Emerson said appreciating natural phenomena makes it easier to manage the stresses that come with living in a big city. Also like a big sports game, the eclipse will draw lots of people together to experience something much larger than themselves, in community, he said.\n\n\"A lot of times it's tragedies that bring us together, but sometimes things like this do,\" he said.\n\n− Claire Thornton\n\nTexas Eclipse Festival cut short by weather\n\nThe Texas Eclipse Festival was canceled Monday in Burnet County, 50 miles northwest of Austin, because of weather concerns. The festival, which included bands and other events, began Sunday and was supposed to wrap up Tuesday.\n\n\"We regret to inform you of the severe weather forecast, including risks of high winds, tornadic activity, large hail, and thunderstorms for later today, including during the eclipse, Tuesday, and Wednesday,\" festival organizers said on their website. \"Your safety is our top priority.\"\n\nFestivalgoers were urged to leave early for safety and to beat traffic. Guests, however, were allowed to stay \"provided they pack and are prepared to depart after totality.\"\n\nTraffic jams, collisions mar eclipse watchers' travel\n\nTraffic crashes and road delays were reported across the nation as Americans flocked to prime locations to gaze up at the rare solar eclipse. Local roads and highways in states including Texas, Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Vermont and New Hampshire were overwhelmed with eclipse chasers, many of whom were from out of state. The most intense bottlenecks appeared to be in the path of totality, where spectators will be able to view the full eclipse.\n\nIn Oklahoma, a crash around 7:30 a.m. local time narrowed eastbound lanes on I-40, a major transcontinental highway that runs from California to North Carolina. The crash occurred not far from several state parks that were hosting eclipse events, and it's also within driving distance of the full eclipse path, which includes parts of southeastern Oklahoma and Arkansas.\n\nMultiple crashes were reported on an interstate in Waco, Texas, a city in the path of totality, where several festivities and eclipse viewing events were scheduled. The crashes all occurred on I-35, which runs from southern Texas to Minnesota.\n\n\"Expect major traffic delays in this area,\" the Texas Department of Transportation said in a statement.\n\n− Christopher Cann\n\nAirport draws a crowd of jets for eclipse\n\nEAGLE PASS, Texas − Maverick County International Airport in Eagle Pass, Texas, usually sees maybe three private planes a day. By 10 a.m. CT on Monday, more than 10 planes crowded the tarmac, including Cessnas, Pipers and at least one corporate jet − all there to catch an early glimpse of the total solar eclipse. Eagle Pass will be one of the first American cities to witness the phenomenon. Some watchers, like Brandon Beck, 43, flew in Sunday night from San Diego and spent the night in a sleeping bag on the tarmac next to his friend’s Mooney single-prop piston four-seater.“We’re so lucky to be on a planet where the sun is the perfect size and perfect distance to create that effect,” he said. “It’s obligatory. We have to see it.”\n\nFirst the Cherry Blossoms, then the eclipse\n\nWASHINGTON − The Cherry Blossoms brought Ali and Aurore Youssouf to the city all the way from Paris, but the pair were delighted to learn that their trip would overlap with the eclipse. The day is extra special for Aurore Youssouf, 43, who has never seen an eclipse before. On Monday morning, the couple arrived by chance at the National Mall early enough to snag a few pairs of free eclipse glasses distributed by the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum for the occasion.“We didn’t even know. We just ended up here and found out that they were giving away some glasses,” said Ali Youssouf, 46.\n\n− Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nAwaiting eclipse − and hail − in Texas\n\nKERRVILLE, Texas − Forecasts called for considerable cloudiness, rain and possible hail, but retired NASA engineer Jeff Stone stayed positive as he and his wife prepared to host more than a dozen people for a watch party at their hilltop home in Texas Hill Country. Stone, an eclipse enthusiast who had met family in Missouri to watch the solar eclipse of 2017, said he recently reviewed video footage of that event and said current conditions weren’t that much different than they were back then.\n\n“I’m outside and seeing patches of blue among scattered clouds, so we’re remaining hopeful,” he said.\n\nAbout 150 miles to the northeast in Gatesville, lead pastor Eric Moffett of Coryell Community Church said a similar forecast did little to deter an expected gathering of about 800 visitors for the church’s family-oriented “Eclipse at the Crosses” event. Many, if not most, were from out of town or even out of country − Canada, Wales, France, Italy. Many locals were staying home to avoid the crowd, he said.\n\n“It’s partly cloudy, but the sun is shining on me right now,” he said. “We are praying that it stays that way.”\n\n− Marc Ramirez\n\nWhat is the difference between a solar eclipse and a lunar eclipse?\n\nA total solar eclipse occurs when the moon comes in between the Earth and the sun, blocking its light from reaching our planet, leading to a period of darkness lasting several minutes. A total lunar eclipse occurs when the moon and the sun are on exact opposite sides of Earth. The Earth blocks the sunlight that normally reaches the moon. Instead of that sunlight hitting the moon’s surface, Earth's shadow falls on it.\n\nA lunar eclipse can last for a few hours, while a solar eclipse lasts only a few minutes. Solar eclipses also rarely occur, while lunar eclipses are comparatively more frequent. While at least two partial lunar eclipses happen every year, total lunar eclipses are still rare, NASA says. Another major difference: No special glasses or gizmos are needed to view the a lunar eclipse, and people can directly stare at the moon.\n\n− Saman Shafiq\n\nSolar eclipse, lunar eclipse:What is the difference?\n\nCan you drive during the solar eclipse?\n\nThe 2024 solar eclipse will shroud much of the United States in darkness on Monday, leaving many people to wonder: Is it safe to drive during the solar eclipse?\n\nIt is safe to drive during an eclipse as long as you don't look up at the sky. AAA is telling drivers to be focused on the road if they are operating a car during the total solar eclipse. But the automobile insurance company is advising Americans who want to safely view the total eclipse to \"find a safe place to park (not on the side of a road or highway) away from other traffic and then wear your eclipse glasses,\" said Aixa Diaz, a spokeswoman from AAA.\n\n\"Pack your patience, whether traveling a great distance or locally,\" Diaz said. \"People will be out and about to catch a glimpse of the eclipse.\"\n\nA similar scenario played out in 2017 during the nation's last total solar eclipse: Congestion in some areas lasted for up to 13 hours after totality, according to Transportation Research News, a National Research Council publication. An analysis of traffic patterns from that year suggests the worst of the traffic – on interstates and rural back roads alike – will kick off after the eclipse ends and everyone tries to leave all at once.\n\n− Kayla Jimenez\n\nWhen will the next solar eclipse happen?\n\nIt will be 20 years before there's a chance to witness a total solar eclipse in the United States again. According to NASA, after Monday's total solar eclipse, the next one viewable from the contiguous U.S. will be on Aug. 23, 2044.\n\nUnfortunately, the 2044 total solar eclipse won't have the broad reach across the U.S. as the 2024 eclipse. The path of totality during the 2044 eclipse will only touch three states, according to the Planetary Society, a nonprofit involved in research, public outreach and political space advocacy. The eclipse will begin in Greenland, sweep through Canada and end around sunset in Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota.\n\nBut another eclipse scheduledfor Saturday, Aug. 12, 2045, will trace a path of totality over California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, Arkansas, Missouri, Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Florida and Georgia.\n\n− Mary Walrath-Holdridge, Gabe Hauari and Eric Lagatta\n\nEclipse and pets: It's not the sky that's the problem\n\nAn eclipse itself isn't dangerous for domestic animals such as dogs and cats, but experts say it's probably best to not bring pets to experience the April 2024 total solar eclipse. Experts' biggest concern is not what’s happening in the sky but on the ground as crowds of excited and eager people gather, said Dr. Rena Carlson, president of the American Veterinary Medical Association. Dogs especially will take their cues from their owners rather than the celestial event.\n\n“Rather than the effects of the eclipse, I would be more worried about the excitement and all of the people,” Carlson said.\n\n− Elizabeth Weise\n\nA guide to the solar eclipse for kids\n\nHere's an easy-to read, illustrated guide to help kids understand what the April 8 total solar eclipse means, where it will be visible and how you can watch it safely. It also shows them how an ordinary kitchen colander can easily be used to view a solar eclipse − the colander's holes can project crescent images of the sun onto the ground. There are even pages that can be downloaded and colored.\n\nTrump's eclipse experience lit up internet in 2017\n\nSeven years ago, when the last total solar eclipse crossed over North America, a photo of then-President Donald Trump seemingly gazing at the sun with his naked eyes set the internet ablaze. During the afternoon of Aug. 21, 2017, Trump, who was president at the time, was joined by then first lady Melania Trump and their son Barron to watch the rare phenomenon from the Truman Balcony at the White House. Photos taken by members of the media captured all three donning eclipse glasses while looking at the eclipse.\n\nBut at one point during the viewing, the former president was captured in photos and videos without proper eye protection, seemingly gazing directly at the sun. Looking at an eclipse before or after the brief phase of totality without proper eyewear can lead to eye damage.\n\n− Natalie Neysa Alund\n\nWhen is the next total solar eclipse?What to know about the next eclipse's path, timing\n\nHow to make a solar eclipse viewer\n\nPeople who didn't manage to get their hands on glasses are not completely down and out. There are other safe ways to view the eclipse, say experts, and a lot of them only require a little bit of craftiness and items you can find lying around the house.\n\nSteps to make the cereal box eclipse viewer (And here is a video aid):\n\nGet an empty, clean cereal box.\n\nCut a white piece of cardboard that will fit snuggly in the bottom of the box, or secure it permanently by gluing it in place.\n\nCut the top of the cereal box, removing both ends and leaving the center intact.\n\nPut a piece of tape across the center of the top to securely hold it closed.\n\nTape a piece of heavy-duty foil or double a single layer for additional strength, covering one of the openings at the top of the cereal box. The other opening will remain open for viewing.\n\nUsing a small nail (approximately 3mm in diameter) push a hole in the foil.\n\nCover the entire box with construction paper, leaving the single-viewing opening and the foil uncovered.\n\nThe finished box should be held with the pin-hole side facing the sun. It may take a little practice pointing the box. With your back facing the sun, look through the viewing opening. A small image of the sun, about ½ cm in diameter, can be seen projected on the white paper inside the box.\n\n− Mary Walrath-Holdrid\n\nWhat is the path of the solar eclipse called?\n\nThose in the direct line of the eclipse will be treated to an incredible sight as the moon completely blots out the sun's disk, ushering in uncharacteristic darkness and revealing the sun's elusive outermost layer called the corona. That moment is called \"totality\" and this year the path of totality crosses through 13 U.S. states.\n\nThe last total solar eclipse to cut through North America was in August 2017.\n\nHow to look at eclipse without glasses\n\nA total solar eclipse offers skygazers the rare opportunity to witness the eclipse with the naked eye. However, solar eclipse glasses are still needed until totality is reached.\n\nCertified solar eclipse glasses are crucial for spectators to avoid the sun's retina-damaging rays. But when the moon moves completely in front of the sun and blocks its light, you'll know it's safe to remove the glasses for a short period of time.\n\nHow fast does an eclipse shadow travel?\n\nAccording to a post from the National Weather Service in Indianapolis on X, an eclipse shadow travels at speeds from 1,100 to 5,000 mph. Near the equator, it travels at around 1,100 mph and increases in speed as it approaches the poles.\n\nThe eclipse party is over? Time to recycle those glasses!\n\nAstronomers Without Borders, or AWB, a non-profit organization running its second nationwide eclipse glasses recycling drive. Her business will join over 300 schools, museums, city governments, commercial businesses, community organizations and local libraries that will collect and ship an estimated millions of glasses to be repurposed for use by underserved communities around the world in future solar eclipses.\n\nAWB launched its first run of the program after the last solar eclipse in 2017 when volunteer centers across the country collected millions of the glass. After vetting them for reuse, more than half a million glasses were distributed to Africa, Asia and South America.\n\nPeople can visit AWB's website to find their nearest participating collection center and learn more about recycling the glasses, said Andrew Fazekas, the organization's communication manager.\n\n\"We figure there's probably going to be tens of millions of glasses out there at the very least,\" he said. \"And most of them are probably very gently used.\"\n\n− Cybele Mayes-Osterman", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/01/14/snow-freezing-temperatures-live-weather-updates/72223787007/", "title": "Snow, freezing temperatures sweeping across the US. Weather ...", "text": "Editor's Note: This page is a summary of news on the winter weather for Sunday, Jan. 14. For the latest weather news, view our live updates file for Monday, Jan. 15..\n\nARLINGTON, Va. − A deep freeze that settled in across much of the nation Sunday threatened to wallop dozens of states with snow and ice, bring freezing temperatures as far south as Florida and create chaos for travelers, football fans and even voters in the Iowa Caucuses.\n\nWind chill advisories or warnings were in effect Sunday for more than 100 million Americans, and over 44 million were under a winter weather advisory. Much of the country faced temperatures 20-40 degrees below normal.\n\nThe severe cold was expected to push as far south as northern Texas while Montana and the Dakotas could see subfreezing wind chills. The National Weather Service said North Dakota could see \"life-threatening wind chills as low as 60 below zero.\"\n\n“It takes a matter of minutes for frostbite to set in,” the South Dakota Department of Public Safety said in a statement Sunday urging people to stay indoors.\n\nA winter storm with snow and ice will threaten the mid-Atlantic and New England from Monday night to Tuesday night, AccuWeather said. The storm, and a wall of arctic air, is expected to ride the jet stream across most of the nation over the next few days.\n\n\"For much of the country, this will end up being the coldest and most persistent outbreak of arctic air in a couple of winters,\" AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Matt Benz said.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ The Electric Reliability Council of Texas, tasked with operating the state's power grid, has said it expects the grid to function normally, though city and county leaders and energy experts have warned of the possibility of outages caused by extreme conditions. In the winter storm of 2021, 4 million Texans were left without power after nearly half of the state's generation capacity was knocked offline because of frozen equipment and other weather-related problems across the system.\n\n∎ In Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser was planning to activate a Cold Weather Emergency on Monday through Thursday. Human services agencies will assist unsheltered and vulnerable residents with shelters, warming buses, gloves, blankets, and handwarmers.\n\n∎ In Arlington, outside of the nation's capital, deep freezes are rare and authorities urged residents to consider wrapping pipes or leaving water running a trickle to avoid freezing and cracking: \"Temperatures expected to drop this week. Think of the pipes.\"\n\nSnow and ice from Texas to Tennessee\n\nSnow rolling across Texas, Oklahoma and southern Kansas on Sunday was forecast to expand into Arkansas, Missouri, the Tennessee Valley and the southern Appalachians through Monday. Some areas could see more than a foot of snow, AccuWeather said. An area of dangerous ice was forecast late Sunday in Texas and southeastern Oklahoma before spreading into Louisiana, Mississippi, southern Arkansas, Alabama, Georgia and Tennessee into Monday.\n\nOfficials in southern states advised residents to prepare for the subfreezing weather. Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders declared a state of emergency in advance to give utility trucks and trucks transporting essential supplies more flexibility to respond.\n\n\"Texans are urged to take precautions to protect themselves, their loved ones, and their homes,\" Gov. Greg Abbott said Sunday.\n\nIn Mississippi’s capital city of Jackson, officials said they were preparing for the cold weather. Pipes had burst in 2021 and 2022 amid cold snaps, causing water pressure to drop across the city. Ted Henifin, Jackson’s interim manager of the city’s water system, told WAPT-TV that crews were on standby to respond to any broken pipes.\n\n3 feet of snow, 50-mph winds\n\nIn the Northeast, Buffalo was under siege and an NFL playoff game scheduled for Sunday was postponed. The National Weather Service said a band of lake-effect snow would dump 1 to 2 feet across much of the area, and some communities could see up to 3 feet. Winds gusts of up to 50 mph would prompt near-blizzard conditions, the weather service warned.\n\n\"Travel will be very difficult to impossible at times with deep snow cover on roads,\" the advisory said. \"Widespread blowing snow will reduce visibility to near zero.\"\n\nIowa, where iconic political caucuses are scheduled for Monday, was setting temperature records Sunday. The temperature at 7:30 a.m. dipped to minus 18 degrees at Des Moines International Airport, the lowest temperature recorded for a Jan. 14 in Des Moines since 1888. It's also the lowest temperature recorded since a minus 20 reading in January 2019.\n\n\"Many roads have drifted shut or partially shut overnight,\" the weather service in Des Moines warned on social media Sunday. \"Do yourself and the road crews a favor and do not travel!\"\n\nParts of northern Florida are projected to trend from a daytime high near 70 degrees on Monday to the upper 40s by Wednesday. Overnight temperatures could drop below freezing across the northern third of the state, AccuWeather warned.\n\nFreezing temperatures in Michigan\n\nSnowfall may hit between two and six inches and another four inches Sunday night, while areas of southern Michigan may see up to an inch after the severe storm slammed the state over the weekend.\n\nSince Friday, regions across the state saw heavy snowfall, high winds and thundersnow. Snowfall and low temperatures brought icy conditions, making roadways hazardous. The storm began Friday afternoon and continued into Saturday, bringing dangerous conditions and thousands of power outages throughout Michigan.\n\nThe Michigan Department of Transportation and Michigan State Police reported dozens of crashes throughout the weekend, with crews working continuously to clear roadways. Road conditions are particularly dangerous in northern Michigan, where intense lake bands are causing near whiteout conditions and low visibility, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nOfficials urge residents to keep an emergency kit and fully charged cell phone with them before hitting the roads.\n\nIowa Caucuses 2024 live updates:Why does the race matter for Trump, Haley and other GOP hopefuls?\n\nIn Iowa, heroism of first responders aids woman in labor\n\nDeputies in Marshall County, Iowa, worked with other first responders to aid a woman who gave birth in the snowstorm early Sunday. The call for help from a woman who was having contractions came shortly before midnight, the sheriff's office said in a statement. Responding deputies found the snow-covered road unpassable and hiked a half-mile in blizzard conditions to reach the woman's home.\n\nThe Clemons Fire Department brought in a tractor to clear a path for an ambulance. The woman gave birth at 12:38 a.m., and she and her baby were taken to Unity Point Health, authorities said.\n\nTrump not worried about weather for Iowa Caucuses\n\nIn Des Moines, former President Donald Trump met with campaign volunteers on Sunday before heading to a rally in Indianola, less than 20 miles south. Trump is a heavy favorite to win the Republican Caucuses − a new Iowa Poll released Saturday night showed him leading the field by 28 percentage points.\n\nThis is expected to be the coldest Iowa Caucus ever. In 1972, the first Iowa Caucus, wind chills reached 26 degrees below zero. But the high temperature climbed to 25 degrees. Monday's expected high is minus 3 degrees.\n\n\"We seem to have a lot of good enthusiasm,\" Trump said. \"I don't know, maybe the weather is not going to be that big a deal.\"\n\nDangerous road conditions are coming:We have tips for driving in snow.\n\nWest Coast not exempt from wintry weather, outages\n\nAlmost 170,000 homes and businesses were without power across Oregon early Sunday after a winter storm blasted across much of the state and Oregon and southwestern Washington. Temperatures dipped into the teens as power companies scrambled to bring back heat and light. Adding to the struggle: Strong winds with gusts above 80 mph tumbled trees and powerlines.\n\nPortland's Bureau of Environmental Services said its crews were working around the clock at several locations to make emergency repairs and prevent sewage releases into homes and businesses. Portland’s largest sewage pump station, which serves downtown and the surrounding inner city, was under partial service due to a frozen pipe.\n\n\"As conditions remain hazardous for the next several days, we need you to stay home,\" Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler posted Saturday on social media. \"As you are able, please check on your neighbors. It takes our entire community to get through this weather event.\"\n\nThe Oregon Department of Emergency Management also activated its Emergency Coordination Center for state agencies and nonprofit partners to share life safety resources. The department encouraged people to stay home, stay informed, have an emergency plan, and stock an emergency kit.\n\nIowa won't be warming up soon\n\nThe high temperature in Des Moines was only expected to reach minus 9 degrees, close to the all-time record of minus 14 in January 1912. Today's wind chill could reach minus 40.\n\nThe reprieve won't come right away, either. The overnight low Sunday night was forecast at minus 17. Highs on Monday, Iowa Caucuses day and the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, were expected to be minus 5 degrees. The temperatures will fall to minus 11 degrees Monday night, with a wind chill of minus 30, forecasters said.\n\n\"This extreme arctic air combined with breezy to strong winds will continue to create dangerous temperatures and wind chills through early next week, with wind chill values as low as 45 below zero possible at times,\" the weather service in Des Moines warned.\n\nA 2007 study indicates poor weather benefits the Republican Party’s vote share − and may have contributed to presidential races in 1960 (good weather in several close states helped Democrat John F. Kennedy) and 2000 (rain in Florida helped Republican George W. Bush). But the caucuses are primaries and don't pit party against party.\n\nSteelers vs. Bills:AFC wild-card game in Buffalo postponed until Monday due to weather\n\nA different kind of 'delay of game' for Buffalo\n\nIn New York, the state Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services urged Western New Yorkers to stay home.\n\n\"Travel in impacted areas will be impossible and dangerous at times throughout the weekend due to life-threatening blizzard-like conditions,\" the agency said in a statment.\n\nGov. Kathy Hochul cut a deal with the NFL to postpone Sunday's playoff game between the Buffalo Bills and the Pittsburgh Steelers from Sunday to Monday.\n\n\"I've been in communication with @NFL commissioner Roger Goodell regarding the dangerous conditions in Buffalo this weekend,\" she wrote on social media. \"In consultation with our emergency response teams, @BuffaloBills leadership, and the NFL, the Bills game will be postponed to 4:30 pm Monday.\"\n\nContributing: Marina Pitofsky, USA TODAY; Victoria Reyna-Rodriguez, José Mendiola and Philip Joens, the Des Moines Register; Alan Torres and David DeMille, Eugene Register-Guard; Jenna Prestininzi, Detroit Free Press; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/weather/2024/04/07/solar-eclipse-2024-weather-for-viewing/72869059007/", "title": "Solar eclipse 2024: Where will the weather be best for viewing?", "text": "Monday is the day serious eclipse fans have been waiting years for.\n\nMonday afternoon, weather permitting, a total eclipse of the sun will grace the skies above the U.S., all the way from southern Texas to northern Maine.\n\nIt will be the last total solar eclipse visible from the lower 48 states until 2044.\n\nTens of millions of people in the United States are expected to see the eclipse, and even those who find themselves outside its direct path are likely to witness the stunning celestial event in some form.\n\nHere's the latest weather forecast:\n\nWhere will the solar eclipse be visible? A 'nearly perfect day' for some\n\nFederal forecasters said the best chances for clear skies within the path of totality will be in northern New England, despite some chilly temperatures: \"New England will likely wake up to clearing skies with cold temperatures into the 20s Monday morning under a fresh snow cover from the recent nor'easter,\" National Weather Service forecaster Kwan-Yin Kong said Sunday.\n\nThe weather service forecast office in Caribou, Maine, confirmed that Sunday. \"Despite being in a relatively active stormy period, somehow we scored a nearly perfect day Monday to observe the eclipse under sunny to mostly sunny skies during the mid-afternoon hours,\" the service said in a forecast discussion.\n\nIn Burlington, Vermont, weather service forecasters also were optimistic, despite the chance of some high clouds streaming in during the afternoon: \"Cloud cover should not be thick enough to obscure the event,\" forecasters said.\n\nGet ready:The total solar eclipse is Monday: Here's everything to know, including time, path, safety\n\nMeteorologists at Weather.com were also enthused about the splendid forecast for the region: \"The portion of the path of totality in northern New England could have some of the best weather in the country for viewing,\" meteorologist Jonathan Erdman said.\n\nThere probably will be breaks in the clouds from northern Arkansas to central Ohio behind a front. But that is the area of \"greatest uncertainty due to potential high clouds,\" the Weather Prediction Center said.\n\nOutside the path of totality, which stretches from Texas to Maine, AccuWeather meteorologist Brandon Buckingham said, \"the best locations for viewing can be the Southwest deserts, much of California, New England and parts of the Southeast.\"\n\nHe said major cities such as Los Angeles, El Paso, New York, Boston and Raleigh, North Carolina, should all have nice views of the eclipse from start to finish.\n\nWhere will it be cloudy?\n\nUnfortunately for folks in the path of totality, adverse viewing conditions are expected from Missouri and Kansas southward into central and east Texas, AccuWeather said, where it is likely to be cloudy with showers and perhaps some thunderstorms.\n\nKong said southern Texas will wake up to considerable clouds Monday morning.\n\nThe Weather Prediction Center said Sunday afternoon that clouds may also impede viewing across Ohio, northwest Pennsylvania and parts of New York. Rain showers are possible during totality in all of those areas.\n\nFor the partial eclipse, AccuWeather long-range expert Joe Lundberg added that \"other areas with poor viewing conditions will be from Wisconsin westward through South Dakota and Nebraska to Washington and Oregon.\"\n\nSevere storms, tornadoes possible in South\n\nSevere thunderstorms were expected to rattle portions of the southern U.S. on Monday and Tuesday.\n\n\"Multiple rounds of severe thunderstorms should develop from early afternoon Monday through Tuesday morning across a large portion of Texas, into south Oklahoma, southwest Arkansas, and west Louisiana,\" the Storm Prediction Center said Sunday. \"A few tornadoes, scattered large to very large hail, and isolated severe wind gusts will be possible.\"\n\nBig Texas cities such as Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin are all at risk of severe storms Monday, the center said.\n\nHeavy rainfall could lead to flash flooding across the region, the Weather Prediction Center warned.\n\nWhat time is the solar eclipse?\n\nThe eclipse will begin in Texas at 1:27 p.m. CDT and end in Maine at 3:35 p.m. EDT, but the exact time of the eclipse varies by where you are in its path. You can search by ZIP code to find the exact time for your location.\n\nCan you drive during a solar eclipse?\n\nIt's safe to drive during an eclipse as long as you don't look up at the sky. AAA is telling drivers to be focused on the road during the total solar eclipse.\n\nThe automobile insurance company is advising Americans who want to safely view the eclipse to find a safe place to park and wear your eclipse glasses.\n\nAuthorities also are reminding people to not drive while wearing solar eclipse glasses. Eclipse glasses are designed specifically for an eclipse, and you would not be able to see the road well enough while wearing them.\n\nCanada will get to see the show, too\n\nThe eclipse also will grace the skies above five eastern provinces of Canada. It's the first of its kind since 1979 in Canada, and it is creating a carnival atmosphere there. Many people have been making travel plans for months.\n\nIn the Niagara Falls area, the local government has declared a state of emergency. More than 1 million people, a record, are expected to converge along the majestic falls and the popular tourist destination.\n\nYour dogs and cats will be fine\n\nDon't worry, your dog or cat probably will be oblivious to the eclipse, according to Pasco, a science education company.\n\n\"It is unlikely that dogs and cats will react to solar eclipses, as they typically do not have a strong biological or behavioral response to changes in light or natural phenomena like eclipses,\" Pasco reports.\n\nJust in case, Pasco recommends you keep your pets inside during the eclipse and distract them with toys or treats.\n\nHow to photograph a solar eclipse with your cellphone\n\nYou'll need to have the right solar filter in front of your cellphone camera to protect both your device and eyesight, according to Carly Stocks, a Utah-based astronomical photographer who talked to USA TODAY.\n\nThe filter must be made specifically for solar viewing, Stocks said. She also emphasized the need to place a filter that is larger than the lens itself and to keep it on at all times if you're in a location where the eclipse is only partially visible. She recommends purchasing a small 4- by 4-inch sheet of the Thousand Oaks solar filter.\n\nAnd if you're observing the sky in a location where the total eclipse is visible, you'll have a moment when you can take off the solar lens entirely and capture unfiltered images.\n\n\"During totality, you can remove all filters,\" Stocks told USA TODAY. \"If you're looking with the solar glasses and you don't see anything, then it's safe to look at it during that time.\"\n\nWhen is the next total solar eclipse visible from the U.S.?\n\nIt will be 20 years before there's a chance to witness a total solar eclipse in the United States again.\n\nAccording to NASA, after the total solar eclipse on April 8, the next total solar eclipse that can be seen from the contiguous U.S. will be on Aug. 23, 2044.\n\nNASA will launch 3 rockets into space during the eclipse\n\nNASA is preparing to launch three giant rockets into our atmosphere on the day of the eclipse. The agency is hoping to gather some valuable scientific data about how solar eclipses alter Earth’s upper atmosphere.\n\nNASA is using spacecraft called sounding rockets that are equipped with scientific instruments to take measurements and perform experiments during its sub-orbital flight.\n\nThe three rockets will launch from NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia and will reach an intended altitude of 260 miles, NASA said. That's high enough to study disturbances during a total solar eclipse in the ionosphere, a region of Earth’s atmosphere between 55 to 310 miles above the ground.\n\nScientists hope to collect data on how the sun's sudden disappearance during the eclipse creates disturbances that could interfere with communications here on Earth.\n\n“Understanding the ionosphere and developing models to help us predict disturbances is crucial to making sure our increasingly communication-dependent world operates smoothly,\" said mission leader Aroh Barjatya, an engineering physicist at Florida's Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.\n\nContributing: Reuters; Dan D’Ambrosio, the Burlington Free Press; Eric Lagatta, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/07"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/environment/960113/the-worlds-most-extreme-weather-events-in-2023", "title": "The world's most extreme weather events in 2023 | The Week UK", "text": "Wildfires, floods and heatwaves have continued to make headlines as communities across the world have had their homes and lives threatened by deadly weather conditions.\n\nThis year already \"seems destined to be remembered as the year that extreme weather events left the Northern Hemisphere reeling\", said National Geographic.

Action on climate change is no longer “a luxury but a must”, said Professor Petteri Taalas, secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nHere are some of the extreme weather events the world has experienced in 2023.\n\nFreezing in Afghanistan\n\nBoys in Afghanistan shovel snow after wave of freezing temperatures (Image credit: Atif Aryan/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nIn January, Afghanistan saw temperatures plunge to -28C, well below average for the time of year and resulting in the deaths of 78 people and 77,000 livestock, according to CNN.\n\nThe sudden drop in temperature was attributed to polar vortex disruptions, said Al Jazeera, and \"compounded the misery of Afghans\", who are already \"suffering from an unprecedented humanitarian crisis\".\n\nFloods in California\n\nCalifornia has seen major flooding in the last few months (Image credit: Robert Gauthier/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)\n\nThe US had its third wettest January on record this year, according to a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration report.\n\nCalifornia was \"battered by an onslaught of 31 atmospheric river storms in a matter of months\", said the Los Angeles Times. The storms \"dumped record-setting snow across the Sierra Nevada and Southern California mountain ranges, breached levees and flooded communities\".\n\nWarm winter in Europe\n\nSki resorts across Europe had to close due to a lack of snow (Image credit: Lukas Kabon/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n\nEurope experienced its second warmest winter to date this year, according to data gathered by Copernicus Climate Change Service. A strong winter heat dome \"pounced\" on the continent, said The Washington Post, causing many ski resorts to temporarily close due to low snowfall.\n\nThe \"unusually mild\" temperatures \"offered some short-term relief to governments struggling with high gas prices\", said the Evening Standard, but \"posed risks to wildlife and agriculture\".\n\nCyclone Freddy\n\nCyclone Freddy has killed hundreds of people (Image credit: Amos Gumulira/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nCyclone Freddy made landfall in southern Africa in February \"before circling back in March\", said Reuters. It \"left a trail of destruction in its wake after ripping through Malawi, Mozambique and Madagascar\".\n\nMore than half a million people were displaced and more than two million affected by the storm, Malawi’s President Lazarus Chakwera said in April. The death toll, he said, had surpassed 1,000 by then.\n\nThe cyclone may prove to be \"the most energetic and long-lasting storm ever recorded\", said Space.com.\n\nFloods and landslides in Brazil\n\nParts of São Paul saw more than 680 millimeters of rainfall in one day (Image credit: Michael Dantas / AFP via Getty Images)\n\nAt least 65 people were killed by landslides in São Paulo in southeastern Brazil in February that were triggered by torrential rainfall.\n\n\"Parts of the state saw more than 680 millimeters (26 inches) in a single day,\" according to Nasa. The heavy rainfall saturated hillsides, \"destabilising the soils and underlying bedrock\", said Nasa landslide expert Robert Emberson.\n\nThe following month a further mudslide killed eight people in Manaus, after a downpour \"drenched the region\", said La Prensa Latina.\n\nMonsoon in Malaysia\n\nA family wades through the flooded streets of Yong Peng, Malaysia (Image credit: Mohd Rasfan /AFP via Getty Images)\n\nMore than 40,000 residents were forced to flee their homes in southern Malaysia in March due to extreme flooding that claimed four lives.\n\nMonsoon season usually falls between November and March in the region, but this year's rains lingered and flooding continued, said Hawaii Public Radio. Experts blamed deforestation, over-development and climate change for the unprecedented amount of rainfall.\n\nCyclone Mocha in Myanmar\n\nCyclone Mocha made landfall in May (Image credit: Sai Aung Main / AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe United Nations appealed for aid to help 1.6 million people in Myanmar after Cyclone Mocha made landfall on 14 May. \"Hundreds of makeshift shelters\" were torn apart and 90% of the western Rakhine state’s capital city Sittwe was \"destroyed\", said the BBC.\n\nCoastal winds of up to 150mph wrought destruction, causing flooding and landslides in \"an area that is home to hundreds of thousands already displaced by the protracted conflict in Myanmar, many of them the Rohingya minority of Rakhine state\", said UN News.\n\nWildfires in Canada\n\nMore than 10 million acres had been scorched in Canada's worst wildfire season ever (Image credit: James MacDonald / Bloomberg via Getty Images)\n\nCanada has suffered its \"worst wildfire season in recorded history\" this year, said The Guardian. More than 5,000 blazes have scorched through 32 million acres of land since the start of the year, \"almost seven times the average for the same period over previous years\".\n\nThe conditions have been \"taxing on wildfire crews\", said The Washington Post. Six firefighters died while tackling blazes in British Columbia this summer.\n\nSouth Korea floods\n\nMore than 40 lives were claimed by torrential rain and floods in South Korea in July (Image credit: South Korea National Fire Agency via Getty Images)\n\n\"Weeks of on-and-off torrential rain\" killed at least 41 people in South Korea in July, VOA reported. \"This year's monsoon is unlike any seen before\" and the season is becoming \"increasingly unpredictable\".\n\nThe extreme weather \"left thousands picking up the pieces from storm damage\" as President Yoon Suk-yeol told officials to \"spare no effort\" in relief and rebuilding work.\n\nHeatwave in the US\n\nPhoenix experienced 31 consecutive days of extreme heat this summer (Image credit: Mario Tama, Getty Images)\n\nAs \"historic heat\" levels hit Texas, New Mexico and Arizona in June and July, Phoenix, the capital of Arizona, \"sweltered more intensely than most\", said The Guardian, as temperatures in the city topped 43C for 31 consecutive days.\n\nHospitals saw \"a rise in first-, second-, and third-degree contact burns, some fatal, amid extreme heat conditions\". Arizona's most highly populated county, Maricopa, reported 25 deaths in relation to heat this year to 21 July, \"and hundreds more are under investigation\".\n\nEurope's heatwave\n\nA six-month state of emergency has been declared in Rhodes (Image credit: Spyros Bakalis / AFP via Getty Images)\n\nScorching temperatures have impacted countries across Europe this summer too, with many experiencing wildfires.\n\nThousands of holidaymakers and residents were evacuated from the Greek island of Rhodes in July, which is now in a six-month state of emergency, after blazes \"threatened resorts\", said The Times. Greece has battled its \"most intense wildfires in two decades of modern satellite records\".\n\nFires have also burned across Italy, Spain, Portugal, Turkey, Croatia and France. As the UK's weather took \"a turn for the worse\" in August, tourists were \"flocking to Britain to enjoy the cooler, wetter climate\", said Sky News.\n\nFloods in China\n\nTyphoon Doksuri has caused extreme flooding in the Hai River basin in China (Image credit: Kevin Frayer / Getty Images)\n\nTyphoon Doksuri caused \"exceptional rainfall\" in the Hai River basin in northern China, which covers Beijing, Hebei Province and Tianjin port, CNA reported. The region experienced \"the worst floods since 1963 despite massive mitigation efforts\" in August.\n\n\"China's Soviet-era urban drainage systems… leave cities vulnerable to waterlogging during heavy rain,” said CNA. Zhuozhou in Hebei was “unprepared\", with many residents saying \"they were not informed about the severity or the situation or told to evacuate\" before the rains began. Authorities say 33 people have died and tens of thousands have been displaced.\n\nFires in Hawaii\n\nAt least 97 people are known to have died as blazes burnt across Maui in August (Image credit: Patrick T. Fallon / AFP via Getty Images)\n\nA \"devastating inferno\" charged across Maui on 8 August, said The Associated Press. A \"wall of flame\" destroyed buildings and homes and killed at least 97 people. Officials have warned it will take years for the island to recover.\n\nThe Hawaiian Electric Co has acknowledged that fallen power lines started the fire. Officials are now investigating whether the utility company had been negligent in its activities, including in keeping its infrastructure clear of flammable, overgrown foliage.\n\nA lack of planning and years of underfunding were reported to have left the island at risk of a fire threat.\n\nCyclone in Brazil\n\nHomes were destroyed by heavy rainfall and flooding across the state of Rio Grande do Sul in September (Image credit: Mateus Bruxel / Agencia RBS / AFP via Getty Images)\n\nIn what Rio Grande do Sul's governor Eduardo Leite described as the state's worst weather disaster on record, an extratropical cyclone killed at least 27 people in southern Brazil in September.\n\nOfficials said that almost 30cm of rain fell on the state in less than 24 hours, causing flooding and subsequent landslides.

At the same time, flood recovery efforts continued in Australia and Pakistan, while catastrophic rainfall hit the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nTake a look back at the deadliest and most extreme weather events of 2022.\n\n1. Storms, southern Africa\n\nStorm Ana hit Malawi, Madagascar and Mozambique in January (Image credit: Rijasolo/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nIn January, Storm Ana “wrought devastation across southern Africa”, said Climate Home News. More than 80 people were killed and thousands of people were “cut off” as roads and bridges were “washed away in Madagascar, Mozambique and Malawi”, said the BBC.\n\nAna “highlighted the need for investment in early warning systems and anticipatory action” in African nations, said Climate Home News.\n\n2. Cyclone, Africa\n\nCyclone Batsirai displaced more than 60,000 people (Image credit: Rijasolo/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nWithin weeks of Storm Ana, Cyclone Batsirai then “barrelled towards” Madagascar, said Reuters. The tropical storm also hit Mauritius, bringing life “to a standstill, with public transport cancelled, shops and banks shut, and air and sea travel halted”, said Africa News.\n\nIn Madagascar, the death toll reached 120 and 124,000 people had their homes damaged or destroyed. The island had already been “struggling with food shortages in the south”, said Al Jazeera, “a consequence of a severe and prolonged drought”.\n\n3. Floods, Pakistan\n\nA third of Pakistan was under water in September (Image credit: Shahid Saeed Mirza/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nIt was estimated that more than 33 million people were impacted by the deadly floods that swept across Pakistan from June to September this year. “Logistically the country was hardly prepared”, said The Diplomat. When the government announced a “national emergency” in August, “it was already too late”.\n\nA UN report published in December warned that 240,000 people remain displaced as a result of the flooding, while an estimated eight million are still potentially exposed to the floodwaters.\n\nThousands of kilometres of road were washed away. By September, a third of the country was underwater, with water-borne diseases “now making the situation even worse”, the site continued. It remains “hard to predict if Pakistan will be able to rebuild its lost infrastructure in this decade”.\n\n4. Lightning strikes, India\n\nLightning strikes Kolkata in May (Image credit: Indranil Aditya/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nIndia experienced “a big jump in extreme weather events” this year, said the World Economic Forum (WEF). Almost 50 people in Uttar Pradesh were killed by lightning strikes during the monsoon season. The state’s chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, called for an early warning system for thunder and lightning storms as a result.\n\nA significant number of people die each year in India due to lightning, said The Independent, “A large number of people work outdoors” and there is “poor awareness and education about the dangers” of strikes. According to government figures, lightning increased by 111 times this year and 907 people were killed by strikes in 2022.\n\n5. Heatwave, UK\n\nTemperatures in England hit new highs in 2022 (Image credit: Carlos Jasso/AFP via Getty Images)\n\n“For three months, heat was a regular curse, not an occasional blessing” in the UK, said the Financial Times. A record-breaking temperature of 40.3 degrees was recorded on 28 July, and a series of fires broke out across the country.\n\nA drought was officially declared in parts of England in August, with a hosepipe ban imposed in some areas as reservoir levels sunk. Analysis by the UK Health Security Agency published in October, found that 2,800 more people aged 65 and over died during the periods of high temperatures than would normally be expected.\n\n6. Wildfires, Europe\n\nThe Bordeaux region suffered devastating wildfires (Image credit: Thibaud Moritz/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nBy mid-August this year, wildfires had burned an area equivalent to the size of Azerbaijan, according to Euronews. Portugal, Italy and Romania were among the countries affected by blazes, and “wildfire carbon emissions broke all records in France and Spain”, said The Guardian.\n\n“Fire weather” – a mix of heat, dry conditions and wind – “is not new to the Mediterranean”, said Euractiv. But rising global temperatures are “creating more intense, less controllable fires, and driving these conditions” further across the continent.\n\n7. Heatwave, US\n\nCalifornia hit a record 116F in September (Image credit: Allen J. Schaben/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)\n\nCalifornia experienced its most extreme heat ever in September, “an epic grilling that disabled one of Twitter’s main data centers, pushed the power grid to its limit and triggered a succession of weather and safety alerts”, said the Los Angeles Times.\n\nTemperatures “sizzled” across the state as mercury readings soared above 100F, said CNN. “Such extreme heat events are being pushed into unprecedented territory”, scientists warned.\n\n8. Typhoon, Japan\n\nTyphoon Nanmadol hit southern Japan in September (Image credit: Yuichi Yamazaki/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nTyphoon Nanmadol was “one of the most powerful” storms that Japan had ever seen, said The Japan Times. Local authorities ordered the four million people living on Kyushu island to evacuate their homes in September.\n\nDespite “dumping heavy rain, paralysing traffic and leaving tens of thousands of homes without power”, said The Guardian, the Japan Meteorological Agency said that damage “appeared relatively limited”.\n\n9. Hurricane, US\n\nHurricane Ian caused havoc across Florida and the Carolinas (Image credit: Sean Rayford/Getty Images)\n\n“One of the strongest storms ever to hit the US mainland”, according to Reuters, made landfall on 28 September.\n\n“After pummeling Cuba”, said The Washington Post, Hurricane Ian “came ashore on the western coast of Florida with an unforgiving storm surge that gutted the first floors of buildings and winds that knocked out about a quarter of Florida’s power”. It then moved up the Atlantic coast, hitting North and South Carolina.\n\nMore than 100 people died in Florida as a result of the storm’s devastation, said The New York Times, more “than any hurricane in almost 90 years”.\n\n10. Typhoon, Philippines\n\nVillagers are rescued in Bulacan, Philippines (Image credit: Dante Diosina Jr/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n\nPhilippine residents are “accustomed to severe weather”, said CNN; the country experiences around 20 tropical storms a year. But locals living on the island of Polillo were “stunned by the intensity of Typhoon Noru” in September, with “ferocious winds that lifted waves and lashed properties on the shoreline”.\n\nNoru was initially expected to be a category one hurricane, but that was quickly escalated to a category five. It’s estimated that more than 100,000 people who rely on agriculture and fishing for their livelihoods were affected.\n\n11. Flooding, Australia\n\nSandbags are delivered in Forbes, NSW, in November (Image credit: Brendon Thorne/Getty Images)\n\nAustralia has been hit by a series of extreme floods this year “due to a multi-year La Nina weather phenomenon”, said Reuters, which increases the likelihood of higher average rainfall. Floods have “left thousands homeless and damaged agricultural industries”.\n\nCentral west New South Wales is right now braced for “its worst flooding in 70 years”, said The Guardian. Many people have been evacuated from their homes, as farmers “struggle to recover from repeated bouts of destruction to crops and livestock losses”.\n\n12. Snowstorm, US\n\nSeveral feet of snow fell on western New York in November (Image credit: John Normile/Getty Images)\n\nA “historic lake-effect snowstorm” that swept across western New York in November “buried” much of the region, “dropping over 80 inches of snow in four days”, said Fox Weather. At least four people were known to have died as a result of the intense snowfall.\n\nSchools and highways were shut as crews cleared away several feet of snow, and President Joe Biden ordered federal aid to help local authorities.\n\n13. Flooding, Democratic Republic of Congo\n\n‘Months’ of rain fell on the capital city of Kinshasa in December (Image credit: Augustin Wamenya/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n\nIn mid-December, “a ‘biblical’ downpour submerged swathes” of Kinshasa, central Africa’s “largest megacity”, said The Times. “Months of rain” caused landslides and floods in the Democratic Republic of Congo capital, with at least 120 people known to have died.\n\nPictures from the area showed “just the tops of buses visible on deluged roads” as people clung to passing debris. With a population of 17 million, Kinshasa’s “rapid development and poor planning regulation have made the city’s population vulnerable to extreme weather events”.", "authors": ["Julia O'Driscoll", "The Week Uk", "Last Updated", "The Week Staff", "Devika Rao", "The Week Us", "Justin Klawans", "Peter Weber", "Joel Mathis", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/11/08"}]}

When USA TODAY asked about it on Thursday and Friday, a spokesperson did not address the issue.\n\nHowever, an AT&T customer in South Dakota told USA TODAY she contacted AT&T and got a $52.50 credit on her account on Thursday. \"Never hurts to ask,\" she posted on X.\n\nShe told USA TODAY she logged onto her account online and clicked \"Contact Us,\" and a representative gave her the credit. She said she wondered whether those who didn't do this quickly will get as much of a rebate.\n\nAT&T outage: How much could a credit or rebate be?\n\nIf AT&T offered a credit simply based on how long customers were unable to use the communications network, it could amount to one day's worth of access. That 3% credit for the month could amount to about $1.50 to $2.60, assuming a monthly bill is about $51 to $86.\n\nBecause of the importance wireless networks are to consumers that may not seem enough compensation for the outage, Jonathan Schwantes, senior policy counsel at Consumer Reports, told USA TODAY on Thursday.\n\nBut AT&T will probably do \"some kind of nominal credit. If you'll pro-rate it out, eight to 10 hours on a day out of a 31-day billing cycle doesn't amount to a whole lot, but I think it would do good by consumers,\" he said.\n\nIn September 2023, Charter Communications gave its Spectrum pay TV subscribers a $15 credit when a programming dispute took Disney and ESPN channels off the service. Initially, subscribers had to call in, but eventually the company gave it to all subscribers, Schwantes said.\n\nAT&T, which has more than 70 million wireless subscribers in the U.S., is likely weighing what it should do. If the company gives even a $4 or $5 credit, \"that's a real loss for AT&T,\" he said.\n\nHowever, taking no action raises the possibility customers could defect to Verizon or T-Mobile. \"Are they going to leave and never come back?\" Schwantes said. That's why he expects the company will eventually offer a credit.\n\nSo does Dave Heger, a senior analyst at Edward Jones, who told USA TODAY on Thursday, \"We expect that AT&T will offer some type of refund to restore customer goodwill.\"\n\n\"We think that this type of outage can negatively impact financial results in the quarter in which it occurs and cause short-term lost goodwill with customers,\" Heger said. \"However, it does not have a longer-term impact on the business.\"\n\nFollow Mike Snider on X and Threads: @mikesnider & mikegsnider.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

The food makers notified the U.S. Department of Agriculture about products they shipped that could include ingredients such as corn, diced onions and other vegetables possibly tainted with bacteria – all provided from a single company, McCain Foods, the USDA says.\n\nThe initial recalls, announced by the USDA on Oct. 17, involved relatively small quantities, ranging from 217 pounds to 940 pounds of salads. Among those products recalled last week were Whole Foods' santa fe style salad with chicken, sold at stores in California; Trader Joe's labeled BBQ flavored chicken salad, sold in several states; and Walmart's marketside fiesta salad with steak, sold in some of its stores.\n\nBut some of the latest recalls involve far larger quantities of ingredients including 795,261 pounds of ready-to-eat meat and poultry products such as Harris Teeter Deli-Bakery brand bacon, egg and cheese burritos, and chicken sausage, egg white and cheese breakfast burritos.\n\nBakkavor Foods, which makes products for Harris Teeter and Trader Joe's, has production facilities in Carson, California; Charlotte, North Carolina; and Jessup, Pennsylvania. The products recalled could contain an onion ingredient supplied by McCain Foods that may be contaminated with salmonella and listeria monocytogenes, according to the USDA.\n\n\"These recalls demonstrate just how complex and interconnected our food system is today. When you buy something from the store, it’s possible the company that produced it was three companies ago,\" said Will Wallace, senior food policy analyst for Consumers Union. \"This is a big deal. It could impact tens of thousands of people, if not more.\"\n\nDistributed nationwide and produced between Sept. 27, 2017, and Oct. 15, 2018, most of Bakkavor's products for Harris Teeter have use by dates of Oct. 24 and Oct. 25, according to the USDA. A 16-ounce Harris Teeter Deli-Bakery brand BBQ style chicken artisan pizza has use by dates from Jan. 7, 2019, to April 11, 2019.\n\nBakkavor also recalled Trader Joe's carnitas with salsa verde burritos over the same concerns. Those products had use by dates through Oct. 24.\n\nAs of now, there have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of any of the recalled products, according to McCain Foods and the USDA.\n\n\"McCain Foods recently identified a potential health risk related to its fire roasted, caramelized or sautéed frozen vegetable and fruit products produced at its Colton (California) facility,\" McCain Foods said in a statement to USA TODAY on Friday when contacted about an initial five voluntary recalls involving potentially tainted corn and a sixth for possibly tainted caramelized mushrooms and fire-roasted tomatoes used in products sold at Hy-Vee. The company, which has offices in Illinois and is headquartered in Canada, said \"as a result, we have made the decision to voluntarily recall all products produced at this facility.\"\n\nOther products involved in the nationwide recall:\n\nSimple Truth and Cadence Gourmet entrees\n\nEnvolve Foods of Corona, California, told the USDA it was recalling about 292,764 pounds of ready-to-eat chicken and beef products including 22-ounce bags of Simple Truth Chicken Bibimbap, Thai Style Green Curry and Chicken Tikka Masala. Some of the products had use by/sell by dates through April 12, 2019. The Cadence Gourmet-branded Steak Fajitas, Tuscan Tomato Basil Chicken & Sausage and Rustic Toasted Tomato Basil Chicken & Vegetables also had expiration dates into 2019.\n\nThe products were sold in more than two dozen states at stores including Fred Meyer, Kroger and Ralphs. For complete lists, check the USDA's current recalls site at www.fsis.usda.gov.\n\nGo-Go Taquitos\n\nThe snacks sold nationwide at 7-Eleven stores were recalled after Ruiz Food Products of Denison, Texas, recalled about 2.5 million pounds of ready-to-eat meat and poultry taquitos for possible risk of salmonella and listeria, the USDA says. The recall involved Beef & Taco Cheese Taquitos, Buffalo Style Cooked Glazed Chicken Taquitos and Chipotle Chicken taquitos. All of the products, made between July 1 and Oct. 10, have been taken off the market, Ruiz Food says. The company learned about the problem Oct. 16 when it was notified diced onions used in the making of their beef and cheese taquitos was being recalled by their supplier due to bacteria risks.\n\n7-Eleven had already recalled two different sizes (9.6-ounce and 11.2-ounce) of its 7-Eleven Bistro Southwest Style Salad With Bacon, produced on Oct. 13 by Prime Deli Corp., of Lewisville, Texas, also made with potentially tainted corn from McCain Foods. The salads, with a best by date of Oct. 16, were shipped to stores in Texas. The retailer learned about the problem Oct. 14, the USDA said.\n\nJenny Craig chicken wraps\n\nSK Food Group, with locations in Groveport, Ohio, and Reno, Nevada, recalled about 174,207 pounds of Jenny Craig Chicken Wrap with BBQ Sauce, produced from Oct. 15, 2017, to Oct. 15, 2018, because they contained vegetables that might be contaminated with bacteria. The frozen, fully-cooked wraps were shipped directly to consumers through catalog sales in California, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Texas.\n\nFresh Garden salads\n\nCaito Foods of Indianapolis recalled about 1,532 pounds of ready-to-eat chicken salads and food bowls made with corn that could be contaminated. Recalls included 11.5-ounce and 8.75-ounce packages of Fresh Garden Highway Santa Fe Style with Chicken salads with best if sold by dates of Oct. 21. Among retailers that its various salads were shipped to included Walgreens in Illinois and Target stores in Illinois and Minnesota.\n\nBuddy’s Kitchen products\n\nBuddy's Kitchen of Burnsville, Minnesota, told the USDA it recalled about 212,746 pounds of ready-to-eat pork and chicken products because they could contain vegetables at risk for salmonella and listeria contamination. The company said it contacted institutions that had been shipped bulk cases of foods such as omelets with potatoes and sausage, produced between Oct. 19, 2017, and Oct. 9, 2018. Its customers included locations in Arizona, California, Georgia, Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri and New Jersey.\n\nAn estimated 1,600 people get listeriosis each year in the U.S., and about 260 die from it, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Salmonella causes about 1.2 million illnesses, 23,000 hospitalizations and 450 deaths in the U.S. each year, the CDC estimates. Most people infected develop diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps within 12 to 72 hours.\n\nAnyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a health care provider.\n\nOverall, the recall involved more than two dozen retail chains and 13 food companies supplied by McCain Foods.\n\n\"This goes all over the country,\" Consumers Union's Wallace said. \"Salmonella and listeria can really cause a lot of harm to people, especially to the elderly, the very young and those who are sick.\"\n\nConsumers should visit the recall sections of the Food & Drug Administration website and the USDA website and check the complete list of products recalled, he said. \"And then, check your kitchen to make sure if you have any of these foods you throw them out and not eat them.\"\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/10/22"}]}

Are the Boston Celtics going to carry over their regular-season momentum and become the dominant team in the playoffs?\n\nIt's difficult to predict the outcome, but here are the most recent predictions from various sources on the internet.\n\n2024 NBA playoffs:Printable bracket with postseason schedule and seeding\n\nEastern Conference predictions\n\nCBS Sports: Boston Celtics\n\nEvery member of the CBS Sports staff believes the Eastern Conference is the Boston Celtics' to lose. Jack Maloney writes: \"Brad Stevens' offseason maneuverings have given the Celtics all the tools to finally break through and win a title with the Jayson Tatum-Jaylen Brown core. Are there still concerns about their late-game offense? Of course. But they have been the best team in the league all season long because they have five legitimate options on offense, shoot 3-pointers at an elite rate and can dial it up defensively to a level most cannot reach.\"\n\nBleacher Report: Boston Celtics\n\nTyler Conway writes: \"The Celtics are the NBA's best team on paper and in practice. They dominated the regular season to the point there is almost no historical data equivalent. The last team to win their conference by at least 10 games was the 2016-17 Golden State Warriors, perhaps the greatest team in NBA history.\"\n\nThe Guardian: Celtics\n\nStaff writes: \"This could come back to haunt me, but it also just seems like their year. They won 64 regular season games while the next best total was 57. While I would pick Denver in a vacuum, they have seemed a half-step slow, and they’ve played a ton of games over the past year. Boston are younger, fresher and maybe hungrier. If Tatum can avoid wilting late in games and if Jaylen Brown can take care of the ball, they should win. But Boston need to take it, which is something they’ve avoided doing since the Garnett era. Boston over Denver in seven.\"\n\nWestern Conference predictions\n\nCBS Sports: Denver Nuggets\n\nBrad Botkin writes: \"Denver spending the majority of the season on autopilot doesn't change the fact that it is the best team and Nikola Jokic is the best player.\"\n\nBleacher Report: Denver Nuggets\n\nTyler Conway writes: \"This season has increasingly felt like a collision course between Boston and Denver, and there's no reason to back down now. Nikola Jokic is the NBA's best player and one of the greatest offensive forces the game has ever seen.\"\n\nNBA Finals predictions\n\nThe Guardian: Denver Nuggets\n\nStaff writes: \"The biggest challenges the Nuggets face will take place long before they reach the finals, if they manage to get there. The West is an absolute gauntlet this season, far more difficult than the one they traversed last year. Denver will have to slay a healthy LeBron James and Anthony Davis, followed by either a tough, huge Timberwolves squad or Durant and Booker with a better supporting cast than last year, and potentially Doncic and Irving and a red hot Mavericks. Yes, the Celtics had a sensational regular season and will theoretically be better rested due to a far easier path to the finals than Denver, but beating the best of the best gives me more confidence in a team, and the Celtics simply won’t have to. I have the Nuggets in Game 7.\"\n\nPickswise: LA Clippers\n\nGermantas Kneita writes: \"The Clippers should have a real shot this year and definitely deserve love as an NBA Championship pick. They have elite wings, an elite playmaker in James Harden, firepower off the bench in Norman Powell and big bodies in Ivica Zubac and Mason Plumlee. On paper, they match up well with everyone, from the Suns to the Celtics. While the Celtics are outright favorites, they could potentially have to cross paths with elite bigs in Giannis Antetokounmpo and Joel Embiid. Those are battles I doubt that Kristaps Porzingis and Al Horford could be down for, especially with their respective injury troubles and age.\"\n\nCBS Sports: Celtics over Nuggets\n\nJames Herbert writes, \"If these two teams were playing this week, I might pick the Nuggets, even though Boston's statistical profile is more impressive. Their path to the Finals will likely be more taxing, though, and they have less room for error - if any of Denver's starters has to miss any amount of time, I'll be extremely concerned.\"\n\nBleacher Report: Celtics over Nuggets in six\n\nTyler Conway writes, \"The Celtics have a cohesive, star-laden roster of their own and lost just four home games all season.

They're without Malik Monk (knee) and Kevin Huerter (shoulder), who are averaging a combined 25.6 points per game.\n\nSacramento would still put up a fight. Domantas Sabonis is a handful to contain down low, especially on the glass. And even though OKC has good perimeter defenders such as Lu Dort and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, De'Aaron Fox is one of the tougher players in the league to stay in front of.\n\nBut Sacramento is already experiencing a down year offensively. And without Monk and Huerter, two key floor spacers, it won't have enough firepower to keep up with OKC.\n\nWorst-case scenario: OKC shouldn't want to face the Los Angeles Lakers, who've won 12 of their last 15 games. They have experience, an elite rim protector in Anthony Davis and, of course, LeBron James.\n\nMore:OKC Thunder is back in NBA Playoffs, but which play-in team would be scariest foe?\n\nConference semifinals: Los Angeles Clippers\n\nOn paper, Los Angeles is one of the most dangerous teams in the league.\n\nThe Clippers have a Big Three of Kawhi Leonard, Paul George and James Harden. They have high-level bench players such as Russell Westbrook and Norman Powell. They have a head coach in Tyronn Lue who's great at making mid-series adjustments.\n\nBut Los Angeles is entering the postseason with health concerns. Leonard (knee) has missed the Clippers' last eight games, while Harden (foot) has missed three of their last four games.\n\nThe Clippers can be dangerous if they stay healthy. But if the other option is facing a red-hot Dallas team, OKC should be content with taking its chances against Los Angeles.\n\nWorst-case scenario: Nobody wants to face Dallas, which has won 12 of its last 15 games. The Mavericks have an elite scoring duo in Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving, and their defense has improved since they added Daniel Gafford and PJ Washington at the trade deadline.\n\nMore:How to buy OKC Thunder tickets for 2024 NBA Playoffs at Paycom Center\n\nConference finals: Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nAside from the obvious answer, which is a play-in team reaching the conference finals, Minnesota is the best matchup for OKC.\n\nIt would still be a battle. The two teams split their four-game series in the regular season, and three of those games were decided by two possessions or less.\n\nMinnesota has the best defensive rating in the NBA thanks to guys such as Rudy Gobert and Jaden McDaniels. It also has a lethal offensive weapon in Anthony Edwards, who averaged 31.6 points in the playoffs last season.\n\nBut just look at the other options. Denver is the defending champion. And if Phoenix reaches the conference finals, that means everything has clicked for a team that has Kevin Durant and Devin Booker.\n\nGive me Minnesota. It'll be tough, but at least OKC has the speed to control the pace and a pick-and-roll game with Gilgeous-Alexander that'll cause problems for Gobert.\n\nWorst case scenario: The worst-case scenario is the Denver Nuggets.

The disadvantage is rust.\n\n“We’d take the rest,” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said after practice Thursday.\n\nAll things Thunder: Latest Oklahoma City Thunder news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.\n\n“If you’ve got bumps and bruises it gives you time to heal and get everybody’s tank full from a recovery standpoint,” Daigneault said. “Disadvantages would just be a lot of time in between games, an amount of time we’re not used to.\n\n“Even in training camp, you don’t go this long without playing at least one preseason game. It’s a long period of time, but I thought we managed it pretty well in the last stretch.”\n\nThe Thunder showed some rust in Game 1 against the Pelicans, but after rattling off four straight wins, it’s hard to argue that the rest — if a factor at all — was anything but beneficial.\n\nOKC would surely love to see the Clippers-Mavericks series go to a Game 7 Sunday, giving either team only one day off before starting Round 2.\n\nMore:Would OKC Thunder be better off facing Clippers or Mavericks in NBA playoffs?\n\nHow Thunder is preparing for Clippers vs. Mavericks\n\nDaigneault, to no surprise, isn’t watching Clippers-Mavs on live television like the rest of us.\n\n“I haven’t watched a ton of that series yet,” Daigneault said. “I’m getting there, but I’ve focused more on us. We’ll sit down (as a staff) and watch it together, but we’re not coming in here at night and doing that. The commercials are brutal.”\n\nHe must’ve been referring to the Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Chet Holmgren duet for AT&T.\n\n“No comment,” Daigneault said.\n\nThe Thunder’s staff divides the scouting reports, with some focused on the Clippers and some on the Mavericks.\n\n“And then we’ve got some people that work on specials for both teams, so somebody will take zone offense for both teams, zone defense for both teams,” Daigneault said. “We’ve got a large staff so we can cover a lot of ground there. And once the opponent presents itself, the people that were on the other team can jump on board and we’ll start to do some special projects and try to understand them.”\n\nThat information isn’t being relayed to the players until the opponent is known.\n\n“Practice today and tomorrow, very much rhythm, focus on us, focus on our habits that transcend the opponent,” Daigneault said. “Not a lot of specific stuff to Dallas or the Clippers.”\n\nMore:OKC Thunder star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, wife Hailey Summers welcome their first child\n\nAaron Wiggins on playoff experience\n\nAaron Wiggins isn’t a changed man after logging 60 minutes of playoff experience.\n\n“I guess I get to say I have playoff experience, but it doesn’t feel any different,” Wiggins said Thursday.\n\nWiggins played quite well by the way, averaging 5.8 points, 3.3 rebounds and 1.8 assists in his 15 minutes per game. He shot 9 of 16 (56%) from the field.\n\nThe third-year pro looked very much like himself in Round 1, as did most of his teammates despite having little or no playoff experience.\n\nAsked what version of the Thunder showed up: “I think it’s the same version we had all year, all season,” Wiggins said. “A hungry team, a team that doesn’t pay attention to a lot of what’s being said outside of us about our youth or our inexperience, anything like that.\n\n“Just a group of guys who understand that we’ve gotta prove ourselves in the league and nothing’s gonna be handed to us. Guys are hungry and guys wanna win.”\n\nMore:Why OKC Thunder players 'show love' to Bally Sports sideline reporter Nick Gallo\n\nQuotable: Mark Daigneault on Lu Dort’s ‘invisible’ work on defense\n\n“The hardest thing about stats is that there’s a lot of non-measurable things that are highly impactful and relevant that aren’t necessarily counted. I think everybody has a bias toward what they can see, what they can count and what stats are easily comparable on a box score.\n\n“And yet successful players, successful teams do the invisible … Lu does a lot of invisible things. You can’t count them all, you can’t put a stat on all of them, but try playing against him. You can feel it. We can feel it.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2024/04/16/how-does-play-in-tournament-work-nba-standings-playoff-lakers-warriors/73331084007/", "title": "How does the NBA play-in tournament work?

Milwaukee rallied for a fourth-quarter lead but again wilted down the stretch despite 37 points from Antetokounmpo and 24 from Damian Lillard.\n\nDec. 13: Milwaukee 140, Indiana 126: The lone Bucks victory in five tries against Indiana had a memorable postscript. Antetokoumpo set the franchise single-game scoring record with 64 points, but a dispute over the game ball elevated tensions between the two teams, even though it turned out to be somewhat of a misunderstanding.\n\nJan. 1: Indiana 122, Milwaukee 113: In a New Year's Day showcase, the Pacers ended Milwaukee's 15-game home winning streak with a comeback victory after facing two 15-point deficits. Indiana's bench outscored the Bucks, 70-16. Antetokounmpo had a triple double in the loss.\n\nJan. 3: Indiana 142, Milwaukee 130: The Bucks found themselves in the midst of a losing rut with the defeat at Gainbridge Fieldhouse two days after facing off at Fiserv Forum. Antetokounmpo flirted with a triple double.\n\nThe Indiana Pacers' best player is from Wisconsin, but you knew that already\n\nFrom afar, it's been impressive to watch Oshkosh native Tyrese Haliburton evolve into an NBA superstar, but now he represents a significant obstacle. The guard scored 20.3 points per game this year for Indiana and handed out 10.9 assists per game, leading the league. He turned 24 in February and already has two all-star appearances.\n\nThe Bucks and Pacers have just a teeny bit of history this year\n\nThe infamous battle for the game ball after a game in December certainly enflamed tensions between the two teams after some emotional basketball earlier in the season, though the ball wasn't the centerpiece of the initial dispute.\n\nFor those who need a refresher, Antetokounmpo gave a passionate tongue-lashing to Haliburton after the game, initially upset that the Pacers had declined to shake hands in the aftermath of the Bucks win, a game where Antetokounmpo happened to score a franchise-record 64 points.\n\nAlerted to the possibility that the Pacers also left the floor with the game ball, Giannis ran toward the Pacers locker room seeking the memento.\n\nEven after the situation was defused, Antetokounmpo said he didn't believe he'd been given the correct ball.\n\nIt wasn't just the ball and handshakes, either. Haliburton's use of the \"Dame Time\" celebration in the In-Season Tournament perhaps contributed to the dust-up, and the fact that Antetokounmpo checked into the game late while still pursuing the single-game scoring record seemed to sit poorly with the Pacers. Bobby Portis and Aaron Nesmith both received technical fouls in the game, and Portis was ejected.\n\nMore:Audio and video from after Bucks game suggests Pacers knew the gravity of taking game ball\n\nMore:Whose game ball is it anyway? Social media erupts after Bucks-Pacers postgame tussle\n\nWe know now that the correct game ball was in the hands of a Bucks official, but the confusion afterward led to high tensions in the tunnel after the game.\n\nHalburton technically isn't Indiana's leading scorer, and there's some playoff history there\n\nIn January, the Pacers acquired Raptors star Pascal Siakam from the struggling Toronto franchise in exchange for three players (including former Buck Jordan Nwora) and future draft picks. Siakam has delivered in his 40 games with the Pacers, averaging 21.1 points per game (even better than Haliburton's scoring mark) with 7.8 rebounds and 3.8 assists per contest.\n\nSiakam has shot 38.4% from three-point range with the Pacers, which would represent by far his best season from three-point range if that were extrapolated over the full year.\n\nSiakam scored 19 points per game for the Raptors in the 2019 postseason, a championship performance that included a win over the Bucks in the Eastern Conference finals. Siakam scored 14.5 points per contest in the Bucks series.\n\nThe Pacers are reasonably healthy, except for Bennedict Mathurin\n\nBennedict Mathurin, the 21-year-old rising star, tore his labrum and was ruled out for the rest of the season in March. He averaged 14.5 points and 4.0 rebounds over 59 games this season and was posting even better numbers after the all-star break before the injury.\n\nThis is Indiana's first time in the playoffs in four years\n\nThe Pacers are in a bit of a playoff drought, having missed the postseason each of the last three years. Last year's team went 35-47, so the jump to 47-35 was quite the flip. The Pacers went to the playoffs five years in a row from 2016-2020 … but lost in the first time each year. The last time Indiana won a playoff series was in 2014, when it appeared in the conference finals for the second year in a row.\n\nThe Bucks and Pacers have met twice in the playoffs, in 1999 and 2000. Indiana swept the earlier series, 3-0, and won the next year, 3-2, with a 96-95 outcome in the decisive game. Ervin Johnson didn't miss a free throw in the final seconds when coach George Karl called for one, and Ray Allen's 30-foot three-point attempt at the buzzer was off the mark. Reggie Miller scored 41 points.\n\nT.J. McConnell has a reputation as a Bucks killer\n\nReserve T.J. McConnell has a bit of a reputation for burning the Bucks, and he comes by it somewhat honestly. His career high in scoring came in 2023 against Milwaukee, a 29-point effort in a 132-119 Bucks win. He also posted his third-best scoring effort against the Bucks in 2021, a 142-133 Bucks win.\n\nMcConnell also has 19-point showings against the Bucks, both in 2023, tied for his 10th-highest scoring output. For his career, he averages 8.4 points per game, though it's up to 10.1 this year in 18.2 minutes per game. All told against Milwaukee, his 9.7 points per game are the most against any team, and he shoots a whopping 48.1% from 3-point range (13 for 27) against the Bucks.\n\nThe Pacers are the kings of … pace, which is why they're the highest-scoring team in the league\n\nNobody makes more baskets or shoots a better field goal percentage in the NBA this year than the Pacers, adding up to an NBA-best 122.9 points per game. Nobody hands out more assists, and no team allows fewer three-point shots and attempts on defense.\n\nBut there's a dark side. Indiana also allows 120.3 points per game (28th in the league) and ranks 30th in allowed field-goal percentage.\n\nIt all adds up to a team that plays at one of the fastest paces in the league, behind only Washington in that department. The Pacers aren't going to overwhelm anyone on the glass, but they still take solid care of the basketball, ranking just ahead of the Bucks in turnover percentage, with the two at No. 7 and No. 8 in the NBA. This isn't a team that's letting the shot clock dip, and they're going to quickly take advantage of defensive lapses with ball movement.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaw/2024/04/07/iowa-south-carolina-womens-national-championship-time/73207130007/", "title": "When is women's national championship game?

The views expressed here are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nNo weapon has been more in the public eye in America of late than the AR-15, in large part because of its tragic role in some of this country’s deadliest shootings.\n\nThe AR-15 has the dubious distinction of being America’s most popular semi-automatic rifle. I’m more familiar with the gun than most people: I own one. And one thing I know for sure is that this weapon doesn’t belong in the hands of the average civilian.\n\nOfficer Michael Fanone attends The 15th Annual CNN Heroes: All-Star Tribute at American Museum of Natural History on December 12, 2021, in New York. Mike Coppola/Getty Images\n\nI’ve owned multiple firearms for most of my life. I spent two decades in the Washington Metropolitan Police Department in a number of different roles, as a street cop walking the beat and on various special mission units.\n\nI’m also a card-carrying member of the National Rifle Association. And when I wasn’t at my job doing police work, I worked part-time for several years in firearm sales as well as training law enforcement officers, members of the military and civilians.\n\nI purchased my different guns over the years for the same reason that you might purchase a flathead screwdriver along with a Phillips screwdriver: Each one serves a different purpose. As an avid hunter, I’ve got a gun that I use for turkey hunting, one that I use for waterfowl and one I use to hunt deer and larger game like elk.\n\nI purchased my AR-15 because I was assigned one as part of my police duties. But officers weren’t allowed to take our department-issued weapons home. I felt it was my responsibility to become proficient with any weapon I’d been assigned, so I bought one. And I’ve spent hundreds of hours training so that I could properly use it.\n\nI’ve sold guns at big box retailers and I’ve also sold firearms at a small retail gun store. Some gun buyers have been misled into thinking that the AR-15 is somehow practical for self-defense. But frankly, it’s the last gun that I would recommend for that purpose.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Gunman posted images of guns just days ago on social media 01:15 - Source: CNN\n\nUsually, the motivation for purchasing the AR-15 is simple: People want one because they want one. Most times, the person who buys an AR-15 comes into the store already knowing that they intend to purchase one.\n\nI’ve pressed some customers about why they want an AR-15, but no one could ever come up with a legitimate justification for needing that particular weapon.\n\nSome members of the tinfoil hat brigade have come up with the reply, “We need these weapons because we want to be effective against the government if it becomes tyrannical. That’s part of our Second Amendment right.” Personally, I think that’s ludicrous, but it has become an increasingly popular justification for purchasing a semi-automatic rifle.\n\nThe AR-15 was given to law enforcement because more and more frequently police officers were encountering these types of weapons on the street and finding that they were outgunned. One example that springs to mind is the famous 1997 North Hollywood, California, shootout at the Bank of America.\n\nIn that incident, two individuals clad in body armor held up a bank in the Los Angeles neighborhood. Police who responded at the scene literally had to run to a nearby gun store to purchase more powerful weapons, because they were using 9 mm pistols, while the bad guys were armed with semi-automatic rifles.\n\nThe standoff was one of the most infamous gun battles in American history, with 11 officers wounded – luckily, none fatally – and both robbery suspects shot dead. While it’s an extreme example, it is in many ways the situation encountered by officers all across this country: Police simply are outgunned against semi- and fully automatic firearms.\n\nThe bullet that comes out of the barrel of an AR-15 style semi-automatic rifle can easily penetrate the target – the intruder or whatever person you are using deadly force to defend yourself or others from.\n\nPallbearers carry the casket of Nevaeh Bravo during a funeral service at Sacred Heart Catholic Church on June 2 in Uvalde, Texas. Bravo was killed in the shooting at Robb Elementary School. Eric Gay/AP\n\nBut it also will go through the wall behind that person, and potentially through that room and into the next wall. That power and accuracy are useful for military purposes, which is obviously what they were designed for. But it’s far more power than should ever be in the hands of the average civilian.\n\nThe bullet fired by the AR-15 is capable of defeating the average police officer’s body armor, like a knife slicing through butter. SWAT teams and some of the more specialized units typically are equipped with level IV Kevlar or steel-plated armor, which would stop maybe two or three direct hits, but eventually body armor breaks down after being hit with multiple rounds.\n\nA person wielding an AR-15 has a range beyond 300 yards. For an officer armed with a 9 mm pistol, hitting a target beyond 50 yards is going to be difficult, even for the most accomplished marksman. A bullet fired by an AR-15 travels at three times the velocity as one fired by a 9 mm handgun. And magazines that can feed dozens of rounds into the weapon in the space of minutes clearly were meant for use only on the battlefield.\n\nThe prevalence of these weapons means police sometimes are overmatched, as we saw with the mass shooting in Uvalde, Texas, last month. In a situation where you have small children near the shooter, you want to remove the threat as quickly as possible.\n\nBut we all saw the tragic consequences at that elementary school, where police waited for more than an hour before engaging with the teenage gunman armed with an AR-15 who killed 19 young children and two teachers.\n\nI have no doubt that police in Uvalde wish they had had weapons as powerful as the one carried by the shooter who snuffed out the lives of the victims in that school. But a far better outcome would have been if the shooter didn’t have an AR-15 in the first place.\n\nNow that I’m no longer on the police force, my AR-15 collects dust in my gun safe. Rifle ranges that permit the type of training required to use this weapon system effectively are few and far between and the cost of ammunition exceeding a dollar per round is more than this guy can afford. I no longer need it. But neither, to be honest, do most of the people flocking to guns stores to buy one.\n\nBanning these powerful weapons from the civilian marketplace is a no-brainer, as are universal background checks. Neither move is going to solve all the gun problems that we have, but it would be a start.\n\nAnd outlawing these AR-15s would not require confiscating them from people who already have them. Once you’ve made these weapons illegal, anyone found with one would be subject to arrest, since possession of these weapons would be a crime. I think it’s likely that you would see a lot of people opting to turn them in.\n\nA makeshift memorial surrounds the Robb Elementary School sign following the mass shooting at the Uvalde, Texas, school on May 26. Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n\nIf banning them outright seems like too extreme a solution to be politically palatable, here’s another option: Reclassify semi-automatic rifles as Class 3 firearms.\n\nThat would mean that someone wanting to purchase an AR-15 would have to go through a background check, fingerprinting and review by an official from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives – a process that takes anywhere from 12 to 16 months. And since Class 3 weapons can’t be purchased by anyone younger than 21, it would solve the issue of emotionally unstable 18-year-olds buying them.\n\nA Class 3 firearm reclassification would also make those who are approved to purchase these weapons subject to an annual check that they are complying with federal regulations regarding secure storage of the firearm, and to confirm their licensing and other paperwork is up to date. All of these hoops and hurdles are sure to reduce the civilian demand for these weapons.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s new newsletter.

And students are often in the best position to notice concerning behavior from classmates, O’Toole said.\n\nHere is what experts say students and schools should recognize as disturbing behavior – and what they should do:\n\nNotice sharp changes in behavior\n\nIt can be tough figuring out whether a student might be contemplating harm, or if they’re simply being irritable, angry or withdrawn.\n\nThe key is to look out for drastic changes in behavior, said school safety consultant Melissa Reeves, past president of the National Association of School Psychologists.\n\nThose drastic changes can show up in different ways.\n\nFor some, it’s increased outward behavior. “So we will see an escalation in grievances. An escalation, potentially, in anger. We will see an escalation in difficulty managing their emotions,” Reeves said.\n\nOthers might do the opposite and become more isolated.\n\n“We’re still seeing significant changes, but they may now be starting to withdraw,” Reeves said. “They’re no longer interacting with groups of friends. They’re starting to spend more time on the internet.”\n\nBroad statements of hostility, such as “I hate everybody,” are another red flag, Reeves said.\n\nWatch out for ‘leakage’\n\nSchool shooters often leak hints about their plans before they carry them out, said O’Toole, the former FBI profiler.\n\n“I’ve seen it in nearly every case. And leakage is very specific because it is the shooter talking about what they’re going to do before they do it,” she said.\n\n“They’re typically done because the offender is really excited about what they’re going to do. Some people say it’s a cry for help … if they’re discovered beforehand, then they could be used for that purpose,” O’Toole said.\n\nBut for those bent on violence, “They plan it. They think about it. They fantasize about it. They prepare for it. And all of that period of time in which that is done, that’s very pleasant for them. They enjoy it.”\n\nA few days before the 2021 school shooting in Oxford, Michigan, the 15-year-old suspect posted a photo of a gun on Instagram with the caption: “Just got my new beauty today. SIG SAUER 9mm,” Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald said.\n\nBy itself, that post isn’t necessarily a cause for alarm, Reeves said. In Michigan, residents under age 18 can possess a gun under certain circumstances.\n\n“However, if you pair this with other risk factors and/or warning signs, it could very well be a sign of leakage,” Reeves said.\n\nThe morning of the shooting, a teacher found a drawing by the suspect depicting violence and phrases such as “the thoughts won’t stop help me,” “blood everywhere” and “my life is useless,” the prosecutor said.\n\nThe drawing is a clear sign of leakage, Reeves said.\n\nLeakage can also involve a fixation on previous mass shootings “to the point where the English teacher knows about it, their friends at the lunch table know about it,” O’Toole said.\n\nWhile a troubling social media post or a disturbing comment in class might not indicate any threat, it’s still worth telling a teacher or school official because others might have additional concerns, O’Toole said.\n\nMake sure students can report concerns anonymously\n\n“Educate the students and the faculty to what the red-flag behaviors are … and make it so that students can call in on a confidential line,” O’Toole said.\n\nSome schools use websites or apps to report concerns anonymously. Even an old-fashioned drop box and note cards can work, O’Toole said.\n\nBut no mechanism will work unless students feel comfortable using it.\n\n“You have to educate the student body that this is not an effort to rat out your fellow student or get a fellow student in trouble,” O’Toole said.\n\n“We strive for prevention – based on knowing what warning behaviors are, how to spot them and how to use appropriate intervention in an objective and compassionate way,” she said.\n\nRegardless of how students report concerns, those messages should be actively monitored, and the information should go to a school threat assessment team, according to best practice recommendations from the US Secret Service National Threat Assessment Center and US Department of Education.\n\nHave a threat assessment team to help support students and prevent violence\n\nIdeally, every school or school district should have a behavioral threat assessment team with protocols on handling potential threats, Reeves said.\n\nThe core team “should include an administrator, at least one school mental health professional (school psychologist, school counselor, school social worker), and a school resource officer (SRO)/law enforcement,” Reeves and colleagues wrote about behavioral threat assessment and management in K-12 schools.\n\nJust because a student gets called in to meet one or more team members doesn’t mean that student is in trouble.\n\n“It’s not designed to be punitive,” Reeves said. “It is an intervention process to get them help. And it does prevent acts of violence.”\n\nReeves said she and other school psychologists have worked with students who had started planning or even started gathering materials to cause harm.\n\nBut when there’s intervention and support, many students “no longer had the desire to want to harm others,” she said.\n\n“Oftentimes, when we’re doing the threat assessment is where we find out there’s abuse going on in the home. Or that one parent just got arrested for domestic violence and they’re sitting in jail. Or the one grandma that was their caretaker who they loved just died. Now they feel that they have nobody,” Reeves said.\n\n“Through this process, we oftentimes identify stressors that nobody knew about. And then when we can intervene, we prevent them from escalating.”\n\nKnowing when to involve law enforcement is another important role of the threat assessment team.\n\n“If an individual makes a threat but it is found to be not true, low level, or transient, then law enforcement will not likely need to be directly involved. School personnel can work with the student and parents by implementing a problem solving and/or conflict resolution process,” Reeves and her colleagues wrote.\n\n“However, if the threat is legitimate and mitigation actions need to be taken, an SRO/law enforcement officer may become engaged in a consultative or direct role. … Reports involving weapons, threats of violence, and physical violence should immediately be reported to local law enforcement.”\n\nSchools can inspect a locker or backpack with ‘reasonable suspicion’\n\nThe mass shooting in Oxford, Michigan, prompted questions about whether schools can search a student’s backpack or locker.\n\nHours before the deadly attack, a teacher reported seeing a drawing by the suspect that included “a semiautomatic handgun pointing at the words ‘the thoughts won’t stop help me,” the lead prosecutor said. She said it also included a drawing of a bullet with the words “blood everywhere” written above it, along with the words “my life is useless” and “the world is dead.”\n\nThe student was “immediately removed from the classroom” and taken to the guidance counselors’ office, where he told a counselor “the drawing was part of a video game he was designing,” the school district’s superintendent said.\n\nDuring that meeting, the 15-year-old suspect had a gun in his backpack, the prosecutor said.\n\nThe gunman later admitted in court that he hid a gun in his backpack and pulled it out in a bathroom before opening fire on his schoolmates.\n\nThe school district did not publicly say whether the suspect’s backpack had been searched.\n\nSchools can search a locker or backpack if they have “reasonable suspicion that there is potentially some sort of weapon or something that could be used as a weapon,” Reeves said.\n\n“It’s a very low bar for a school to search a backpack or a locker,” CNN Senior Legal Analyst Elie Honig said. “We know that from the Supreme Court – it’s reasonable suspicion, which is very low.”\n\nBut just because a school can search a locker or backpack doesn’t mean it’s obligated to, the former federal prosecutor said.\n\nAsk multiple people about gun access\n\nWhen there are hints a student might cause harm, O’Toole said it’s critical to ask both the student and their parents questions about guns, such as:\n\n• Whether there are any firearms in the home\n\n• Whether those guns are safely secured\n\n• Whether the student might otherwise have access to a gun\n\nIf there’s a high level of concern, and the student says they don’t have access to a gun, “you can’t stop there,” O’Toole said.\n\n“Self-reported information is some of the least reliable information that you can have. So you need to find other sources to corroborate what this person is telling you,” the former FBI special agent said.\n\n“So you would certainly want to look for anything else that might suggest that this person is experiencing violent ideation of some kind,” she said. That means talking to the parents, teachers and even law enforcement to see if there have been any reports of incidents at the home.\n\nDon’t rush to suspend or expel a student, which can backfire\n\nSchool officials shouldn’t rush to suspend or expel a student who might cause harm, Reeves said.\n\n“Human instinct is to kick the student out of school, but this can actually escalate risk,” she said.\n\nSeparating the student from school or socialization “can further escalate emotions,” Reeves and her colleagues wrote.\n\n“In addition, further disconnecting the student can increase grievances.”\n\nTherefore, “these types of consequences should be implemented only after careful team consideration and should always be paired with supportive interventions,” the team of school psychologists wrote.\n\nOn the other hand, keeping the student of concern supervised at school “decreases the opportunity for them to be at home alone where they have more time to conduct research and plan how to carry out the act of violence.”\n\nFocus on proactive help\n\n“One of the most proactive ways that we can identify individuals early on is we need to be doing more prevention programs in schools,” Reeves said.\n\nThose can include programs on bullying prevention, suicide prevention, conflict resolution and anger management.\n\n“In addition, parent awareness and engagement is critical,” Reeves said.\n\n“We need parents to be more aware of what is happening in their child’s life and what they may have in their possession. While we need students and school staff to report, we also need more parent engagement at home and also need them to reach out when their child is struggling.”\n\nIn October, after police said a 19-year-old gunman returned to his former St. Louis high school with an AR-15-style rifle and killed two people, the school district announced plans to add gun safety to its curriculum.\n\n“Not just reading, writing, and arithmetic but reading, writing, arithmetic and gun safety,” Saint Louis Public Schools Superintendent Kelvin Adams said.\n\n‘Students, quite honestly, are our biggest eyes and ears’\n\nTo maximize school safety, anyone who sees a warning sign should report it, O’Toole said.\n\nWhile a single incident might not prompt serious concern, “you don’t just look at that alone,” she said.\n\n“It’s the totality of all those behaviors. So one person may know about leakage. One person may know, ‘Yeah, I heard that he has access to a gun.’” And another person might report a separate concern about the same student, O’Toole said.\n\n“So you pull all those together and you say, ‘Ah-ha, now I’m really concerned’ or ‘Nope, there’s nothing else here. Nothing to see here.’”\n\nReeves said students are often in the best position to notice red flags – whether those clues are on social media, in the classroom or outside of school.\n\n“Students, quite honestly, are our biggest eyes and ears that are out there.”", "authors": ["Holly Yan"], "publish_date": "2022/10/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/15/politics/railroad-strike-talks-biden-economic-disaster/index.html", "title": "Analysis: Biden claims huge win for unions, and himself, in tentative ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden proclaimed a huge win for rail workers and organized labor Thursday after his administration brokered a tentative deal with freight bosses on long-sought improvements in working conditions and averted a potentially disastrous strike.\n\nBiden has long been an advocate of trade unions, saying as recently as his Labor Day speech in Pittsburgh that “unions built the middle class.”\n\nBut his intervention – including calls with union leaders and bosses in the critical run-up to the deal on Wednesday night – helped lift the threat of a dispute that could have had serious consequences for the economy and still-roaring inflation after talks, led by his Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, lasted all through Wednesday and into the middle of the night on Thursday.\n\nThe agreement in principle was a validation of Biden’s support for unions, a politically significant factor given the movement’s role supporting Democrats in November’s midterm elections. But it also averted a prolonged shutdown of freight rail that could have hammered the economy and hurt the President and his party politically and exposed him to Republican criticism.\n\nBiden hailed the tentative agreement as “a win for tens of thousands of rail workers who worked tirelessly through the pandemic.”\n\nThe key issue in the dispute was not pay but working conditions, which saw some freight rail engineers and conductors facing “on-call” schedules that could see them rostered to work at short notice, 24-hours-a-day and seven-days-a-week.\n\nDennis Pierce, president of Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen who was in the talks, said the administration’s involvement in driving toward the tentative agreement delivered what the workers wanted on this issue.\n\n“This is a historic agreement for the first time in recorded history we were able obtain an agreement that has negotiated attendance rules, something we’ve strived for. This is the quality of life issue that we have been trying to get for our members since the bargaining round started,” Pierce said, and like other union negotiators, paid tribute to Biden’s role.\n\nThe threat of a strike has not gone away entirely; the deal needs to be ratified by union members. But if blessed, the agreement will sure to be hailed by the President on the campaign trail as another deliverable for an administration that he says is rooted in improving the lives of working- and middle-class Americans.\n\nAn extended halt of the vast freight trains that snake across the prairies and north to Canada and south to Mexico would have caused a full-blown economic, social and political crisis at a time when the nation is still clawing its way back from a fragile and redefined sense of normality after the Covid-19 pandemic and facing the worst spikes in food prices since 1979.\n\nA quarter of the way into the 21st century, it’s a little shocking that a rail network that most Americans probably don’t spare a thought for still forms an economic backbone of the nation. But the latest showdown is far from the only occasion in history when labor disputes in this critical industry have threatened nationwide disruption, and have turned into high-stakes political dramas as a result. Without freight rail, the country can’t properly function.\n\nThe dispute may be focused on the railroads, but it is also emblematic of a wider trend in industrial relations in modern America, as workers squeezed in ventures pared back aggressively for maximum profit potential, from retail to health care to transportation, demand livable working conditions and turn to unions for help.\n\nThe repercussions of a rail strike would have been dramatic.\n\nRoughly 30% of America’s freight moves by rail. If vast trains, some with 240 wagons, don’t move, the country would need to find an impractical 80,000 truck drivers to make up the shortfall. It might seem counterintuitive, but a strike on the railways would send gasoline prices for cars soaring again. That’s because refineries would struggle to get sufficient crude oil from their rail deliveries. Recently harvested crops would be stuck, unable to reach processing plants and could spoil. Farm groups warned of the threat to fertilizer stocks that are transported by rail and needed for the next planting season. There would have been shortages of food and other items in stores – and prices could have risen again, adding to the current plague of inflation. New and used cars would be more expensive, if factories can’t get the parts they need for their assembly lines. And the ports that became clogged during the pandemic could have again filled up, in a huge problem for the US economy that would quickly send shockwaves around the world.\n\nA strike lasting weeks could have underscored, yet again, the tenuousness of the supply chain networks that are the foundation of modern life and how it doesn’t take long to incur serious damage.\n\nThese painful consequences, which could touch every American, explain why the talks in Washington brokered by Walsh were so important and urgently pursued.\n\nNegotiations to avert the strike went on for 20 hours, with a deal reached around 5 a.m. ET Thursday, a source familiar with the matter told CNN’s Jeremy Diamond and Phil Mattingly. Biden “made a crucial call” to Walsh and negotiators Wednesday night, the source added, pushing both sides to realize the harm that families, businesses and communities would feel if there was a shutdown of the rail system.\n\nBiden’s team worked to head off a political nightmare\n\nA rail shutdown was not just a threat to the day-to-day lives of millions of Americans. The prospect was a huge problem for Biden and Democrats, first because they know that their brightening chances of staving off a Republican wave in the midterms could be dashed by another devastating shock to the economy that sends prices even higher and shatters the sense of normality that Biden pledged to restore. Another surge in inflation caused by a rail strike could also force the Federal Reserve to prolong its aggressive interest rate strategy, which is expected to go up another notch next week, and so raise the chances of an overcorrection that sends the economy into a recession.\n\nThe President, boosted by the passage of key congressional items, has been aggressively selling a story that America is back on the move again and that its economy is ready to roar. A rail strike would quickly tarnish his credibility in selling that narrative.\n\nIn a broader sense, the rail dispute pulled Biden between two competing strands of his political identity. He is the most-pro union president in decades. He needs the support of the movement to drive turnout in November and has no desire to be seen pressuring workers to accept a bad deal. On the other hand, the success of his entire presidency rests on getting inflation down and preventing Republicans from amassing Capitol Hill majorities that could make him a domestic lame duck.\n\nRepublicans, seeking to wrest the midterm debate back from the controversy over the Supreme Court’s overturning of abortion rights, already spotted an opening in the rail dispute. The GOP tried and failed to pass a bill in the Senate that would enshrine deals most railway unions have made with companies and avert a strike.\n\n“President Biden should have already resolved this himself. Democrats must let this pass,” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell tweeted.\n\nBut some Democrats are unwilling to put pressure on unions. The GOP measure was in the end blocked by progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders, who’s twice run for the Democratic presidential nod. The Vermont independent blasted rail companies for making billions in profits and awarding their CEOs millions in compensation while imposing inhumane working conditions.\n\n“The key issue in the current negotiations are not about salaries. They are about the working conditions in the industry which are absolutely unacceptable and almost beyond belief,” Sanders said, criticizing the lack of sick leave offered to some employees and a system that requires many to be on call for dispatch to work on trains 24 hours a day a day and seven days a week.\n\nA crisis long in the making\n\nArthur Wheaton, director of Labor Studies at the ILR Worker Institute of Cornell University, said that years of cost cutting and consolidation in the rail industry predated the pandemic and have led to the current impasse.\n\n“The railways tried very hard to reduce headcount and actively reduce the number of people that they had working for them as a way to increase their profits or to have a higher return on investment so they could get more investment from Wall Street,” Wheaton said. But that paring down of manpower had caused a deterioration in the conditions for workers, who already faced long hours, and could raise safety concerns given the hazardous cargos some trains carry. The “on call” system mentioned by Sanders is at the center of the current dispute.\n\n“That’s not sustainable for a family or sustainable for your health long term. You’d like to be able to go to bed knowing you don’t have to work for the next 12 hours, instead of saying, ‘Oh, I gotta wait and see if the phone rings,” Wheaton said.\n\nThe threatened railroad shutdown would have been the first major strike in the industry since 1992, when Congress moved with unusual speed to end a labor stoppage after only two days amid severe economic consequences – including layoffs at mines that could no longer ship out their coal. The strike had shut down almost all goods and passenger rail in the country and, as with the current drama, threatened to become a political storm in an election year.\n\nOne question with this new dispute is whether an ever-more polarized Congress could agree on terms for ending industrial action or whether such an erupting economic crisis would have left rival lawmakers with no choice.\n\nThroughout America’s industrial history in the 20th and 19th centuries, railroad strikes often broke out over poor wages or salary cuts or difficult and dangerous conditions. Often they were crushed by the government or industry barons, sometimes amid scenes of violence. But they are also written in the lore of the labor movement. And they also established leverage that played out in the negotiations between unions and company bosses in Washington.\n\nThen and now, the threat of closing down railroads for a sustained period conjures such dire economic repercussions that the dispute ends up becoming a major political issue that the nation’s leaders are ultimately called on to help solve – for their own good and everyone else’s.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/09/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/business/elon-musk-neuralink-animal-cruelty-intl-scli/index.html", "title": "Elon Musk's Neuralink confirms monkeys died in project, denies ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nElon Musk’s implant company Neuralink, which aims to enable brains to connect and communicate with computers, has acknowledged that monkeys died as part of its testing procedures, but denies allegations of animal cruelty.\n\nIn a blog post on its website, ​Neuralink addressed the “recent articles” that have “raised questions around Neuralink’s use of research animals at the University of California, Davis Primate Center” (UC Davis) and said that “all novel medical devices and treatments must be tested in animals before they can be ethically trialed in humans.”\n\nMacaque monkeys have been used in testing by Neuralink as the company has been developing Bluetooth-enabled implantable chips – inserted into the monkey’s brains – that ​the company says can communicate with computers via a small receiver.\n\nIn April last year, Neuralink claimed monkeys can play Pong – a computer game - using just their minds when it released a video of Pager, a male macaque, moving a cursor onscreen without using a joystick to do so.\n\n​The company said this was achieved after the Neuralink chip fed the information from the monkey’s neurons into a decoder, which was then used to predict Pager’s intended hand movements – allowing the output from the decoder to be used to move the cursor, instead of Pager manipulating the joystick.\n\nThe statement by Neuralink comes after the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine – a US non-profit ​that advocates alternatives to animal testing – sent a letter to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) referencing violations and requesting an investigation into what it called “apparent egregious violations of the Animal Welfare Act related to the treatment of monkeys used in invasive brain experiments.”\n\nThe document says the experiments were carried out pursuant to contractual agreements between UC Davis and Neuralink. In the letter, which spans more than 700 pages, the Physicians Committee said records it obtained for the 23 monkeys used in the experiments reflect a “pattern of extreme suffering and staff negligence.” The committee said that the letter to the USDA is based on nearly 600 pages of what it calls “disturbing” documents released after the committee filed an initial public records lawsuit in 2021.\n\nThe Physicians Committee said in a press release on February 10 that UC Davis received more than $1.4 million in funding from Neuralink to carry out the experiments on the macaque monkeys.\n\nCNN has contacted UC Davis and the Board of Regents for comment. In a statement to KCRA 3, UC Davis spokesperson Andy Fell said: “The research protocols were thoroughly reviewed and approved by the campus’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).” Fell added: “The work was conducted by Neuralink researchers in facilities at the California National Primate Research Center at UC Davis. UC Davis staff provided veterinary care including round-the-clock monitoring of experimental animals. When an incident occurred, it was reported to the IACUC, which mandated training and protocol changes as needed.”\n\nElon Musk's company, Neuralink, denies accusations of animal cruelty in its testing procedures. Action Press/Shutterstock\n\nOn February 10, the Physicians Committee ​says they filed a second public records lawsuit to compel the university to release videos and photographs of the monkeys. Neuralink is not part of the lawsuit.\n\nIn the lawsuit, the committee alleges that staff at the university “removed pieces of the skulls of rhesus macaque monkeys and inserted electrodes into the animals’ brains.”\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that monkeys were not provided with adequate veterinary care and that an “unapproved substance” known as BioGlue “killed monkeys by destroying portions of their brains.”\n\nIn Neuralink’s blog, the company said there was “one surgical complication involving the use of the FDA-approved product (BioGlue),” and the monkey was euthanized.\n\nIn the lawsuit, the committee further alleges that the University of California has ​declined to release photos and videos ​of the experiments, saying the records belong to Neuralink, a private company not subject to California’s Public Records Act.\n\nIn ​a statement posted to Neuralink’s website, Neuralink said the company is “absolutely committed to working with animals in the most humane and ethical way possible.”\n\nIt also said that its “central mission is to design an animal care program prioritizing the needs of the animals, rather than the typical strategy of building for human convenience alone.”\n\nNeuralink said “the use of every animal was extensively planned and considered to balance scientific discovery with the ethical use of animals.” In reference to the claims of ​euthanasia by the Physicians Committee, Neuralink stated that “two animals were euthanized at planned end dates to gather important histological data, and six animals were euthanized at the medical advice of the veterinary staff at UC Davis.”\n\nNeuralink said it ​made the decision to partner with UC Davis in 2017 to conduct animal-based research. In 2020, Musk’s company opened an in-house 6,000-square-foot vivarium to house farm animals and rhesus macaques​, according to Neuralink’s statement.\n\nNeuralink said in the statement that it is “never satisfied with the current standards for animal well being and we will always push ourselves to do more for the animals that are contributing so much to humanity.”\n\nJeremy Beckham, research advocacy coordinator with the Physicians Committee, said in the press release that documents used by the committee in its letter to the USDA “reveal that monkeys had their brains mutilated in shoddy experiments and were left to suffer and die.”\n\nNeuralink has previously said that the goal of their research was to enable a person with paralysis to be able to use a device like a computer or phone using only brain activity.", "authors": ["Hannah Ryan"], "publish_date": "2022/02/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/28/business/dr-pepper-history/index.html", "title": "The soda market is flat, but not for Dr Pepper | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN —\n\nIn the pantheon of sodas, Dr Pepper is the odd one out: It doesn’t have the popularity or sales of Coca-Cola or Pepsi, you can’t use it in a standard cocktail, and it doesn’t fall neatly into a category like cola or root beer.\n\nFor decades, the peppery soda has marketed its blend of 23 flavors as a unique choice for discerning soda drinkers. Over the years Dr Pepper has found success as a quirky alternative to Coke and Pepsi.\n\nToday, Dr Pepper is hardly a scrappy underdog — it’s the hero brand in Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) which, along with Coca-Cola (KO) and PepsiCo (PEP), make up the three largest soda companies in the $37 billion US market, as measured by NielsenIQ in retail and convenience stores.\n\nAnd recently, Dr Pepper has been gaining ground on its competitors, even as the overall soda market goes flat.\n\nKeurig Dr Pepper is the third-largest soda maker in the country. Daniel Acker/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nDr Pepper soda grew its dollar share by 9% from 2003 to 2021, compared to a 26% drop in the carbonated soft drinks category overall, according to Keurig Dr Pepper, citing IRI and the Beverage Digest factbook. Today, Dr Pepper is the fourth most popular soda in the country after Coke, Pepsi and Mountain Dew.\n\n“Over the past 20 years, carbonated soft drinks have been declining in volume,” said Duane Stanford, editor of Beverage Digest. “One of the bright spots … has been Dr Pepper.”\n\nFounded in 1885 in Waco, Texas, Dr Pepper was the first in a wave of 19th-century upstart soda companies. (It dropped the period in the 1950s for design reasons.) The little brand rose to prominence in the latter half of the 20th century and helped shape the soda industry, all while cultivating its reputation as an outsider.\n\nThe early days of Dr Pepper\n\nThe drink was invented by Charles Alderton, a pharmacist at a drug store owned by Wade Morrison, who is credited with patenting the drink and naming it.\n\nLegend has it that Morrison named the beverage after one Charles Pepper, the father of a woman he loved, hoping that the gesture would facilitate a match. That’s the tale on the Dr Pepper website. But Joy Summar-Smith, associate director of the Dr Pepper Museum in Waco, said there are several origin stories, and this one doesn’t hold up.\n\n“By the time [Morrison] came across Dr. Pepper he was married and he had a son,” said Summar-Smith.\n\nCoca-Cola was created in 1886. Pepsi was invented in the 1890s, but got its name in 1898.\n\n“The soft drink industry itself, as a whole, was still really trying to figure itself out in the late 1800s, early 1900s,” Summar-Smith said. “Each town had their own soft drink manufacturing facility.”\n\nCoca-Cola established itself most quickly, aided by its invention of the coupon, which offered free samples of its new beverage. Pepsi positioned itself as a less expensive competitor to Coke.\n\nAds for Dr Pepper and Coca-Cola on a store in North Carolina, in April 1938. John Vachon/Everett/Shutterstock\n\nWhile Coke and Pepsi were making waves, Dr Pepper “just didn’t push it that hard,” said Tristan Donovan, author of “Fizz: How Soda Shook Up the World.”\n\nEarly in the 20th century, Dr Pepper encouraged customers to drink a Dr Pepper three times a day, at around 10 a.m., 2 p.m. and 4 p.m., to keep their energy up. While successful, the campaign never focused on the product’s unique, non-cola flavor.\n\nIn the 1950s, Dr Pepper branded itself “the friendly Pepper-Upper,” once again focusing on the rush of energy you could get from any can of soda.\n\nThen, everything changed.\n\nNot a cola\n\nIn the early 20th century, national bottlers that worked with with Coke or Pepsi shied away from Dr Pepper, fearing they would run afoul of agreements that barred them from partnering with a competitor. As a result, Dr Pepper had little national distribution, focusing primarily on Texas and nearby states.\n\nIn the 1960s, PepsiCo sued Dr Pepper for trademark infringement. Dr Pepper countered, accusing Pepsi of denying the beverage entry to its distribution platform. In 1963, a judge ruled for the bottler, opening the door to the product’s national expansion.​​\n\nDr Pepper “pulled off a legal coup that gave it the necessary leg up: It argued effectively in a US District Court that Dr Pepper was not a cola,” a 1984 article in D Magazine explained. Or as the Federal Trade Commission put it, “the suit opened up PepsiCo and Coca-Cola bottlers to Dr Pepper and its sales rose immediately.”\n\nWith new-found access to the whole country, the brand “started promoting [itself] much more heavily,” said Donovan, the author of “Fizz.”\n\nThrough the 1970s, Dr Pepper marketed itself to a national audience as a unique flavor, a shift that D Magazine said “fleshed out an identity for Dr Pepper that may be its most formidable asset.” In 1977, the company launched its “Be a Pepper” campaign, encouraging people to identify as Dr Pepper drinkers.\n\nThe \"Be a Pepper\" campaign ran from 1977 to 1983. Courtesy Keurig Dr Pepper\n\nToday, Dr Pepper advertises itself as a treat, using a pint-sized mascot called Lil’ Sweet in its commercials. Another campaign, Fanville, is set in a fictionalized world where people are obsessed with college football and also Dr Pepper, positioning the beverage as a cult favorite.\n\nAfter Dr Pepper established itself as an alternative to mainstream colas, it launched on a path that ultimately made it part of the country’s third-largest soft drink maker, Keurig Dr Pepper.\n\nDr Pepper hits the scene\n\nDuring the wave of mega-mergers in the 1980s, Coca-Cola tried to scoop up Dr Pepper.\n\nIn 1986, soon after PepsiCo announced its intention to purchase 7Up, Coca-Cola said it had agreed to acquire Dr Pepper. The plans would have made Coke and Pepsi the most formidable players in the market by far, the Los Angeles Times reported at the time.\n\nBut both Coke’s and Pepsi’s deals were blocked, as the FTC decided the beverages were similar enough to pose a possible antitrust threat.\n\nA whirlwind series of mergers, acquisitions and spinoffs ensued. Dr Pepper and 7Up merged in the late 1980s. Over the years, Cadbury Schweppes took stakes in the combined company and, eventually, full ownership of the brands. In 2008 Cadbury spun off its North American beverage division to create the Dr Pepper Snapple Group. A decade later, Keurig Green Mountain merged with that company, creating Keurig Dr Pepper.\n\nBottles of Dr. Pepper move down a production line at the Swire Coca-Cola bottling plant in Utah. George Frey/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nDr Pepper, soda giant\n\nToday, KDP still trails behind Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, but it’s narrowing the gap.\n\nBy volume, Coca-Cola controlled about 40% of the US retail market in the first nine months of 2022, followed by PepsiCo with about 29% and Keurig Dr Pepper with roughly 25%, according to Beverage Digest’s data.\n\nCompared to the year before, PepsiCo’s share fell by 1%, while Keurig Dr Pepper’s ticked up. And over the years, the Dr Pepper brand has been gaining momentum while some of its competitors struggle. That might be because of consumers’ increasing interest in flavored soft drinks, said Stanford, the publication’s editor.\n\nThere are other advantages to existing outside of the cola dichotomy. Food-service providers typically have an agreement with either Coke or Pepsi for its soda fountains, and one fountain won’t feature products made by the other. But the fountains often offer Dr Pepper, making it a widely available choice.\n\n“Dr Pepper is the number one most differentiated trademark in beverage — not just soft drinks, but in beverage,” said Derek Dabrowski, general manager of juices, mixers and sauces at KDP. People reach for Dr Pepper when they want a treat, he added. That’s “where we have been winning.”", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/12/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/05/business/non-alcoholic-trend/index.html", "title": "The buzzy new drinking trend is no-booze alcohol | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nNon-alcoholic alternatives to booze have been around for a while. But recently, the sector has been booming.\n\nFor a long time “you had ‘near beer,’ which was kind of a joke,” said Duane Stanford, editor of Beverage Digest. “People would be discreet about drinking them. And now that’s completely changed.”\n\nThe non-alcoholic trend started to pick up a year or two before the pandemic, with no-alcohol bars catering to the so-called “sober curious” popping up in some cities, and has continued to grow at a rapid clip.\n\nIn recent years, major alcohol companies including Heineken, AB InBev and Molson Coors have started offering more zero alcohol options. Smaller brands, such as Athletic Brewing, which makes non-alcoholic craft beer, and Seedlip, which makes booze-free liquor alternatives, have also arrived on the scene.\n\nA non-alcoholic martini. Sean Clark\n\nSeedlip “started to gain momentum a few years ago and continues to today,” said Lizzy Freier, director of menu research and insights at food service consulting firm Technomic.\n\nMentions of Seedlip on drink menus has grown 100% year-over-year, Freier said, adding that “we’re now starting to see some new alcohol-free spirits show up on the market, especially in independent restaurants.”\n\nNon-alcoholic booze alternatives are still a tiny market compared to regular alcoholic beverages. But while alcohol sales slip, sales of their alcohol-free counterparts are soaring.\n\nIn the year ending May 14, US retail sales of non-alcoholic spirits grew 116% to $4.5 million, according to NielsenIQ. Alcoholic spirit sales slipped about 1% to just under $21 billion.\n\nIn that same period, non-alcoholic beer jumped 21% to $316 million and non-alcoholic wine rose 20% to $50 million. Traditional beer sales fell 4% to about $46 billion, and sales of alcoholic wine declined 6% to nearly $20 billion.\n\nStanford sees it this way: As interest in non-alcoholic alternatives rises, there’s a greater imperative for brands to deliver better products as more of them launch.\n\n“There is a real market force now to go and create those solutions and to really work at it,” he said. “There’s money to be made. So people are figuring it out.”\n\nBut, Stanford added, “I do wonder what the natural ceiling is for these products, because you don’t have the functionality of alcohol.” In other words, how many people really want booze without the buzz?\n\nGoing out, but drinking less\n\nDemand for non-alcoholic alternatives has been largely driven by younger consumers who want to drink less but aren’t interested in abstaining from alcohol altogether, Stanford said.\n\n“They’re not necessarily teetotaling. In fact, most of them aren’t,” he said. “They do drink alcohol, but they’re just trying to moderate.”\n\nA non-alcoholic beer or cocktail might appeal to consumers who, for example, are observing Dry January. Or maybe they want to stay out late with friends, but keep drinking to a minimum. Perhaps they have to drive home, or are trying to avoid a hangover. Or they are aware of alcohol’s negative health effects, and want to consume less in general.\n\nThose drinkers could always reach for a seltzer or a soda, of course. But non-alcoholic beverage makers are positioning their products as more sophisticated and flavorful. And, with colorful cans and festive packaging, they’re designed to help non-drinkers blend in.\n\n“The biggest market play we’re seeing is this emphasized idea that customers can still gather, celebrate and enjoy a good drink while still abstaining from alcohol, whether that be for lifestyle choices or personal reasons,” Freier said.\n\nErin Flavin, seated facing the table, started researching non-alcoholic alternatives to booz when she quit drinking. Sean Clark\n\nErin Flavin found herself imbibing more than she wanted to during the pandemic. So in October 2020, she decided to quit drinking. Sick of seltzer, she explored other options.\n\n“I started out with teas,” she said. She discovered Rishi Tea & Botanicals, which makes a line of “sparkling botanicals” drinks. They come in flavors like grapefruit quince, dandelion ginger and elderberry maqui, made with red wine grape skins.\n\n“I was drinking that a lot, in a beautiful glass, and still having my little ritual at the end of the night,” she said. “That really helped.”\n\nLast year, she started selling some non-alcoholic drinks at her Minneapolis hair studio, Honeycomb Salon. She plans to open a non-alcoholic liquor store soon.\n\nWhile some, like Flavin, took stock of their drinking habits during the pandemic, others had been thinking about alcohol alternatives for years.\n\nNon-alcoholic beers get crafty\n\nFor Ben Jordan, it was challenging to find something flavorful but non-alcoholic to drink when he’d go to get-togethers while at graduate school, about a decade ago.\n\n“I was wanting to drink beer at parties and in social environments, but didn’t want the effects of ethanol,” he told CNN Business. At the time, the non-alcoholic beer options were “pretty bad,” he said.\n\nSo he set out to find a solution, eventually co-founding ABV Technology, which sells and rents machines that remove alcohol from beer to craft breweries, enabling them to get in on the trend. ABV Technology also offers its products to distilleries and wineries. The company was incorporated in 2017, and Jordan is its CEO.\n\nOne surprising incentive for craft brewers deciding whether to invest in non-alcoholic beers? The hard seltzer craze.\n\nOnce ABV Technology’s machines remove alcohol from beer, that booze can then be used for hard seltzers. For a brewer, that affords the option of turning alcoholic beer into two products: non-alcoholic beer and trendy hard seltzer.\n\nBen Jordan, CEO of ABV Technology. Sean Clark\n\nJordan predicts that in the United States, non-alcoholic beer could end up making up a fifth of the total US beer market.\n\n“Things look very positive for the non-alcoholic beer industry right now,” he said.\n\nBut there are challenges ahead, especially as consumers cope with soaring inflation. Non-alcoholic beer, wine and spirits don’t come cheap.\n\nBottles of non-alcoholic spirits are priced in the $20 to $30-range on Amazon. And a can of non-alcoholic beer costs about the same, if not more, than the same sized-can of regular beer, Jordan said.\n\nA sliver of the population may be willing to pay that amount for that alternative, Stanford said.\n\n“Upwardly mobile, young consumers who want these kinds of products for specific lifestyle reasons — as long as you’re offering them quality and something that they actually want to hold and be seen with, they will pay those prices,” he said.\n\nBut getting money-conscious skeptics on board? “The challenge is, you’re gonna have to convince them that the quality is there,” Stanford said, “that they’re going to look cool drinking it, and they’re going to want to be seen with it.”", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/06/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/12/homes/buying-a-home-high-rates/index.html", "title": "It's a terrible time to buy a house. Here's what to know if you have to ...", "text": "There is no sugarcoating it: This is a terrible time to buy a home.\n\nMortgage rates for a 30-year fixed rate loan are now hovering above 7%, more than 4 percentage points higher than a year ago. That has slashed a typical buyer’s purchasing power by 14%, according to Black Knight, a mortgage data company.\n\nWith fewer people able or interested in buying now, home sales have been falling. Just 16% of people say now is a good time to buy a home, a record low, according to a monthly survey conducted by Fannie Mae in October.\n\nStill, that’s barely made a dent in home prices, which soared to new heights during the pandemic and are now just easing off of all-time highs.\n\nAnother thing tamping down sales is stubbornly low inventory of available homes for sale, said Jackie Lafferty, a real estate agent with Baird & Warner Real Estate in Chicago.\n\n“It is something I’ve never seen a combination of, this lack of inventory and higher interest rates,” Lafferty said. “There is no motivation for people to move unless they have to.”\n\nBut whether people need to move because of a new job, a divorce, an addition to the family or they simply don’t want to give up after years of trying to buy a home, there are still buyers out there.\n\n“Even if sales slow down, real estate doesn’t stop,” said Lafferty. “People need a place to live.”\n\nFor those who are pressing on, here are a few ways you can take some of the sting out of buying a home.\n\nTake a loan now and refinance later\n\nBuyers taking out a mortgage now are doing so with the hope that within a couple years, rates might meaningfully drop and they can refinance to a lower rate.\n\n“Yes, rates have gone up much farther and faster than anyone expected them to,” said Melissa Cohn, regional vice president at William Raveis Mortgage. “But if you can afford to buy today and want and need to, you shouldn’t let the higher rate environment stop you, knowing that at some point in the next year, two years at the most, rates are likely to be significantly lower.”\n\nThe downside: You’ll still have to stomach the higher rate for the time being. There is some risk that interest rates may not fall, or at least not by much. And if mortgage rates don’t go down, you could be stuck with it for a while, said Delyse Berry, CEO and principal broker at Upstate Down in Rhinebeck, New York.\n\n“There could be a decrease in rates in the middle of 2023,” she said. “If that comes to pass, you can do a refinance and secure a lower interest rate and lower payments. But these rates could now be the new cost of doing business.”\n\nPlus, refinancing can be extremely costly. Typically, closing costs run between 2% and 5% of the loan’s principal amount.\n\nAnd unexpected events may prevent you from refinancing, like losing your job or losing value in your home.\n\nGet an adjustable rate loan\n\nMore home buyers are exploring options outside of the standard 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. For example, adjustable rate mortgages, or ARMs, now make up 12% of mortgage applications, up from 3% a year ago, according to Mortgage Bankers Association.\n\nWhile the average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate loan was 7.08% last week, the rate for the 5-year Treasury-indexed hybrid adjustable rate mortgage was a full percentage point lower at 6.06%, according to Freddie Mac. Though they are still 30-year loans, ARMs offer a fixed rate for a set period – typically 5, 7 or 10 years – after which the interest rate resets to current market rates.\n\n“Buying today is about figuring out what can you do to bridge this high-rate environment to get yourself comfortable with your acquisition,” said Cohn. “When rates drop, it is time to see what your more permanent solution will be.”\n\nFor buyers who may be moving out of the home in 5 to 7 years anyway, an ARM may be a way to boost purchasing power.\n\n“For the first 5 or 7 years of an adjustable rate mortgage, it walks, talks and acts just like a fixed-rate mortgage,” said Cohn. “It has a lower rate and lower payment because the bank is only guaranteeing it for a shorter period of time.”\n\nIf rates come down, an ARM could reset to a better rate.\n\nThe downside: Borrowers must also accept the risk that rates could be even higher when the loan resets, or any time over the life of the loan. After the fixed period, ARMs can reset every year or every six months.\n\nHowever, most do have caps on how much a rate can go up or down during each reset period and over the life of the loan, so it’s important to understand how your loan works.\n\nBuy down your interest rate with points\n\nBorrowers can lower their payments by paying more upfront to buy down their mortgage rate. This will lower the loan’s interest rate, either permanently or temporarily.\n\nWhile a permanent buydown changes your rate for the life of a loan, a temporary buydown provides lower rates for a period of time.\n\nIn a temporary buydown, typically borrowers get two percentage points off the loan’s rate for the first year, one percentage point off for the second year, and by the third year, the loan returns to its original rate for the remainder of its term. By then, many borrowers expect there to be lower interest rates, which leaves open the possibility of refinancing.\n\n“That is a meaningful difference for the first year of the loan, lowering your rate from 7% to 5%,” said Cohn.\n\nThe downside: While getting a lower interest rate is very appealing, it means shelling out more money up front. That might not make financial sense if you don’t plan to stay in the house for a long time.\n\n“It takes about five years to break even on paying down one point,” said Cohn. “Knowing that rates are likely to be meaningfully lower by then, you might be better off taking the money you’d use to pay for points to pay for refinancing later.”\n\nRequest a seller’s credit to buy down your rate\n\nIn some housing markets, competition among buyers has softened, and sellers are being forced to be more flexible on offers.\n\nOne way a buyer can reduce their payments is to ask for a seller’s credit, or a seller’s concession, as part of the deal. Buyers can then use that money to buy down the interest rate on their mortgage and reduce their monthly payments.\n\n“Sellers are willing to negotiate more now than they have in the past,” said Trudy Kelly, a senior home loan specialist at Churchill Mortgage in Oregon.\n\nIn September, when mortgage rates were around 5.75%, Kelly worked with borrowers who were buying a $590,000 house. Rather than offering $15,000 or $20,000 below the asking price to reduce the cost of the monthly payments, the buyers asked for a $15,000 seller’s concession.\n\nIf the buyers had made the lower offer and got the home for $575,000, their monthly savings would be $78, said Kelly. But by paying down the interest rate by one percentage point, their payments dropped by $340 a month.\n\n“That is a huge difference,” she said. “Ultimately, what that did for them was expand their budget. It lowered their debt-to-income ratio giving them more purchase power. It puts them in a time machine and takes them back to April or May [when rates were lower].”\n\nThe downside: In many areas, it’s still a seller’s market. Asking for a credit or concession might be less appealing to a seller if they have other offers.\n\nBuy in cash or increase your down payment\n\nIf you’ve got the cash to buy a home, now is a good time to do it. Not only will you avoid paying a high rate on a mortgage, you’ll likely be able to negotiate for a better price.\n\nBut not many people can pay in cash: 97% of homebuyers over the past year needed to finance their home, according to a recent report from the National Association of Realtors.\n\nEven if you don’t have enough for an all-cash deal, throwing more at the down payment will reduce the amount of your mortgage, lower your monthly payments, and mean paying less interest over the life of the loan. If you own your current home, you can leverage some of the cash from your sale or possibly even tap the equity to boost your down payment.\n\nBy making a larger down payment you will not only reduce your loan balance but also increase your home equity, money you can recoup when you sell – assuming the property appreciates.\n\nThe downside: Using cash toward a real estate purchase is always a trade-off, as you’ll have to forgo other potential investments. And for most buyers, coughing up more cash just isn’t an option. The typical down payment for first-time buyers was 6%, while it was 17% for repeat buyers. according to the National Association of Realtors.", "authors": ["Anna Bahney"], "publish_date": "2022/11/12"}]}

Wilmington Brew Works at 3201 Miller Road should be open sometime in May, making it the first production brewery within the city limits in more than six decades.

The Starboard in Dewey Beach, which is known best for selling Orange Crushes and Bud Lights, added craft beers three years ago and they already account for nearly 20 percent of all beer sales.\n\nSo this beer bubble is bound to burst, right? Think again.\n\nIndustry watchers, brewery owners and restaurateurs agree: there are no signs of slowing. In fact, most say Delaware is still behind the curve.\n\nFigures from the Brewers Association, a trade group that represents the craft brewing industry, points to room for growth in Delaware. While the state ranks 19th in the number of craft breweries per capita, it ranks sixth in terms of craft beer intake.\n\n\"Delawareans are getting their beer from somewhere – not necessarily Delaware breweries,\" says Wilmington-based beer expert and author John Medkeff Jr. \"What that tells me is that there's a lot of potential for local breweries, along with the state's distributors and restaurants.\"\n\nFor Ron Price, owner and founder of Smyrna's Blue Earl Brewing Co., one of Delaware's newest breweries, he has seen no signs of slowing in the fast-growing industry.\n\n\"I understand there are some folks who think this bubble may burst and maybe sooner rather than later. I don't think that's necessarily the case here because we're seeing a change in culture,\" says Price, who opened Blue Earl in May. \"I don't think craft beer drinkers are going to all of a sudden say, 'You know what? This is not for me.' This is a renaissance.\"\n\nCraft brews gain in prestige, popularity\n\nThe shift away from brand loyalty in the beer world is a side-effect of the craft beer explosion with new beers being created and brought to market daily.\n\nFor those used to a keg of Bud Light or Yuengling at a summertime backyard barbecue, it's no longer a surprise finding a wide assortment of craft beers from multiple breweries being sampled and passed around.\n\n\"The consumer is becoming more educated and more interested in trying new things constantly. It's ever-evolving,\" says Ted Stewart, craft brand manager for New Castle-based Standard Distributing Co. \"You have beer nerds or beer geeks who are like hipsters with music – they want the new stuff before everyone else.\"\n\nWhen Sam Calagione founded Dogfish Head in 1995 as the state's first brewpub, there were 858 craft breweries in the U.S. Last year, the Brewers Association reported 3,464. That's a 303 percent increase in craft breweries over a 20-year period.\n\nLast year, craft brewers produced 22.2 million barrels of beer – an 18 percent jump in volume over the year before, according to association figures.\n\n\"That's awesome as a beer drinker, but we'd be naive to assume that growth rate is sustainable,\" says Calagione, who believes the industry will continue to grow for years, but not at that accelerated rate. \"The consumers will decide which breweries survive and thrive and I'm confident that most will.\"\n\nOverall, microbreweries are still a drop in the beer barrel compared to worldwide beer giants Anheuser-Busch InBev and MillerCoors.\n\nCraft breweries only account for 11 percent of the market share in the beer industry, marking the first time it ever broke double digits, according to 2014 figures from the trade association. The industry has set a goal of owning 20 percent of the market by 2020.\n\nCalagione predicts that the first major signs of a craft beer slow-down in Delaware would come in the form of a brewery closing its doors. And these days, they only seem to be swinging open.\n\n\"Until you see a brewery go out of business, you'll see a healthy environment,\" he says. \"And if Delaware breweries focus on quality, consistency and being well differentiated, I don't foresee a Delaware brewery closing any time soon.\"\n\nMedkeff agrees, pointing toward history.\n\nIn the 1870s in the United States, there were over 3,000 breweries for about 40 million people. Today, there's about 3,500 breweries for seven times the number of people.\n\n\"That speaks well for the potential for growth,\" he says, especially considering that Delaware's largest city, Wilmington, does not have any production breweries.\n\nMedkeff, whose new book \"Brewing in Delaware\" ($21.99, Arcadia Publishing) is due in stores Aug. 10, sees the return to locally based brewing as a trip back to the future.\n\nAfter all, the brew game is coming full circle back to the days before Prohibition when hometown brews dominated early American life.\n\n\"Brewpubs existed from the earliest colonial days and were generally small operations run at hospitality houses that had saloons attached,\" he says. \"They were spread along colonial roads with no railroads or refrigeration, making their business from travelers going from one town to the next.\"\n\nEven though large-scale, non locally-sourced breweries have dominated in the nearly 100 years since Prohibition, brewpubs began to re-appear again in the mid-80s, concentrated mostly in California and the Northwest.\n\nCraft beer now a must-stock item\n\nDelaware has 15 craft breweries that are either already open or preparing to open soon, including Lewes' Crooked Hammock Brewery, opening later this summer, and the Dewey Beer Co., which opened in May. The majority of Delaware's craft breweries have opened in just the past five years or so.\n\nThe Dewey Beer. Co. is located across the street from one of the party town's biggest bars, The Starboard.\n\nOnly three years ago, The Starboard didn't carry any craft beers. That changed after co-owner Steve \"Monty\" Montgomery began getting requests for craft brews from his staff. They had caught the craft beer buzz even before The Starboard's customers, who rarely requested the small batch beers.\n\nTwelve craft beer taps made their debut at The Starboard opening weekend 2012. Those taps and the other dozen or so craft beer bottles The Starboard now carries account for nearly a fifth of all beer sales, Montgomery days.\n\nIt's a number that might jump even higher now that Dewey's first brewery opened across Del. 1, already leading to more cross-pollination between craft beer drinkers and lovers of traditional domestics.\n\n\"The world is changing. Nothing against the domestics of the world, but people now are specifically going to places like The Picked Pig Pub or the Henlopen City Oyster House to find great beers,\" Montgomery says. \"They almost treat it like wine: they're swilling it, sniffing it, tasting it. People are more into quality over quantity in this day and age.\n\n\"It's really overwhelming to keep track of all these great beers and not feel like a complete alcoholic because you have to go out every other day to try new beers.\"\n\nOver at Standard Distributing, best known for supplying beers like Miller Lite, Coors Light and Yuengling to bars and liquor stores, Stewart's position as the craft beer manger was created just last year.\n\nHe's in charge of selling nearly 20 different craft brands that range from local brews like Greenville's Twin Lakes and Georgetown's 16 Mile to California's Lagunitas Brewing Company and New York's Brooklyn Brewery.\n\nOver the past two or three years, Stewart estimates Standard has doubled or tripled its craft beer sales in the state, making it 10 to 15 percent of their current business.\n\n\"And even though you see craft beer everywhere, Delaware is still behind the game. If you go to Philly, it's even more prevalent. Delaware is on its way, but we still have a way to go,\" he says.\n\nCrooked Hammock co-owner Rich Garrahan says his new brewery, which also includes a restaurant with live music and a beer garden, should be open in early September.\n\nThe brewery, which is part of the newly formed La Vida Hospitality Group that includes Rehoboth Beach restaurant Nage, is located just outside of Lewes on Kings Highway off Del.1 – making it the Lewes area's only brewery.\n\nFive Crooked Hammock beers will be available to start, along with other locally brewed cold ones. Other local partner restaurants, including Nage and Big Chill Surf Cantina, are also expected to eventually carry the Crooked brews.\n\n\"Before Prohibition, there were local breweries all over the place. That trend is coming back and restaurants are realizing, 'Hey, we can brew our own beer, too. We don't have to serve the same thing as everybody else,' \" Garrahan says. \"For people who think there are too many brewpubs, just about every other restaurant in [the state] is serving the same beer. There's only a few of us serving something different. I don't think we're over-saturated. It's way under-saturated.\"\n\nOpening a brewery 'extremely painstaking'\n\nIf you're a beer drinker or even a home brewer, Blue Earl's Ron Price warns that opening a brewery is a massive undertaking.\n\nA home brewer himself dating back 20 years to when Dogfish first arrived on the scene, Price began his brewing career in his garage.\n\nHe now hosts beer-lovers and live music fans in his tap room at the 11,535-square-foot facility, which has been pumping out IPAs, saisons and stouts for two months now.\n\nEven as the time nears when his beer will be available in local restaurants and in stores – the end of summer and fall, respectively –the excitement is tempered by the tough journey it took to get to this point.\n\nPrice warns that the process is not for the faint of heart. You have to juggle business plans, investors, bank loans and construction, along with an unholy trinity of city, state and federal officials who are all making sure the operation is following regulations.\n\n\"I think people should pursue their dreams, but opening a brewery is a daunting task. It's not for a weak-hearted or -minded. It's extremely painstaking,\" he says, nearly sighing at the memories. \"It takes every bit of your blood, sweat and tears to do it.\"\n\nIf you're wondering just how mainstream craft beer is in Delaware, all you have to do is follow around Calagione, Delaware's own King of Beers.\n\nThe man who began his pioneering craft beer dynasty in Delaware is the nearest thing we have to a rock star.\n\nCalagione isn't only recognized by fawning beer buffs at beer events or when visiting bars – he's recognized just about everywhere.\n\nHis visits to the Apple store at the Christiana Mall can especially morph from shopping trip to meet-and greet. It's that excitement for craft beer that has fueled not only the industry as a whole, but his own company. Dogfish, he says, is on pace for double-digit growth for the 17th year in a row.\n\n\"There's a lot of overlap in the demographics of computer nerds and beer geeks,\" Calagione says. \"When I go into the Apple store, I can predict there will be beer lovers there who are going to want to high-five and selfie it out.\"\n\n-- Ryan Cormier, The News Journal.

Delaware State Police, which is investigating the shooting, said Robinson ran there after being confronted by Dewey Beach police.\n\nAccording to state police, shortly after 1:15 a.m., employees of The Starboard, located at Saulsbury Street and Route 1, told Dewey Beach police officers that Robinson had left the bar with a gun.\n\nPolice tried to stop him but he ran, according to Delaware State Police. Dewey Beach officers chased him for about three blocks before losing sight of him.\n\nBACKGROUND:Man, 21, killed in shooting involving Dewey Beach officer early Saturday\n\nAbout an hour later, another Starboard employee called 911, saying Robinson had returned to the bar and was in a restricted, employee-only area. The bar had closed by that time and only employees were left, state police said.\n\nTwo Dewey Beach officers who responded found Robinson in the bar's outdoor tent. When they tried to talk to him, state police said Robinson again ran.\n\nOfficers chased him to a nearby alley, where a Dewey Beach officer who has been on the force for 1½ years fired a single shot. Delaware State Police have not given an explanation why, saying \"the details surrounding the shooting incident are still in the early stages.\"\n\nPolice are typically trained to shoot multiple times.\n\nREAD:Violence reduction, neighborhood aid initiative to target Claymont's Knollwood community\n\nAfter the shooting, Robinson ran from the alley, state police said. Additional Dewey Beach officers who responded the scene found him unconscious behind a commercial building on Route 1 with a single gunshot wound to the upper torso.\n\nState police said the gun Robinson was reported to have was also found with his body.\n\nThe shooting came during The Starboard Restaurant's \"reopening\" weekend alongside St. Patrick's Day festivities that had been ongoing since Thursday.\n\nBy Saturday afternoon, the area was packed with bar patrons, many of whom gave little thought to the early morning incident.\n\nStill, residents of Saulsbury Street said they weren’t surprised by the violence. They described it as a “rough part of town” where police activity is “not unusual.”\n\nThe shooting was the first police shooting since November. That occurred in Millsboro.\n\nGot a story tip or idea? Send to Isabel Hughes at ihughes@delawareonline.com.

This is the language of love. The less said about bready filler or claw meat, the better.\n\nWhen Chip Hearn told me about Woody's Dewey Beach Bar & Grill and the new Crabcake Factory Bayside in Selbyville, two eateries where owners aren't stingy with the shellfish, I hopped in the car to meet him at the Sussex County restaurants.\n\nHearn, as a hobby, enjoys hunting down lower-profile and off-the-beaten-track eateries and businesses. Last summer, the year-round Dewey resident introduced me, and News Journal readers, to a variety of Sussex places he felt were worthy of notice. (Oh, the lemon pies from Frank & Louie's Italian Specialties in Rehoboth Beach. I'm still thinking about the lobster sandwiches at Fishkiller's Lobster Shack in Dagsboro.)\n\nWe started calling his suggestions \"Chip's Picks.\" We'll occasionally feature more \"Chip's Picks\" throughout the summer.\n\nHearn is well-acquainted with the restaurant business. His family owned and ran the Country Squire in Rehoboth and Starboard in Dewey for almost 20 years. He now operates Peppers, a Lewes hot sauce store and mail-order business, and The Ice Cream Store near the Rehoboth boardwalk, which sells ice cream made by Hockessin's delicious Woodside Farm Creamery. The store is so popular, it's been featured on the Food Network.\n\nThe first thing to know about Woody's Dewey Beach Bar & Grill, 1904 Highway One (Del. 1); is it's not run by Woody. In fact, there is no Woody.\n\nJimmy O'Conor has owned the year-round eatery, popular with locals, since 2009. So, why did he name his restaurant Woody's, rather than his own name?\n\n\"Woody's is a marketable name for a beach restaurant. There's already a Jimmy's across the street,\" he says, gesturing toward Jimmy's Grille and giving a sly smile.\n\nBefore O'Conor came into the picture, the building housing Woody's was once known as more of a bar than a restaurant – and, if you've been around as long as me, you might even recall it was once the home of the wacky Col. Mustard's Last Stand hamburger joint.\n\nThe casual spot, with 35 seats inside and tables for about 25 outside, sits next door to Vavala's Beach Things between New Orleans and Bellevue streets.\n\nSpecials are featured throughout the week – chicken wings are 35 cents each on Tuesdays, and a 12-ounce New York strip steak with garlic mashed potatoes and a salad is $12 on Thursdays.\n\nBut O'Conor, a Maryland native, is dead serious about his crabcakes ($15.50). He uses huge lumps of premium colossal crabmeat and just a whisper of a light, creamy binder that barely holds the lumps together. The cakes are every bit as terrific as Hearn promised.\n\nO'Conor serves the crabcakes on buttery-tasting brioche rolls, or with crackers, or, if you don't want bread, he'll serve them on top of a salad with romaine, onions, Mandarin oranges, raspberries and candied walnuts.\n\nForget trying to get details from O'Conor. He safeguards his culinary secrets like they're a national security risk and won't disclose any classified information. \"I don't tell people where I get our crabmeat or my rolls,\" he says.\n\nWhat he will say is the crabmeat is barely handled – maybe three times at the most – before being gently patted into its baseball-size shape.\n\nO'Conor says he once watched a new employee overhandle the crab – few food sins are as unforgivable as breaking up lumps of crabmeat – and immediately reassigned him to another job.\n\nIn other words, don't mess with the crabcakes.\n\n\"They're always the same,\" says O'Conor, taking obvious pride in his work. \"Consistency is my thing.\"\n\nA convection oven in the kitchen is devoted just to baking the crabcakes and giving them a slightly brown top. Let me repeat. An oven in the kitchen is just for the crabcakes. (See what I mean about O'Conor being dead serious?)\n\n\"It's got to be a certain temperature,\" O'Conor says about the oven. And that temperature would be? He smiles that Mona Lisa smile and, with a little nudging, finally concedes it is 425 degrees.\n\n\"It's the best crabcake ever,\" says frequent diner Marty George, of Bethany Beach. His wife, Chris, sitting at an outside table with him for lunch last week, nods. \"I make really good crabcakes, and his are better than mine,\" she says.\n\n\"We go everywhere. We're foodies,\" says Marty George. \"This is the best crabcake from Ocean City [Maryland] to Lewes. We love it here.\"\n\nAnother dish for crab lovers? Crabby tots. O'Conor deep-fries tater tots, covers them with cheesy crab dip and then tops them with another layer of cheddar, mozzarella and provolone. The melty cheese appetizer ($11) is a perfect nosh with a cold beer.\n\n\"It's gooey, hot and crispy,\" O'Conor says.\n\nCrabcake Factory Bayside delivers a great view along with a great crabcake\n\nThe gorgeous, panoramic view of the Little Assawoman Bay from the dining room and outdoor decks of the new Crabcake Factory Bayside is one reason to visit the new restaurant.\n\nSeafood fans can guess the other one.\n\nThe restaurant at 37314 Lighthouse Road, off Del. 54, west of Fenwick Island, opened Feb. 2. The name might sound familiar to some longtime resort visitors because there are two other Crabcake Factory restaurants in Ocean City, Maryland. The business, with a thriving mail-order business, has had a place on the sand at 120th Street and the beach, serving its legendary jumbo lump crabcakes. Since 1996, they've made more than 1.5 million crabcakes.\n\nBut Crabcake Factory founder Johnny Brooks believes seafood shouldn't be limited to just lunch and dinner. His flagship Ocean City eatery has become well-known for its shellfish-laden breakfast dishes. The same items there can be found at the Selbyville location. Visit the Crabcake Factory Bayside Facebook page.\n\nStart with the Triple Threat Bloody Mary, ($25) actually more of a meal than a drink. The housemade bloody mary blend, with Bloody Mary vodka, comes in a 34-ounce, Old Bay spice-rimmed mug. It's then piled with four slices of applewood bacon, shrimp skewered on sugarcane, at least a ¼ pound of skewered jumbo lump crabmeat, vinegary and spicy green beans and lemon and lime slices.\n\nIf you believe in going big, or going home, check out the \"Legendary Seafood Benedict\" ($32) or eggs Benedict with lump crabmeat, lobster tails, shrimp, grilled Canadian bacon, toasted English muffins and a light, lemony hollandaise sauce. It's large enough for two.\n\nBut, the reason to come back – besides that stunning view – is the star of the restaurant, the 5-ounce jumbo lump crabcake. We got it sans roll ($12.99). Sandwiches with coleslaw and chips or french fries are about $15.99.\n\nHearn says all the hallmarks of a perfect crabcake are here: jumbo lumps that \"aren't squished together\" and almost no filler, an appetizing crabby aroma and a great taste with just a hint of crabby mustard. This is the taste of summer.\n\nYou can order crabcakes online at www.crabcakefactoryusa.com\n\nContact Patricia Talorico at (302) 324-2861 or ptalorico@delawareonline.com.

Sunday will feature only the film and costs $10. Get tickets at everetttheatre.com.\n\nTo help get in the spirit, here's a walk down memory lane.\n\nThe following article was originally published April 4, 2014:\n\nWhen it was time to move from his home in Wilmington's Westover Hills neighborhood, Roger Gordon had more than just a stately house in an exclusive area as selling points.\n\nHe had Hollywood magic.\n\nGordon's home was used for a pair of scenes in the 1989 film \"Dead Poets Society\" – the first major feature film shot entirely in Delaware.\n\nEven though one of the scenes was the heartbreaking suicide of a student, Gordon's Realtor put together a sales brochure leaning on the home's famous past.\n\nIt worked. The house sold five years ago, and Gordon says the connection to the Robin Williams film certainly didn't hurt.\n\nGordon's story is one of many from the army of Delawareans who worked on the film, which is celebrating its 25th anniversary of its release June 9.\n\n\"It was just a wonderful experience,\" says Gordon, 80, who opened his home to the filmmakers for a week of shooting and was not initially told the suicide scene would be shot in his office.\n\nAt Middletown's Everett Theatre, where some of the film was also shot, the anniversary will be celebrated this weekend with a screening and gala on Saturday and a second matinee screening on Sunday.\n\nTo help with the celebration, we have gathered 25 nuggets filled with facts about \"Dead Poets Society\" and its time in The Small Wonder.\n\n1. The 70-person film crew stayed in 70 rooms booked at the old Radisson Hotel on King Street in downtown Wilmington, now home to the DoubleTree Hotel. After filming was complete, some actors complained a bit about being bored in a city with little downtown nightlife. Robin Williams said at the time that \"staying in a hotel room in a town that shuts down at 5 o'clock at night can be boring.\" Co-star Ethan Hawke looked for a silver lining when addressing his time in Wilmington, saying that he'd \"bet there was tons of stuff to do if we had really worked at it.\"\n\n2. During a visit to the old Vincente's Restaurant on Lincoln Street in Wilmington, Robin Williams and comedian David Steinberg dined on toasted ravioli and veal marsala. Before leaving, Williams entertained owner Vincente Mancari's grandson by doing his Popeye impression from his 1980 film.\n\n3. While the Everett Theatre is home to a scene in the film, St. Andrew's School near Middletown was home for the bulk of the film's shooting. Old New Castle also gets plenty of screen time with private homes, Delaware Street and Gunning Bedford Middle School each hosting film crews. Roger Gordon's home in Wilmington's Westover Hills neighborhood was also used, among a few other locations in the state.\n\n4. Before Josh Charles' shocking exit from CBS' \"The Good Wife\" last month in one of the most talked-about television scenes this year, he played Welton Academy student Knox Overstreet in \"Dead Poets.\" The actor was 17 when the film was released.\n\n5. Fun fact: \"Dead Poets Society\" screenwriter Tom Schulman, who won the Academy Award for the \"Dead Poets\" screenplay, went on to write comedies like \"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids\" and \"What About Bob?\" \"Dead Poets\" was his first feature screenplay.\n\n6. The film's Welton Academy in Vermont was fictional, based on a Nashville prep school Schulman attended as a teen.\n\n7. More than 100 schools across the country were considered as the setting of Welton Academy. When \"Poets\" director Peter Weir pulled up to St. Andrew's School for the first time, \"his eyes got as big as saucers,\" producer Steven Haft told The News Journal at the time. \"He turned to me and said, 'This is it.'\"\n\n8. Don't bother trying to find the cave where the Dead Poets Society met. It was a fake made of a latex mold. There's that damn Hollywood magic, again! Here's the twist: The fake cave was modeled after Wolf Cave, a little-known cavern between Creek and Beaver Valley roads near the Pennsylvania state line. The wooded area around the cave was filmed near Newport in Banning Park.\n\n9. Even 25 years later, \"Dead Poets\" can still pop up when you least expect it. In January, Apple released a 90-second TV ad for the iPad Air that features Robin Williams reading Walt Whitman's poem \"O Me! O Life!\" The poem is featured in the film. In the commercial, Williams' \"Dead Poets\" character John Keating comes alive one last time to inspire us again.\n\n10. Remember when Robin Williams was only funny? \"Dead Poets Society\" was one of Williams' first dramatic roles in a feature film, putting him on a path to do \"Awakenings,\" \"The Fisher King,\" \"Being Human\" and \"Good Will Hunting.\"\n\n11. While Robin Williams was nominated for an Academy Award for best actor three times – \"Dead Poets Society,\" \"Good Morning, Vietnam\" and \"The Fisher King\" – his only win came in 1998 for best actor in a supporting role for \"Good Will Hunting.\"\n\n12. A week before being released on June 9, 1989, local actors and extras used in the film were invited to a sneak preview screening held at the long-gone theater in Christiana Mall.\n\n13. Robin Williams routinely clowned around with St. Andrew's students, many of whom doubled as extras. \"He never stops acting. He's always cracking us up, but I don't get a sense of who he is,\" St. Andrew's senior Robb Ellis told The News Journal in December 1988.\n\n14. The waters on the St. Andrew's School campus where \"Poets\" actors were seen rowing in the film is called Noxontown Pond, and it's still used by the private school's boys and girls crew teams.\n\n15. While it's been more than a quarter of a century since the \"Dead Poets\" cast was filming inside the Everett Theatre in Middletown, the theater's historic marquee looks better than ever. How exactly? The 92-year-old marquee was replaced earlier this year with a replica that looks just like the old one – except for the new lights and estimated $50,000 price tag. The rusted, leaky old marquee was specifically replaced in time for this weekend's anniversary events.\n\n16. More than 1,000 Delawareans were used as actors, extras, scouts and crew in the film.\n\n17. The filming of \"Dead Poets Society\" took 10 weeks, and the company spent about $8 million in the state. Filming at St. Andrew's School spanned 40 days.\n\n18. \"Dead Poets\" received a 3½-star review from News Journal critic Gary Mullinax. \"Seeing Delaware on the screen is by no means the only reason to watch 'Dead Poets Society,'\" he wrote. \"This is a first-rate movie and a thoughtful antidote to the flood of big budget, low IQ movies coming out this summer.\"\n\n19. Best known for his comedic ability and ability to improvise, Robin Williams ended up improvising about 15 percent of his dialogue in the film, according to producers.\n\n20. At the time of the film's release, Middletown Mayor Kenneth L. Branner Jr. was upset his town was not selected for a screening. \"We weren't included in anything,\" he huffed.\n\n21. Sure, there are no Delaware references made by any of the characters in the film. But if you wait for the credits, St. Andrew's School, the Delaware Office of Development and the people of New Castle are all thanked.\n\n22. The location manager for \"Dead Poets\" just happened to be Michael Meehan, who was born in Philadelphia and grew up in the Midway area between Lewes and Rehoboth Beach. He has since done location work for a slew of films, including \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest\" and \"The Perfect Storm.\"\n\n23. Film crews received part of their pay in $2 bills. They were encouraged to spend the money in Delaware to illustrate the economic impact of the film on the state.\n\n24. Several paintings by late Delaware illustrator Frank Schoonover, who studied under Howard Pyle, are used in the film. Two of the paintings depict rowing and were already housed at the school.\n\n25. In December 1988, Robin Williams took advantage of an afternoon off and went from making a movie to watching a movie. He went to the theater at Christiana Mall and saw Bill Murray's \"Scrooged.\" He also brought his son there to see \"Land Before Time.\"\n\nContact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.

Night Shyamalan was searching for the best first assistant director in the Philadelphia area.\n\nHe was coming off a film that he shot at the age of 24 and it was a difficult experience. There was chaos on the set and it left him wondering if he was even good enough to make movies.\n\nAnd that's when he found Prices Corner's own John Rusk, who had already been working as an assistant director for 10 years, including on major movies \"A League of Their Own,\" \"Twelve Monkeys,\" \"Outbreak\" and \"The Pelican Brief.\"\n\n\"It was a complete reversal. It taught me that you're as good as your first AD,\" Shyamalan tells The News Journal Thursday from the office of Blinding Edge Pictures, his production company located in the Philadelphia suburbs.\n\nFor Rusk, the experience was equally exhilarating. Not only because he calls it one of the \"most incredible experiences\" he's had in film, but because the movie was shot in nearby Philadelphia.\n\n\"On the first day of production, I was home mowing my lawn afterward,\" says Rusk, 59. \"You still get to live in your house, which is something I had never done before.\"\n\nOver nearly 20 years, the pair has worked on 10 feature films together, nine of which Shyamalan directed, bonding over both a mutual love of intricate preparation and fast food. Rusk was by the side of the Academy Award-nominated director as he shot his surprise hit horror flick \"Split,\" which has been No. 1 at the box office for two weeks straight.\n\n\"Sometimes it is very taxing emotionally to make a movie and to have somebody there as an anchor is the key. And not only to keep the set moving but to support me as I go up and down every single day from, 'This is impossible!' to 'This going to be amazing!',\" adds Shyamalan, who specializes in thrillers that incorporate supernatural elements. (He also specializes in making super-successful films with only one out of 14 losing money over a 25-year span. Together, his films have grossed more than $2.9 billion.)\n\nThroughout Rusk's 30-plus-year career working on Hollywood films, the reserved filmmaker never moved out west in search of Hollywood's glitz and glam. Instead, he stayed where he grew up – right here in Delaware. He still lives off Del. 141 with his wife, Sally, who works as a teacher and on-set tutor for child actors. It's also where they raised their two children, Kimberly, 31, and Matthew, 29.\n\nWhile many projects of his were shot in New York, some took him out to California. And while he did think about moving to Los Angeles, he decided to stick to his roots in The First State. When working on films on the West Coast, he lived a self-described nomadic lifestyle before heading back to Delaware.\n\nIn between his days shooting films like \"Doubt,\" \"Dead Poets Society\" and \"Green Card,\" Rusk has been active in supporting local actors and filmmakers as a founding member of the Delaware Valley Filmmaking Foundation, which offers grants, internships and scholarships.\n\nIt's through that work – and his efforts as a board member of the Pennsylvania Film Industry Association – that Rusk was honored Sunday at the Philadelphia viewing party for the 23rd annual Screen Actors Guild Awards.\n\nRusk was given the Distinguished Service Award and feted by his colleagues in Philadelphia's Screen Actors Guild‐American Federation of Television and Radio Artists union, which represents film workers in Delaware, eastern Pennsylvania and southern New Jersey. He accepted while looking out at a room of 170 people, filled with familiar faces, some of whom he has been working with for more than 20 years.\n\nHis first reaction? \"They got the wrong guy,\" he cracks, before adding, \"No, it was nice. And apparently turnout was a lot more than they expected, so they joked that they are going to give me another award next year.\"\n\nStephen Leshinski, director of SAG-AFTRA Philadelphia Local, says Rusk is only the second person to receive the honor. He was chosen not just for his professional success, but also for his involvement in the local industry through support, training and more.\n\n\"He has gone above and beyond,\" Leshinski says.\n\nMel Gibson's wedding ring gets stuck\n\nMost of Rusk's time on film sets has been as the first assistant director – a job that puts him as the director's right-hand man. He's like an air traffic controller, coordinating all aspects of the production from organizing and keeping to a shooting schedule to preparing storyboards and overseeing the cast and crew.\n\nIt's a key role – one that is out of view for film fans. But that doesn't mean Rusk hasn't had his fair share of screen time, albeit usually one body part at a time.\n\nThat was his wrist under a watch and his foot on the car pedal toward the end of the Eddie Murphy-directed 1989 comedy \"Harlem Nights,\" co-starring Richard Pryor and Redd Foxx.\n\nIt was his hand holding a photo in a shot from 1993's \"The Pelican Brief,\" which starred Julia Roberts and Denzel Washington.\n\nAnd those weren't Mel Gibson's hands for a driving scene in Shyamalan's 2002 film \"Signs\" – they belonged to Rusk, who put on what he believes was Gibson's actual wedding ring for continuity.\n\nA funny thing happened when the scene was over and it was time for him to give the ring back – it wouldn't come off his finger.\n\n\"I remember special effects guys kept coming up to me with different types of lubricant. The more we tried, the more my finger would swell up,\" Rusk says from behind his graying beard. It took two days until crew members were able to get it off.\n\nHis time on movie sets and at rehearsals has found him working directly with the actors and actresses that are household names – stand-outs like Gibson, Washington, Roberts and Murphy, along with Tom Hanks, Harrison Ford, Oprah Winfrey, Brad Pitt, Madonna, Will Smith, Jeff Bridges and Philip Seymour Hoffman.\n\nEach film project has left him with plenty of behind-the-scenes stories – observations that any film fan would eat up.\n\n• On \"Dead Poets Society,\" he remembers being at St. Andrew's School in Middletown on New Year's Eve for a shoot, which included hundreds of Delaware teenagers, who played students at the fictional Welton Academy. Robin Williams came down to greet the kids after they waited for hours to shoot their scene, watching NFL divisional playoff games on a television to kill time.\n\n\"He did a little stand-up routine and then they put the sound down on the TV and he did the play-by-play,\" Rusk remembers. \"He was an incredible force.\"\n\n• While shooting close-ups of Murphy on \"Harlem Nights,\" Murphy would also perform the off-camera lines of his co-stars.\n\n\"He would sound just like Richard Pryor or Redd Foxx. I told him, 'You should do a movie where you play all the characters.' He later did something very similar to that, although I can't say I'm the only person who came up with that idea. But it was very entertaining,\" Rusk says, referring to \"The Nutty Professor\" and \"Coming to America.\"\n\n• And on \"Doubt,\" he sat in on rehearsals and watched Streep's process as she worked on her accent for the film. When the rest of the main cast joined her – Hoffman, Amy Adams and Viola Davis – it was just them, Rusk and famed cinematographer Roger Deakins in a room together.\n\n\"It was a crazy experience to be among that kind of talent,\" he says. \"To watch Phil Hoffman and Meryl on the set –- they are just incredibly dynamic people.\"\n\n'Dead Poets Society' wrong turns get Rusk his big break\n\nRusk moved to the Wilmington area with his parents around the age of 6. With a film fan as a mother, he would stay up late with her watching movies, \"amazed that she knew the name of every actor and every movie.\"\n\nIt wasn't until his senior year at Concord High School that he began to dabble in film production before deciding on the University of Delaware for college.\n\nEven though UD didn't have a film program, he found his way via a custom-made inter-departmental major through the art and communication departments with a concentration in film. It was there where he took his first film criticism classes, remembering afternoons watching films in the classroom of professor Gerald Barrett.\n\nBefore graduating in 1979, he started working as a media specialist in the audio/visual department of Delaware Technical Community College before doing the same at UD as an instructional technologist.\n\nHe then entered the Directors Guild of America's Assistant Director Training Program, learning the ropes while working on television shows like the CBS crime drama \"The Equalizer\" and the short-lived ABC medical drama \"Hothouse.\"\n\n\"The analogy I always use is that I felt like I was the starting pitcher on a little league team with those first jobs and when I went through that training program, I was the bat boy for the [New York] Yankees,\" he says, adding he was disillusioned with \"The Equalizer\" experience and nearly quit.\n\nHis big break came a few years later when \"Dead Poets Society\" and Williams came to Delaware in late 1988, shooting at locations such as St. Andrew's and the Everett Theatre in Middletown, as well as a home in Wilmington's ritzy Westover Hills neighborhood.\n\nRusk, 31 at the time, read in The News Journal that the film was coming to the state. As the only member in the Directors Guild of America in Delaware, he made a call to the production manager, but was turned down because their team had already been hired.\n\n\"And then one day they called me back because everybody was getting lost in Delaware, so I started making maps for them,\" says Rusk, who eventually moved up from additional second assistant director to second assistant director. \"Once I got in, I never left and stayed on for the whole production.\"\n\nHe has since worked on more than 40 feature films as a second or first assistant director and has a co-producer credit on Will Smith's \"After Earth.\" He was also the associate producer of two other Shyamalan films: 2008's \"The Happening\" starring Mark Wahlberg and 2006's \"Lady in the Water\" featuring Paul Giamatti.\n\nIt's that distinguished career that landed him his award Sunday. Wilmington-based actor Lyman Chen, who worked with Rusk on \"The Happening,\" attended the event and cheered for his fellow Delawarean.\n\n\"He's a really nice, hard-working Delaware guy. It's nice seeing a true Delawarean work the way he's been working,\" says Chen, who appears as a waiter in the new Robert De Niro-led film \"The Comedian,\" which lands in theaters nationwide Friday.\n\nFor Rusk, the life of an assistant director means not necessarily knowing which project is next – and that's where he is today.\n\nIn the meantime, he still hopes to direct or write a feature of his own. After all, Hollywood is a place where peoples' dreams sometimes come true.\n\n\"It's always been an aspiration,\" Rusk says. \"It may never happen, but it's a dangling carrot keeping me moving forward in this business.\"\n\nContact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.

It’s part of a larger downward trend in safety ratings across the state’s hospitals in recent years, with only St. Francis Hospital in Wilmington having consistently earned C’s.\n\nHowever, the Delaware Healthcare Association, which provided a statement on behalf of all Delaware hospitals, said the latest safety grades were based on “distorted measure data.”\n\nMORE:Did your school district's lunches get an 'F'? It probably did and here's why.\n\nBecause the data came from early in the pandemic, which put a strain on all hospitals in the First State, DHA interim CEO Megan McNamara Williams said the grades were not an accurate reflection of typical patient safety.\n\nInstead, McNamara Williams said, The Leapfrog Group should follow the example of other safety reporting organizations and wait to release judgments on health care until data becomes available that wasn’t severely impacted by COVID-19, as health care quality has since rebounded.\n\nShe pointed to a recent ranking from U.S. News & World Report, in which Delaware placed third in the nation for hospital quality and 12th for overall health care quality.\n\nHEALTH:Nurses say they were never told Medicaid reimbursements went down. Now they want answers\n\n“Delaware hospitals, like hospitals across the nation, are re-doubling our efforts to improve quality now and into the future,” she wrote.\n\nKatie Burggraf Stewart, director of health care ratings at The Leapfrog Group, acknowledged that other hospitals across the country experienced a similar dip in ratings in the spring 2023 report. But at the same time, she said some hospitals’ scores stayed the same or even improved.\n\n“Especially during a pandemic, when our patient safety infrastructure is challenged, it's even more important for consumers and for others and for hospitals themselves to have this information about infections and prevention of injuries and accidents,” Stewart said.\n\nStill, she said it was “promising” that Delaware did not have any hospitals in the D or F categories.\n\nHow do the grades work?\n\nThe grades come from a comparison of scores across five categories: infections, problems with surgery, safety problems, practices to prevent errors, and doctors, nurses and hospital staff. Each of these is then broken down into individual components.\n\nThough the majority of Delaware hospitals fell into the same grading category as 39% of hospitals nationwide, not all of the hospitals’ individual component scores were actually in the middle. Instead, most Delaware hospitals scored above average on certain metrics and below average in others.\n\nINVESTIGATION:From patent to Percocet: How this powerful opioid got its start in Delaware\n\nFor example, TidalHealth Nanticoke has one of the highest rates of surgeons leaving dangerous objects in patients’ bodies nationwide. It also has the lowest rates of patients being injured from falling over and air or gas bubbles in the blood.\n\nThe data used to generate the scorecards comes from a variety of sources, Stewart explained, including public information reported by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Hospitals are also sent a voluntary survey from The Leapfrog Group, though not all choose to complete it.\n\nWhat should you do with the scores?\n\nThe ultimate goal of the Hospital Safety Grade is to allow patients to select the best treatment options for them, Stewart said.\n\nIn larger states, the array of hospital safety scores tends to be more diverse, meaning prospective patients can easily find higher-ranking hospitals. But in Delaware, where all except one hospital received the same score, how does one make an informed decision?\n\nStewart said it can be helpful to look at the individual breakdowns of the score and to see how a hospital did in areas that are relevant to the services that one wants to get. Other important indicators are hand washing and measures to prevent infections.\n\nADDICTION:A record 447 Delawareans died of overdoses. What we learned about them, their deaths.\n\nIn the case of an emergency, Stewart said that going to the closest hospital is still the best option.\n\nIf a hospital does not have a grade on The Leapfrog Group’s website — typically because there isn’t enough available data — Stewart encouraged patients to raise safety questions to their providers and advocate for transparency.\n\n“We need to have a more resilient (patient safety) infrastructure,” Stewart said. “We have seen some progress recently … but now is really the time to accelerate that progress.”\n\nThe latest Hospital Safety Grade reports are available online at hospitalsafetygrade.org.\n\nSend story tips or ideas to Hannah Edelman at hedelman@delawareonline.com.

According to the report, 34% of hospitals were graded “A,” 24% were “B's,” 35% were “C's,” 7% were “D's,” and less than 1% were “F's.”\n\nThe findings don't fall far from results in fall 2019, when 33% of hospitals received an \"A,\" 25% got \"B's\" and 34% got \"C's.\" This fall's results are based on 2019 data and fall 2019 results were based on 2018 data.\n\nMaine, Idaho, Delaware, Massachusetts and Oregon had the highest percentages of “A” hospitals in the fall 2020 report. There were no “A” hospitals in Alaska, South Dakota and North Dakota, similar to the fall 2019 report.\n\nThough results from the two reports seem similar, Binder said hospitals have improved on an individual level. In the past five years, she estimated, hospitals have seen up to a 30% improvement in hospital-acquired infections.\n\n\"We see hospitals all the time who are a B, and then six months later, they’re an A,\" she said.\n\nThe Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade methodology has been peer-reviewed and published in the Journal of Patient Safety. An expert panel selected 27 measures of patient safety and placed them into one of two domains: Process/Structural Measures and Outcome Measures.\n\nProcess measures represent how often a hospital gives patients recommended treatment for a given medical condition or procedure, and structural measures represent the environment in which patients receive care. Outcome measures represent what happens to a patient while receiving care.\n\nTaking a moment to remember:Comprehending the 300,000 people killed by coronavirus in America\n\n'Nothing too surprising there':Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine ingredients are pretty standard, experts say\n\nGrades can be found at hospitalsafetygrade.org. Patients can search for their hospital by name, city, state or ZIP code.\n\nHospitals that do not appear on the website were not graded because they were missing more than six process measures or more than five outcome measures. The report doesn’t include military or VA hospitals, critical care access hospitals, specialty hospitals, children’s hospitals or outpatient surgery centers.\n\nThe Leapfrog Group has begun to collect hospital data from 2020, Binder said, but it's too soon to tell what the experts will find. She's confident hospitals that maintained patient safety as a top priority will have an impact on the pandemic.\n\n\"When you have that kind of culture, you’re better prepared for a pandemic because you have a hospital (that's) ready,\" she said. \"I hope that as a result we’re going to see even greater improvements that might have occurred during the pandemic.\n\n\"We'll know in six months.\"\n\nFollow Adrianna Rodriguez on Twitter: @AdriannaUSAT.\n\nHealth and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

It's part of a larger initiative to rebuild rail crossings in the state. But due to the funding cycle, Perrine says, the project won't begin until the fall of 2016 at the earliest.\n\nTrain crossings are an acute safety issue in Delaware because of the increased number of oil trains traveling south to the Delaware City refinery, as well as passenger rails that operate at capacity on most days through Delaware's unique chokepoints around Wilmington.\n\nThe factors that likely contributed to the Amtrak crash in Philadelphia are not the most significant rail concerns in Delaware. The safety system known as Positive Train Control, which the National Transportation Safety Board said could have prevented the Philadelphia crash, is installed in the First State, according to an Amtrak report in January.\n\nInstead, it is rail crossings and public awareness of trains that are the primary safety focuses for the First State's transportation agency, said Perrine.\n\nIn 2014, DelDOT, Norfolk Southern, and other parties spent roughly $5.6 million on rebuilding about 40 train crossings, Perrine said.\n\n\"All the refinery crossings have been replaced,\" Perrine said.\n\nIn 2011, 65 percent of rail crossings in Delaware were rated as poor or unserviceable. In December of last year, that number had nearly flipped, Perrine said, as DelDOT gave 59 percent of crossings a positive rating.\n\nBut one-quarter of all crossings are still in insufficient states of repair.\n\nEarle Timpson, assistant director of finance at DelDOT said that, while funding can be a problem, it can also be challenging to negotiate and coordinate with the train companies, such as Amtrak and Norfolk Southern, over when to begin a project.\n\nFor instance, \"we need a flagger from the company to be at the crossing [during construction],\" Timpson said. \"And Amtrak has very specific demands.\"\n\nIn addition to crossings, DelDOT is working with Amtrak to relieve congestion on passenger rails that run parallel to I-95. They are currently building a third track south of Wilmington Station at a total cost of $53 million, according to Amtrak. For its portion, DelDOT has spent $28 million since 2010, said Timpson.\n\nBut even after that project is complete, another two-track section north of the Wilmington Station will remain – and with it, that congestion-causing chokepoint.\n\nAmtrak has considered a plan to add a third track to that section north of the station, and estimated that it would cost $100 million. Craig Schulz, a spokesperson for Amtrak, said in an email that this project \"would only take place in the 2035-2050 time period.\"\n\nWilmington Station is the 11th busiest train station in the country, as measured by the number of boardings and exits, according to Amtrak.\n\nIn contrast, New Castle County is not even among the top-100 counties in the United States, by population.\n\nBob Perrine says that despite the construction projects on rails and crossings, it's all for naught if drivers and pedestrians don't obey signals and crossing gates. He highlighted the area around Main Street in Newark where crossings have been rebuilt but safety is still a top concern. Too many people still cross the tracks while crossing gates are down, he said.\n\n\"If you see a train, it's already too late for a train to stop,\" Perrine said.\n\nContact Karl Baker at kbaker@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2329.

New report from Leapfrog Group released.", "text": "Two years ago, administrators and caregivers at St. Bernard Hospital in Chicago were stunned when they flunked a basic standard for patient safety.\n\n\"It was a real jolt,\" said Charles Holland, the hospital's president and CEO. \"We thought we were doing patient safety and we thought we were doing it well.\"\n\nBut the Leapfrog Group, a nonprofit health care watchdog organization, found the hospital fell short on documenting and having comprehensive approaches to hand-washing, medication safety systems and fall and infection prevention.\n\nThe wake-up call led Holland to hire a Patient Safety and Quality Officer and to use Leapfrog's criteria as a roadmap for improving patient safety.\n\nIt worked. In its latest annual review of hospital safety, released Wednesday, Leapfrog awarded the century-old charity hospital an A.\n\nGovernment watchdog:1 in 4 older Americans on Medicare harmed during hospital stays\n\nThe fact that St. Bernard could turn around so quickly and so effectively without spending a fortune in the process shows that patient safety is an attainable goal, said Leah Binder, Leapfrog's president and CEO.\n\n\"I'm incredibly inspired by St. Bernard's,\" Binder said. \"This is a story of a hospital that has every reason to give excuses and instead gave us extraordinary performance.\"\n\nFor decades, hospitals have paid lip service to patient safety, but the numbers tell a different story. In 1999, an Institute of Medicine report called \"To Err is Human\" found medical errors cause as many as 100,000 deaths per year.\n\nA 2017 study put the figure at over 250,000 a year, making medical errors the nation's third leading cause of death at the time. There are no more recent figures.\n\nBut the pandemic clearly worsened patient safety, with Leapfrog's new assessment showing increases in hospital-acquired infections, including urinary tract and drug-resistant staph infections as well as infections in central lines ‒ tubes inserted into the neck, chest, groin, or arm to rapidly provide fluids, blood or medications. These infections spiked to a 5-year high during the pandemic and remain high.\n\n\"Those are really terrible declines in performance,\" Binder said.\n\nPatient safety: 'I've never ever, ever seen that'\n\nNot all patient safety news is bad. In one study published last year, researchers examined records from 190,000 patients discharged from hospitals nationwide after being treated for a heart attack, heart failure, pneumonia or major surgery. Patients saw far fewer bad events following treatment for those four conditions, as well as for adverse events caused by medications, hospital-acquired infections, and other factors.\n\nIt was the first study of patient safety that left Binder optimistic. \"This was improvement and I've never ever, ever seen that,\" she said.\n\nHEALTH NEWS:Loneliness epidemic facing America in 2023, U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy warns\n\nThe healing power of a good beat:Neurologic music therapy helps kids with brain injuries\n\nBinder attributes the advances to federal reporting requirements that forced hospitals to reveal patient safety metrics, such as how many people were catching infections in hospitals and how many patients were falling out of bed or not being turned enough to avoid pressure sores. Those metrics allowed Leapfrog and others to grade hospitals on their performance.\n\nAs a result, hospital board members started asking their leadership teams, \"why are we are getting a C or a D or an F? How could you not tell us what was happening?\" Binder said. \"That moved patient safety up on the CEO's priority list. Fast.\"\n\nUnfortunately, the pandemic un-did a lot of that progress.\n\nWith the increased demands on staff during the pandemic, compounded by burnout, staffing and supply shortages and high turnover patient safety slipped as a priority, Binder said.\n\n\"Hospitals are supposed to be caring for patients and keeping them safe no matter what, even in an emergency,\" she said. \"That is why we have hospitals, because emergencies happen. We expect them to be able to handle them.\"\n\nAccording to Leapfrog's latest ranking, over 800 hospitals ‒ nearly 30% ‒ received an A, a slight drop since before the pandemic. More than 700 ‒ or 26% ‒ received a B; 1,100 ‒ or just under 40% ‒ received a C, a small uptick; 170 or 6% were given a D; and 12 hospitals, or less than 1%, flunked.\n\nThe state with the most A hospitals is New Jersey, which jumped from No. 6 to No. 1 since the Leapfrog's last review. Delaware, North Dakota and Washington, D.C., are tied at the bottom of the ranking, entirely lacking A-rated hospitals.\n\nOn any given day now, 1 of every 31 hospitalized patients acquires an infection while hospitalized, according to a recent study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This costs health care systems at least $28.4 billion each year and accounts for an additional $12.4 billion from lost productivity and premature deaths.\n\n\"That blew me away,\" said Shaunte Walton, system director of Clinical Epidemiology & Infection Prevention at UCLA Health. Electronic tools can help, but even with them, \"there's work to do to try to operationalize them,\" she said.\n\nThe patient experience also slipped during the pandemic. According to Leapfrog's latest survey, patients reported declines in nurse communication, doctor communication, staff responsiveness, communication about medicine and discharge information.\n\nBoards and leadership teams are \"highly distracted\" right now with workforce shortages, new payment systems, concerns about equity and decarbonization, said Dr. Donald Berwick, president emeritus and senior fellow at the Institute for Healthcare Improvement and former administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.\n\n\"There a long list of things now on the agenda,\" Berwick said. \"Safety, if it hasn't fallen off the list, it's certainly lost rank.\"\n\nWhy these problems keep happening\n\nTo some extent, hospital safety is a no-brainer.\n\nIt's been clear for almost 200 years that dirty hands and medical equipment can transmit infections. Technological advances and training on basic habits can make a difference.\n\n\"We have really good evidence about things that work,\" Binder said. \"What we haven't had is that shove to hospitals to say 'now go do it.'\"\n\nSUMMER SAFETY:As summer approaches, a wake-up call on child drowning deaths. Here's what you should know\n\nHEALTH AND AI:Chatbots are accurate, show more empathy than doctors in answering questions, study finds\n\nPatient care has also become increasingly complex over the past two decades and if nothing had been done about patient safety, \"the number of errors and deaths from errors would be far higher,\" said Dr. Robert Wachter, chairman of the department of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nBut he admits that the field has stagnated over the past decade as other priorities, such as patient satisfaction, caregiver burnout and equity, have competed with patient safety for attention and scarce dollars. \"The agenda has grown and grown.\"\n\nHospitals did the easy stuff first, the \"incredibly, almost flabbergasting errors where we'd do surgery on the wrong patient,\" Wachter said. \"We don't do as many of the really, really bad, 'how could that possibly happen?' things. The errors today are more subtle, but they're actually more difficult to eradicate.\"\n\nChanging a hospital's culture is the hardest part of addressing patient safety, said Dr. Elizabeth Mort, senior vice president for quality and safety at Massachusetts General Hospital, one of the researchers who led a recent study on patient safety at Harvard-affiliated hospitals. Workers have to be encouraged to do the right thing and supported for it.\n\nSerious mistakes are usually the product of systems or basic habits that don't support appropriate behavior.\n\n\"Sometimes it's the simple things that are the best things,\" Mort said.\n\nShe pulled up a sign that was posted next to patients getting infusions, reinforcing the \"5 rights.\" \"Is it the right person, is it the right drug, is it the right dose, is it the right time, is it the right route?\"\n\nSurgical teams should also be pausing for a \"pre-operative timeout\" before they begin, to make sure they have the right patient and right body part identified.\n\n\"Each and every time. There's no excuse not to,\" Mort said.\n\nA culture of openness, awareness and inclusion, where employees feel empowered to raise questions is \"a big part of the solution to safety,\" Berwick added.\n\nHaving electronic systems in place, like bar codes on both patient wristbands and medications, can also help avoid mistakes.\n\nElectronic medical records have made it easier to avoid mistakes like giving a patient a medication they are known to be allergic to ‒ but caregivers are subject to so many alerts they can get \"pop-up fatigue\" and miss important messages, Mort said.\n\nTechnical solutions aren't enough, said Stephanie Mercado, chief executive officer and executive director of the National Association for Healthcare Quality. Health care executives have to invest in training their workforce to move the needle on patient safety.\n\n\"It's the single biggest lever they have to affect change,\" she said.\n\nToday's safety training is highly variable and often absent from workforce development plans, said Mercado, whose organization offers a standardized and specific framework for improving patient safety and quality. About half the 14,000 professionals involved in safety and health care quality don't have funding from their employers for training and have to scramble to self-fund their training programs, she said.\n\nToo many hospital leaders \"view quality as compliance,\" she said, responding to mistakes that are made instead of proactively making improvements to insure safer care.\n\nCaregiver burnout is closely tied to patient safety, Mercado said. \"Burnout occurs in part because the workforce sees the same challenges in health care quality and safety playing out over and over and over again.\"\n\nThe health care payment system doesn't help. Short of a truly egregious error, a hospital gets paid for a procedure whether the \"care was perfect or not,\" Wachter said.\n\n\"No one has figured out yet a system that provides appropriate incentives on either quality or safety,\" he said. \"Most health care organizations want to do the right thing but the kind of investment that has to go into people and processes to really address this adequately is pretty high.\"\n\nPatients can help themselves by coming to the hospital with a list of medications they're taking and any allergies.\n\nIt's also \"fair game\" to ask a caregiver to wash their hands when entering a patient's room, Mort said, and to make sure they are being given the correct medication and that they understand it's effects and possible side effects. \"If something doesn't seem right, speak up,\" she said.\n\nAnd it makes sense for patients to bring someone with them, \"another set of eyes and ears,\" Mort said, because it's hard to pay attention to such things when you're feeling lousy.\n\nBut the burden shouldn't be on the patient to keep themselves safe in a hospital, Mort said. \"It's really our responsibility to implement these systems and do the right training.\"\n\nHospitals can turnaround\n\nWhen Michael Richardson was first hired at St. Bernard as Patient Safety and Quality Officer, he said his focus was to make changes that would show progress quickly.\n\nHe helped establish a committee on safe medication administration, corrected systems issues with digital systems, replaced damaged equipment and began to use existing resources to provide more data on patient safety measures.\n\n\"Straight away we could see a difference,\" Richardson said.\n\nHe also purchased a system from the company BioVigil, providing badges that flash yellow during the first minute a caregiver is in a patient room and then red if they haven't washed their hands.

It's key to note, researchers say, that infection rates before March 2020 were nothing to celebrate.\n\nOn top of that moderately good news, the Leapfrog Group found other metrics that measure patient safety and satisfaction have fallen significantly, likely because of hospital staffing shortages and other pandemic-era challenges.\n\n\"We're encouraged and relieved to see that infections are rapidly decreasing in hospitals following the spike during the pandemic, but we remain very concerned about a number of major problems in hospitals,\" said Leah Binder, president and CEO of Leapfrog, an independent, national nonprofit founded by large employers and other purchasers.\n\nPatient surveys following hospital visits found declines in experiences for the second year in a row in all states. Particularly significant drops were reported in “communication about medicines” and “responsiveness of hospital staff.\" Preventable errors have been linked to these problems.\n\n\"Hospitals need to take a hard look at what they are unnecessarily continuing post-pandemic that are not helping patients,\" Binder said.\n\nInfection rates fell but could still be better\n\n\"Hospital-acquired\" infections are those considered avoidable if staff wash their hands appropriately and follow other infection-control procedures.\n\nCommon hospital-acquired infections include Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, central line-associated bloodstream infections and catheter-associated urinary tract infections.\n\nLeapfrog, which analyzes hospital safety data twice a year, showed that rates of all three reached a five-year high during the pandemic and remained elevated through last year's ranking before getting better.\n\nThe report released Monday, which included data from 3,000 hospitals nationwide, showed:\n\n◾ 19% of hospitals reduced levels of all three infections,\n\n◾ 66% of hospitals reduced instances of at least one infection and\n\n◾ 16% of hospitals had infection rates that continued to rise or made no improvement.\n\nLeapfrog assigns letter grades to hospitals based on their safety records and ranks states according to their percentage of A-rated hospitals. (Ratings for individual hospitals are available on the organization's website.)\n\nUtah topped the list for the first time, with 52% of its hospitals earning an A grade.\n\nThe District of Columbia and four states ‒ Vermont, Wyoming, Delaware and North Dakota ‒ brought up the rear with no A-grade hospitals.\n\nNationwide, nearly 30% of hospitals earned an A grade, 24% earned a B, 39% earned a C, 7% a D, and less than 1% an F.\n\nTypically, for a state to rank well, a few local hospital systems must focus on safety. \"It's not about money or resources or partisanship,\" Binder said. \"It's about do people actually care so much about safety that they put effort into it. It's elbow grease.\"\n\nThat commitment from top executives has been clear in Utah, she said, but not in Vermont. \"I hope Vermonters will talk to their hospital leaders and ask for that commitment.\"\n\nBinder said she's also concerned about New York, which consistently ranks near the bottom nationally. A large percentage of medical and nursing students pass through New York during their training, so it's a particularly key place for patient safety to be a priority, Binder said.\n\nAdventHealth, a nonprofit, faith-based health system that runs 52 hospitals across six states in the Southeast, as well as Texas, Colorado and Wisconsin, has more A-grade hospitals this year than ever before, said Dr. William Scharf, Advent's executive clinical director of quality and safety.\n\nOut of 42 hospitals examined by Leapfrog, Advent earned an A on 31 and infection levels across the chain have now dropped below what they were before the pandemic, he said.\n\n\"This does not happen by accident,\" Scharf said. Just as construction sites often report days since their last accident, Advent hospitals typically report the number of days since their last hospital-acquired infection.\n\nDuring the pandemic, Advent's hospitals started to see an increase in infections, but decided \"not to accept the new normal of COVID,\" he said, instead focusing on \"back to basics and back to baseline.\"\n\nPatient satisfaction slipping fast\n\nLike most hospitals during the pandemic, Advent relied on visiting nurses and saw a lot of turnover due to burnout. They've made an effort since to hire more staff, move away from agency nurses, improve the benefits package and emphasize the company's supportive culture.\n\n\"We recognized that we had to do something different and we had to do something better,\" Scharf said.\n\nResearch has shown that hospitals that had higher quality ratings and more staff before the pandemic slipped less during that stressful time.\n\nIn many hospitals, though, turnover, particularly the departure of experienced nurses, remains very high and compassion fatigue has set in, said Dr. Pablo Moreno Franco, chair of the Department of Critical Care Medicine at Mayo Clinic Florida and a member of Leapfrog's advisory board.\n\n\"Some of the staff that has remained may not have the same level of resilience and tolerance they once had,\" Franco said.\n\nExperienced nurses are often the ones to raise patient safety issues, challenge the system and suggest improvements, he said. Newer nurses, particularly those trained during the pandemic, may not have as much hands-on, front-line experience or know how to communicate as effectively with patients face-to-face, he said, because of the distance and technology that was necessary during the pandemic.\n\nPatients themselves have also changed, he and Binder said. \"A lot of industries have said that people are crabbier, more short-tempered,\" Binder said.\n\nData shows an increase in patient violence toward staff, \"which does not create the conditions for a therapeutic relationship,\" Franco noted. \"We need to be compassionate to them so we can get compassion back.\"\n\nThe expansion of telemedicine and artificial intelligence offers tremendous opportunities for creativity, including options like virtual nurses to provide standardized information to patients, Franco said. However, government and patient safety advocates need to help ensure these advances are implemented carefully so as not to add stress to already maxed-out hospital workers.\n\n\"If we try to bring too much technology too quickly that upsets the staff as well as the patient,\" he said.\n\nStill, Franco said, he remains optimistic that the post-pandemic rebound is just beginning.\n\n\"We do hope that the combination of creativity with precise execution and better use of technology can help us not only get to pre-pandemic levels but get even better by learning from these lessons.\"\n\nContact Karen Weintraub at kweintraub@usatoday.com.\n\nHealth and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

Alaska should have been named rather than Arkansas.\n\nPatients' risk of dying from medical mistakes, deadly infections and safety lapses have gotten much worse at the lowest ranked U.S. hospitals, underscoring Americans' need to check ratings of their local hospitals, new research released Wednesday shows.\n\nThe new analysis is based on data gleaned from about 2,600 U.S. hospitals since 2016. What the findings reveal is that some of the nation's most dangerous medical centers have become even riskier for patients.\n\n\"These are the avoidable deaths – the deaths that are accidental or the result of a mistake made in the hospital,\" said Leah Binder, the CEO of the non-profit Leapfrog Group, which issues grades hospitals based on safety and quality. \"It doesn’t matter how sick you are – the surgeon and operating room team shouldn’t be leaving sponges or surgical tools in you.\"\n\nLeapfrog assigns letter grades - from A to F - to hospitals and is a tougher grader than the federal government, which doesn't issue failing marks. The latest Leapfrog rankings, released Wednesday, give failing or near-failing classifications to 168 hospitals.\n\nAmong the hospitals with failing grades are United Medical Center in Washington, D.C, Hurley Medical Center in Flint, Mich., and St. John's Episcopal Hospital in Far Rockaway, N.Y.\n\nThe American Hospital Association, a trade group, defended its member hospitals, saying that improvements have been made. The group cited recent data that shows hospitals have been doing a better job at preventing infections and other safety problems that patients sometimes get during treatment. It said hospitals are \"making important strides in making care safer.\"\n\nAkin Demehin, AHA's director of quality policy, said Leapfrog's grades may not reflect recent hospital improvement efforts, adding \"not all measures apply to all patients.\"\n\nHospitals that scored poorly also have claimed that the rankings are skewed because they treat sicker patients, whereas higher-graded hospitals have a healthier, more affluent clientele and are therefore less likely to have complications.\n\nBut Leapfrog, which has been grading hospitals since 2012, counters that some of their measurements, such as hospital infections, are risk adjusted to reflect sickness levels of patients.\n\nSome medical errors, such as leaving instruments inside patients, should never happen no matter how sick the patient is, Binder said.\n\n\"Improving their safety record is something any hospital can do and they don’t have to have a lot of money or resources,\" she said. \"They just have to put patients first.\"\n\nAlso Wednesday, the Armstrong Institute for Patient Safety and Quality at Johns Hopkins Medicine released its updated 2016 report on Leapfrog's grades and the increased death risk associated with them. It found some encouraging news: Although about 160,000 people die a year from the avoidable medical errors reflected in the Leapfrog's grades, that's still a drop from the 205,000 avoidable deaths estimated in 2016.\n\nOther grades:\n\n• About a third of the more than 2,600 hospitals graded received an A grade. Forty-one of them - including Brigham and Women's Faulkner Hospital in Boston and OhioHealth Methodist Hospital in Dublin, Ohio - have only gotten A's since Leapfrog started grading in 2012.\n\n• About a quarter of hospitals got a B; 36% earned C's and 6% got a D grade. Patients at C-rated hospitals on average face an 88% greater risk of avoidable death, while those at B-rated hospitals on average face a 35% greater risk of avoidable death, the Armstrong Institute report said.\n\n• The five states with the highest percentages of “A” hospitals were Oregon, Virginia, Maine, Massachusetts and Utah.\n\n• There were no A-rated hospitals in five other states: Wyoming, Alaska, Washington, D.C., Delaware, North Dakota.\n\nHospitals know how to reduce or stop staph infections.

Despite an emergency trip with his wife to an F-rated hospital in California a few years ago, Burrows is now committed to only using A-rated hospitals.\n\n\"If a hospital is rated an F, it's an incredibly good indicator what’s going on at that hospital: what the culture is and what the quality and safety of that hospital is,\" Burrows said. \"You're not going to go out for a D rated steak dinner or a chicken Alfredo rated C.\"\n\n\"Our hearts go out to the Burrows family, and our focus remains on providing the safest care and achieving the best outcomes for our patients,\" Aurora West Allis said in a statement. \"While we applaud efforts to report and measure safety, we recognize that government and industry safety organizations use varying methodologies that don’t always reflect the quality of care provided.\"\n\nMarian Hollingsworth of La Mesa, Calif., became a patient safety advocate after her father died in 2009 at a nursing home. She alleges that he succumbed to a staph infection that led to pneumonia, and that he also suffered from the effects of an anti-psychotic medication given without consent.\n\nLast year, her husband, Ed, got sepsis in a hospital that was rated A by Leapfrog but soon dropped to a B.\n\n\"An A rating is certainly no guarantee that things will go well,\" Hollingsworth said. \"I think having these rating systems definitely helps people get an idea of the quality of their hospital, but they still need to be vigilant while at the hospital.\"\n\nWhile Hollingsworth supports hospital rating systems including Leapfrog's, she says she worries that hospitals “teach to the test” to get a good rating.\n\nLeapfrog, started by employers and unions that wanted more public information about patient safety and quality, factors medical errors, infections and injuries into its grades. The ratings are based in part on patient responses to surveys, data provided to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the American Hospital Association and voluntarily to the nonprofit.\n\nMore than 2,000 hospitals - at least 50% of those eligible - agree to provide the additional voluntary data on medication safety, hand hygiene, intensive care unit physician coverage and cesarean section section rates.\n\nHurley Medical Center spokeswoman Laura Jasso noted that the hospital, which received an F grade, doesn't provide any voluntary information, which she said \"obviously\" affects the grade.\n\nHurley, like United Medical Center, has a one-star rating on CMS' Hospital Compare site.\n\nUnited Medical Center and St. John's Episcopal in Far Rockaway, New York, did not respond to a request seeking comment.\n\nNo matter what a facility is rated, Hollingsworth said consumers \"should not assume hospitals are clean.\"\n\n\"It’s what you can’t see that can kill you,\" she said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2018/04/27/leapfrog-report-fewer-than-one-third-tennessee-hospitals-scored-safety-measures/559177002/", "title": "Leapfrog report: Fewer than one-third of Tennessee hospitals ...", "text": "Just fewer than one-third of Tennessee hospitals got a top score in Leapfrog’s Spring 2018 Hospital Safety Grades.\n\nThe independent group, which calculates the scores using data hospitals already report to national agencies, releases new reports each fall and spring.\n\nOverall, Tennessee ranked 20th in the country — up from 29th in Fall 2017 — in terms of hospital grades.

No East Tennessee hospital received a D grade.\n\nThree Knoxville hospitals got A grades: University of Tennessee Medical Center and Fort Sanders Regional and Parkwest medical centers, which are both owned by Covenant Health.

Physicians Regional, which Tennova is shifting from an acute-care facility to a specialized center with a standalone emergency department, had MRSA (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus) rates three times the average for U.S. hospitals; North Knoxville Medical Center’s MRSA rates were nearly three times the average, and Turkey Creek’s were double the average.\n\nThe rates of blood infections, usually caused after a central line was inserted, also were higher than hospitals’ average at all three Tennova hospitals — twice the average at North Knoxville and Physicians Regional. Risk for serious breathing problems and dangerous blood clots after surgery were higher than average, along with risk for urinary tract infections. The hospitals scored low for leadership and communication about medications, about discharge and with nurses.\n\nScores can vary year-to-year\n\nLeapfrog does the biannual ratings both to encourage hospitals to improve in certain areas, and to help consumers be aware of what can go wrong and advocate for themselves. The scores, based on Medicare patient data, can vary widely from year to year depending on patient population and other factors.\n\nPhysicians Regional, for instance, scored low in many areas but did better than average at preventing bedsores, patient falls, air or gas bubbles in blood and other risks. Similarly, North Knoxville Medical Center scored higher than average in such safety categories.\n\nAnd Parkwest, which brought its B score from 2017 up to an A, still had a MRSA rate double the average and higher rates of UTIs, bedsores and post-surgery blood clots and serious breathing problems.\n\nLikewise, hospitals that function as trauma centers and/or teaching hospitals could have higher rates of deaths from complications of surgery and infection — in part because some serious patients are transferred there from other hospitals. UT Medical Center, for example, had higher-than-average rates of deaths from post-surgery complications; Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, which also had an A score, had higher-than-average rates of serious breathing problems after surgery.\n\nOverall, however, hospitals that scored higher grades generally had lower instances of safety problems and scored higher in “practices to prevent errors,” such as handwashing, communication and staff cooperation.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/04/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/02/08/veteran-affairs-care-improving-delaware-but-vets-still-face-long-waits/2799783002/", "title": "Veteran Affairs care improving in Delaware, but vets still face long ...", "text": "Veterans still face long waits for medical care in Delaware, but the quality of that care is improving and administrators say more positive changes are on the way.\n\nA new analysis by USA Today provides the most comprehensive picture to date of how 146 VA medical centers compare to other health care facilities on an array of factors, giving an in-depth look at how hospitals like the one in Elsmere are operating.\n\nVincent Kane, director of the Wilmington Veterans Affairs Medical Center, said the data has been driving changes in Delaware for some time now.\n\n“We have work to do,\" he said. \"I’m not going to sugar coat that.\"\n\n“Wilmington is moving in the right direction, but we’re not happy.”\n\nVeterans still suffering from poor VA care despite fixes touted in Washington\n\nThe USA TODAY report is based on scores of spreadsheets the VA has posted online in recent years containing comparisons of its medical centers to non-VA averages on everything from the ER wait times to infection rates and patient-survey results.\n\nIt adds to evidence of uneven quality within the VA system and comes as the Trump administration is considering sweeping new rules to widen veterans’ access to outside health care paid for by the VA.\n\nEven so, some of the findings are positive.\n\nDeath rates, bedsores, ER wait times: Where VA hospitals lag or lead\n\nFor example, as of June 30, a majority of VA hospitals, including Wilmington's, reported lower death rates than other facilities. Wilmington and other VA medical centers also stacked up better on prevention of post-surgical complications such as blood clots.\n\nAt the same time, dozens had higher rates of preventable infections and severe bed sores – a sign of potential neglect. And nearly every VA performed worse than other medical providers on industry-standard patient satisfaction surveys.\n\nVA spokesman Curt Cashour said certain veterans may have conditions that make them more susceptible to complications, and “caution should be exercised” when drawing conclusions from the comparisons.\n\nHe said the VA “does recognize the need to improve the speed by which it can admit veterans to the inpatient unit,” but he said non-VA hospitals also struggle with long waits.\n\nHow the Wilmington VA stacks up\n\nHow long did vets wait for care?\n\nAt roughly 70 percent of VA hospitals, the median time between arrival in the emergency room and admission was longer than at other hospitals, in some cases by hours, according to the USA TODAY analysis.\n\nAt the Wilmington VA hospital, it's 272 minutes or roughly 4.5 hours. The national median is 257 minutes.\n\nKane says he's working to provide faster care.\n\n“We’re a small community hospital,\" Kane said Thursday. \"We’ve seen an increase in the complexity of needs.”\n\nWith only 16 acute beds, the medical center doesn't always have room, Kane admitted, which can lead to long waits in the ER while staff work to transfer patients to hospitals such as St. Vincent's and Christiana.\n\n\"It's not uncommon, particularly this time of the year with flu season, that we're full,\" he said. “Much of those delays are actually related to waiting for the transfers once we’ve decided to admit.\n\nBut the VA is also trying to open its clinics on some nights and weekends, so local veterans can see a doctor without going to the ER. It has expanded its clinic in Georgetown and is looking at expanding services in Dover.\n\nThat could also solve another problem at the Wilmington VA — less than 55 percent of patients get appointments as soon as they need them and less than 23 percent have been able to access care on the weekends, at night or during the holidays, the data says.\n\nVeterans have been wanting more access to urgent care, Kane said, which is something the VA hasn't been focused on in the past.\n\nBut it makes a lot of sense to address veterans' medical concerns before they become medical emergencies, and could lessen the burden on the ER.\n\nThe Wilmington VA is also rolling out a virtual primary care center this year, Kane said, where patients can connect to a doctor via a secure internet connection.\n\nDid vets get quality care?\n\nUSA TODAY compiled and analyzed the scorecards from June 30, the most recent available, and found that death rates after heart attack, heart failure and pneumonia were the same or lower than non-VA averages at two-thirds of VA medical centers.\n\nMost VA hospitals also had lower rates than other facilities for a majority of post-surgical complications such as hemorrhages, clots and death.\n\nIn Wilmington, for example, there were no serious blood clots after surgery and the death rate within 30 days of both pneumonia and heart failure were lower than the national average.\n\nBut nearly 50 VA hospitals had higher rates on at least three of four avoidable infections, such as potentially life-threatening intestinal bacteria and bloodstream infections. More than half had higher rates of severe bedsores.\n\nIn Wilmington, though there were no reported antibiotic-resistant staph infections or catheter-associated urinary infections, the rate of potentially life-threatening intestinal infections, 8.11, was nearly twice as high as the national average of 4.19.\n\nThe bed sore rate was 0.84 per 1,000 patients, more than three times higher than the national average of 0.27.\n\nKane said the medical center is seeing more veterans with complex medical problems, such as diabetes, which can come with skin problems.\n\nHe said the VA is also working on further lowering infection rates.\n\n“We have been extremely vigilant on that, and fortunately we’re seeing reductions,\" he said.\n\nCashour, the VA spokesman, said some key quality measures are not risk-adjusted, and so could appear inflated. He said certain veterans, such as those with spinal cord injuries, are at “much higher risk” of developing bedsores.\n\nBill Finck, former chairman at The Leapfrog Group, a non-profit hospital rating organization, said there should be zero – much like an airline aims to have zero crashes.\n\n“You either give a person an … infection or you don’t, whether or not they’re severely compromised or they’re in there for sniffles and colds,” said Finck, a longtime health care industry executive and Vietnam veteran who gets care at the Philadelphia VA.\n\nHow did vets rate the hospital?\n\nOn patient satisfaction surveys, veterans overall were less likely than non-VA patients to feel medical workers treated them with respect or listened to and respected what they had to say, the USA TODAY analysis found.\n\nThey were also less likely to recommend VA hospitals to others and rated their medical care providers lower.\n\nThe VA scorecards analyzed by USA TODAY feature questions for inpatients and outpatients about their healthcare experiences. Nearly every VA facility – 141 out of 146 – scored below other facilities on a majority of questions surveyed.\n\nIn Wilmington, 74 percent of those surveyed said they would definitely recommend the hospital, which is actually slightly higher than the national average of 73 percent.\n\nHowever, the Delaware facility scored lower than the national average on the following measures:\n\nExplained things/easy to understand\n\nClerks/receptionists courteous and respectful\n\nKnows your medical history\n\nPatient rating of provider\n\nProviders listen carefully\n\nProvider respects what you say\n\nCashour, the VA spokesman, said the outpatient survey results are not adjusted for factors like age that could influence the outcomes. He said older patients on average give higher ratings than younger patients for the same care, and sicker patients give lower ratings than healthy ones.\n\nKane said the Wilmington VA is working on improving its bedside matter. He's also brought on board a new chief of staff, George Tzanis, in October and a new nurse executive in May who are working to promote safety, reliability and consistency at the medical center.\n\nThe Wilmington VA has also hired new palliative care staff, to help improve care and planning for those struggling with chronic illness, and is focusing more on hospice care, for those with serious and terminal illnesses.\n\nIn the past, veterans have come into the hospital because their families could no longer care for them at home or because they were near death, Kane said.\n\nBut the acute unit, built for short stays, is not the best place for that.\n\n“There are opportunities for improvement,\" Kane said. \"Our goal has to be zero harm for our veterans.”\n\nPushing for better care\n\nThe USA TODAY analysis was prompted in part by veterans who could not access necessary medical care in a timely manner, such as a 66-year-old Navy veteran in California who was sent home and told to come back the next morning after shattering her wrist.\n\nReport: Wilmington VA wait times manipulated\n\nVacancies at Wilmington VA worse than reported\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs has been buffeted by crises since 2014 when news reports revealed that patients died awaiting appointments at the Phoenix VA hospital. There were lethal lapses in Oklahoma City, patient safety failures in Memphis, Tennessee, and equipment and sterilization problems in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn Wilmington last year, local veteran Salathiel M. Gaymon Sr. was found dead in his car more than 17 hours after he walked out of the facility after his regular treatment in the hemodialysis unit.\n\nGaymon's death prompted an investigation by the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General, which published a report in September that judged the VA harshly but didn't place blame.\n\nStill, Kane said, the incident prompted a series of changes.\n\nIn response to concerns that no one noticed Gaymon dying in his car, the hospital has better trained its police officers and increased surveillance, Kane said.\n\nClinically, the medical center has put a more robust checkout procedure in place, during which staff check patients' vitals and make sure they're steady on their feet before they leave. They also encourage patients to bring their family to dialysis with them and have alternative care available for veterans afterward.\n\n“We have aggressively worked on improving the quality of how that care is delivered,\" Kane said.\n\nLook up other VA hospitals", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/02/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/12/07/best-hospitals-have-baby-every-state-us-news-world-report/6405851001/", "title": "Best hospitals to have a baby in every state: US News & World Report", "text": "After more than 30 years of evaluating the best health systems in America, U.S. News & World Report hopes to better inform expecting families with its first-ever edition of the “Best Hospitals for Maternity\" report.\n\nOut of the 2,700 hospitals nationwide that offer maternity services, U.S. News said 237 made the list.\n\nBut while health experts appreciate the focus on maternity care, some say the report provides an incomplete picture.\n\nThe publication evaluated facilities based on five different factors: scheduled early deliveries, C-section rates in low-risk people, newborn complications, rate of exclusive breast milk feeding and option for vaginal births after cesarean.\n\nThe report included services such as the availability of private rooms or suites, childbirth classes or valet parking, although these amenities were not included in the overall performance score.\n\n“All families deserve to be informed on how hospitals perform,” said Ben Harder, managing editor and chief of health analysis at U.S. News & World Report. “Our hope is that this initiative will push hospitals in general – and especially underperforming hospitals – to redouble their efforts to provide the same high quality care.”\n\nThe survey, however, was restricted to uncomplicated pregnancies and did not stratify the data by race or ethnicity, or household income.\n\n“There are many more components to maternal health than what is being measured but we’re grateful when there’s any attention on maternal health,” said Dr. Brenna Hughes, vice chair of obstetrics and quality and division chief of maternal-fetal at Duke University, which was one of the high-performing hospitals in North Carolina.\n\nThe list is also far from comprehensive. U.S. News reached out to every hospital in the country with maternity services but only about 20% responded.\n\nThe publication is working to include more hospitals and data on maternal health for the next report, said Min Hee Seo, a health data scientist at U.S. News.\n\n“Maternity health equity, increase feedback and provide more information to patients and expecting families – that’s something we’re going to put more effort in,” she said. “We’re going to focus on hospitals that are smaller or located in maternity deserts so those hospitals are not penalized by larger populations in the area.”\n\n'Advanced maternal age':Pregnancy risks increase with age but there’s no reason to believe risks ‘jump’ after turning 35, study suggests\n\nOpinion:Tackle maternal health disparities, mortality with data and better care\n\nThe report notably didn’t include information on maternal mortality and morbidity. The Joint Commission and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services is expected to release data on this sometime next year, but experts expect that report also to be lacking because hospitals were not mandated to provide that information.\n\n“Hospitals are in a lot of stress right now, to be honest and fair, and I know that has delayed a lot of quality initiatives,\" said Dr. Elliott K. Main, medical director at the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative and clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Stanford University School of Medicine.\n\nTen states had no high-performing hospitals, despite having at least one facility that participated in the U.S. News survey: Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi, New Mexico, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia.\n\n“Transparency doesn’t come easily to many hospitals, particularly in certain parts of the country and those are the same parts of the country that have very poor outcomes,” Main said.\n\nFor the past five years, California has made obstetrics a priority by demanding transparency from hospitals, he said, and maternity care has improved. The U.S. News report is an important first step to provide such transparency on a national level.\n\n“It’s a long time coming to do these kinds of reports for obstetrics,\" Main said. \"What we’ve learned in California is the more you show light on obstetric outcomes, the quicker they improve.”\n\nFollow Adrianna Rodriguez on Twitter: @AdriannaUSAT.\n\nHealth and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

The series follows chef Carmy Berzatto (Jeremy Allen White) as he runs his family's Chicago-based sandwich shop. \"The Bear\" has won a number of awards since its premiere—including a Best Actor Golden Globe for its star—and was responsible for hundreds of people suddenly responding \"Yes, Chef!\" during work calls.\n\n5.

'Good Omens' season 2 - July 28 on Amazon Prime\n\nAmazon Prime's \"Good Omens\" returns for season two this July. Season one of the series was based on the novel by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett, so fans are eager to see where the plot goes after the conclusion of the book. \"Good Omens\" stars David Tennant and Michael Sheen who play a demon and angel, respectively, and seek to save the world from an oncoming Apocalypse.\n\n7.

Few details are available about the new season, but we know Tom Hiddleston will make his return as the titular character.\n\n9. 'All the Light We Cannot See' - November 2 on Netflix\n\nBased on the bestselling novel, the series \"All the Light We Cannot See\" is one of the year's most anticipated novel adaptations.

The instructions include some basic warnings, including not to speak to anybody about the case or do any independent research.\n\nIt also included some basic instructions about taking notes, the case's flow and jurors' role evaluating the evidence. Afterward, she excused the jurors with instructions to return to begin again at 9 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nOpening statements by the parties are expected then. Prosecutors said their first witness will be an FBI agent responsible for investigating the case.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nJury sworn in for felony gun trial\n\nTwelve jurors and four alternates were sworn in at 4:20 p.m. for Hunter Biden's felony gun case, and opening arguments will begin on Tuesday.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWe have a jury pool, but not quite a jury\n\nThe court has churned its way through dozens of Delawareans and has a pool of 36 potential jurors. Now, both sides will get the opportunity to strike potential jurors without stating a specific reason.\n\nThe government will have six strikes and Hunter Biden's attorneys will have ten. Each side will also each have two strikes for alternate jurors.\n\nThis process should be done rending a jury of 12 and four alternates by the close of business today, meaning opening statements are likely to occur first thing Tuesday.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nJury selection expected to wrap up on Monday\n\nWhat's the timing for the rest of Hunter Biden's trial in Delaware? Jury selection is expected to finish on Monday, which would tee up opening statements to begin on Tuesday.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nCourt takes break\n\nThe court is taking a 45-minute recess before continuing with jury selection.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson and Marina Pitofsky\n\nHunter Biden also faces tax charges\n\nThe president's son isn't only facing federal firearm charges. He also faces nine tax charges in California in another case, in which he's accused of avoiding paying at least $1.4 million.\n\nHe's charged with three felony and six misdemeanor charges tied to the allegations. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhat is Hunter Biden being charged with?\n\nThe president's son faces three firearms felonies.\n\nIn October 2018, Hunter Biden walked into a gun shop north of Wilmington, Delaware, and purchased a revolver. People who purchase firearms are required to fill out a standardized form that asks whether they are an unlawful user or are addicted to controlled substances, narcotics and other listed substances. Biden is accused of answering \"no\" to that question on the form.\n\nBut Biden has been open about his longtime struggles with crack cocaine addiction. He's written about it in his 2021 memoir, \"Beautiful Things,\" and discussed it during a court hearing last year, stating he's been sober since 2019.\n\nBiden faces a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison if convicted, although first-time and non-violent offenders are often given shorter terms.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\n‘You can’t swing a cat without hearing something’\n\nOne potential juror was asked by the judge if he had previously heard about the case.\n\n“I live in Delaware, you can’t swing a cat without hearing something,” he told the judge, though he added that he had only heard about the case on the news but hadn’t researched it.\n\nProsecutors moved to strike the man because he said he had a family member who suffered from addiction and he holds strong feelings about second chances.\n\n“I think after people have been recovering, they need a second chance,” he said. “Everybody needs a second chance.”\n\nHe said he wasn’t sure what time period that second chance should come and that it should be down to the individual. He said this belief would not impair his ability to judge the evidence and he was allowed to remain in the jury pool.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nCan Joe Biden pardon Hunter Biden?\n\nThere's no rule that a president can't pardon a loved one. But if Hunter Biden is convicted on federal charges, it's not likely that his father would use his office to take action.\n\nThe White House last year ruled out President Joe Biden using his presidential authority to pardon his son. The president has given no indication that he planned to pardon Hunter Biden, but that hasn't stopped some critics from suggesting he might.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky and Joey Garrison\n\nCourt making progress selecting jurors\n\nSo far, the court has worked through more than three dozen potential jurors. Twenty-four have been selected to remain in the jury pool.\n\nThe court will continue to interview potential jurors until it has a pool of 36. After that, the parties will be granted what’s known as \"peremptory strikes\" until the pool is whittled to 16.\n\nThat pool will comprise 12 jurors and four alternates that will stand in if any of the 12 must be dismissed mid-trial.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nDrug addiction a common theme in juror interviews\n\nA common theme in the juror interviews so far: Many people have been touched by addiction among family and loved ones.\n\nMultiple people have told the court that someone close to them have struggled with addiction, some becoming emotional in answering the questions and some reporting that they’ve lost someone close to them to addiction.\n\nThat isn’t an automatic disqualifier as most potential jurors have answered that they could remain impartial in evaluating the evidence.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nWill Hunter Biden's daughters be at the trial?\n\nHunter Biden's children were not in attendance at the trial on Monday. Hunter Biden and Melissa Cohen Biden have a 4-year-old son, Beau Biden, and he and his ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, have three adult daughters: Naomi Biden, Finnegan Biden and Maisy Biden.\n\nLunden Roberts, the mother of Hunter Biden's youngest daughter, is expected to provide testimony in the case. It's not clear if she would bring their 5-year-old daughter, Navy Joan Roberts, to the courthouse.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhat happened to Hunter Biden’s plea deal?\n\nJustice Department special counsel David Weiss secured two indictments for gun and tax charges against Hunter Biden after U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika rejected a plea agreement in July that aimed to resolve the investigation.\n\nWeiss, as U.S. attorney in Delaware, had investigated Biden for years. Biden agreed to plead guilty to two misdemeanors for nonpayment of taxes in 2017 and 2018, and to enter a pretrial program on a gun charge.\n\nBiden potentially could have stayed out of jail under the agreement, which congressional Republicans slammed as a sweetheart deal. But Noreika questioned prosecutors and defense lawyers about whether the deal would protect Biden from future charges and the judge refused to “rubber-stamp” the agreement.\n\nThe collapse of the plea deal led to Biden’s indictment on three felony gun charges in Delaware, in a trial that started Monday, and nine tax charges in California, in a trial set for Sept. 5.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nWhich jurors could be selected?\n\nThe court ruled some jurors were qualified after they answered questions about potential hardship in attending the trial, their political work in the past and family members who have suffered addiction.\n\nOthers were quizzed about their local connections and encounters with the Bidens. One potential juror said they worked at the same college as First Lady Jill Biden for a period. He also supported current Superior Court Judge Farris Wharton’s campaign for Delaware Attorney General against Hunter Biden’s brother, Beau, two decades ago. He said those aspects of his life would not challenge his ability to fairly view the evidence in the case and was allowed to remain in the jury pool.\n\n“I’d listen to any testimony with an open mind,” he answered when quizzed about whether he’d be more apt to believe a police officer’s statement if it were in conflict with another person’s.\n\nAnother potential juror was a bartender at Two Stones Pub in New Castle County and said she served a Biden family member there from time to time, but didn’t know him. She was allowed to stay on.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nCourt churns through potential jurors\n\nTwo hours into jury selection, a handful of potential jurors have been dismissed over concerns about their impartiality.\n\nOne was dismissed after expressing his opinions on rights around gun ownership might color his view of the law and evidence. Another noted his father was a police officer for 30 years and his grandfather worked for the FBI. He told the judge he felt he could not be impartial because of this.\n\nOne person told the court she read stories involving Hunter Biden from when his father, Joe Biden, was running for president.\n\n“I don’t know if I can be impartial from previous opinions about things I’ve heard,” the person told the court.\n\nProsecutors pressed her on what that opinion was. “Not a good one, sorry,” she responded and was dismissed.\n\n–Xerxes Wilson\n\nHallie Biden, Lunden Roberts and Kathleen Buhle could testify\n\nProsecutors have said they'll call about a dozen witnesses as they make their case against Hunter Biden during the trial, according to multiple reports.\n\nThose may include Hunter Biden's ex wife, Kathleen Buhle, as well as the mother of his youngest daughter, Lunden Roberts. Hallie Biden, the widow of Beau Biden, is also expected to testify. She and Hunter Biden were in a relationship following Beau Biden's death.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nHow long is the trial expected to last?\n\nHunter Biden's trial on federal gun charges in the family's hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, could last more than two weeks.\n\nFederal prosecutors have said in court filings they will present photos, testimony and messages to show that Hunter Biden was an illegal drug user around the time he bought the gun and failed to disclose that as required on a federal gun purchase form.\n\nProsecutors also said they may use details gleaned from his phone, iCloud account and the infamous laptop that he allegedly abandoned at a repair store, including photos of Hunter Biden smoking crack and texts arranging meetings with illegal drug dealers.\n\n– Reuters\n\nMore:Hunter Biden bursts into public view: Here's how the president's son will play a central role in 2024\n\nMore:What is an addict? Hunter Biden is fighting what that means as gun trial looms\n\nSee the questions lawyers will ask potential Hunter Biden jurors\n\nHere are the 47 questions potential jurors will be asked as Judge Maryellen Noreika looks for twelve impartial Delaware residents to take their seats at Hunter Biden's federal gun trial. The questionnaire gets to the heart of the unusual case involving the president's son, drug addiction and firearms. Among the questions:\n\nDo you believe Robert Hunter Biden is being prosecuted in this case because his father is the President of the United States and a candidate for President?\n\nDo you have any strong negative views about past users of controlled substances, narcotics, or alcohol?\n\nDo you or a close family member have any experience purchasing a firearm (including a handgun, pistol, automatic rifle, hunting rifle, or other)?\n\n−Xerxes Wilson\n\nJudge begins questioning potential jurors\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika began questioning potential jurors in Hunter Biden’s trial on gun charges and explained rules for participating in the case, including not reading media coverage.\n\nShe aims to seat 12 jurors and four alternates.\n\nNoreika is asking potential jurors whether they can impartially review the evidence in the case. Questions include whether potential jurors know anyone involved in the case, along with general inquiries about their thoughts on politics, law enforcement and issues surrounding addiction.\n\nJurors who answer “yes” to one of the screening questions will be further questioned by the judge. Those interviews are occurring now. Out of the first pool of what was scheduled to be 50 potential jurors, only one did not answer \"yes\" to one of the screening questions, meaning this process will likely take a long time.\n\n−Xerxes Wilson\n\nPresident Joe Biden supports Hunter as trial begins\n\nPresident Joe Biden issued a statement Monday supporting his son as Hunter Biden’s federal gun trial begins.\n\n“Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today,” Joe Biden said. “Hunter’s resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us.”\n\nJoe Biden said he wouldn’t comment as president on pending federal cases. But he said he has confidence in his son and respect for him.\n\n“Our family has been through a lot together, and Jill and I are going to continue to be there for Hunter and our family with our love and support,” Joe Biden said.\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nHunter Biden also faces civil trial against his ex-wife over alimony\n\nHunter Biden isn't just facing sweeping legal problems over gun and tax charges. Axios reported last week that – in 2021 – a Washington court found he was in breach of an agreement with his ex-wife Kathleen Buhle. At the time, he owed her over $1.7 million in legal fees, spousal support and other costs from their 2017 divorce.\n\nSince then, Buhle and Biden's legal battle has continued, and her attorneys have argued he still owes her millions.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nHunter Biden’s family stays close for federal trial\n\nHunter Biden’s relatives stayed close for his trial on federal gun charges, with his father, President Biden, remaining in Wilmington on Sunday night for the start of jury selection Monday.\n\nHunter Biden arrived at court holding hands with his wife, Melissa Cohen Biden. His mother Jill and sister Ashley arrived separately. Hunter Biden's past drug use is at the heart of charges he lied on a federal form and to a gun dealer when buying a guy in 2018.\n\nThe two courtroom benches behind Hunter Biden and his defense team, where Jill and Ashley Biden were seated, were filled before the jury was called into the courtroom.\n\nMore:As Trump's trial nears an end, the Bidens prep for a month in legal purgatory\n\nThe family support contrasted slightly with the attendance at another high-profile trial, that of former President Donald Trump in New York. He was convicted Thursday of falsifying business records to cover up his role in a hush money payment to porn actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election.\n\nTrump’s wife Melania, daughter Ivanka and son Barron Trump didn’t attend the six-week trial. His sons Donald Junior and Eric attended occasionally, and daughter Tiffany Trump appeared for closing arguments.\n\n−Bart Jansen and Esteban Parra\n\nHunter Biden trial hunts for jurors without connections to famous family\n\nAs jury selection begins in Hunter Biden’s trial on federal gun charges, one challenge will be finding jurors who don’t have a connection to the first family in the First State.\n\n\"Good luck getting that jury,\" said Dori Jacobson, a Greenville resident who lives not far from President Biden's residence.\n\nHunter Biden’s father, President Joe Biden, has been a ubiquitous presence since serving decades as a senator and then as vice president. Potential jurors won’t be asked about interactions at Pep Boys, worshipping at St. Joseph on the Brandywine or watching his grandchildren’s flag football games, but they will be asked about connections to the family.\n\n\"Are you, any member of your immediate family, or close friends acquaintances with Robert Hunter Biden or any member of his family?\" reads the seventh of 47 questions listed on the jury selection document.\n\n−Ryan Cormier\n\nMore:When everyone's met a Biden in Delaware, how hard will it be to find a jury?\n\nHunter Biden arrives at federal courthouse for trial on gun charges\n\nHunter Biden arrived about 8:10 a.m. Monday for the start of his trial on federal gun charges.\n\nHis sister, Ashley Biden, arrived about 10 minutes earlier.\n\n−Esteban Parra\n\nMore:'Karma' or 'political prosecution?' Voters weigh in on Hunter Biden criminal trials\n\nTrial's key moment: Was Hunter Biden sober on Oct. 12, 2018?\n\nA large part of Hunter Biden’s trial will boil down to a single day in October 2018, when he bought a .38 Special revolver at a Delaware gun store and checked “No” on a federal gun form that asked about drug addiction or drug use.\n\nThe federal drug form asked: “Are you an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance?”\n\n“At issue here is Mr. Biden’s understanding of the question,” his lawyer Abbe Lowell recently wrote the court. “Someone like Mr. Biden, who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict.”\n\nSome drug treatment experts told USA TODAY they wouldn’t consider a patient cured of addiction after 11 days of treatment. But they said a person who had just completed treatment might consider themselves sober.\n\nMore:Hunter Biden trial: Why his gun case hinges on one fateful day when he wasn't using drugs\n\nReporters arrive early for Hunter Biden trial\n\nBy 6:45 am, a dozen reporters had lined up outside the J. Caleb Boggs Federal Building in downtown Wilmington for the start of Hunter Biden’s will go on trial this week on federal gun charges.\n\nJury selection starts today, with court convening at 8:30 a.m. local time.\n\nThree tents for broadcast stations were set up near the court. A heavy police presence is visible, with several police cars parked along North King Street, which runs along one side the building.\n\nA Department of Homeland Security dog walked up and down the line of reporters, sniffing their bags.\n\nBoggs, the building’s late namesake, was a former Republican governor who lost his Senate seat in a 1972 squeaker to Joe Biden.\n\n−Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nJudge: No second gun form at trial\n\nHunter Biden won’t be able to introduce a second federal form during his trial on charges he illegally bought and possessed a gun while addicted to drugs, U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika ruled Sunday.\n\nThe president’s son is charged with lying on the form and lying to the gun dealer about his drug usage when he bought a .38-caliber pistol in 2018 and had it for 11 days.\n\nOn the initial form submitted to federal authorities soon after buying the gun, Biden put an X next to a question asking if he used narcotics or was addicted to them. The second version of the form was submitted to investigators in 2021 with additional information attached that said Biden submitted his vehicle registration when he bought the gun, which apparently wasn’t the case, according to court statements.\n\nBiden’s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, sought to question the gun shop owner about the second form, arguing he apparently filled out the form inaccurately, which is the charge against Biden. But prosecutors argued the second form is “irrelevant” and would confuse jurors. Noreika agreed and barred the form from trial, in one of two rulings Sunday against the defense.\n\n−Xerxes Wilson\n\nMore:These are the people, places that will take center stage in Hunter Biden's trial\n\nJudge bars defense expert on drug addiction from trial\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika barred testimony from one of Hunter Biden’s proposed expert witnesses, who the defense sought to give a perspective about how people suffering drug addiction view themselves.\n\nDefense lawyers sought to have Elie Aoun, an assistant professor of clinical psychiatry, to testify to testify about how people who have participated in rehabilitation programs are sometimes in denial about their addiction and view themselves as no longer addicted when they complete a program.\n\nBut Noreika barred the witness Sunday, in one of two decisions against the dense, by ruling the defense failed to provide prosecutors with a proper explanation about what expert opinions Aoun would offer.\n\nBiden’s defense also sought testimony from Michael Coyer, a forensic toxicologist, to answer questions about items including a white residue on a brown leather gun pouch that tested positive for cocaine years after it was taken into police custody. Noreika ruled that she would hear from Coyer without the jury present before deciding whether to allow him to testify.\n\n−Xerxes Wilson\n\nWho is Hunter Biden?\n\nHunter Biden is President Joe Biden's youngest son. He's facing three firearms felonies in Delaware.\n\nThe first two relate specifically to the form he filled out to purchase a gun in 2018, accusing Biden of lying about this drug use on the form.\n\nThe third charge pertains to Biden's possession of a firearm while he was allegedly an unlawful user or addicted to controlled substances.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nCould Hunter Biden go to prison?\n\nThe charges carry a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison, though Biden is likely to get a shorter sentence if convicted. It is atypical for defendants to get a maximum sentence when they are first-time offenders like Biden.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/06/14/hunter-biden-ex-wife-memoir/7620316001/", "title": "Hunter Biden's ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, details marriage in memoir", "text": "Buhle and Biden met in their 20s while serving in the Jesuit Volunteer Corps.\n\nBuhle described a warm relationship with Joe Biden, but often felt left out in larger family dealings.\n\nBuhle and Biden's daughters broke the news of Biden's affair, with help from the family therapist.\n\nKathleen Buhle's retelling of her marriage, and divorce, with Hunter Biden — the president's son — steers clear of politics in the would-be presidential family to instead focus on personal reflections.\n\n\"The process of writing the book was incredibly cathartic,\" Buhle told \"Good Morning America\" Tuesday, ahead of her book's release.\n\nBuhle married Biden, who has been the target of conservative media for his financial dealings, in 1993, and divorced him in 2017. Though she described her marriage to as Biden as \"special,\" Buhle frequently grappled with not feeling like a \"real Biden\" within the larger family.\n\nHere are the top takeaways from Buhle's new memoir, titled \"If We Break: A Memoir of Marriage, Addiction, and Healing.\"\n\n'Family, family, family':Valerie Biden Owens defends brother 'Joey' and nephew Hunter\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n'Biden blood only'\n\nBuhle described a friendly relationship with Joe Biden, writing that he “introduced me as his daughter everywhere we went” and that the would-be president was the “the sun around which we all revolved,\" according to excerpts published in Guardian.\n\nShe wrote that when they first met, the future president said: “Honey, my boy tells me he loves you, so that means I love you too.

She recalled a memory from early on in their marriage when taking family photos, a relative announced, \"Now, let's do Biden blood only.\"\n\nThe family's Secret Service detail, in particular, was \"one frequent reminder I wasn't a true Biden,\" she wrote.\n\nBefore the senior Biden was inaugurated as vice president in January 2009, she recalled a Secret Service agent sitting her down with a big black binder to explain their family's new detail. He said that Hunter and her three daughters would each have \"two agents with them 24 hours a day,\" while she would have none, according to the memoir.\n\n\"Suddenly I felt embarrassed,\" she wrote. \"Did this mean I was less important than my husband and my kids?\"\n\nBiden family protection:Secret Service protecting 33 in Biden administration and family, down from record 42 under Trump\n\nFamily finances\n\nBiden's finances often take center stage in conservative media coverage, but Buhle said she had little to add to the conversation, writing that she left Biden to deal with their finances alone, according to excerpts of the book in Vanity Fair.\n\n\"It's embarrassing to say that I ceded all financial control to my husband, and kept my head buried in the sand,\" she told ABC in an interview. \"I liked the nice things, and I didn't want to think about the cost at which they were coming.\"\n\nIn the book, she said she began to understand the extent of their financial woes once she initiated their divorce in 2016. She found they had no savings, double mortgage and no equity in their two homes, credit card debt and medical bills.\n\n“The sheer amount of our debt overwhelmed me,\" she wrote. \"We were underwater.”\n\nShe didn't blame Biden for the lack of stability, though, instead pointing the finger at herself for \"willful ignorance\" of their financial standing.\n\nSubstance abuse\n\nBuhle started to notice Biden's substance abuse problem \"spiral from social to problematic\" about eight years into their marriage, according to People's excerpts of the book.\n\nShe recalled one early instance where, while making pancakes, a sleepless Biden came into the kitchen at 10 a.m. to grab a bottle of Jack Daniel's.\n\n\"I don't think he knew what time it was, and he still seemed drunk,\" she wrote. \"He laughed and put the bottle back.\"\n\nShe described a number of stints Biden spent in rehab, including in November 2012 after he showed up drunk to a fundraising event following the reelection of his father and President Barack Obama.\n\nAffair\n\nAfter Biden's brother, Beau, died of brain cancer in May 2015, he began spending much of his time at the home of Beau's widow, Hallie, according to People's excerpts of the book.\n\nMore than a year later, in November 2016, Buhle received \"the kind of call that tightens every parent's chest\" from her middle daughter, Finnegan, who was with their family therapist.\n\nBuhle met with Finnegan and the family therapist, and her oldest daughter, Naomi, was on speakerphone. The two girls asked the family therapist to break news of the affair between her husband and his brother's widow. Biden and Hallie split in 2019.\n\nAfter she was told, all Buhle said was \"Oh my God,\" questioning how the girls found out. They had discovered text messages on Biden's phone between the two, according to the book.\n\n\"I felt a strange vindication,\" Buhle wrote. \"Not only had I not been crazy, but it was so much worse than I could have imagined. I was shocked, but not heartbroken. Heartbreak had already flattened my self-esteem that past year.\"\n\nOpinion:Republicans want to investigate Biden or even impeach him. Is that what 2022 voters want?\n\nReclaiming her name\n\nBuhle wrote that the Biden name was a \"crown and shield,\" and described the difficulty she had giving it up in 2019.\n\n\"Changing my name had been as frightening as anything I'd ever done before,\" she wrote. \"I was no longer a Biden. I'd handed in my crown and shield because I no longer needed them. Maybe I never had.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/06/07/hallie-biden-who-is-john-hopkins-anning-at-hunter-biden-trial/74012587007/", "title": "Who is Hallie Biden's husband John Hopkins Anning from Cincinnati?", "text": "A financial broker from Cincinnati married President Joe Biden's former daughter-in-law over the weekend and found himself Thursday in the middle of the media storm surrounding the trial of Biden's son, Hunter Biden.\n\n“It's not a great way to start to the honeymoon,\" John Hopkins Anning told NBC News Thursday as his new wife, Hallie Biden testified.\n\nPage Six first reported that Anning and Hallie Biden were set to marry this past weekend, something Anning confirmed to NBC News.\n\nAnning, 53, is a financial broker with UBS The Anning Group Financial Services in Sycamore Township, according to an investment adviser public disclosure report from the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nAccording to the SEC report, he has served on the boards of the Cincinnati Parks Foundation and The Christ Hospital.

Dr. Christopher Bullock, seated in the second row behind Hunter Biden's defense table. He calls himself the Bidens’ spiritual adviser and is often garnering attention from the family during the case. “There is a lot of support here for them.”\n\nIt's not an easy place for any family to sit and watch. Some of the testimony is gut-wrenching, including tales of a crack pipe being found by Hunter Biden's ex-wife in their home and stories of his incessant drug use described by an ex-girlfriend.\n\nNevertheless, it's been a full-court press of Biden family members in the front row over the first three days of the trial. That includes first lady Jill Biden, who's shown up each day. Hunter’s half-sister sister Ashley Biden has been a frequent presence, as well as Hunter Biden's wife Melissa and Peter Neal, Hunter’s son-in-law.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nA courtroom packed with so many of the first family is a rarity - and even rarer still is what the case reveals about a first family wrestling with problems. Breaks in the courtroom routine often see the Biden supporters huddling, leaning into each other, massaging shoulders and clasping hands. Many got a hug and a kiss from the other confidants.\n\nAmid testimony of Biden's desperate addiction to drugs and spiraling life and career, Jill Biden could be seen embracing her family pastor. Hunter’s wife Melissa Cohen Biden extended her arms and blew kisses to her friends in courtroom. Jack Ownes, who is married to the president’s sister Valerie, patted Jill Biden’s sister Bonny’s head as he got through to his seat in the front row.\n\nThe second row has been filled with longtime friends and trusted allies including Francis Person, the president's former aide; Kevin Morris, Hunter’s friend and Hollywood lawyer; Anthony Bernal, senior adviser to the first lady; Ricky Mouse, a friend of the president for 57 years; and the Bidens family pastor, the Rev. Bullock.\n\nFrom time to time, some of the Bidens are called to testify for the prosecution under subpoena. Those include Kathleen Buhle, Hunter’s ex-wife wife of 24 years, and the mother of three of his children who took the witness stand on Wednesday.\n\nBuhle testified about discovering a crack pipe in 2015 in the ashtray of a side porch of their home in Washington, D.C., while they were married. He acknowledged smoking crack to her that day.\n\n\"I was worried, scared,\" she said. \"His behavior had changed.\"\n\nBut her biggest fear was her three children discovering the drugs or drug paraphernalia in their father's car.\n\n\"When my daughter would take his car, I would check to make sure there they were not driving with drugs in them,\" she said.\n\nThe first lady was in the courtroom both before and after Buhle's testimony - but was missing during it.\n\nOn Thursday, Hallie Biden, the widow of Hunter’s brother Beau, with whom he was romantically involved, will take the stand as a witness for the prosecution. The prosecution said in its opening remarks that Hunter introduced her to crack.\n\nThe gun saga was set into motion with Hallie throwing Hunter’s gun in a trash can located outside Janssen’s Market, a gourmet grocery store in Greenville. Prosecutors are alleging Hunter lied on the form about his drug use to purchase the handgun. One spectator in the courtroom on Wednesday included a 21-year-old college student who said she’d come by out of curiosity.\n\nA Greenville resident, she said it was surreal that the grocery store is at the center of the firestorm.\n\nAnother witness, Zoe Kestan, Hunter's former yearlong girlfriend testified that he smoked crack every 20 minutes and said she knew about his struggles and attempts to get sober. Yet, when he asked her if she could help him find drugs, she obliged, contacting an acquaintance who procured it for him.\n\nDuring that testimony, Hunter's wife could be seen shaking her head.\n\nThe Bidens' family pastor said he was praying for the family and that if President Biden could be at the trial, he would be. The president is in France to mark D-Day and participate in other engagements. After the day's proceedings in court, the first lady was en route to join her husband in France.\n\n“It’s times like these that we need to stand with the Bidens,\" Bullock said.\n\nDuring a break in the proceedings on Wednesday, Jill Biden, wearing a fuchsia blazer, hung back in her seat with her sister Bonny by her side. Hunter left the defense table and sidled next to them, engaged in an intense chat. But before he stood up to leave with his wife holding his hand, he gave the first lady a hug and a kiss.\n\nSwapna Venugopal Ramaswamy is a White House correspondent for USA TODAY.

This prompted Lowell to introduce a series of text messages seeking to refresh her memory and several objections from prosecutors.\n\nLowell also pressed her on whether she found drugs near the gun. Under questioning, she said she was not certain that what she saw in his car was drugs and couldn’t remember any exact paraphernalia.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nJoe Biden says he wouldn’t pardon his son if he is convicted\n\nPresident Joe Biden said he would not pardon his son Hunter Biden, who is on trial for federal gun charges, according to a wide-ranging exclusive interview with ABC News.\n\nABC anchor David Muir, interviewing President Biden in France for the 80th anniversary of D-Day, asked whether he would accept the outcome of his son’s trial.\n\n“Yes,” the president said.\n\nMuir also asked if he would rule out a pardon for his son.\n\n“Yes,” the president said.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nWhat kind of gun did Hunter Biden buy?\n\nThe gun Hunter Biden purchased and held onto for 11 days in 2018 is a .38 caliber Cold Cobra, known as a 38 special. The revolver is a rimmed, centerfire cartridge designed by Smith & Wesson that can range in price from a couple hundred to a thousand dollars.\n\nThe handgun is known for its accuracy and is often used for small-game hunting, recreational target shooting, and personal defense.

That investigation was launched after Hallie Biden discovered the gun and threw it in a grocery store trash can.\n\nHunter Biden has also said he he was waiting for a replacement phone at a store across the street and went in the gun store.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson and Marina Pitofsky\n\nHunter Biden's lawyer Abbe Lowell begins cross examination of Hallie Biden\n\nProsecutors ended their questioning of Hallie Biden with a text she sent to Hunter Biden in late October 2018.\n\nShe told Hunter Biden that she found a leather pouch with a stem in it inside her home beside her child. She confirmed sending the text. Now Abbe Lowell will begin his cross examination.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nHunter Biden calls Hallie Biden ‘insane’ for trashing gun\n\nHallie Biden described for the jury how Hunter Biden confronted her over getting rid of the revolver 11 days after he bought it.\n\n“Did you take that from me Hallie? Are you insane … ” Hunter Biden said in a text the day after she threw it in a grocery store trash can.\n\n“It’s hard for me to believe anyone is that stupid,” Hunter Biden said in a text. “Do you want me dead?” he asked in a later text.\n\nShe apologized.\n\n“I’m sorry. I just want you to be safe. That was not safe,” Hallie Biden replied in a text.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nHallie Biden discusses Hunter Biden’s incriminating text messages\n\nHallie Biden walked the jury through a series of text messages in the days after Hunter Biden purchased the gun on Oct. 12, 2018.\n\n“Why won’t you answer my calls,” she texts him.\n\nHe replies in a text Oct. 13, stating that he was behind a baseball stadium in Wilmington “waiting on a dealer named Mookie.”\n\nThe next day, she texts him stating that she tried calling him “500 times in the past 24 hours.” He eventually responds: “I was sleeping on a car smoking crack on 4th Street and Rodney.”\n\nThis evidence is important to prosecutors because defense attorneys have sought to argue Hunter Biden was not using drugs during the period in which he purchased the gun.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nHallie Biden trashes Hunter Biden’s gun\n\nAfter finding Hunter Biden’s .38-caliber revolver, Hallie Biden said she panicked and was afraid to touch it.\n\nShe went inside her home and grabbed a gift bag but realized the gun was still visible in the small bag. So she put it inside a leather pouch and then inside the bag, drove to a local grocery store and threw it in an outdoor trash can.\n\n“I realized it was a stupid idea now, but I was just panicking,” Hallie Biden told the jury.\n\nShe didn’t remember exactly how, but Hunter Biden found out about it and told her to return to find the gun.\n\nHallie Biden went back, but the gun was gone. She went inside the store to see if they had removed the trash and eventually filed a police report with the help of one of the employees.\n\n“I was so flustered,” she said.\n\n--Xerxes Wilson\n\nHallie Biden describes her panic finding Hunter Biden’s gun\n\nHallie Biden told jurors she would regularly clean out Hunter Biden’s vehicle to “help him get or stay sober.”\n\n“That was kind of the pattern,” she told the jury.\n\nOn the morning of October 23, 2018, the car was parked beside her home and she searched it and found “some remnants of crack cocaine and paraphernalia.”\n\n“Oh, and the gun, obviously,” she told the jury a moment later.\n\nProsecutors asked her to identify what remnants she found, and she told the jury, “a dusting of powder.” She said the gun was located in the “center console” of the car. “I panicked and wanted to get rid of them,” she said.\n\nShe said she didn’t want him to have it and she didn’t want her kids to find it.\n\n--Xerxes Wilson\n\nHallie Biden describes how Hunter Biden introduced her to crack cocaine\n\nHallie Biden testified that she visited Hunter Biden in California in June 2018, telling the jury Hunter Biden was using crack cocaine at that time.\n\nProdded by prosecutors, she told the jury that by then, she also had begun using crack cocaine and was introduced to it by Hunter Biden.\n\n“It was a terrible experience that I went through, and I am embarrassed, and I am ashamed and I regret that period of my life,” she told the jury.\n\nShe said she stopped using in August 2018.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nHallie Biden testifies about finding pieces of Hunter Biden's crack cocaine, and googling find out what it was\n\nHallie Biden, a potentially star witness, took the stand Thursday and testified that she learned about Hunter's drug use after she found pieces of crack cocaine.\n\n“I found it and I Googled it because I didn’t know what it was,” she told the jury.\n\nHallie Biden told the jury that after the death of her husband Beau, Hunter Biden’s brother, she and the defendant began a relationship in late 2015 or 2016.\n\n“It was gradual,” she told the jury.\n\nShe mentioned his use of alcohol was also an issue and that he frequently used both at the same time.\n\n--Xerxes Wilson\n\nWho is Hallie Biden?\n\nHallie Biden, the widow of the late Beau Biden and Hunter Biden's ex-lover, is expected testify about how she used drugs with the president’s son as part of the prosecution in his federal trial on gun charges.\n\nBeau Biden died of cancer in 2015. Hallie Biden became romantically involved with his brother in 2016 and were still seeing each other in the fall of 2018, when Hunter Biden is charged with lying on a screening form to buy a gun.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden gave the relationship their “full and complete support” in a 2017 statement that said they were “putting their lives together again after such sadness.”\n\nProsecutors have said Hallie Biden, who was granted immunity to testify, will say she saw Hunter Biden use drugs multiple times, and found drugs and paraphernalia in his belongings multiple times. She and her kids would search his \"bags, backpacks, and vehicle in an effort to help him get sober,\" according to court documents.\n\n--Xerxes Wilson and Brittany Horn\n\nHunter Biden texts debated as trial evidence\n\nAbbe Lowell put the court on notice late Wednesday that he wants to introduce into evidence a chart of text messages involving Hallie Biden, the defendant’s sister-in-law and former lover.\n\nProsecutors objected arguing that Lowell’s notice to them was given too late and the evidence is not admissible. The parties have debated the issue for about half an hour.\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika ruled that individual messages will be evaluated on a case by case basis to “refresh (Hallie Biden’s) memory.”\n\n--Xerxes Wilson\n\nA dispute about whether Hunter Biden filled out his addiction screen form correctly\n\nHunter Biden’s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, still had questions Thursday about whether the gun shop that sold the president’s son a resolver in 2018 may have failed to confirm his address.\n\nBut U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika previously rejected Lowell’s attempt to introduce the second version of a federal screening form that Biden filled out when buying the guy. The second version had been altered to show Biden’s vehicle registration.\n\nLowell argued the shop filled out the form incorrectly, which is what Biden is charged with. But Noreika agreed with prosecutors that the second form would only confuse the jury.\n\nThe gun shop employee who watched Biden fill out the form, Gordon Cleveland, remained on the witness stand as the trial resumed Thursday. Prosecutors and defense lawyers are also debating other evidence Lowell wants to introduce.\n\n--Xerxes Wilson\n\nTrump laments the addictions of others when asked about Hunter Biden trial\n\nFormer President Donald Trump told Fox News on Wednesday he is watching Hunter Biden’s federal trial on gun charges, but the chat with Sean Hannity turned to addiction rather than politics or details of criminal law.\n\nBiden is charged with lying on a federal form and to a gun dealer about his drug use when he bought a revolver in 2018. He has acknowledged a crack addiction, but his lawyer argued he was sober when buying the gun and didn’t intend to deceive anyone.\n\n“I had a brother who suffered tremendously from alcoholism and alcohol,” Trump said. “And it was a terrible thing to watch. He was an incredible guy with the best personality. He was the best-looking person you have ever seen. Everything was perfect. But he had an addiction.”\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nWhat happened at Hunter Biden's trial on Wednesday?\n\nFor Trump, the talk turned to alcohol. Trump, whose brother Fred Trump Jr. died of complications from alcoholism, said he’s never taken a drink.\n\nWednesday's testimony focused on Biden's years-long struggle with addiction, airing details about how his loved ones feared for his health and safety over several years of drug abuse.

In October 2018, Hunter Biden walked into a gun shop north of Wilmington, Delaware, and purchased a revolver. People who purchase firearms are required to fill out a standardized form that asks whether they are an unlawful user or are addicted to controlled substances, narcotics and other listed substances. Biden is accused of answering \"no\" to that question on the form.\n\nBut Biden has been open about his longtime struggles with crack cocaine addiction. He's written about it in his 2021 memoir, \"Beautiful Things,\" and discussed it during a court hearing last year, stating he's been sober since 2019.\n\nBiden faces a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison if convicted, although first-time and non-violent offenders are often given shorter terms.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nHow many kids does Hunter Biden have?\n\nHunter Biden has five children.

But its more salacious contents, including explicit photos and videos of Hunter Biden, have continuously stoked the fire of controversy.\n\nJohn Paul Mac Isaac, the owner of The Mac Shop in Wilmington, Delaware, said a man identifying himself as Hunter Biden brought in three liquid-damaged laptops in April 2019.\n\nOne laptop was left behind, and Mac Isaac said at the time he shared the device with Robert Costello, Rudy Giuliani's lawyer who also testified at Trump's hush money trial, because he believed it would make him safer.\n\n– Kinsey Crowley and Xerxes Wilson\n\nFBI agent testimony delves into Hunter Biden messages\n\nAfter playing more than one hour of audio excerpts of Hunter Biden’s 2021 memoir, FBI agent Erika Jensen is now discussing text messages and emails sent to and from Hunter Biden.\n\nJensen told the jury that some of the communications were derived from hard drive backups directly from Apple.

But if Hunter Biden is convicted on federal charges, it's not likely that his father would use his office to take action.\n\nThe White House last year ruled out President Joe Biden using his presidential authority to pardon his son.

Biden agreed to plead guilty to two misdemeanors for nonpayment of taxes in 2017 and 2018, and to enter a pretrial program on a gun charge.\n\nBiden potentially could have stayed out of jail under the agreement, which congressional Republicans slammed as a sweetheart deal. But Noreika questioned prosecutors and defense lawyers about whether the deal would protect Biden from future charges and the judge refused to “rubber-stamp” the agreement.\n\nThe collapse of the plea deal led to Biden’s indictment on three felony gun charges in Delaware, in a trial that started Monday, and nine tax charges in California, in a trial set for Sept. 5.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nHow long is the trial expected to last?\n\nHunter Biden's trial on federal gun charges in the family's hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, could last more than two weeks.\n\nFederal prosecutors have said in court filings they will present photos, testimony and messages to show that Hunter Biden was an illegal drug user around the time he bought the gun and failed to disclose that as required on a federal gun purchase form.\n\nProsecutors also said they may use details gleaned from his phone, iCloud account and the infamous laptop that he allegedly abandoned at a repair store, including photos of Hunter Biden smoking crack and texts arranging meetings with illegal drug dealers.\n\n– Reuters\n\nTrial's key moment: Was Hunter Biden sober on Oct. 12, 2018?\n\nA large part of Hunter Biden’s trial will boil down to a single day in October 2018, when he bought a .38 Special revolver at a Delaware gun store and checked “No” on a federal gun form that asked about drug addiction or drug use.\n\nThe federal drug form asked: “Are you an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance?”\n\n“At issue here is Mr. Biden’s understanding of the question,” his lawyer Abbe Lowell recently wrote the court. “Someone like Mr. Biden, who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict.”\n\nSome drug treatment experts told USA TODAY they wouldn’t consider a patient cured of addiction after 11 days of treatment. But they said a person who had just completed treatment might consider themselves sober.\n\nMore: Hunter Biden trial: Why his gun case hinges on one fateful day when he wasn't using drugs\n\nHallie Biden, Lunden Roberts and Kathleen Buhle could testify\n\nProsecutors have said they'll call about a dozen witnesses as they make their case against Hunter Biden during the trial, according to multiple reports.\n\nThose may include Hunter Biden's ex wife, Kathleen Buhle, as well as the mother of his youngest daughter, Lunden Roberts. Hallie Biden, the widow of Beau Biden, is also expected to testify. She and Hunter Biden were in a relationship following Beau Biden's death.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nHunter Biden’s uncle, James Biden, will be a defense witness\n\nHunter Biden’s uncle, James Biden, will be a defense witness at his nephew’s trial on federal gun charges.\n\nJames Biden, who is President Joe Biden’s brother, has helped his nephew pay for rehabilitation and therapy to deal with his addiction to drugs, according to the defense.\n\nThe appearance threatens to attract more political attention to the trial. House Republicans have investigated Hunter and James Biden to see whether their foreign business deals benefited President Biden.\n\nHunter and James Biden have denied wrongdoing and the White House described the inquiries as baseless. A key witness has been charged with lying to the FBI.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nCould Hunter Biden go to prison?\n\nThe charges carry a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison, though Biden is likely to get a shorter sentence if convicted. It is atypical for defendants to get a maximum sentence when they are first-time offenders like Biden.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nCourt breaks for lunch\n\nProceedings paused for a lunch break and will continue at about 2 p.m. ET.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWho is Kevin Morris?\n\nKevin Morris is an entertainment lawyer and author who provided the president’s son nearly $5 million in loans to help pay his debts and living expenses. He was part of Hunter Biden's entourage present in court Monday.\n\nThree House committees questioned Morris while they investigated Hunter Biden’s finances for possible influence on his father’s presidential administration earlier this year.\n\nMorris told lawmakers he is not a registered lobbyist, he has no ulterior motive, and there is no corruption involved in their relationship.\n\n“He’s my client,” Morris said. “And he’s my very good friend.”\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nJury hears excerpts from Hunter Biden's memoir\n\nHunter Biden isn't taking the stand today, but the jury in Delaware is still hearing his voice. The jury is now listening to a series of excerpts from Hunter Biden’s memoir “Beautiful Things.” Passages from the book are displayed on a large screen in the courtroom as prosecutors play a narration of the book by Hunter Biden.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nWhat did Hunter Biden do?\n\nThe president's son faces three firearms felonies in the case that kicked off on Monday.\n\nIn October 2018, Hunter Biden walked into a gun shop north of Wilmington, Delaware and purchased a revolver. People who purchase firearms are required to fill out a standardized form that asks whether they are an unlawful user or are addicted to controlled substances, narcotics and other listed substances. Biden is accused of answering \"no\" to that question on the form.\n\nBut Biden has been open about his longtime struggles with crack cocaine addiction. He's written about it in his book and discussed it during a court hearing last year, stating he's been sober since 2019.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nFBI agent takes the stand as first witness\n\nProsecutors called their first witness on Tuesday, questioning FBI special agent Erika Jensen. She's expected to discuss the investigation into Hunter Biden, including messages he exchanged in 2018, bank statements and other evidence.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson and Marina Pitofsky\n\nHunter Biden’s cash withdrawals for lack of credit card, not for drugs: defense\n\nProsecutors argued that Hunter Biden routinely withdrew large amounts of case, including $5,000 the day he bought a gun in October 2018.\n\nBut rather than paying for drugs, the president’s son didn’t have a credit card and was paying thousands for drug recovery programs, according to defense lawyer Abbe Lowell.\n\n“He withdrew cash for lots of things, which are the opposite of buying drugs,” Lowell said. Biden spent “thousands and thousands” on recovery and rehab around that time, Lowell said.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nHunter Biden’s defense disputes timing of drug abuse\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers at Hunter Biden’s trial disagreed about when he was using illegal drugs – and whether the timeline affects the gun charges against him.\n\nProsecutors said his drug abuse occurred before, during and after buying the gun in October 2018. Biden is charged with lying on a federal form and to the gun dealer about his drug abuse, which he chronicled in a 2021 memoir.\n\nBut his lawyer, Abbe Lowell, disputed the timing of his drug use. The federal form asked whether a person “is” using drugs rather than “have you ever been,” Lowell said.\n\n“Hunter was not using when he bought the gun,” Lowell said. “When the form wants to ask someone ‘have you ever done something,’ the form knows how to do that.”\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nGun shop cut corners to sell Hunter Biden a gun: defense\n\nThe gun shop that sold Hunter Biden the pistol at issue in his federal trial didn’t receive verification of his address, as they are legally required to do, according to defense lawyer Abbe Lowell.\n\n“A sale is a sale and that was their goal that day,” Lowell said. “You will hear they wanted it done quickly.”\n\nBiden’s defense is arguing he didn’t knowingly lie when he filled out the form in October 2018 denying he used illegal drugs because he had recently completed a rehabilitation program.\n\nLowell argued that the form defined terms such as fugitive, but not portions asking about drug use. He implored jurors to listen to testimony from the gun dealer, to determine whether they knew what the drug-related terms meant.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nProsecutors can’t prove Hunter Biden believed he was addicted: defense\n\nAbbe Lowell, one of Hunter Biden’s defense lawyers, emphatically told jurors that prosecutors can’t prove he knowingly lied on the gun form at the heart of the trial on federal gun charges against the president’s son.\n\nPounding the lectern, Lowell said nobody will dispute that Hunter Biden struggled with drug use.\n\nBut Lowell emphasized that much of the evidence prosecutors outlined deals with episodes well before or after the gun purchase in October 2018. Biden is charged with lying on a federal form, lying to the gun dealer and then possessing the gun for 11 days, all while addicted to unlawful drugs.\n\nLowell noted Hunter Biden had been in rehabilitation in California months before buying the gun. He emphasized that prosecutors can’t prove at the time he bought the gun, that he believed himself to be addicted or an unlawful user of drugs.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nHallie Biden granted immunity to testify about Hunter Biden’s drug use\n\nA prosecutor told jurors that Hallie Biden, the widow of Hunter Biden’s brother, would testify about his drug use and her own, under a grant of immunity.\n\nHallie Biden was married to Beau Biden, who died in 2015. She was then in a relationship with Hunter Biden after Beau Biden's death.\n\nProsecutor Derek Hines said she had become a drug user at the time as well but ceased using months before October 2018, when Hunter Biden purchased the gun at issue in his federal trial. Hallie Biden is the one who threw the gun at issue in the trial into a grocery store trash can.\n\nHines said prosecutors will also call Zoe Kestan, Hunter Biden’s former girlfriend, to discuss his frequent use of crack cocaine. She is also testifying with a grant of immunity.\n\n“The agreement they have requires them to tell the truth noting more nothing less,” he said.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nGun dealer unaware that Hunter Biden used drugs: prosecutor\n\nA prosecutor said the Delaware gun dealer who sold Hunter Biden a .38-caliber revolver in 2018 will testify that he watched the president’s son fill out a from stating he was not an unlawful drug user or addicted to controlled substances.\n\nProsecutor Derek Hines said the dealer, Gordon Cleveland, will testify that he didn’t know Biden used drugs. The defense is expected to argue that Biden considered himself sober at the time he bought the gun, after completing a stint in rehabilitation.\n\n“What Mr. Cleveland didn’t know was that Mr. Biden was an unlawful user and he lied,” Hines said.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nWhat was Hunter Biden’s relationship with his brother's widow?\n\nHallie Biden is the widow of the president’s other son, Beau, and a key witness prosecutors have indicated they plan to call during the trial.\n\nTwo years after Beau died of brain cancer in 2015, she became romantically involved with Hunter, prompting a tabloid media frenzy. The two split in 2019.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nOne juror dropped from Hunter Biden trial\n\nA juror dropped out the day after being selected for Hunter Biden’s federal trial on gun charges because she didn’t have transportation from southern Delaware to the Wilmington courthouse, U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika said Tuesday.\n\nTwelve jurors – six men and six women – had been chosen Monday, along with four women alternates.\n\nNoreika said one of the jurors had been “lost” before the start of opening arguments Tuesday because she begged to be dismissed for living an hour away and not having a car, job or money for parking.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\n‘No one is above the law’: Hunter Biden prosecutor tells jury\n\nThe prosecution in Hunter Biden’s trial on gun charges told the jury Tuesday the reason the president’s son was in the courtroom was because of choices he made.\n\n\"No one is above the law, it doesn’t matter who you are or what your name is,\" special prosecutor Derek Hines told the jury.\n\n\"Each day in courtrooms like this one, defendants from all walks of life are tried because of the choices they make, not the people they are,” Hines added. “Choices they made to break the law. This case is no different.\"\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nWho is Melissa Cohen Biden?\n\nHunter Biden is currently married to Melissa Cohen, a 38-year-old South African filmmaker. Within a week of meeting her in May 2019, he proposed.\n\nThe Biden family was not at the wedding, but he told The New Yorker of his father's support for the marriage.\n\nIn 2019 they welcomed a son together, Beau Biden IV, named after Hunter Biden’s late older brother.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nHow many kids does Hunter Biden have?\n\nHunter Biden has five children. He has three daughters with his ex-wife Kathleen Buhle named Naomi Biden, Finnegan Biden, and Maisy Biden. In 2019, he welcomed a son with his second wife Melissa Cohen, Beau Biden IV., named after his late older brother.\n\nIt was also revealed that he had secretly fathered another daughter with an Arkansas woman named Lunden Roberts in 2018. Her name is Navy Roberts. President Joe Biden first publicly acknowledged his granddaughter in 2023.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nWhy was Hunter Biden discharged from the Navy?\n\nLess than a year after he was commissioned in 2013, Hunter Biden was administratively discharged from the Navy after testing positive for cocaine on a drug test.\n\nOn the presidential debate stage in 2020, former President Donald Trump falsely claimed Hunter Biden was dishonorably discharged from the Navy.\n\n\"Hunter got thrown out of the military,\" Trump said. \"He was thrown out, dishonorably discharged for cocaine use.\"\n\nAn administrative discharge is standard procedure after failing a drug test. It is different from a dishonorable discharge which is usually the result of misconduct.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nWho is Abbe Lowell?\n\nHunter Biden’s main lawyer, Abbe Lowell, has a long history of working with Democrats and Republicans.\n\nLowell represented Ivanka Trump while she was a White House aide, chiming in as an ethics adviser. He also defended Jared Kushner when House members questioned his use of WhatsApp to communicate with foreign leaders.\n\nNow, he is defending Hunter Biden who faces three felony charges related to purchasing a gun in 2018. Biden officially added Lowell to his legal team after a plea deal fell through in July that would have covered tax charges and the gun charges. It was seen at the time as a way to take a more aggressive response to the investigation into him, which have been going on for more than five years.\n\nHe was the chief minority counsel during the impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton.\n\n--Kinsey Crowley\n\nHunter Biden also faces civil trial against his ex-wife over alimony\n\nHunter Biden isn't just facing sweeping legal problems over gun and tax charges. Axios reported last week that – in 2021 – a Washington court found he was in breach of an agreement with his ex-wife Kathleen Buhle. At the time, he owed her over $1.7 million in legal fees, spousal support and other costs from their 2017 divorce.\n\nSince then, Buhle and Biden's legal battle has continued, and her attorneys have argued he still owes her millions.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWho is David Weiss?\n\nJustice Department special counsel David Weiss, who is overseeing the prosecution of Hunter Biden, was appointed the U.S. attorney in Delaware by former President Donald Trump in 2017.\n\nWeiss investigated Biden for years before reaching a plea agreement for the president’s son to admit two tax misdemeanors and enter a pretrial program to potentially erase a drug charge. But U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika refused to rubber stamp because of disputes about whether it would protect Biden from future charges.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland appointed Weiss as special counsel in August to continue his investigation. Weiss secured indictments on gun charges in Delaware, in the trial that started Monday, and on tax charges in California, with that trial set to begin Sept. 5.\n\nWeiss has been criticized by Republicans as going too soft on Biden by reaching a “sweetheart deal” in the plea agreement. Democrats have criticized him for being too hard on Biden by pursuing charges that are rarely enforced.\n\nGarland has defended Weiss as an independent prosecutor following the facts and the law.\n\n--Kinsey Crowley and Bart Jansen\n\nHunter Biden had family's support during jury selection\n\nHunter Biden, the president’s son, enjoyed the support of relatives as the jury selected Monday in his trial on federal gun charges.\n\nThe first lady, Jill Biden, sat in the front row on her birthday, paying rapt attention and taking notes. She had helped raise Hunter Biden after his mother was killed in a car crash when he was young.

James Comer of Kentucky, who heads the Oversight and Accountability Committee; Jim Jordan of Ohio, who heads the Judiciary Committee; and Jason Smith of Missouri, who heads the Ways and Means Committee, wrote to Attorney General Merrick Garland arguing Hunter and James Biden made statements that could implicate the president in influence peddling.\n\n“Our investigation has revealed President Biden knew about, participated in, and benefitted from his family cashing in on the Biden name around the world,” Comer said.\n\nThe Justice Department reviews such recommendations from Congress and decides independently whether to pursue charges.

This prompted prosecutors to object.\n\nAfter the sidebar, Lowell rephrased the question before asking her about discussions with federal investigators.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nZoe Kestan speaks about Hunter Biden drug use in late 2018\n\nZoe Kestan, Hunter Biden’s ex-girlfriend, told a jury that he continued to use drugs through the summer of 2018 while living in California.\n\nKestan walked the jury through a series of episodes during that summer after they have moved to California.

The plan was for Hunter Biden to go to California first and to work on his recovery.\n\n“It seems like the plan had gone out the window,” she said.\n\nShe testified that she arrived to the southern California bungalow he had rented to find drug paraphrenia, alcohol, food and two women that Hunter Biden said would not leave.\n\nProsecutors also presented a photo of Hunter Biden wearing a shirt with a marijuana leaf and the label “addicted” as a play on the Adidas logo.\n\n“I thought that was funny because he didn’t smoke weed,” she said.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nJoe Biden's family tree: An introduction to Delaware's most famous family\n\nThere's no question the Bidens are Delaware's most famous family.\n\nAs Joe Biden prepares to begin his term as the 46th president, his family will be by his side the entire way.

Trey Gowdy says Hunter Biden's trial is unusual\n\nTrey Gowdy, a former Republican lawmaker from South Carolina, told Fox News on Tuesday that both Donald Trump's hush money trial and Hunter Biden's trial would not have come to fruition if not for their stature.\n\nBefore becoming a four-term representative, Gowdy served as a state and federal prosecutor. He told Fox News that he has prosecuted similar gun possession cases, but he added that Hunter Biden's case remains unusual.\n\n\"There are a lot of people who cannot possess firearms,\" he said, rattling off cases he worked on involving defendants with domestic violence restraining orders, fugitives and convicted felons. \"I never once did an unlawful user of controlled substance.\"\n\nHe said he wonders if the trial came about because of Biden's name.\n\n\"I struggle, Neil, that this is really the best use of federal resources. We have a lot of real crime in this country,\" Gowdy said.\n\n– Kinsey Crowley\n\nZoe Kestan testifies about drug use\n\nProsecutors are taking Kestan through her growing connection with Hunter Biden.\n\nKestan has described hotel stays in New York, where she lives, as well as Atlantic City. She said Hunter Biden used crack cocaine during these rendezvous through early 2018.\n\n“I already felt myself really caring for him and starting the discussions about this addiction,” Kestan told the jury.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nWhat is Hunter Biden being charged with?\n\nThe president's son faces three firearms felonies.\n\nIn October 2018, Hunter Biden walked into a gun shop north of Wilmington, Delaware, and purchased a revolver. People who purchase firearms are required to fill out a standardized form that asks whether they are an unlawful user or are addicted to controlled substances, narcotics and other listed substances. Biden is accused of answering \"no\" to that question on the form.\n\nBut Biden has been open about his longtime struggles with crack cocaine addiction. He's written about it in his 2021 memoir, \"Beautiful Things,\" and discussed it during a court hearing last year, stating he's been sober since 2019.\n\nBiden faces a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison if convicted, although first-time and non-violent offenders are often given shorter terms.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nZoe Kestan describes meeting Hunter Biden at gentleman’s club\n\nKestan was working part time in 2017 at a gentleman’s club in New York. She was about the clock out when she was asked to do one more private dance.\n\nKestan and another woman entered the room to find Hunter Biden. She didn't know who he was. The club was getting ready to close and the music was off so Hunter Biden played a Fleet Foxes song on his phone. The room had a balcony and she said Hunter Biden used it to smoke. She said she assumed it was crack cocaine.\n\n“He was incredibly charming and charismatic, and I felt really safe around him,” she said.\n\nHe asked her to return to his hotel. She declined but gave him her number and they’d meet again.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nWho is Zoe Kestan?\n\nZoe Kestan is up next to testify in Hunter Biden's felony gun trial.

She added that she never actually saw Hunter Biden use drugs before concluding her testimony.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nWhy was Hunter Biden discharged from the Navy?\n\nLess than a year after he was commissioned in 2013, Hunter Biden was administratively discharged from the Navy after testing positive for cocaine on a drug test.\n\nOn the presidential debate stage in 2020, former President Donald Trump falsely claimed Hunter Biden was dishonorably discharged from the Navy.\n\n\"Hunter got thrown out of the military,\" Trump said. \"He was thrown out, dishonorably discharged for cocaine use.\"\n\nAn administrative discharge is standard procedure after failing a drug test. It is different from a dishonorable discharge which is usually the result of misconduct.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nHow many kids does Hunter Biden have?\n\nHunter Biden has five children. He has three daughters with his ex-wife Kathleen Buhle named Naomi Biden, Finnegan Biden, and Maisy Biden. In 2019, he welcomed a son with his second wife Melissa Cohen, Beau Biden IV., named after his late older brother.\n\nIt was also revealed that he had secretly fathered another daughter with an Arkansas woman named Lunden Roberts in 2018. Her name is Navy Roberts. President Joe Biden first publicly acknowledged his granddaughter in 2023.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nHunter Biden’s ex-wife describes searching his car for drugs\n\nKathleen Buhle, Hunter Biden’s ex-wife, testified she would search Hunter Biden’s car following their divorce in 2017 out of concerns for their children.\n\n“I would check the car to make sure they were not using the car with drugs in it,” she told the jury.\n\nShe said she continued to do these checks until 2019, following the period in which Hunter Biden purchased the gun in October 2018.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nHunter Biden’s ex-wife testifies about finding his drugs\n\nKathleen Buhle, Hunter Biden’s ex-wife, told the jury in his federal trial on gun charges about the first time she knew he was using drugs. She said she found a pipe in the ashtray on the porch of their home in Washington, D.C., in July 2015. She said she confronted him.\n\n“It was very short,” Buhle said. “He acknowledged smoking crack.”\n\nShe said he had feared he was using drugs since he was discharged from the Navy for testing positive for cocaine.\n\n“I was worried, but I had no proof,” she said. “I was worried, scared.”\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nKathleen Buhle, Hunter Biden’s ex-wife, called to testify\n\nHunter Biden’s ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, was called as the second witness in his federal trial on gun charges, where she is expected to testify about her complaints about his drug use.\n\nThe two were married from 1993 to 2017 and they have three children: Naomi, Finnegan and Maisy. In 2022, Buhle published \"If We Break: A Memoir of Marriage, Addiction, and Healing,\" which details Hunter Biden’s struggles with addiction.\n\nProsecutors have said she will testify that through 2018, she would search his vehicles because she didn’t want her children around drugs. She told investigators she discovered drugs in his vehicles on at least a dozen occasions, according to pretrial filings.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nProsecutor asks whether drug dealers accept credit cards\n\nFBI Special Agent Erika Jensen testified that Hunter Biden bought liquor with check cards, despite his lawyer arguing that he often withdrew large amounts of cash from his account because he had no credit cards.\n\n“Do drug dealers accept credit cards?” prosecutor Derek Hines asked Jensen.\n\n\"Not in my experience,\" Jensen responded.\n\n--Xerxes Wilson\n\nHunter Biden paid bills with check card: FBI\n\nFBI Special Agent Erika Jensen testified that Hunter Biden paid for rehabilitation services and an Airbnb in 2018 with a check card, according to bank statements submitted in his federal trial on gun charges.\n\nProsecutor Derek Hines highlighted the use of a check card after Biden’s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, had argued that Biden withdrew large sums of cash from because he had no credit cards. Prosecutors have suggested Biden could have used the cash to buy drugs.\n\n–Xerxes Wilson\n\nDefense questions Hunter Biden texts implying drug use\n\nFBI Special Agent Erika Jensen acknowledged during questions from defense lawyer Abbe Lowell that the bulk of Hunter Biden’s text messages referring to drug use occurred well before he bought the gun at issue in his federal trial, but two messages stood out.\n\nOne exception was a text to his sister-in-law, Hallie Biden, the week he bought the gun in October 2018 stating he was waiting on a dealer named Mookie. Another text stated he was smoking crack on a car.\n\nUnder Lowell’s questioning, Jensen said she didn’t know if Mookie actually exists and does not know whether Hunter Biden was actually smoking crack on a car at that time.\n\nJensen also testified she did not investigate to what extent Hunter Biden was spending money to help his family members, pay for his children’s tuition and other living expenses.\n\n--Xerxes Wilson\n\nFBI agent cites no evidence in memoir of Hunter Biden drug use in October 2018, month he bought a gun\n\nFBI Special Agent Erika Jensen testified Wednesday she had no recollection of descriptions of drug use in Hunter Biden’s memoir from the same month as he purchased the gun central to the case in October 2018.\n\nDefense lawyer Abbe Lowell noted Jensen provided excerpts that have “granular” descriptions of drug use in 2017 and early 2018. Lowell asked if she would have provided any from the month Biden bought the gun, if they existed.\n\n“It would have been added if they were there, that’s fair,” Jensen said.\n\nLowell has argued Biden didn’t intend to lie on a federal form and to the gun dealer about his drug use because he had just completed a rehabilitation program when he bought the gun. Prosecutors charged Biden with lying on the form and to the deal because of his addiction.\n\n--Xerxes Wilson\n\nCross-examination continues for FBI agent who investigated Hunter Biden\n\nFBI Special Agent Erika Jensen remains on the witness stand Wednesday as Hunter Biden’s defense continues questioning her investigation into the president’s son.\n\nJensen helped the prosecution introduce texts as evidence of Biden’s addiction to unlawful drugs, records of his cash withdrawals from banks and his 2021 memoir that chronicled his drug abuse.\n\nBiden’s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, began questioning Jensen on Tuesday about the fewer texts in October 2018, when Biden bought the gun at issue in the federal trial.\n\nBiden is charged with lying on a federal form aimed at screening out gun buyers who use or are addicted to drugs. But Lowell has argued Biden didn’t intend to mislead on the form because he had recently completed a rehabilitation program when he bought the .38-caliber revolver.\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nJury hears from Hunter Biden despite him not taking witness stand\n\nHunter Biden hasn’t yet taken the witness stand in his trial on federal gun charges, but the jury has already heard from him.\n\nJurors listened Tuesday to a recording of the president’s son as he narrated an unvarnished account of his life as an alcoholic and a drug addict from his 2021 memoir, “Beautiful Things.”\n\n“I’ve bought crack cocaine on the streets of Washington, D.C. and cooked up my own inside a hotel bungalow in Los Angeles,” Biden said. “I’ve been so desperate for a drink that I couldn’t make the one-block walk between a liquor store and my apartment without uncapping the bottle to take a swig.”\n\n−Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nGOP mum about Hunter Biden trial, focused on Trump conviction\n\nAfter a year and a half investigating Hunter Biden's overseas business dealings and struggle with drug addiction, Republicans on Capitol Hill and former President Donald Trump’s campaign have been nearly silent about his felony gun trial that started Monday.\n\nRepublicans told USA TODAY it's no mystery why they haven't addressed the president's son's trial: They're still focused on Trump's historic conviction last week in his New York hush money case.\n\nSen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., told USA TODAY that Trump's 34-count felony conviction on Thursday has angered their base, and they're concentrated on how GOP voters are feeling in the unprecedented moment. Hunter Biden also faces a second tax-related trial later this year.\n\n\"Republicans and independents are so angry about the miscarriage of justice that occurred when former President Donald Trump was found guilty,\" said Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo. \"So, changing the subject from what has them riled up to something about Hunter Biden – nope, doesn't matter, it's immaterial.\"\n\n−Sarah D. Wire, Ken Tran and Riley Beggin\n\nWho is Hunter Biden?\n\nHunter Biden is President Joe Biden's youngest son. He's facing three firearms felonies in Delaware.\n\nThe first two relate specifically to the form he filled out to purchase a gun in 2018, accusing Biden of lying about this drug use on the form.\n\nThe third charge pertains to Biden's possession of a firearm while he was allegedly an unlawful user or addicted to controlled substances.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nWhat happened yesterday in Hunter Biden's trial?\n\nJustice Department special counsel David Weiss’ team began by laying out their case against Hunter Biden and saying “no one is above the law” in opening statements.\n\nDefense lawyers followed later in the morning, alleging that Hunter Biden didn’t knowingly lie when he filled out a form in October 2018 denying he used illegal drugs as he purchased a gun.\n\nProsecutors also called their first witness on Tuesday, questioning FBI special agent Erika Jensen to discuss the investigation into the president's son.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/10/01/fact-check-unproven-claims-hunter-biden-got-3-5-m-russia/3586861001/", "title": "Fact check: Unproven claims that Hunter Biden got $3.5M from Russia", "text": "The claim: Hunter Biden received $3.5 million from the wife of the former mayor of Moscow\n\nDuring their first debate on Sept. 29, President Donald Trump charged that Hunter Biden, the son of rival former Vice President Joe Biden, had received $3.5 million from wife of Moscow's ex-mayor and demanded an investigation.\n\nThe president had raised the issue Sept. 27 in a news conference in which he said the allegations \"are all questions that are very, very big on the internet.\"\n\nThe claim was also posted by a Facebook user on Sept. 26. \"How did Robert Mueller do a 2 yr investigation on Russia and miss a $3.5 million payment to the Biden family?,\" the user wrote, adding \"#askingforafriend.\"\n\nTrump raised the issue of the purported Moscow payment several times during one segment of the first presidential debate, asking at one point, \"What did he do to deserve it?\"\n\nBiden responded each time with a series of denials, saying, \"none of that is true,\" \"my son did nothing wrong,\" and \"that is simply not true.\"\n\nThe claim stems from an 87-page report — \"Hunter Biden, Burisma, and Corruption: The Impact on U.S. Government Policy and Related Concerns\" — by the Republican majority on the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, chaired by Sen.

It does not elaborate.\n\nThe allegation does not provide any additional detail, including whether the alleged transaction was legal.\n\nRosemont Seneca Thornton, LLC, was incorporated in Delaware on May 28, 2013.

Gary Peters, D-Mich., ranking member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., ranking member of the Finance Committee, responded to the report by calling it a \"failed effort\" by the Republicans to \"manufacture dirt\" on Joe Biden.\n\n\"The Republican Chairmen’s use of confidential Treasury documents to justify its unsubstantiated allegations and personal attacks against Vice President Biden’s family is grossly irresponsible,\" the response said. \"The information in the documents cited by the Republicans has not been verified, and we are not aware of any other Congressional committee ever releasing this sort of information in this manner.\n\n\"Any credible investigation would have sought the underlying financial records at issue and spoken to the involved parties,\" they continued. \"At Chairman Johnson’s request, HSGAC authorized 46 subpoenas across four business meetings related to his current investigations, none of which sought information that could substantiate or verify the information in these documents.\"\n\nRegarding the specific Moscow allegation, Alison Green, spokesperson for the minority on the Homeland Security Committee, and Keith Chu, spokesperson for the minority on the Finance Committee, issued a joint statement that said, \"Democratic staff has reviewed all known information on file with the Committees, however, including the confidential document cited by the Republicans, and are aware of no information in the Committees’ possession showing Hunter Biden had any financial interest in this entity or transaction.\"\n\nUSA TODAY asked a spokesperson for the Republican majority for a comment but did not get an immediate response.\n\nHunter Biden's lawyer, George Mesires, told CNN that his client was not an owner of the firm, Rosemont Seneca Thornton.\n\n“Hunter Biden had no interest in and was not a ‘co-founder’ of Rosemont Seneca Thornton, so the claim that he was paid $3.5 million is false,” Mesires told CNN.\n\nUSA TODAY asked the Facebook user who posted the claim for a comment but did not get an immediate reply.\n\nPolitiFact has found the allegation \"unproven.\"\n\nFact check:Joe Biden called troops 'stupid bastards,' but only 'jokingly'\n\nOur ruling: Missing context\n\nThe claim has been denied by Biden's lawyer, who says his client was not a co-founder of the entity purportedly receiving the money.

He spent nine seasons in Philadelphia before going to Arizona.\n\nHe opened his career with three seasons with the Baltimore Orioles before spending one season with the Houston Astros.\n\nSchilling hasn't been afraid to speak publicly about his disdain for the ownership of the Red Sox, and he talked about it again on the Faith On The Field Show.\n\n“The ownership in Boston is comprised of some very, very bad human beings who on my way out of baseball did things to myself and my family that I’ll never forget,” Schilling said on the show. “I forgave them, but I’ll never forget it. Unfortunately, it severely tainted my experience. My experience ending here should have been one of immense joy given what we were able to accomplish in the four or five years I spent here… and it didn’t because of what they did.”\n\nMore:Your take: Curt Schilling's Capitol rioters comments should keep him out of Hall of Fame\n\nMore:Five of Curt Schilling's most controversial political opinions\n\nAfter missing out on the Hall of Fame last season, Schilling first revealed his preference to represent Arizona should he be inducted someday.\n\n\"I’ve chosen Arizona as the team I would have represented if I had been inducted and even though I heard someone there is calling for the DBacks front office to “meet” should the induction happen I’ll stand with that decision as I know Mr Kendrick to be an honorable and kind man,\" Schilling wrote on Facebook. \"Should that change it most certainly would be the Phillies. What Mr Henry and Mr Werner did to my family and I in my final year has been forgiven but will never be forgotten.\"\n\nLast year, Arizona Republic columnist Kent Somers wrote that Schilling being elected to the Hall of Fame could put the Diamondbacks in a tough spot, especially if he were to go in representing Arizona.\n\nHe wrote: \"I suspect the Diamondbacks and Red Sox, his most likely choices, aren’t anxious for Schilling to replace his MAGA hat with theirs. Nor would I think the Diamondbacks would be excited getting the 2001 championship team together for a 20-year reunion this summer, if that is even in the works. Schilling would be a party killer, but how could you invite everyone else and not him? Their worries would be over, at least for a year, if Schilling isn’t elected this year. But I don't like the odds.\"\n\nHe continued: \"For the Diamondbacks, the lurking Schilling decision isn’t just about what is right. Business and politics likely will make it a close call for them. A good percentage of their fans lean conservative politically. A strong statement against Schilling’s view risks alienating some of them. Granted, such a statement isn't likely to come because owner Ken Kendrick and his wife Randy are conservatives, too, and have donated to conservative causes and candidates. But the Diamondbacks can’t afford to embrace Schilling, either, because even more people might decide to spend their entertainment dollars with a business that doesn't endorse intolerance. Patting Schilling on the back will be seen as that by some. The Diamondbacks’ silence seems a tacit acknowledgement that the organization is trying to walk a fine line to avoid offending anyone.\"\n\nMore:Curt Schilling tweets support for U.S. Capitol rioters: 'A confrontation that matters'\n\nThis is Schilling's last season on the ballot for voting done by the writers in the Baseball Writers Association of America.\n\nHe could still get in the Hall in the future if voted in by a group of former players that make up the Veterans' Committee.\n\nIn his Facebook post last season Schilling requested he be removed from Hall of Fame consideration in his final year of eligibility, writing that he would like to later have the chance to be selected by the Veterans' Committee.\n\n\"I wanted to reiterate this final point,\" he wrote. \"I will not participate in the final year of voting.

In a 1-0 Reds victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers at Riverfront Stadium, Browning threw 70 of 102 pitches for strikes and did not run the count to three balls on a single batter.\n\nWant more?\n\nThe first left-hander to pitch a perfect game since Sandy Koufax’s perfect game in 1965, Browning remains the only Reds player to pitch a perfect game. Three months earlier, on June 6, 1988, Browning had a bid for a no-hitter broken-up by Tony Gwynn who singled with one out in the ninth. And he just missed becoming the first pitcher to throw two perfect games, taking another bid into the ninth on July 4, 1989, against the Philadelphia Phillies at Veterans Stadium, a lead-off double by Dickie Thon broke up this attempt.\n\nNow it’s the Reds turn to be perfect. To do the right thing.\n\nBrowning passed − suddenly − on December 19, 2022. It’s time for the Reds to retire Number 32 − Mr. Perfect.\n\nHis 123 wins with the Reds ranked fourth among left-handers when he retired, and remain the most by any Reds pitcher active since 1971; his 298 starts trail only Eppa Rixey among the team’s left-handers. Browning pitched 12 years in the big leagues and might be best known not for the perfect game, but something that didn’t involve pitching at all.\n\nOn July 7, 1993, the Reds were visiting the Cubs at Wrigley Field when Browning decided he wanted to watch the game from a different vantagepoint than the dugout. So, he left the ballpark and went across the street, where he was welcomed atop of the houses on Sheffield Avenue.\n\nHe was later fined $500 by then-Reds manager Davey Johnson.\n\nBut don’t let that Tomfoolery fool you. In 1985 − his rookie season − he was the Reds’ first 20-game winner in 15 years, and equaled the most wins by a Cincinnati left-hander since 1925. He led the National League in games started four of the next five years.\n\nTo date, the New York Yankees have retired more numbers than any other team and started the practice with Lou Gehrig’s No. 4 in 1939.\n\nAs for basketball, well no team in NBA history has more titles than the Boston Celtics − their 17 ties them with the Los Angeles Lakers. So, it makes sense there are no other franchises in the league with more retired numbers to honor the players who earned and hung those banners over the decades. In fact, no team in any sport has more retired jersey numbers than the Celtics with 23 − a reflection of the excellence behind the Celtics mystique built by Hall of Fame coach Arnold (Red) Auerbach.\n\nThe Reds' list is small but impressive: Dave Bristol (1), Johnny Bench (5), Joe Morgan (8), Sparky Anderson (10), Barry Larkin (11), Dave Concepcion (13), Ted Kluszewski (18), Frank Robinson (20) and Tony Perez (24).\n\nIn December 2005, Browning led fan balloting wire-to-wire to become a 2006 Hall of Famer. He has something in common and is in good company with another Reds’ left-hander − Johnny Vander Meer. Vander Meer became the only pitcher in Major League Baseball history to throw two consecutive no-hitters, and was a member of the 1940 World Series champions.\n\nAnd his number hasn’t yet been retired.\n\nJason Vosler wears No. 32 these days for the Reds. The 10-year minor-leaguer opened the season with three homers in his first 15 at-bats. Quite the feat. And he should be applauded.\n\nBut not in Tom Browning’s uniform − sorry.\n\nAndy Furman is a member of the Enquirer Board of Contributors.

The rightful acclaim, sadly, he had to wait much longer.\n\nAllen, a seven-time All-Star slugger whose fight against racism during a tumultuous time with the Phillies in the 1960s cost him on and off the field, died Monday. He was 78.\n\nThe 1964 NL Rookie of Year and 1972 AL MVP had a lengthy illness while at home in Wampum, Pennsylvania.\n\n“Dick will be remembered as not just one of the greatest and most popular players in our franchise’s history, but also as a courageous warrior who had to overcome far too many obstacles to reach the level he did,” the Phillies said in a statement.\n\nFollow every MLB game: Latest MLB scores, stats, schedules and standings.\n\nAllen’s No. 15 was retired by the Phillies in September, an honor that was considered way overdue by many for one of the franchise’s greatest players.\n\nPhillies managing partner John Middleton broke from the team’s longstanding “unwritten” policy of only retiring the number of players who are in the Hall of Fame to honor Allen. In 2014, Allen fell one vote short of Cooperstown in a Hall committee election.\n\n“I thank the city of Philadelphia. Even though it was rough, I’ve made some friends along the way,” Allen said in an emotional ceremony on a warm, sunny afternoon.\n\nMiddleton said he was “bereft to learn of Dick’s passing today.”\n\n“Our community’s powerful connection to, and pride in, Dick leaves all of us in a state of mourning. He will be remembered not only for his extraordinary baseball skills and accomplishments, but equally for his strength of character. His humility, gratitude and compassion were so evident when we retired Dick’s number just three months ago. I am grateful he was able to participate in the ceremony and experience the outpouring of affection and respect we have for him,” Middleton said.\n\nMike Schmidt, a Hall of Fame third baseman who helped lure Allen out of retirement to return to Philadelphia for a second stint with the team in 1975, was among the former players who attended the ceremony. They wore masks and sat several feet apart during the coronavirus pandemic that shortened the major league season to 60 games. The Phillies planned to honor Allen again in 2021 with fans in attendance.\n\nSchmidt called Allen “an amazing mentor” who was wrongly labeled a “bad teammate” and “troublemaker.”\n\n“Dick was a sensitive Black man who refused to be treated as a second-class citizen,” Schmidt said in a speech. “He played in front of home fans that were products of that racist era (with) racist teammates and different rules for whites and Blacks. Fans threw stuff at him and thus Dick wore a batting helmet throughout the whole game. They yelled degrading racial slurs. They dumped trash in his front yard at his home. In general, he was tormented and it came from all directions. And Dick rebelled.”\n\nAllen answered in his own way, sometimes scratching out “Boo\" or “No” with his cleats in the dirt around the bases.\n\nSchmidt pointed out Allen didn’t have a negative reputation playing for the St. Louis Cardinals, Los Angeles Dodgers and Chicago White Sox. He also campaigned for Allen’s induction into the Hall of Fame.\n\n“My friends, these (negative) labels have kept Dick Allen out of the Hall of Fame,” Schmidt said. “Imagine what Dick could’ve accomplished as a player in another era, on another team, left alone to hone his skills, to be confident, to come to the ballpark every day and just play baseball.”\n\nAllen was Middleton’s favorite player as a kid. He called the abuse Allen received “horrific” and pointed out his accomplishments are even greater considering the racism he endured.\n\nAllen batted .292 with 351 home runs, 1,119 RBIs and .912 OPS in 15 seasons. He played first base, third base and left field.\n\nAfter seven years in Philadelphia, Allen played a season each with the Cardinals and Dodgers.\n\nIn 1972, he joined the White Sox and was an immediate hit in winning the AL MVP. Allen led the AL in homers (37), RBIs (113), on-base average and slugging percentage.\n\nHis impact was felt on the diamond and in the stands. Chicago finished second in the AL West that year with 87 wins and drew nearly 1.2 million fans; two years earlier, the White Sox were 56-106 and only 495,000 people came out to Comiskey Park to see them.\n\n“It was one of those things where the fans were kind of down in the dumps,” Bill Melton, his All-Star teammate in Chicago, recalled Monday. “Things were bad. The economy was bad, everything.\"\n\n“I think Dick just brought a flavor to the White Sox. And the flavor was this: national attention. We’d go into New York, we’d finally get writers, press, pictures back to Chicago. ... We were starting to draw attention, magazine covers,” he said.\n\nMelton said Allen would always shrug off the Hall of Fame vote, saying it wasn’t meant to be. But he wasn’t sure how his former teammate really felt.\n\n“We probably were more angry than he was,” he said. “There’s a lot of bad characters in baseball. Dick wasn’t one of them. He was beloved by his team.”\n\nMelton said he spoke to Allen a week ago for about a half-hour.\n\n“He never uttered once about his condition. I just found out today that he passed from cancer. He refused to take the chemo the second time around. To me, it was typical Dick Allen: I’ve had enough. When he’s had enough, he moves on,\" he said.\n\nAllen had the fifth-most home runs (319) over an 11-year span (1964-74) behind four Hall of Famers: Hank Aaron (391), Harmon Killebrew (336), Willie Stargell (335) and Willie McCovey (327). His .940 OPS during that time was second to Aaron’s .941. He finished his career with Oakland in 1977.\n\nAllen wasn’t elected into the Hall of Fame by the Baseball Writers' Association of America and he fell one vote short in Golden Era Committee voting in 2014. The Golden Days Committee and the Early Days Committee did not vote this year because of COVID-19 and instead will meet during the winter of 2021.\n\nIn his only postseason appearance, Allen went 2 for 9 as the Phillies got swept in three games by Cincinnati in the 1976 NL Championship Series.\n\nAllen nearly made it to the World Series as a rookie, but the '64 Phillies notoriously blew a 6 1/2-game lead in the NL with just 12 games remaining. While Philadelphia lost 10 in a row and closed in a 2-10 slump, Allen hit .429 (21 for 49) in that span.\n\nTwo of Allen's brothers played in the majors. Hank was an outfielder for seven seasons, mostly with the Washington Senators, and Ron had a total of seven games for the Cardinals.\n\n“He is now reunited with his beloved daughter, Terri. The Phillies extend their condolences to Dick’s widow, Willa, his family, friends and all his fans from coast to coast,” the Phillies said.\n\n____\n\nAP Baseball Writer Ben Walker and AP Sports Writer Andrew Seligman contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/columnist/bob-nightengale/2021/10/03/mlb-legends-retiring-2021-gerry-davis-mike-shannon/5976432001/", "title": "MLB legends are retiring in 2021 – but you may not know these four", "text": "Each of them have earned World Series rings, but only one ever played Major League Baseball, and that was 50 years ago.\n\nOnly one can be found in the daily box score.

In 2010, McGwire appeared on 23.7% of ballots cast by eligible members of the Baseball Writers Association of America. A year later, after admitting to steroid use, that number dropped to 19.8% and continued to wane until getting 12.3% in 2016.\n\nMeanwhile, other sluggers from McGwire's era, ones suspected of using PEDs but with no substantial evidence, are gaining ground.\n\nMike Piazza, Jeff Bagwell and Pudge Rodriguez have become members of the Hall of Fame in the last 13 months.\n\nBarry Bonds and Roger Clemens, for whom there is far more evidence of PED use, each going to federal court to win not-guilty verdicts on perjury charges, have made significant gains in the past two years, getting 53.8% and 54.1% last year, and now stand a strong chance of making it to Cooperstown.\n\nBut Sammy Sosa, McGwire's running partner in that magical home run race of 1998, is headed the other direction, collecting 8.6% last year.\n\nIf not for McGwire’s admission, would he be viewed differently today?\n\n“No regrets, I’ve got no regrets,’’ says McGwire, now the San Diego Padres bench coach. “I don’t know anything about those other guys, but I know what I did. I know what I’ve done.\n\n“Did I take a lot of hits? Yeah. But I moved on from it. I’m totally fine how things developed in the years after my retirement.’’\n\nStill, there’s a part of McGwire’s soul that has been ripped away. He knows he belongs in the Hall of Fame. And what happens if Bonds and Clemens reach it?\n\n“I hope they do make it, they should,’’ McGwire says. “Barry did a hell of a job. The numbers are there. But you know what, my numbers are there too.\n\n“You look at my numbers for 16 years and ask if they are Hall of Fame worthy. Absolutely. They’re right in line with the numbers of other Hall of Fame first basemen. And that’s after missing nearly two years. Who knows where my numbers would have been if I hadn’t retired? I could have ended up with more homers than Barry, who knows?\"\n\nMcGwire slowly exhales, knowing it’s all out of his control and public sentiment may be cast in stone.\n\n“I’m not the type of person who’s going to fight it,\" he says. \"But you also have to remember there were no rules or regulations about that kind of stuff when I played. That’s the bottom line.\n\n“The game is different today, and all for the better, with the best testing in all of sports. Unfortunately, that’s something that wasn’t around when I played.’’\n\nIf there was testing, McGwire says he would never have used PEDs. He’s not making excuses, but he happened to play in an era when there were teams, trainers and front office personnel who actually encouraged drug use.\n\n“It wasn’t like that stuff made me a home-run hitter,’’ McGwire says. “I was always a home-run hitter. Always.\"\n\nMcGwire homered once every 10 at-bats during his career, which is still the best in major-league history, with a .588 slugging percentage than ranks eighth. And even with the home run rate this season the highest in history, no one is going to come close to McGwire’s 70 homers in 1998, let alone Bonds’ record 73 in 2001.\n\nGo ahead and call them tainted totals, with Miami Marlins slugger Giancarlo Stanton saying that if he reaches 62 homers this year, he would become the real single-season home-run king. You won’t get McGwire to agree, but you won’t get him into an argument, either.\n\n“I saw that, but what am I going to say?’’ McGwire said. “You know what, that’s obviously his opinion, and I’m extremely happy for him. No injuries this year. And he’s found that hitting slot.\n\n“We all know how difficult it is to hit home runs.’’\n\nIt’s why this weekend is so emotional for McGwire and his family, knowing that despite spending just 4½ years in St. Louis, he was voted into the Cardinals’ Hall of Fame.\n\n“That’s not a long time for a player to be in one place, but they still thought enough of me to put me into their Hall of Fame,\" he says. “I’m honored. I’m humbled. It’s very surreal.’’\n\nMaybe there will be a day, McGwire says, when Cooperstown will be calling, too. If Bonds and Clemens make it, maybe he’ll be viewed differently. He’s still eligible to be selected by the veterans’ committee, which passed him over last winter in his first year on the Today’s Game ballot.\n\nThe Baseball Hall of Fame would be the ultimate honor, McGwire says, but he refuses to let it define him.\n\n“If it happens, great, but if not, I understand it,’’ McGwire says. “Really, I’m OK with it.

On Friday, Philadelphia's city council publicly acknowledged the incident as a dark chapter in the city's history.\n\n\"He faced tremendous racism in our city,\" Councilwoman Helen Gym said. \"It was something he never forgot ... but neither should we.\"\n\nApril 15 is recognized nationally as Jackie Robinson Day, and ballparks around the country are also celebrating the 69th anniversary of the day he broke the league's color barrier in 1947. Robinson played for the Dodgers until 1956.\n\nAll MLB players, managers, coaches and umpires wore his No. 42 for games. Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred, at Yankee Stadium for the Seattle-New York game, said he was in his office earlier in the day and saw Colorado playing the Cubs on television, with everyone wearing the same number.\n\n\"It's a constant reminder that today's different,\" Manfred said.\n\nGym presented a resolution , passed by the council last month, before about 100 children, city leaders and Robinson fans — some wearing his No. 42 Dodgers jersey — gathered at the Philadelphia Stars Negro League Memorial Park. Among them was 79-year-old Carolyn Mitchell, who saw Robinson play as a girl.\n\nMitchell, who is black, said Friday's ceremony was \"very meaningful\" and that passing by the park gave her back fond memories of watching baseball growing up. The youngest of eight children and her parents' only daughter, Mitchell took to sports early and saw Robinson play in Philadelphia in the early 1950s.\n\n\"He was unbelievable,\" she recalled, smiling. \"He could run like crazy. He used to love to steal bases.\"\n\nIn Los Angeles, where the Dodgers played their first game in 1958, Robinson's widow, Rachel, and daughter Sharon were part of a pregame ceremony at Chavez Ravine - where the club first retired Robinson's uniform number on June 4, 1972.\n\nRachel Robinson was escorted to the mound by Dodgers part-owner Magic Johnson and Hall of Famer Frank Robinson, the first black manager in baseball history. The former Cincinnati Reds and Baltimore Orioles slugger threw a ceremonial first pitch to Dodgers skipper Dave Roberts, who this year became the first minority manager in franchise history.\n\nIn Philadelphia, Robinson's skill for basestealing is depicted in a mural on the city's north end painted nearly a decade ago in his honor. Walking near the mural on Friday afternoon with her 10-year-old daughter Nate, Tikeena Harris explained that blacks and whites didn't used to play sports together.\n\nTommy Keels, who lived nearby and passes the mural regularly, said Robinson was a groundbreaker who represented his race well.\n\n\"I lived through Jim Crow,\" said Keels, 60, who is from Miami. \"I was raised in the South. I experienced a lot of things I know he did on a monumental scale.\"\n\nJackie Robinson's teammate and roommate Don Newcombe says his friend deserves all the accolades.\n\n\"The world owes him whatever they can say about him and do about him that is good, because he was a great man,\" the former Brooklyn pitcher told the AP on Friday while the Dodgers were taking batting practice.\n\n\"I was with him, I roomed with him, he was my good friend, my good buddy, and I loved him. I still love him today like he was still here,\" said Newcombe, who was the first black pitcher to win the Rookie of the Year award in 1949. \"I remember Jackie sitting me and Roy Campanella down one day in Roy's apartment and he told us: 'I can't do it without you. I need you. And one day, we're going to change the letter I in bitter to an E for better.' And he became so right. God bless him.\"\n\nDodgers broadcaster Vin Scully, who was there for Robinson's career in Brooklyn, said Robinson's \"self-control under some pressurized circumstances was remarkable.\"\n\n\"We all knew that that fire of competitiveness was always on high, and he was not always welcomed. But he overcame all of that,\" Scully said. \"That, to me was the most remarkable thing — how controlled he was with all the hell that was running around him. He took a lot of abuse, but kept his jaw tight.

They also happen to be Rivera's lifelong \"spiritual\" parents, although Gandia publicly shies away from discussing their personal connection.\n\nShe works from a tiny, one-room Stanton office, which Rivera pays for out of his own pocket \"so 100 percent of the donations go to the foundation.\"\n\nWhen Rivera decided to retire in 2013, the Yankees and teams across the league wanted to donate during his retirement tour, so he created a public version of his foundation for underprivileged children.\n\nThat's when his mostly private work began to become more public, leading to the realization that his foundation needed a headquarters, now in a co-working office park near Christiana Mall.\n\nNext month, the foundation will host its biggest Delaware event yet when Rivera himself returns to host the Mariano Rivera Foundation 5K & Kids Run on May 19 in Wilmington's Canby Park to help raise funds for next year's backpack giveaway and other programs.\n\nThe first race, which was held last year in Garnet Valley, Pennsylvania, raised $42,000 for the man who wore No. 42 on his back.\n\nThe funds helped pay for giving away backpacks in Rodney Square last summer, said Richards, Layton & Finger attorney Russell Silberglied, who works closely with Gandia as both legal counsel and a member of the board of directors for the foundation.\n\nA man of God raised by a Christian evangelical family, the self-educated Rivera quietly gave 10 percent of his Yankees contracts back to his private foundation, Gandia said, along with every penny from his endorsement deals.\n\nWhen Rivera was in Rodney Square last summer, he explained where his drive to help comes from and why he does much of it in Delaware, pointing to the Gandias.\n\n\"The Lord has blessed me with a lot and to remember where I came from, I just have to give back,\" he said to a group of local reporters. \"Delaware is a special place for me. ... My spiritual parents live here — the people who have loved me, taken care of me and have been there for me. We're always looking for stuff to do here for the kids.\"\n\nThis new public push makes both Rivera and Gandia uncomfortable, even though it will likely mean more donations.\n\n\"What we do is really to thank God for what he's done for this family and what he's done for Mariano,\" said Gandia, offering a peek into the selflessness and grace that became keystones to Rivera's baseball legend.\n\nEven so, Gandia points not to herself or her husband for Rivera's giving. She said it was the late Yankees owner George Steinbrenner who helped instill Rivera's altruism.\n\nSteinbrenner — the man known as the Boss in New York media for his brash style — also had a softer, charitable side that went mostly unreported because he stipulated that his donations be private.\n\nHe also founded the Silver Shield Foundation in 1982, a nonprofit that pays for the education of children of New York firefighters and police officers killed in the line of duty.\n\nSteinbrenner had been quoted often as saying, \"If you do something good for someone, and more than two people know about it, you didn't do it for the right reason.\"\n\n\"Mariano took that very seriously and, of course, we've always been giving, so it felt right with us,\" she said. \"That's how we became the Mariano Rivera Foundation and gave and gave and gave. And we're still giving.\n\n\"What we do is what we have to do. We teach children to love and to care for your family and your neighbor. That's a biblical principle. And when you learn that and it's in your blood, it doesn't take motivation to do it because it's there.\"\n\nSilberglied has seen Gandia and Rivera, 48, torn between keeping their charity secret and making it known. As he puts it, \"It's an interesting conundrum. Giving on a personal basis and not saying too much is very meaningful, but you also get to give more if you publicize it.\"\n\nAdds Gandia, \"We are not here to make a name for ourselves or lift up Mariano Rivera. We're here to lift up the people. And we realize you have to let the people in need know that you're here.\"\n\nThe foundation focuses on education for underprivileged children through scholarships, back-to-school backpack events, holiday food drives and monetary contributions. Foundation events have been held everywhere from New Jersey and Florida to Panama and Puerto Rico.\n\nSilberglied said the foundation is as hands-on as it gets. Rivera, Rivera's wife Clara and their children, along with Gandia, Silberglied and others, all volunteer their time. As a small, nimble charity, they follow their heart in deciding who to help.\n\nFor the past several years, the Riveras have all have been in Delaware for their annual turkey giveaway – a meal that comes with all the trimmings. They did one event on the Riverfront, and last year's giveaway was held at the William \"Hicks\" Anderson Community Center in West Center City.\n\n\"It was a very festive atmosphere with a lot of pictures being taken, a lot of hugs and a lot of gratitude,\" said U'Gundi Jacobs, director of the center. \"And going into the winter, it helps families who struggle — maybe even letting them save some of those canned goods for a time after they're done with that big, fresh turkey.\"\n\nSince one church didn't give away its vouchers in 2016, the whole gang went door to door offering the dinners to random families, even stopping cars and making the offer.\n\nGandia remembers one woman in her late 20s with four children who opened her door and was utterly shocked by the generosity, as well as the timing for her family.\n\nShe kept saying, \"Oh my God, oh my God,\" before asking for a hug while sobbing.\n\n\"She told me, 'You don't understand. We don't have any food in this house. What you are giving me is for the rest of the week,'\" Gandia remembered.\n\nThe woman then asked if there was any other food left over. She knew a friend around the block in need. Soon, they were all marching up the block and delivering another dinner.\n\n\"And that woman literally jumped and yelled, 'I have food! I have food!' And that's need right here in Wilmington,\" Gandia said.\n\nGandia, whose missionary work with her husband brought her everywhere from California and Vermont to Peru and South America, moved to Delaware in the mid- to late 1980s. They began working with small groups and were drawn to the people at Georgetown's Iglesia de Dios de la Profecia (Church of God of Prophecy).\n\n\"They were so needy at the time,\" she said of the church, which had only a handful of people when they first met and is now building a multimillion-dollar facility with help from the foundation. \"When we go there, it's like homecoming. They call me Grandma and call my husband Grandpa.\"\n\nDuring their 2009 church visit with Rivera — a visit that turned out to be a lot more public than other visits — the giving didn't stop with the foundation's $50,000 donation.\n\nGandia told Rivera they should start an offering because there were so many people in attendance. She said she then challenged him to see who could raise more, ending up with about $75,000 — a number than included a personal contribution from Rivera.\n\nWhen Gandia and her husband retired as missionaries, they decided to stay in Delaware. They liked that it was small and close to New York, Philadelphia and Washington.\n\n\"I really love the people. We could have left, but we decided let's just retire here,\" said Gandia, who is also a fan of the Chick-fil-A not far from her home, as is Rivera.\n\nShe still remembers the first time she brought Rivera to Christiana Mall while he was still with the Yankees. A young boy noticed him and followed them for a while before asking Gandia if he would take a photo.\n\nShe told him to wait in a corner and brought Rivera over. The kid became so excited that he shouted, drawing attention and plenty of onlookers.\n\n\"We literally had to run out of the mall,\" she laughed at the memory.\n\nThese days, Gandia is building a team around her at the foundation as she slowly steps away from running it. After that, she plans to live happily in Delaware, but Rivera, who lives in New York, has other ideas.\n\n\"He has these big plans that when we really, really retire, that we're going to live with them,\" she said. \"The only way I would move out of here is if I get Alzheimer's, don't know what's happening and they take me. I just love this place.\"\n\nContact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.

Born too late. Didn’t see Chuck Klein of Southport become one of the most feared hitters in baseball. The MVP, the Triple Crown, the home run titles … Bob Klein missed all that.\n\nBut he was there for the fall.\n\nThe Chuck Klein that hobbled off the train at Union Station in 1947 was a beaten man, hunched over a cane, an alcoholic who had lost everything at the bottom of a bottle – his wife, his two bars, his career, his reputation. All he had to show for a life of 42 years that began in a small white house on the south side of Indianapolis? It fit into the suitcase he carried off that train from Philadelphia.\n\nBob Klein was 7 years old when Uncle Chuck came home. He was at the train station. He saw this.\n\n“He could barely walk,” Bob’s telling me from his house in Greenwood. “His legs were stiff, he shuffled his feet. His nervous system was just shot.”\n\nMore from Gregg Doyel\n\n• Can Carsen Edwards become Purdue's alpha dog?\n\n• Is Pacers boss Kevin Pritchard performing too well?\n\nHad the story ended there — and it well could have — Chuck Klein would be a tragic figure. But it doesn’t. What happened next, what happened over the ensuing 11 years, is not a story of redemption, but recovery. Chuck Klein, the Hoosier Hammer, lost it all but at the end he found something. He found peace. Family. Baseball.\n\nBob Klein was there for that, too. And 22 years after Chuck Klein was found on the floor of his brother’s flooding bathroom, when in death he achieved immortality, Bob Klein was there. Oh, he was there for that.\n\n* * *\n\nThe house, incredibly, is still here. Both houses on Carson Avenue are here in fact, the one where his life began – and the one next door, where it ended.\n\nSo many other chapters of Chuck Klein’s south-side story are closed now. The small white schoolhouse at the corner of Carson and Hanna burned down in 1928. A liquor store is there. The site of Southport High School, at least the one attended by Chuck Klein on Madison Avenue, now has a bank. The steel mill where he once toiled is a warehouse. His favorite golf course became a stretch of I-465, and his bowling alley? A used car lot.\n\nBut the houses on Carson Avenue remain.\n\nChuck, the youngest of three boys, followed his brothers Francis and Ed on the mile walk to that tiny Silver Nook schoolhouse, followed them into the fiery hell that was the Chapman-Price Steel Company on Shelby, followed them into baseball.\n\nEd Klein, the oldest, was said to be the best hitter of the bunch, but he was a homebody. When the St. Louis Cardinals signed Chuck, who owed his prodigious power to forearms that threw 100-pound steel ingots around the mill, Ed stayed in the factory. Chuck went to Evansville of the Three-I League, then to Fort Wayne of the Central League, then to the big leagues in late July 1928 with the Philadelphia Phillies, who purchased his contract from the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nThe rest of that story is well documented, but the highlights are worth revisiting. From 1929-33, Chuck Klein produced five straight seasons with at least 200 hits and 120 RBI, four HR titles, one stolen-base title and a single-season record 44 outfield assists in 1930. He won the National League Triple Crown in 1933 with 28 home runs, 120 RBI and a .368 batting average. He was 28, just entering his prime.\n\nAnd just leaving it.\n\nKlein played another decade, but his batting average for those 10 years (.278) was 81 points below his career average before 1933 (.359). He was in the bigs from 1940-44 only because World War II decimated rosters, most likely; Klein hit .192 in that time, then retired.\n\nThree years later, after the failure of his marriage and his two drinking establishments in Philadelphia, Klein came back to Indianapolis. Back to Carson Avenue.\n\n* * *\n\nHe mowed the grass on the day he died.\n\nIt was a push mower, not one of those riding tractors, and he wasn’t mowing a lawn so much as he was mowing a compound. The Klein family owned both houses and several acres on that stretch of Carson, which sits on the southwest corner of I-65 and I-465 in the Lindbergh Estates neighborhood. The white house on the left, that’s where his parents lived. That’s where Chuck was born. The red house on the right, that’s where his oldest brother lived. That’s where Chuck died. His body resides now at …\n\nWell, hang on. What’s with the rush to bury Chuck Klein? The tragedy of a man once known as The Hoosier Hercules gives way, over time, to the triumph of an alcoholic who didn’t drink for most of his final decade. Chuck deserves the credit for that, of course, but his sister-in-law – her name was Florence Valentine Klein; everyone called her “Sis” – gets an assist.\n\n“Sis was a stern woman,” Bob Klein is saying with a smile, and he’d know. He also spent time in her home, moving in with Uncle Ed and Aunt Sis after his own father, Francis, died when he was 5. Two years later when Chuck Klein came back to Carson Avenue, Bob and his mom moved into their own place.\n\nBob and Chuck were close. Bob had lost his father; Chuck didn’t have kids. They had each other, and they went to see the Reds in Cincinnati, the Cubs in Chicago, the Indians here in Indianapolis. In those early days, Chuck Klein would hobble into Victory Field among baseball fans unaware that the man in his 40s, hunched over a cane, once hit four home runs in a game in 1936 and regularly outslugged Rogers Hornsby and Mel Ott and Hack Wilson for National League HR titles.\n\nMore from IndyStar\n\n• Download the new IndyStar Sports app\n\n• Videos galore on the IndyStar Sports YouTube channel\n\nOther days, Chuck Klein would lead his nephew the half-mile down Carson Avenue to Lake Shore Country Club, where they’d walk the course looking for lost golf balls. At night Chuck would take Bob into the bar there at Lake Shore, setting him on the counter with a roll of nickels to play the slot machines. Or they’d go to Sport Bowl on East Street and roll a few games with Indianapolis bowling legend Jess Pritchett.\n\n“He’d just drink Cokes,” Bob Klein says of Uncle Chuck. “He was moving around pretty good in those days. He got better.”\n\nBut those were hard years he’d spent in baseball, and something inside Chuck Klein’s brain gave out on March 28, 1958. His body was found on the floor of his brother’s house on Carson Avenue, the faucet still running, his face bloodied from an apparent fall onto the sink. The family thinks he was shaving that morning when he suffered some sort of cerebral hemorrhage. Sis came home that afternoon to water all over the house, tracing it to the running faucet in the bathroom where she found Chuck’s body. He was 53.\n\n* * *\n\nHe “died in obscurity on Carson Avenue,” The Indianapolis Star once wrote of perhaps the best baseball player this city has ever produced, and for more than 20 years Chuck Klein remained there. In obscurity.\n\nHe was buried next to his parents at St. Joseph and Holy Cross Cemetery, under a shade tree that allowed the grass to stay green. A small rectangular stone embedded in the ground marks his grave in the simplest of terms: name, lifespan, a cross. Baseball is not mentioned. No room for that. Here lies … someone. Anyone.\n\n“Sis said the family wouldn’t want (the marker) to be big,” Bob Klein says.\n\nA dim memory locally, the baseball legend of Chuck Klein was disappearing nationally. In his first year on the Baseball Hall of Fame ballot, he garnered just 2.5 percent of the vote in 1948. Fifteen times he was on the ballot, topping out at 27.9 percent in 1964, and then he was gone.\n\nNot everyone forgot. On Oct. 2, 1972, Bob Klein received a letter on White House stationery from President Richard Nixon, explaining that a journalist had recently asked Nixon “to name my all-time baseball team.” Nixon went on to write that, on “a quiet afternoon at Camp David, I did come up with a list.”\n\n“No team would be complete without your uncle’s name,” President Nixon continued, and included in his correspondence was a thick gold pamphlet with the presidential seal on the outside and such names as Babe Ruth, Jackie Robinson and Chuck Klein on the inside.\n\nEight years later the phone rang at Bob and Barbara Klein’s home in Greenwood. It was someone from Cooperstown, N.Y., saying the Hall of Fame Veterans Committee —charged with reconsidering players no longer eligible for the regular ballot — had elected Chuck Klein for enshrinement.\n\n“I accepted on (my uncle’s) behalf,” Bob says. “I shook (Commissioner) Bowie Kuhn’s hand and gave the speech.”\n\n“And I wrote it,” says his wife, Barbara. “The night before the ceremony. In the hotel room!”\n\nOn their next visit to St. Joseph and Holy Cross Cemetery, Bob and Barbara adorned his modest gravesite with an engraved brass plate announcing Chuck Klein’s Hall of Fame enshrinement. They attached it with adhesive to the marble gravestone.\n\n“But the brass plate kept getting stolen,” Barbara says. “We stopped after the fourth time.”\n\nThieves have nothing to steal now, not unless they want to pry that slab of marble from the ground. The tree was cut down years ago but Chuck Klein rests peacefully these days under sun-scorched grass. He is obscure no longer, lying alongside his parents with a view of forever.\n\nFind IndyStar columnist Gregg Doyel on Twitter at @GreggDoyelStar or at facebook.com/gregg.doyel.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/08/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2019/01/22/rivera-unanimous-halladay-edgar-mussina-voted-to-hof/38939941/", "title": "Rivera 1st unanimous HOF pick; Doc, Edgar, Mussina also in", "text": "AP\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — This honor was saved for the one and only Mariano Rivera.\n\nNot Babe Ruth. Not Hank Aaron. Not Cy Young.\n\nNot until \"The Sandman\" could everyone agree.\n\nRivera became baseball's first unanimous Hall of Fame selection, elected Tuesday along with Edgar Martinez, Mike Mussina and the late Roy Halladay. Rivera received all 425 votes in balloting announced by the Baseball Writers' Association of America. Ken Griffey Jr. held the mark for top percentage at 99.32 when he was on 437 of 440 ballots two years ago.\n\n\"Beyond my imagination,\" Rivera said.\n\nFollow every MLB game: Latest MLB scores, stats, schedules and standings.\n\nThe quartet will be enshrined in Cooperstown along with Today's Game Era Committee selections Harold Baines and Lee Smith on July 21.\n\nRivera is baseball's career saves leader with 652. With a steady demeanor and a fearsome cut fastball, he won five World Series over 19 seasons with the New York Yankees. He was always at his best in October, getting 42 saves with a 0.70 ERA over 16 postseasons, including 11 saves in the World Series.\n\nHalladay, an ace with the Toronto Blue Jays and Philadelphia Phillies, got 85.4 percent and will be the first posthumous inductee since Deacon White in 2013 and Ron Santo in 2012. Halladay died in November 2017 at 40 years old when an airplane he was flying crashed into the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida.\n\nMartinez was a .312 hitter over 18 seasons with Seattle. He got 85.4 percent in his 10th and final try on the writers' ballot. He and Baines will join 2014 inductee Frank Thomas as the only Hall of Famers to play the majority of their games at designated hitter. David Ortiz will be eligible in 2022.\n\n\"I think the fact that Harold Baines and me got in this year is going to help the future of the DH for years to come,\" Martinez said.\n\nMussina was a steady right-hander for the Yankees and Baltimore Orioles who went 270-153 with 2,813 strikeouts over 18 seasons. He received 76.7 percent, getting seven more votes than the 319 required for election.\n\nBarry Bonds and Roger Clemens made gains but again fell short in their seventh times on the ballot. Bonds got 59.1 percent and Clemens 59.5, their cases muddied by steroid accusations.\n\nRivera grew up in Panama the son of a fisherman. He signed with New York in 1990, debuted in the majors as a 25-year-old in 1995 and a year later emerged as one of the game's best relievers. Part of a core that included Derek Jeter, Andy Pettitte and Jorge Posada, Rivera helped the Yankees win four World Series from 1996-2000 and another in 2009.\n\n\"The scouting report was the same every time,\" Jeter wrote at The Players' Tribune. \"Mo knew he was going to throw that cutter. The guy at the plate knew he was going to throw that cutter. Fifty thousand plus at Yankee Stadium knew he was going to throw that cutter. And it wouldn't matter.\"\n\nThe Yankees didn't even wait until Rivera's final game to retire his No. 42 — he was the last player in the major leagues to wear that number, grandfathered to him when No. 42 was retired in honor of Jackie Robinson in 1997.\n\n\"Wearing No. 42, representing Jackie Robinson, I assume he was the first No. 42 elected,\" Rivera said. \"To be the last No. 42 elected to the Hall of Fame, and unanimously, is amazing.\"\n\nThough his music taste skews more Christian rock than heavy metal, Rivera toed the Yankee Stadium rubber to Metallica's \"Enter Sandman\" for much of his career. \"The Sandman\" became synonymous with the song's foreboding guitar riff, and the Rock & Roll Hall of Famers performed it live at Yankee Stadium in 2013 before one of Rivera's final home games.\n\nLike all the bats he sawed off with that dastardly cutter, Rivera shattered an 83-year-old standard with his selection. Ruth, Young and the game's other early stars fell short of unanimous election in the first ballot in 1936 because of a backlog of worthy candidates. With the bar set so high, some writers began leaving worthy first-year players off their ballots.\n\nBill Ballou of The Telegram & Gazette in Worcester, Massachusetts, wrote in November that he wouldn't vote for Rivera because he didn't think closers belonged in the Hall. Instead of robbing Rivera of unanimous status, though, Ballou planned to not send a ballot at all. Ballou announced Tuesday he had changed his mind and sent a ballot that included Rivera.\n\nRivera and Smith will be the seventh and eighth relievers in the Hall, joining Hoyt Wilhelm (1985), Rollie Fingers (1992), Dennis Eckersley (2004), Bruce Sutter (2006), Rich Gossage (2008) and Trevor Hoffman (2018).\n\nHalladay won two Cy Young Awards, one each with Toronto and Philadelphia, before ending his career in 2013 at 36 years old due to back injuries.\n\nThe right-hander was a first-round draft pick by Toronto in 1995, debuted in the majors in 1998 and struggled terribly until being demoted to the minor leagues in 2001. With the help of sports psychologist Harvey Dorfman, Halladay reinvented himself and became an All-Star in 2002, then won 22 games and an AL Cy Young in 2003.\n\nHalladay's best season came in 2010, his first following a blockbuster trade to Philadelphia. Halladay pitched a perfect game against the Florida Marlins in May, then delivered a no-hitter against Cincinnati in the opener of the NL Division Series. It was just the second no-hitter in postseason history after the Yankees' Don Larsen pitched a perfect game against Brooklyn in the 1956 World Series.\n\nIn an era marked by pitch counts and early hooks, Halladay was a workhorse. Since 2000, Halladay's 65 complete games are by far the most in the majors — Livan Hernandez is second at 39.\n\nHalladay pitched 12 seasons with Toronto and four with the Phillies, making it likely his Hall plaque with have a Blue Jays logo.\n\nThe only other player elected on the first ballot posthumously was Christy Mathewson in 1936. Roberto Clemente was chosen in a special election in 1973 after dying in a plane crash on Dec. 31, 1972.\n\nMartinez was among the game's steadiest hitters throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, winning two batting titles and hitting 309 homers.\n\nA late bloomer from Puerto Rico, Martinez never played more than 100 games in the majors until he was 27. He broke in as a third baseman before becoming a full-time DH at 32, a role he held until retiring at 41 in 2004. MLB's yearly award for the top DH is named in his honor.\n\nMartinez's classmates certainly couldn't get him out. The slugger was 11 for 19 (.579) lifetime against Rivera, 23 for 75 (.307) with five homers against Mussina and 8 for 18 (.444) against Halladay.\n\n\"Especially early in my career, I got two strikes on Edgar, and the third one never showed up,\" Rivera said.\n\nMartinez got just 36.2 percent of the vote in his first ballot appearance in 2010 and fell as low as 25.2 percent in 2014 — the cutoff for induction is 75 percent. With a push from the sport's analytics community and a hearty social media campaign, Martinez made major progress in recent votes, including 70.4 percent in 2018.\n\n\"Some of the sabermetrics really helped,\" Martinez said.\n\nMussina and his nasty knuckle curveball also got a push from the advanced numbers. He felt lucky to get 20.3 percent in his first ballot in 2014 but steadily gained support.\n\nMussina's 3.68 ERA will be the third highest in Cooperstown behind Jack Morris (3.90) and Red Ruffing (3.80), but writers gave him a break for pitching in the slugger-heavy AL East, with its cozy ballparks.\n\n\"You know they're small or hitter friendly, it's just how it was,\" Mussina said. \"I just kept trying to make adjustments.\"\n\nMussina fell short of 300 wins and 3,000 strikeouts, but those traditional markers haven't been as crucial to modern voters.\n\nThis proved more relevant: His 83 wins above replacement, per Baseball-Reference, rank 58th all-time. That's just ahead of first-ballot Hall of Fame pitchers Nolan Ryan and Tom Glavine.\n\nMussina spent 10 seasons in Baltimore and eight in New York. He said he was unsure which hat would be on his Cooperstown plaque — the Hall makes the final call.\n\n\"Certainly by July, we'll have something worked out,\" he said.\n\nIt was only the fifth time the writers voted in four players in one class — it also happened last year, in 2015, 1955 and 1947. The largest group selected by writers was the inaugural five-member class of Ty Cobb, Honus Wagner, Ruth, Mathewson and Walter Johnson in 1936. The writers and Today's Game Era Committee have combined to elect 31 people since 2014.\n\nCurt Schilling got 60.9 percent in his seventh time on the ballot.

The eight major races in the series — starting March 23 with the Jeff Ruby Steaks at Turfway Park and Louisiana Derby at Fair Grounds — will award 100 points to the winner and 50 to the runner-up.\n\nThe championship series will run through mid-April, with the last major day of prep races coming April 6 with the Wood Memorial at Aqueduct, the Blue Grass at Keeneland and the Santa Anita Derby.\n\nKeeneland also will host the final points race — the Lexington — on April 13, with 20 points going to the winner.\n\nThe list of top Kentucky Derby contenders will inevitably change, but here are 20 horses to watch over the next few weeks, listed alphabetically. Trainer Bob Baffert is suspended at Churchill Downs, meaning his top 3-year-olds —including the highly regarded Nysos and Muth — will not be eligible for the Kentucky Derby.\n\nCatching Freedom\n\nTrainer: Brad Cox\n\nOwner: Albaugh Family Stables (Dennis Albaugh)\n\nJockey: Luis Saez\n\nSire: Constitution\n\nDam: Catch My Drift, by Pioneerof The Nile\n\nPrice tag: $575,000 at 2022 Keeneland September Yearling Sale\n\nBred in: Kentucky\n\nCareer record: 2-0-0 in three starts\n\nCareer earnings: $237,350\n\nRoad to the Kentucky Derby points (ranking): 10 (No. 18)\n\nKentucky Derby Future Wager Pool 4 odds: 25-1 (co-No. 9 choice)\n\nLast start: Won Smarty Jones on Jan. 1 at Oaklawn\n\nPossible next start: Grade 2 Risen Star on Saturday at Fair Grounds\n\nNotable: “We’re going to need to improve off the Smarty Jones,” Cox said of Saturday’s Risen Star. “Physically, he looks great. He’s had a good bit of time between races, he shipped back here and is moving well, so we’ll see if he’s up for it.” Cox and Albaugh Family Stables teamed last year with Angel of Empire, who finished third in the Kentucky Derby.\n\nConquest Warrior\n\nTrainer: Shug McGaughey\n\nOwner: Courtlandt Farms (Donald Adam)\n\nJockey: Jose Ortiz\n\nSire: City of Light\n\nDam: Tea Time, by Pulpit\n\nPrice tag: $1 million at 2022 Keeneland September Yearling Sale\n\nBred in: Kentucky\n\nCareer record: 1-0-1 in two starts\n\nCareer earnings: $52,200\n\nRoad to the Kentucky Derby points (ranking): 0\n\nKentucky Derby Future Wager Pool 4 odds: 20-1 (co-No. 5 choice)\n\nLast start: Won maiden special weight Jan. 13 at Gulfstream\n\nPossible next start: Grade 2 Fountain of Youth on March 2 at Gulfstream\n\nNotable: Conquest Warrior has yet to appear in a stakes race but gained status with a rallying victory in January at Gulfstream, earning an 84 Beyer Speed Figure.

Brown said Domestic Product could race twice before the Kentucky Derby, with the Wood Memorial or Blue Grass possible after the Tampa Bay Derby.\n\nDornoch\n\nTrainer: Danny Gargan\n\nOwners: West Paces Racing (Larry Connolly), Raymond Hill Stable, Belmar Racing and Breeding (Vito Cucci), Two Eight Racing (Jayson Werth) and Pine Racing Stables (Mark Pine)\n\nJockey: Luis Saez\n\nSire: Good Magic\n\nDam: Puca, by Big Brown\n\nPrice tag: $325,000 at 2022 Keeneland September Yearling Sale\n\nBred in: Kentucky\n\nCareer record: 2-2-0 in four starts\n\nCareer earnings: $257,400\n\nRoad to the Kentucky Derby points (ranking): 10 (No. 17)\n\nKentucky Derby Future Wager Pool 4 odds: 15-1 (co-No. 3 choice)\n\nLast start: Won Grade 2 Remsen on Dec. 2 at Aqueduct\n\nPossible next start: Grade 2 Fountain of Youth on March 2 at Gulfstream\n\nNotable: Dornoch is a full brother to 2023 Kentucky Derby winner Mage. Co-owner Werth is a retired major league baseball player who was a member of the 2008 Philadelphia Phillies team that won the World Series. He wore jersey No. 28, hence the name of his Two Eight Racing stable. Trainer Gargan is seeking his second trip to the Kentucky Derby after finishing 14th with Tax in 2019.\n\nFierceness\n\nTrainer: Todd Pletcher\n\nOwner: Repole Stable (Mike Repole)\n\nJockey: John Velazquez\n\nSire: City of Light\n\nDam: Nonna Bella, by Stay Thirsty\n\nPrice tag: Homebred\n\nBred in: Kentucky\n\nCareer record: 2-0-1 in four starts\n\nCareer earnings: $1,127,250\n\nRoad to the Kentucky Derby points (ranking): 36 (No. 1)\n\nKentucky Derby Future Wager Pool 4 odds: 12-1 (No. 2 choice)\n\nLast start: Third in Grade 3 Holy Bull on Feb. 3 at Gulfstream\n\nPossible next start: Grade 1 Florida Derby on March 30 at Gulfstream\n\nNotable: Fierceness was the 2-year-old champion after winning the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile in November at Santa Anita. He won that race after a seventh-place finish in the Grade 1 Champagne, so Pletcher is hopeful for a similar rebound in Fierceness’ next race.\n\nForever Young\n\nTrainer: Yoshito Yahagi\n\nOwner: Susumu Fujita\n\nJockey: Ryusei Sakai\n\nSire: Real Steel\n\nDam: Forever Darling, by Congrats\n\nPrice tag: $720,603 at 2022 Japan Racing Horse Association Select Yearling and Foal Sale\n\nBred in: Japan\n\nCareer record: 3-0-0 in three starts\n\nCareer earnings: $569,451\n\nJapan Road to the Kentucky Derby points (ranking): 20 (No. 1)\n\nKentucky Derby Future Wager Pool 4 odds: 30-1 (co-No. 11 choice)\n\nLast start: Won Zen-Nippon Nisai Yushun on Dec. 13 at Kawasaki\n\nPossible next start: Group 3 Saudi Derby on Feb. 24 at Abdulaziz\n\nNotable: Trainer Yahagi plans to use the Saudi Derby as a tune-up for the Group 2 UAE Derby on March 30 at Meydan. That’s the same path followed by Derma Sotogake, the Japan-bred that finished sixth in last year’s Kentucky Derby. Forever Young was one of 37 horses bred in Japan that were nominated for the Triple Crown.\n\nHades\n\nTrainer: Joe Orseno\n\nOwners: D.J. Stable (Leonard Green), Robert Cotran\n\nJockey: Paco Lopez\n\nSire: Awesome Slew\n\nDam: The Shady Lady, by Quality Road\n\nPrice tag: $130,000 at 2023 Ocala Breeders’ Spring Sale of 2-Year-Olds in Training\n\nBred in: Florida\n\nCareer record: 3-0-0 in three starts\n\nCareer earnings: $225,000\n\nRoad to the Kentucky Derby points (ranking): 20 (No. 4)\n\nKentucky Derby Future Wager Pool 4 odds: 30-1 (co-No. 11 choice)\n\nLast start: Won Grade 3 Holy Bull on Feb. 3 at Gulfstream\n\nPossible next start: Grade 1 Florida Derby on March 30 at Gulfstream\n\nNotable: Hades won his first two starts at Gulfstream before surprising the Holy Bull field at 9-1 odds. Orseno said Hades was “really stud-ish,” as a 2-year-old, which led to the decision to geld the horse. “He’s a son of Awesome Slew,” Orseno said. “Nobody was thinking ‘stallion’ at that point. Nobody was thinking anything. We bought a racehorse, and we’ve got to get him to the races.”\n\nHall of Fame\n\nTrainer: Steve Asmussen\n\nOwners: Mrs. John Magnier, Michael Tabor, Derrick Smith, Westerberg, Gandharvi LLC, Brook Smith\n\nJockey: Ricardo Santana Jr.\n\nSire: Gun Runner\n\nDam: Flag Day, by Giant’s Causeway\n\nPrice tag: $1.4 million at 2022 Fasig-Tipton Saratoga Select Yearling Sale\n\nBred in: Kentucky\n\nCareer record: 1-1-0 in two starts\n\nCareer earnings: $60,000\n\nRoad to the Kentucky Derby points (ranking): 0\n\nKentucky Derby Future Wager Pool 4 odds: 20-1 (co-No. 5 choice)\n\nLast start: Won maiden special weight Jan. 20 at Fair Grounds\n\nPossible next start: Grade 2 Risen Star on Saturday at Fair Grounds\n\nNotable: Hall of Fame broke his maiden in January with a 10 ¼-length score. Asmussen addressed the speedy time for Hall of Fame — 1:44.27 for 1 1/16 miles. “He was ridden much more aggressively because he’s playing a little catch-up on a horse like Track Phantom, but the ability is there,” said Asmussen, who also trains Track Phantom.\n\nHonor Marie\n\nTrainer: Whit Beckman\n\nOwners: Ribble Farms (Alan Ribble), Michael Eiserman, Earl Silver, Kenneth Fishbein, Daniel Fishbein\n\nJockey: Rafael Bejarano\n\nSire: Honor Code\n\nDam: Dame Marie, by Smart Strike\n\nPrice tag: $40,000 at 2022 Keeneland September Yearling Sale\n\nBred in: Kentucky\n\nCareer record: 2-1-0 in three starts\n\nCareer earnings: $318,175\n\nRoad to the Kentucky Derby points (ranking): 10 (No. 14)\n\nKentucky Derby Future Wager Pool 4 odds: 25-1 (co-No. 9 choice)\n\nLast start: Won Grade 2 Kentucky Jockey Club on Nov. 25 at Churchill Downs\n\nPossible next start: Grade 2 Risen Star on Saturday at Fair Grounds\n\nNotable: Beckman is a Louisville native who worked as an assistant for Todd Pletcher, Eoin Harty and Chad Brown before going out on his own in 2021. All three of Honor Marie’s career starts have come at Churchill Downs. “To me, he’s a very talented, quality horse, and we’ll see if he made the jump from 2 to 3,” Beckman said. “Early on he was always just kind of aloof, lights weren’t really on, but now we’re really starting to see him wake up, and I know he knows what he’s doing out there. He’s put on a lot of weight, a lot of muscle. He’s been doing what he needs to do.”\n\nLiberal Arts\n\nTrainer: Robert Medina\n\nOwners: Evan Ferraro, Stephen Ferraro\n\nJockey: Cristian Torres\n\nSire: Arrogate\n\nDam: Ismene, by Tribal Rule\n\nPrice tag: Homebred\n\nBred in: Kentucky\n\nCareer record: 2-1-3 in six starts\n\nCareer earnings: $294,825\n\nRoad to the Kentucky Derby points (ranking): 19 (No. 8)\n\nKentucky Derby Future Wager Pool 4 odds: 60-1 (co-No. 22 choice)\n\nLast start: Third in Grade 3 Southwest on Feb. 3 at Oaklawn\n\nPossible next start: Grade 1 Arkansas Derby on March 30 at Oaklawn\n\nNotable: Broke his maiden at Ellis Park on Aug. 13 and won the Grade 3 Street Sense on Oct. 29 at Churchill Downs.

Davis at Tampa Bay Downs. Pletcher has not announced a new plan for Locked’s 3-year-old debut. Locked went off as the 2-1 favorite in the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile but finished third behind Fierceness and Muth.\n\nMystik Dan\n\nTrainer: Kenny McPeek\n\nOwners: Lance Gasaway, 4 G Racing (Brent Gasaway), Daniel Hamby\n\nJockey: Brian Hernandez Jr.\n\nSire: Goldencents\n\nDam: Ma’am, by Colonel John\n\nPrice tag: Homebred\n\nBred in: Kentucky\n\nCareer record: 2-1-0 in five starts\n\nCareer earnings: $510,110\n\nRoad to the Kentucky Derby points (ranking): 21 (No. 3)\n\nKentucky Derby Future Wager Pool 4 odds: 20-1 (co-No. 5 choice)\n\nLast start: Won Grade 3 Southwest on Feb. 3 at Oaklawn\n\nPossible next start: Grade 1 Arkansas Derby on March 30 at Oaklawn\n\nNotable: “We’ve got plenty of time, and he’s a fit horse,” McPeek said of waiting until the Arkansas Derby for Mystik Dan’s next race. “And if we go into the Arkansas Derby, they’re going to have run their tail off to beat us.” Mystik Dan already owns a victory at Churchill Downs, breaking his maiden there Nov. 12 with a 7 ¾-length score.\n\nNash\n\nTrainer: Brad Cox\n\nOwner: Godolphin (Mohammed al Maktoum, et al)\n\nJockey: Flavien Prat\n\nSire: Medaglia d’Oro\n\nDam: Sara Louise, by Malibu Moon\n\nPrice tag: Homebred\n\nBred in: Kentucky\n\nCareer record: 1-2-1 in four starts\n\nCareer earnings: $137,500\n\nRoad to the Kentucky Derby points (ranking): 13 (No. 13)\n\nKentucky Derby Future Wager Pool 4 odds: 30-1 (co-No. 11 choice)\n\nLast start: Second behind Track Phantom in Grade 3 Lecomte on Jan. 20 at Fair Grounds\n\nPossible next start: Allowance race Saturday at Fair Grounds\n\nNotable: Nash showed promise with a 10 1/4-length maiden win at Churchill Downs on Nov. 12 but is 0 for 2 since then. Cox told the Daily Racing Form he hasn’t given up on Nash reaching the Kentucky Derby. “He always trains well, and he has Derby points,” Cox said. “(Saturday’s allowance race) is an opportunity to get some confidence back, get back in a Derby prep next time.”\n\nNo More Time\n\nTrainer: Jose D’Angelo\n\nOwner: Morplay Racing\n\nJockey: Paco Lopez\n\nSire: Not This Time\n\nDam: Baroness Juliette, by Speightstown\n\nPrice tag: $40,000 at 2022 Keeneland September Yearling Sale\n\nBred in: Iowa\n\nCareer record: 2-1-0 in four starts\n\nCareer earnings: $156,780\n\nRoad to the Kentucky Derby points (ranking): 20 (No. 6)\n\nKentucky Derby Future Wager Pool 4 odds: 40-1 (co-No. 17 choice)\n\nLast start: Won Grade 3 Sam.

Davis on Feb. 10 at Tampa Bay Downs\n\nPossible next start: Grade 3 Tampa Bay Derby on March 9\n\nNotable: D’Angelo originally planned to run No More Time in the Grade 3 Holy Bull on Feb. 3 at Gulfstream but decided to give him one more week of training and went to the Sam F. Davis instead. “I had plenty of horse the whole way, and when I asked him he gave me everything,” jockey Lopez said after the victory.\n\nSierra Leone\n\nTrainer: Chad Brown\n\nOwners: Mrs. John Magnier, Michael Tabor, Derrick Smith, Westerberg, Brook Smith, Peter Brant\n\nJockey: Tyler Gaffalione\n\nSire: Gun Runner\n\nDam: Heavenly Love, by Malibu Moon\n\nPrice tag: $2.3 million at 2022 Fasig-Tipton Saratoga Select Yearling Sale\n\nBred in: Kentucky\n\nCareer record: 1-1-0 in two starts\n\nCareer earnings: $96,750\n\nRoad to the Kentucky Derby points (ranking): 5 (No. 30)\n\nKentucky Derby Future Wager Pool 4 odds: 15-1 (co-No. 3 choice)\n\nLast start: Second behind Dornoch in Grade 2 Remsen on Dec. 2 at Aqueduct\n\nPossible next start: Grade 2 Risen Star on Saturday at Fair Grounds\n\nNotable: Of the 346 horses nominated to the Triple Crown, Sierra Leone is the highest-priced at $2.3 million.

But closer to the church, the bells were drowned out by the sounds of marching bands playing as the procession of the saints set out to snake through the streets of Wilmington's Little Italy section.\n\nThe annual procession of saints is a tradition marking the end of the St. Anthony's Italian Festival.\n\nAlong the route families gathered, marking their spots with lawn chairs and gripping dollar bills to pass to honor their favored saints as the passed by.\n\nFor many, the procession is a welcome tradition that reminds them of years gone by and honors their proud Italian-American heritage.\n\n\"We have been doing this since I was a child,\" said Rosemary Delledonne Atallian.\n\nAs the procession goes by, their likenesses of saints are rolled along on carts by volunteers, others pass out keepsakes like mass cards and prayer medals in exchange for a dollar donation to the saint.\n\nAtallian said everyone has their favored saints and everyone has a different reason for donating to each.\n\n\"It depends on who we pray to,\" said said, noting she gives to Saint Gabriele, in honor of her father who shared the same name and Padre Pio because of the miracles he made.\n\nVince Divienzo said his mother, whom he speaks to lovingly in Italian, is the one who decides which saints to donate to, and he doesn't ask questions.\n\n\"There are certain saints that she has a connection to,\" Divinenzo said. \"But there have been some new ones today.\"\n\nDivienzo, who grew up in the community, but has since moved away, said he is lucky to bring his wife and daughter to participate in this tradition that he remembers so vividly as a child.\n\nFor Marie Gibbs the parade is a chance to see her friends from the parish parade down the street and give them a wave, but it also marks the end of the annual St. Anthony's Italian Festival.\n\nThe week-long event brings hundreds to the area each evening, causing many residents to save their parking spots with bright orange cones, trash cans or folding chairs.\n\n\"We complain every year, but every year when it comes around we go down and have a great time,\" Gibbs said.\n\nThis year the community saw large crowds even before the festival began as residents and dignitaries from across the state as well as Washington, D.C., came to St. Anthony's to honor Beau Biden, the son of Vice President Joe Biden, who died after a battle with brain cancer. Biden's funeral and viewing were held at the church bringing large crowds and secret service security to the area in the days leading up to the festival.\n\nContact Jenna Pizzi at jpizzi@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2837.

Our guide to the Italian Festival", "text": "Ken Mammarella\n\nSpecial to The News Journal\n\nSt. Anthony of Padua’s 42nd annual Italian Festival brings a Renaissance theme – and food and drink, music, expressions of faith, rides, games, handicrafts and more food and drink – to Wilmington, Sunday through June 19.\n\nThe festival, which boasts the third biggest crowds of any Delaware event – 73,000, after Firefly’s 90,000 and the Delaware State Fair’s 300,000 – this year will add a centuries-old tradition to its beloved final day parade. Women of all ages will carry baskets of flowers on their heads during the Procession of Saints, which steps off at 2 p.m. June 19 and winds through the streets of Little Italy.\n\nA sample, to the “Triumphal March” from “Aida,” is planned for the Gala Concert that opens the festival Sunday.\n\nThis tradition comes to Delaware from the Abruzzo town of Bucchianico.\n\n“It’s a celebration of nature being reborn at the beginning of the summer season and a way to increase the cultural component of the festival,” Anthony Albence, a fourth-generation parishioner and a member of the festival’s steering committee for 10 years.\n\nSTORY: Opa! Our guide to the Wilmington Greek Festival\n\nLinda Mionske and Roseann Detlefsen led the effort to create 75 baskets of silk flowers that vary in style and color.\n\nOfficials hope for a “reverent, spiritual and proud” effect by having women dress alike (black, white or Italian peasant outfit) and be in sync as they switch among carrying baskets on their heads and in their hands. (If the spirit moves, you still can get involved via ariannaalliance.org).\n\nCos'altro è nuovo? What else is new, you ask?\n\nScott Street is closing between Ninth and 10th streets, making room for a food court from Luigi & Giovanni of Newtown Square, Pennsylvania. The area will feature seats under five tents and a bar. The festival says the court’s 12 stations include “Italian fare not available in other areas at the festival – and often hard to come by at local Italian restaurants.”\n\nThat includes artisanal cheeses and meats, such as fior di latte mozzarella, soppressata and speck, Albence says.\n\nHere’s our insider’s guide to making the most of the big IF:\n\nCulture, food and fun: Those three tabs on www.stanthonysfestival.com spell out what draws perhaps those 73,000 people over eight days.\n\nThe festival, which benefits St. Anthony of Padua Grade School, culminates with a Feast Day Mass for St. Anthony, in Italian at 12:30 p.m. June 19, followed by the Procession of Saints. The church, a national historic landmark, will be lit up each night, and there are tours 5:30-8 p.m. Sunday, 6-8 p.m. Tuesday, Thursday and June 17 and 4:30-7:30 p.m. June 19. Participants in La Mia Piazza Italian Summer Camp will show off songs and skits at 3 p.m. June 18. A booth on dual Italian-American citizenship will be open at scattered times. Sales of devotional items benefit the Oblates of St. Francis de Sales.\n\nCeramics, biscotti jars, garden urns, jewelry and scarves were chosen for the festival marketplace to reflect the Renaissance’s “ethereal beauty” and “transformational spirit of this inspiring period.”\n\nThere are five major food areas, including indoors in the school and the new food court, and 10 bars. More popular items, such as spezzato, porkette and even the meatballs are known to sell out, he said.\n\nMajestic Midways again brings 20 rides on the midway and Kiddie Land and a half-dozen games.\n\nContemporary music is every night on three outdoor stages. The Concerti sul Sagrato (Concerts in the Courtyard) feature traditional Italian music and contemporary music each evening at 7, on an outdoor stage or in the church.\n\nThe nitty-gritty: The festival is open 2-10:30 p.m. Sunday, 5:30-10:30 p.m. Monday-June 17 and 2-8:30 p.m. June 18-19. Admission is $5 for ages 14-61 and free for seniors over 61. Children under 14 get in free when accompanied by an adult (over 18). Weekly passes are $15 on-site.\n\nPark it right here: The festival covers most of the territory between Lincoln and Howland streets and du Pont and 11th streets. Street parking might not be easy to find, particularly since residents of nearby streets are known – even though Wilmington doesn’t allow it – to reserve spots with lawn chairs or other items. “We do not actively go out and police the area residents who try and reserve their spots,” said city Police Department spokeswoman Sgt. Andrea Janvier. “However, we do make it clear that individuals can park in those spaces and move the objects blocking the space out of the way.”\n\nThat said, Albence urges parking at the Wilmington Riverfront and taking the festival shuttle.\n\nStep right up for these deals: On Monday, a $30 Family Fun Night wristband will cover all rides. On Monday through Thursday, the Early Bird Special means all rides are one less ticket from 5:30-7 p.m. (and it’s less crowded, Albence said). A weekly pass is $12 online.\n\nNow that’s Italian: Knowing these terms will make the festival more enjoyable.\n\n• Sfilata dei Fiori: That’s the new Procession of Flowers accompanying the Procession of Saints (Festa Patronale). The floral addition is organized by the Alleanza per il Rinascimento degli’ Italiani Americani Nel Nord America, which generates the acronym ARIANNA and is translated as the Alliance for the Renaissance of Italian Americans in North America.\n\n• A salumeria is an Italian delicatessen. Porkette served abbondanza is a stuffed roast pork sandwich. (My grandfather, who was born five miles from Bucchianico, often lectured young family members with that one word. I felt it meant both “don’t overeat” and “appreciate all the choice you have.”) If you’re stumble over other menu terms, someone’s always available to explain, Albence said.\n\n• Per favore means “please,” and grazie means “thank you.” He said other good words to know are scusi (“sorry,” if you bump into someone), delizioso (“delicious”) and ciao (both “hello” and “goodbye”). And then there’s paesano. “It can mean a member of the family, a member of the parish family or a member of the festival family,” he said. “Everyone is a paesano the week of the festival.”\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nWHAT: St. Anthony’s 2016 Italian Festival, 901 N.

(Oh, and they expanded curbside pickup, too.)\n\n“We have found that there’s a great amount of demand for the festival on weekdays,” says George Rassias, parish president, who leans on an army of more than 100 volunteers for the festival each year. “So we’re going to give it a shot and see how our volunteers respond.\n\n“We have no doubt the community will support an extra day, but for the volunteers at the parish, it’s a lot. Some of them are older, and it’s a lot of work to be on your feet for that many hours.”\n\nThe event at Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church (808 N. Broom St.), a celebration of all things Greek from the food and dance to music, kicks off at 11 a.m. Monday.\n\nBut let’s face it, the food is the star.\n\nFrom Monday through Saturday, June 8, you’ll find traditional Greek comfort food inside at the Hellenic Community Center (11 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.) with everything from pastichio ($10 Greek lasagna) and moussaka ($10 eggplant, potato and seasoned beef casserole) to dolmades ($5 stuffed grape leaves) and spanakopita ($6 spinach pie).\n\nOther delicacies include chicken and orzo ($11), lamb and orzo ($18), tyropita ($6) and keftedes ($3).\n\nThere’s a free lunch shuttle from downtown Wilmington, running from Ninth and Market every 10 minutes from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. for those looking for a midday festival experience.\n\nWhile a daytime visit might scratch that Greek food itch, nighttime is the right time for the full festival experience.\n\nThat’s when the outdoor food stands sling gyros ($9), calamari ($9) and souvlaki ($9) from 5 to 11 p.m. as the Philadelphia-based Greek orchestra Atlantis plays under the stars for its 32nd year at the festival.\n\nYes, the line will probably be long for outdoor food, but that’s almost part of the tradition at this point. In recent years, festival organizers have made a quick lunch pickup easier than ever. And for 2019, they are expanding it further.\n\nOrder online at greekfestde.com or by using their mobile app (GreekFest DE) and pick up curbside between 11 a.m. and 9 p.m. each day of the festival. (It previously stopped at 2 p.m.)\n\nIf the Greek fest puts you in festival mode, you might want to unbuckle that belt. St. Anthony’s Italian Festival in Wilmington kicks off immediately following Holy Trinity’s festival, running from Sunday, June 9, to Sunday, June 16.\n\nGo to stanthonysfestival.com for a complete schedule.\n\nGot a tip?

Politics. Secrets. Family. Murder.\n\nLurid elements swirling around the capital murder trial of wealthy Wilmington lawyer Thomas Capano captivated the public and made it one of the most sensational and dramatic court cases in Delaware history.\n\nTwenty years ago on Jan. 17, 1999 — a frigid, Sunday morning — a jury found Capano guilty of killing 30-year-old Anne Marie Fahey, a scheduling secretary for then-Gov. Tom Carper.\n\nIt was one of very few first-degree U.S. murder cases that got a conviction even though there was no body, no weapon and no witness to the killing. The prosecution was led by Colm F. Connolly, a then 33-year-old assistant U.S. attorney who had never before tried a murder case.\n\nThe crime\n\nFahey, a single, insecure woman, was trying to end her secret relationship with 49-year-old Capano, a married man with four daughters, who also had other mistresses. After a night dining out in Philadelphia, Capano apparently shot Fahey at his rented home in Wilmington's Highlands neighborhood and jammed her body into a cooler.\n\nCapano's two brothers Louis and Gerry helped him get rid of evidence and later testified against him. So did his other girlfriend, Deborah A. MacIntyre, who had bought a gun for her lover.\n\nGerry Capano said he took his older brother out onto his boat off the coast of New Jersey to dispose of the body. When the cooler wouldn't sink after firing a bullet into it, Tom Capano then dumped Fahey's body into the Atlantic Ocean. The cooler floated away and was later found by fishermen. They turned it over to authorities.\n\nFahey's remains and the gun have never been recovered.\n\nThe trial\n\nDuring the trial, Connolly, the young, unflappable federal prosecutor who led the investigation, endured Capano's intense hatred, which included verbal attacks. At one point, Capano had even planned to put a hit on him.\n\nJudge William Swain Lee sentenced Capano to death. It was later overturned. Capano died of a heart attack on Sept. 19, 2011, at age 61 at the Vaughn Correctional Center near Smyrna, where he was serving the life sentence.\n\nThe conviction was a stunning fall from grace for Capano, who had once counseled a Delaware governor and mayor and was the privileged, eldest son of a well-known Italian custom home builder.\n\nFrom Fahey's disappearance on June 27, 1996, to Capano's conviction on Jan. 17, 1999, the public devoured every morsel of information uncovered. The trial, which took many twists and turns, spawned four books and a 2001 TV movie that starred Mark Harmon as Capano.\n\n\"I do believe this case served as a model for the principle that no one is above the law,\" said Connolly, who never tried a murder case again. He is now a U.S. District Court Judge.\n\n\"No matter how wealthy you are, no matter how well-connected you are, when the justice system works, you will pay the penalty for criminal actions,\" he said.\n\n12 things we learned\n\nOn the 20th anniversary of Capano's arrest, News Journal reporters Patricia Talorico and Esteban Parra combed through records and evidence still in a Wilmington courthouse vault, and interviewed participants involved in the case.\n\nCapano's attorneys Eugene J. Maurer Jr., Joseph S. Oteri, and Joseph A. Hurley; prosecutors Colm F. Connolly and Ferris W. Wharton; Judge William Swain Lee; key juror Erin Reilly Lee; former News Journal reporter Valerie Helmbreck; and Wilmington restaurateur Anthony Stella all shared with The News Journal exclusive, never-heard-before details about the case.\n\nHere's a look back on what they said:\n\nJury initially split on Capano's guilt\n\nErin Reilly Lee, also known as Juror No. 8, said the first thing the jury did when they went in to deliberate was to take a vote.\n\nLee, 28 years old at the time, said the vote was half guilty, half not guilty.\n\nBut during deliberations, the jury's attention turned to the white, 40 1/2-gallon, Igloo cooler.\n\nCapano had apparently stuffed the 5-foot-10-inch body of Fahey into the ice chest after she was shot to death at his home with a gun bought by MacIntyre.\n\nIn court testimony, Capano said he laid Fahey's body into the cooler on her side. He said he pushed her knees into a fetal position but insisted he broke no bones. Capano also said he had wrapped her body in a cotton blanket.\n\nLee, who was just a few inches shorter and weighed about the same as Fahey, agreed to climb into the 3-foot-8-inch hard-plastic cooler. Lee, who left her high heels on to compensate for Fahey's height, wanted to see if a body would fit.\n\nAs Lee squirmed inside the cooler, the lid wouldn't close. And that's when some of the jurors realized Fahey's bones might have been broken, or worse, to make the corpse fit.\n\nThe macabre situation, and the enormity of what had happened to Fahey, suddenly became overwhelming.\n\nA traumatized Lee asked a bailiff to escort her to her hotel bedroom. The climb into the cooler-turned-casket helped convince Erin Reilly Lee and the jury of five other women and six men that Capano was a manipulative liar, a cold-blooded killer.\n\nAfter crying in her hotel room, Lee said she spoke to Fahey: \"I'm just so sorry. I'm so sorry that this happened to you.\"\n\n'Killing a human being? That's the end of friendship'\n\nDefense attorney Joseph A. Hurley vowed he'd take to his grave the reasons why he quit Capano's legal team six months before the October 1998 murder trial began.\n\nBut he didn't.\n\nIn November 2017, Hurley shared with The News Journal that he decided to quit during a moment of reflection and moral clarity while attending a funeral Mass at St. Helena's Catholic Church in Penny Hill.\n\nDespite what many believed, Hurley said Capano never confessed to him that he murdered Fahey.\n\n\"I can only surmise that there was something making me feel like I was falling into an evil pit, and this conversation, if that's what you have with God, [went] 'Joe, you're not like this. You can't be this way, '\" Hurley said.\n\n\"I think I was probably facing the reality [Capano] was, in fact, guilty of premeditated murder.\"\n\nHurley said he left the church, went to see Capano in prison and quit the defense team.\n\nHurley said he never saw Capano again.\n\n\"Killing a human being? No,” Hurley said. \"That's the end of friendship.\"\n\nOnly in Delaware – Part I\n\nProsecutor Ferris Wharton and family members had some Only in Delaware encounters with the Capanos before and after the trial.\n\n\"I knew Capano, not well, just basically to say 'hello,'\" said Wharton, now a Superior Court judge. \"We weren't friends. He was the kind of person you would see at the check-out line at Acme.\"\n\n\"The longest conversation I had with him was in the dog park at Rockford Park. We each had black Labrador retrievers. He told me about Labrador retrievers. He talked like he knew all about them. He went on and on.\"\n\nWharton said not too long before Capano's arrest, he saw him while walking his dog down Wilmington's Delaware Avenue. Capano was coming out of a liquor store on Union Street.\n\n\"He said, 'Can I still say hello?' I go, 'Yeah, OK.'\"\n\nWharton said, years later, family members had an encounter with a main witness from the trial.\n\n\"My brother's wife was driving near Brandywine Creek State Park and she hit some black ice and ran off the road. No damage or anything. She called my brother and he came out. This guy comes up with a pickup truck with a tow on it. He pulled their car out of the ditch. My brother wants to give him money. And the guy's refusing. My brother's insisting and the guy's still refusing.\n\n\"Finally, my brother said, 'Well, thank you. What's your name?'\n\nAnd he said, 'Gerry Capano.'\"\n\nDream Team became 'a nightmare'\n\nCriminal defense lawyer Eugene J. Maurer Jr. was at first thrilled with the prospect of representing Capano.\n\nMaurer said the excitement slowly ebbed as the case wore on.\n\n\"Having gotten a taste of what was to come in representing Mr. Capano,\" Maurer said he wanted to withdraw soon after Hurley, \"but was concerned that the simultaneous withdrawal of both attorneys would have a deleterious impact on Tom's public posture.\"\n\nThings quickly went from bad to worse, Maurer said, especially when Capano decided that his chances would be better by hiring an outsider from Boston, where he had attended school at Boston College.\n\n\"Joe Oteri arrived on the scene with a lot of bluster to assume the role of lead counsel at Tom's urging. We were later joined by a Florida attorney who had attended school with Tom and showed up uninvited at the prison, proceeding to convince Tom that he would be an invaluable part of the defense team,\" Maurer said.\n\nDespite being called the \"Dream Team,\" Maurer said \"the defense in this case became a nightmare. [Attorney Charles] Oberly and I took a back seat as lead counsel Oteri orchestrated the weekly meetings with Tom at the prison where the two of them would try to out-manipulate the other.\"\n\nSaid Maurer: \"Tom was an impossible client, pushing the envelope at all times and making the representation quite unpleasant. Ethical boundaries were of no consideration to him in formulating his defense strategy, as was demonstrated by the evidence at trial.\"\n\n\"Instead of a challenging and fulfilling professional experience, the representation of Tom Capano was one of the most depressing and disappointing professional experiences of my life,\" he said.\n\nTaking a lawyer for a client: Bad mistake\n\nBoston attorney Joseph S. Oteri, whose clients have included drug dealers, was referred to Capano in 1998.\n\nOteri's brash style became one of the trial's hallmarks, but he said the defense was full of challenges. \"I made a bad mistake in taking a lawyer for a client.\"\n\nOteri said being Capano's attorney \"didn't make me feel anything but pissed off because I kept saying, 'You're paying me an enormous fee and you're not listening to me. How stupid can you be?'\"\n\nOteri said the trial \"was not a very pleasant experience. The only good thing about it was Bill Lee. He was a good judge. He's a decent human being. He knows the law. He applies it without fear of favor. He takes no shit from anybody and he's a pleasure to work in front of.\"\n\nHe also added, \"the two prosecutors were straight as arrows. They didn't take any cheap shots. They were very honorable men and they tried a hell of a case.\"\n\nHe 'thinks they are going to fall in love with him'\n\nJudge William Swain Lee could not talk to the media during the trial or for years after. But the judge, now retired, shared several never-heard-before nuggets about the Capano trial in a November 2017 interview with The News Journal.\n\nLee said the jury selection was memorable.\n\n\"After the first two jurors had been picked, three straight selections involved single women in their mid- to late-20s. Attractive ladies. Under the circumstances, that wasn't what you expected the defense to be allowing,\" Lee said.\n\nAnne Marie Fahey was a young, attractive woman.\n\n\"The defense attorneys called a sidebar, came up and wanted to go on record that all four of his attorneys had recommended dismissing these three jurors, but Capano insisted on seating them,\" Lee said.\n\n\"They wanted the record made clear that should not be a basis for questioning their competence during the proceedings.\"\n\n\"As we were leaving, Mr. Oteri, the lead defense attorney and certainly the most flamboyant of the group, said, 'Can I go off the record, Judge?'\n\n\"And I went, 'Sure. Off the record.'\"\n\n\"Oteri said: 'The dumb son of a bitch thinks they are going to fall in love with him.'\"\n\n\"And I think that was true,\" Lee said. \"He thought he was going to be able to charm them.\"\n\nLee said he never knew Capano \"personally, when he had the reputation of being a charming man, but in the setting in which I knew him, he was more rodent-like. He was a frightening, scary figure. There was nothing charming about him at all.\"\n\nThe reappearance of the cooler\n\nThe cooler Capano used for Fahey's body was discovered off Indian River Inlet, about 100 miles from where it had been thrown into the ocean.\n\nFishermen turned it over to authorities after reading about Capano's arrest in the newspaper. Lee said it it was astonishing that the cooler had been found.\n\n\"My reaction was Tom Capano should know there really is a God now. It's certainly stranger than fiction, the truth,\" Lee said.\n\nOnly in Delaware - Part II\n\nColm Connelly said the trial \"was the ultimate professional experience I will ever have, and I was very young to have had it.\"\n\nIn another Only in Delaware moment, Connolly told The News Journal he once had a brief chat with Anne Marie Fahey while she worked for then-Gov. Tom Carper.\n\n\"I actually had spoken with her once on the phone, as it turns out. I was chairman of the Delaware Hospice Festival of Trees, an annual fundraiser, and we needed to schedule the governor to speak. I ended up scheduling it through Anne Marie. But I didn't know who she was other than that phone call.\"\n\nAnd there was a very brief meeting with Capano well before the investigation\n\n\"I was a very junior prosecutor on a team of prosecutors who prosecuted Kermit Justice, who had been Delaware's Secretary of Transportation. [In 1992], Bill Carpenter, Bob Prettyman and I were on a conference call with Tom Capano who was, at that point, legal counsel to Mike Castle, then the governor. It had to do with the fact that Kermit Justice had been indicted [on several charges in connection with an FBI sting operation]. I didn't say a word during the conservation ... Other than that, I didn't know anything about him.\"\n\nA meeting in Acme set things in motion\n\nConnolly said on a July Fourth weekend in 1996 he was at the Acme Market on U.S. 202 when he ran into Judge Greg Sleet, then the U.S. Attorney and Connolly's boss.\n\n\"The lead story of The News Journal that day was President Clinton offered federal assistance [to find Anne Marie Fahey, who had not been seen since June 27]. Judge Greg Sleet and I laughed, because Greg Sleet was the U.S. attorney, so he was the chief federal law enforcement officer, and nobody had contacted him. If you were really going to get the feds involved, you would contact him,\" Connolly said.\n\n\"He said, 'Well, I'll call over to Wilmington, and we'll offer our services.' The next working day, July 8, the FBI called us.\"\n\nConversation with Capano 'reeked of manipulation and coercion'\n\nFormer News Journal reporter Valerie Helmbreck in the summer of 1996 received a phone call at her Hockessin home from Tom Capano.\n\nHelmbreck had been working on stories about Fahey for weeks and calls to Capano’s lawyers asking for interviews had gone nowhere.\n\nFor about 90 minutes, Capano had an “off the record” conversation with Helmbreck that couldn't be used in a story.\n\nHelmbreck said Capano was \"trying to seduce me into seeing his vision of Anne Marie Fahey, seeing his version of reality. Only I wasn’t buying it. I was older, more secure, happily married, and frankly, I’d been played by better.\"\n\nHelmbreck wrote in a November 2017 essay for The News Journal that the conversation \"reeked of manipulation and coercion. It was a combination of little boy charm and school yard bullying, in equal measure.\"\n\nAt the end of the phone call, Capano agreed to an on-the-record interview. He never did the promised interview.\n\nAfter his phone call, Capano parked his car at the end of the street where Helmbreck's daycare provider lived and waited for her to pass by.\n\n\"I never did figure out why, but I know it made me uncomfortable. I still find the memory chilling,\" she said.\n\nItalian restaurant scene of out-of-courtroom encounters\n\nAnthony J. Stella once owned a popular Italian eatery, L’Osteria Cucina Italiana, on Marsh Road in Penny Hill. It closed in December 2004.\n\nWhen it was operating, the intimate Italian restaurant was visited by some of the big names on both sides of the Capano murder trial.\n\nThe restaurant also is mentioned in at least one letter Capano mistress Deborah MacIntyre wrote to Capano while he was in prison.\n\n\"A day or two before Tommy was arrested, the place was real busy and Tommy was standing at the bar. I knew what was going on, but played dumb,\" Stella wrote in a 2017 essay for The News Journal.\n\n\"When I greeted him, we talked about how crazy our lives were and he said, “I guess you’ve heard about me?”\n\n\"I said, 'No, what’s up?'\n\n\"He told me that he was a suspect in a murder case.\n\n\"I asked, 'Well, did you?'\n\n\"He responded, 'No.'\n\n\"We both laughed. I think he was arrested a couple of days later.\"\n\n'I think it was suicide by food'\n\nIn 2006, Capano's death sentence was overturned. A life sentence was his punishment.\n\nYears of confinement and isolation on death row had begun to take its toll. Capano, overweight with sallow skin and a wispy, white beard, no longer resembled the fit, polished, man-about-town he had once been.\n\n\"He had gained a massive amount of weight since the trial,\" Connolly said.\n\n\"He ate himself to death; there's no question about it,\" said Judge Lee, who never saw Capano again after sentencing him to death.\n\n\"His father died of a heart attack, he knew he had a heart condition. Once his appeals ran out, I think it was suicide by food,\" said Lee, who retired from the bench nine months after the trial.\n\nContact Esteban Parra at (302) 324-2299, eparra@delawareonline.com or Twitter @eparra3.
