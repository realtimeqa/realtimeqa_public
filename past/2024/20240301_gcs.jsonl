SPUTNIK/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPutin has assembled 70% of the military personnel and weapons it would need for a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, based on the latest US intelligence estimates, but US officials say they still don’t know whether Russia’s leader has decided to launch an attack. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied it is planning an incursion, but has argued that NATO support for the country constitutes a growing threat to Russia.\n\nMacron praised Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s “sangfroid” on Monday, saying that he has shown “self-restraint” in the face of growing Russian military activity on its borders.\n\n“President Zelensky is the president of a country on whose borders there are 120,000 Russian troops, and I would say that that would make one worry,” Macron said.\n\nThe crunch talks between Putin and Macron came as US President Joe Biden met with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Washington, DC on Monday.\n\nUkraine was top of the agenda, Biden said. The US President said that the two leaders “developed a strong package of sanctions that clearly demonstrate international resolve and impose swift and severe consequences if Russia violates Ukraine’s sovereignty,” warning that “it cannot be business and usual if Russia invades.”\n\nWhile the Biden administration has sought to demonstrate a united Western front against Putin’s aggression, Scholz has largely watched from the sidelines as the crisis escalates – drawing criticism and questions over Germany’s willingness to confront Moscow.\n\nOn Monday, one key sticking point between the US and Germany appeared to remain: the future of the contentious Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which is meant to bring natural gas from Russia to Germany.\n\nBiden was explicit the project wouldn’t go forward if Russia invades Ukraine, however Scholz refused to even name the project during a news conference, and declined to commit to ending the pipeline if an invasion moves ahead.\n\nScholz, who succeeded Angela Merkel in December, has, so far, taken a softer approach on Russia than the US and its allies. Germany has not joined the US, France, Spain and other allies in bolstering troops along NATO’s eastern flank. It has also been reluctant to provide lethal aid, refusing to allow NATO ally, Estonia, to send German-made howitzers to Ukraine and drawing mockery for sending thousands of helmets instead of weapons.\n\nSome experts have suggested that the pipeline project may be the reason why it’s not taking a more prominent role. In an apparent attempt to refute that criticism, Scholz will visit Russia and Ukraine later this month.\n\nAs Putin tests the West’s resolve, Macron has thrust himself to center stage, taking Merkel’s place as leading mediator for Europe as he readies himself for a re-election bid at home. Currently at the helm of the European Union’s rotating presidency, Macron has spoken several times per week with Putin, and placed his third phone call in a week to Biden on Sunday evening.\n\nAccording to a statement from the Elysee Palace, Macron and Biden agreed Sunday to capitalize on the “positive progress” made in the Normandy Format – a grouping of France, Germany, Ukraine and Russia – to bolster the Minsk agreements, a ceasefire protocol signed by Ukraine and Russia in 2015 after Russia annexed Crimea and fomented a rebellion in Ukraine’s east. Despite the agreement, the two sides have not seen a stable peace.\n\nThe French president, who in 2019 said bluntly that Europe was facing the “brain death of NATO,” caused by American indifference to the transatlantic alliance, and has called on the EU to take on a larger role in Europe’s defense, is now getting a chance to lay out his vision for what a Europe more independent from US influence might look like.\n\nTo Moscow, Macron has presented himself as a “quality interlocutor,” as Putin described him, according to an official in the French presidency. The official told reporters Friday that among Macron’s agenda for the talks was to try to balance “the new order of security in Europe, including guarantees of regional security and the role and capacity of the European Union in taking charge of its own security,” alongside his commitments to the US and NATO.\n\nThe stakes could not be higher. Macron is seeking to stop the massive Russian military buildup of more than 100,000 soldiers from bubbling over into war and soothe Russia’s security grievances, which include demands that Ukraine and Georgia be blocked from ever becoming members of the alliance and a drawdown of troops in the region.\n\n“I’m reasonably optimistic but I don’t believe in spontaneous miracles,” Macron told reporters on the flight to the Russian capital, according to CNN affiliate BFM TV, which was traveling with the French president.\n\nMoscow, on the other hand, had been more cautious about the planned meeting. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said earlier on Monday the Russian government had seen “nothing new” in response to its security demands.\n\n“For now, the atmosphere remains extremely tense,” Peskov added.", "authors": ["Eliza Mackintosh Nathan Hodge Uliana Pavolva Dalal Mawad Nada Bashir", "Eliza Mackintosh", "Nathan Hodge", "Uliana Pavolva Dalal Mawad", "Nada Bashir"], "publish_date": "2022/02/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/11/europe/france-emmanuel-macron-pcr-putin-meeting-intl/index.html", "title": "Why the big table in Moscow? Macron refused a Russian Covid test ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThere’s socially distanced, and then there’s French President Emmanuel Macron sitting on the opposite end of an enormous table during talks with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin on Monday.\n\nThere is now insight as to why: The French leader declined the Kremlin’s request for a Russian Covid-19 test, the Elysee Palace said Thursday. On Friday, an Elysee spokesperson refused to comment on media reports that Macron did not want Russian doctors getting their hands on his DNA.\n\nThe two men spent more than five hours sitting at the table – estimated to be up to 20 feet (six meters) long – for head-to-head talks on how to diffuse a potential conflict in Ukraine.\n\nMacron was seeking to stop the massive Russian military buildup of more than 100,000 soldiers from turning into war and to assuage Russia’s security grievances, which include demands that Ukraine and Georgia be blocked from ever becoming members of NATO and for the alliance to draw down troops in Eastern Europe.\n\nBut the table itself drew significant attention, with its length shocking many observers and triggering a wave of internet memes.\n\nOn Friday, an Elysee spokesperson explained the French side “judged that the conditions that allowed for a shorter distance [between the presidents during their talks] were not acceptable to us and we chose the other option proposed by the Russian [Covid-19] protocol. That is all.”\n\n“The president has of course always done what he has to do when he travels,” the spokesperson said. “The question is just based on the test conditions.”\n\nAs to the Reuters report about Macron not wanting Russia to have access to his DNA, the spokesperson said it “did not merit launching into particular fantasies.”\n\nWhile refusing to provide details of the test conditions, the spokesperson said there were concerns about who would do the test, how the tests would be taken and their timings.\n\n“The president has doctors who define with him the rules that are acceptable or not in terms of the health protocols relating to him. Period,” the Elysee spokesperson added.\n\nThe conditions that would have allowed a meeting with less distance imposed a Russian health protocol which “seemed neither acceptable nor compatible with our agenda constraints,” the Elysee Palace said on Thursday.\n\nThe Kremlin confirmed that the French side was unwilling to comply with the Kremlin Covid-19 testing protocol that would have led to a more intimate setting.\n\nAsked if Macron decided not to take a PCR test administered by Russian doctors, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters Friday: “Yes, indeed.”\n\n“In some situations, Putin meets with his guests sitting very close by one another, they shake hands,” he said. “With others, negotiations are held at a table, at a distance of approximately six meters.”\n\nPeskov added: “This is due to the fact that some leaders follow their own rules and they do not interact with the host side in sharing tests. We treat this with understanding, this is a normal global practice but, in this case, there is a protocol of additional measures to protect the health of our president and our guests as well. A larger distance is applied.\n\nThe meeting ended with the Kremlin pouring cold water on reports that the two leaders had agreed to de-escalate the tense standoff on Ukraine’s border, where tens of thousands of Russian forces have massed in recent months, drawing warnings from Western officials of an impending invasion.\n\nAs Putin tests the West’s resolve, Macron has thrust himself to center stage, taking former German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s place as leading mediator for Europe as he readies himself for a reelection bid at home.

We will do whatever it takes to ensure that Russia cannot win this war.\"\n\nMacron wouldn’t say which countries might be mulling European boots on the Ukrainian ground, citing the need for “strategic ambiguity.”\n\nRelated:'The last thing we need': Barack Obama jumps into the fray after Donald Trump attacks NATO\n\n'No' in several languages\n\nWhere the French president spoke of ambiguity, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg instead dished clarity, telling the Associated Press on Tuesday there are “no plans for NATO combat troops on the ground in Ukraine.”\n\nOther leaders piled on. “There will be no ground troops, no soldiers on Ukrainian soil who are sent there by European states or NATO states,” German Chancellor Olaf Scholz told reporters Monday after a meeting of 20 leaders and diplomats hosted by Macron.\n\nPrime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland said Tuesday that his country’s troops would not fight in Ukraine, and Czech Republic Prime Minister Petr Fiala said his country “certainly doesn’t want to send its soldiers.”\n\nWhile making clear that President Joe Biden has ruled out any U.S. forces fighting in Ukraine, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby was less equivocal about European armies. \"It's a sovereign decision that every NATO ally would have to make for themselves,\" he said Tuesday. \"There'll be no U.S. troops on the ground in a combat role there.\"\n\nAnd the Kremlin seized on Macron’s comments to warn of the first-ever combat between Russian and NATO troops. “In this case, we need to talk not about probability, but about the inevitability” of direct fighting between Moscow’s forces and those of the Western military alliance, spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.\n\nRelated:Senate releases $118 billion package addressing southern border, aid for Ukraine and Israel\n\nUS support: From 'as long as it takes' to 'as long as we can'\n\nMacron's remarks came amid dismal reports from Ukraine, where troops are struggling to hold off the Russians amid an ammunition shortage and waning U.S. assistance.\n\nAfter nine months of stalemate, Russian forces recently took control of the eastern Ukrainian city of Avdiivka, and Moscow continues to hold nearly 20% of Ukrainian territory.

Earlier this month, European leaders pledged $54 billion in economic aid, for a total of $150 billion since Russia’s 2022 invasion.\n\nThe U.S., for its part, has sent $74.3 billion in military, financial, and humanitarian aid, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nMore:Mitch McConnell says Donald Trump made Ukraine aid package 'doubly challenging' as he fights for deal\n\nSome countries are 'ready' to send troops, Slovakian leader says\n\nIn remarks on Monday, Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico, who opposes military aid to Ukraine, said he had heard that some countries were considering bilateral deals to send troops.\n\n\"There are countries that are ready to send their own soldiers to Ukraine, there are countries that say never – Slovakia is among them – and there are countries that say that this proposal should be considered,\" Fico said.\n\nWhile many Western leaders were aghast at the French president’s suggestion, it received a warm welcome in Kyiv.\n\n\"Macron is now demonstrating a deep understanding of the risks posed to Europe by the war in Ukraine,\" Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak told the AFP news service on Tuesday. \"The French president's statement clearly takes the discussion to another level,\" he added.\n\n\"This is a good sign,\" Podolyak said.\n\nMore:Sweden clears last hurdle to join NATO: Five graphics and maps\n\nUS isn't 'eager' to see European troops in Ukraine\n\nMax Bergmann, director of the Europe, Russia, and Eurasia program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Macron was likely trying to signal to the Kremlin that Europe would consider all options in the defense of Ukraine − even though the likelihood of French troops actually fighting Russian forces was minuscule.\n\nIn the event French troops ever land in Ukraine, they would probably serve as technical advisors for the advanced missile systems that France and other countries have pledged to their embattled ally, far from the front lines.\n\nAnd, despite Kirby's diplomatic response to the French president, \"I don't think the U.S. is eager to see any NATO member boots on the ground,\" Bergmann said. \"It could produce additional pressure on the U.S. to do the same.\n\nMore:Donald Trump threatens NATO, says he would 'encourage' Russia to 'do whatever the hell they want'\n\nContributing: Swapna Venugopal, USA TODAY; Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/10/donald-trump-france-veterans-day/1942830002/", "title": "President Donald Trump meets French counterpart Emmanuel Macron", "text": "PARIS – While preoccupied with issues at home, President Donald Trump sat down Saturday with French counterpart Emmanuel Macron to discuss differences that revolve around Trump's more nationalist approach to global problems.\n\n\"We want to help Europe, but it has to be fair,\" Trump told Macron just hours after he and his French host clashed over American defense commitments in Europe. \"Right now, the burden sharing has been largely on the United States.\"\n\nMacron, who has proposed creating a \"European army\" because of what he sees as wavering U.S. support, told Trump his idea backs up the American's call for more burden sharing by Europe.\n\n\"We need more European capacities, more European defense,\" Macron said, speaking in both French and English.\n\nAfter Trump arrived at Elysee Palace on a gray and rainy morning, he and and Macron shook hands (briefly), smiled, and gave photographers thumbs-up signs, the morning after their very public clash about U.S. defense commitments in Europe.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nThings looked more tense before the actual meeting; Trump sat grim-faced as Macron smiled and gestured toward the U.S. president.\n\nWhile Trump traveled to Paris for World War I commemorations this weekend, his nationalistic criticism of long-standing global alliances – many of them built from the ashes of both world wars in the last century – has hovered over the proceedings.\n\nJust before Air Force One landed in Paris on Friday night, Trump tweeted criticism of Macron for his European army proposal, and again complained that European partners in the NATO military alliance are not paying enough for their own defense.\n\nThe president is among some 60 world leaders in France to mark the 100th anniversary of the end of the First World War. In an early morning tweet, Trump said, \"is there anything better to celebrate than the end of a war, in particular that one, which was one of the bloodiest and worst of all time?\"\n\nThe bilateral Macron-Trump meeting came a day before celebrations kickoff at the Arc de Triomphe for a ceremony to honor the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I.\n\nOther World War I ceremonies are taking place throughout France and Europe this week, some involving Trump – though he canceled a trip Saturday to the Ainse-Marne American Cemetery and Memorial due to what a White House statement called \"scheduling and logistical difficulties caused by the weather.\"\n\nAn American delegation led by Chief of Staff General John Kelly and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joe Dunford attended the cemetery ceremony instead.\n\nOn Saturday night, the U.S. president and first lady Melania Trump are scheduled to attend a ceremonial dinner at Musee D’Orsay, the former train station turned into an iconic Impressionism art museum on the banks of the Seine river.\n\nDomestic issues are also on the president's mind, less than a week after Democrats won control of the U.S. House in congressional elections on Tuesday, and after Trump dismissed Attorney General Jeff Sessions the next day.\n\nBefore departing for Elysse Palace and his meeting with Macron, Trump tweeted support for his new acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, the subject of criticism for his attacks on the special counsel investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nTrump tweeted complaints about California wildfires, saying the reason is that \"forest management is so poor.\"\n\nWhile Macon has made a priority of getting along with the U.S. president, the French leader has also criticized Trump for pulling out of international agreements, including the Iran nuclear agreement and the Paris climate change accord.\n\nOfficials in Europe have also questioned Trump's desire to befriend Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is threatening other countries and seeking to undermine the western alliance.\n\nIn recent days, Macron criticized Trump's decision to withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF), a 1987 arms control deal designed to prohibit Russia from developing mid-range missiles capable of reaching Western European cities.\n\nThat move inspired Macron's call for a European army. In an interview with Europe 1 radio, he said such a force may be needed because \"we have to protect ourselves with respect to China, Russia and even the United States of America.”\n\nTrump's tweeted response while landing in Paris: \"President Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the U.S., China and Russia. Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the U.S. subsidizes greatly!\"\n\nRichard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, said Macron's idea is reasonable because Trump has questioned the need for NATO's \"Article 5\" requirement that all members of the alliance will come to the aid of any member that is attacked.\n\nIt \"is not insulting but rather what you get when the Potus raises doubts about NATO’s Article 5, slaps tariffs on allies, calls the EU a foe, cozies up to Putin, signals support for the National Front, and unilaterally breaks w int’l pacts,\" Haass tweeted.\n\nAt the heart of the dispute is Trump's self-proclaimed \"America First\" foreign policy, and his claim that he is a \"nationalist.\"\n\nCelia Belin, visiting fellow and expert in French politics with The Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., said Trump's brand of nationalism is worrisome to global leaders who fear that Americans \"do not feel they need to lead the world anymore.\"\n\n\"America First\" and other forms of nationalism could encourage \"rogue regimes\" to threaten their neighbors, Belin said, though the situation is not yet dire.\n\n\"The United States is still the dominant power out there – the Atlantic alliance is still alive,\" Belin said. \"But his (Trump's) foreign policy weakened some of the elements.\"\n\nTrump and his supporters equate nationalism with patriotism, and opposition to a form of \"globalism\" that puts the United States at a disadvantage.\n\nCritics say that despots throughout history have promoted a brand of nationalism designed to have their country impose power on others, often with a racial and ethnic components.\n\nIt's the kind of nationalism that says \"I care only about my people, they are special and have a right to look out only for themselves and to do what they want to anyone else,\" said Margaret MacMillan, professor of history at the University of Toronto and author of \"Paris 1919: Six Months That Changed The World.\"\n\n\"I think Trump’s kind of nationalism is closer to that end of the spectrum,\" she said.\n\nMacron and other world leaders have also described the rise of nationalism on their continent, including Poland and Hungary.\n\nTrump and Macron have often made a show of getting along — this is Trump's second special visit to Paris, following last year's attendance at the Bastille Day parade — and tried to do so again on Saturday.\n\nThere have also been some tense moments. Most famously, at their first meeting in 2017, Trump and Macron appeared to engage in a macho handshaking contest to determine who could make the toughest grip.\n\nSaturday's handshakes looked brief and pro forma, even as photographers snapped shots of clasped hands. Before their meeting, Macron smiled and often touched Trump on the shoulder as he thanked him for the visit to Paris.\n\nTrump also complimented Macron, but mostly wore a frown and did not return his host's pats on the back.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/11/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/03/19/ukraine-news-russia-invasion-updates/7110747001/", "title": "Ukraine rejects Russia's demand to surrender Mariupol in exchange ...", "text": "Editor's note: This page recaps the news from Ukraine on Sunday, March 20.

Apply them to more sectors,” Singh told CBS' 60 Minutes. “More banks, more sectors that we haven't touched.”\n\n“It's mostly about oil and gas, but there are other sectors too,” he added. “I don't want to specify them, but I think Putin would know what those are.”\n\nWhen asked what Putin would need to do to have sanctions lifted, Singh said \"we're nowhere near that point.\"\n\n“The first thing (Putin) has to do is to stop a reckless and barbaric attack on the civilians of Ukraine,\" he said. \"That's not happening.”\n\n– Bailey Schulz\n\nZelenskyy: Russia's siege of Mariupol will be remembered for centuries\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the siege of Mariupol would go down in history for what he described as war crimes committed by Russian troops and raised the specter of a \"third world war\" if negotiations with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin fail.\n\n“To do this to a peaceful city, what the occupiers did, is a terror that will be remembered for centuries to come,” Zelenskyy said in a video address to his nation Sunday.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Russia is killing citizens in Ukraine because its invasion has stalled, describing the tactic as \"disgusting.\"\n\n“We’ve seen deliberate targeting of cities and towns and civilians throughout the last several weeks,” Austin said on CBS' \"Face The Nation.\"\n\nThe United Kingdom’s Defense Ministry assessment released Sunday mirrored Austin's concerns. The ministry said Russia has increased its indiscriminate shelling of urban areas, resulting in widespread destruction and large numbers of civilian casualties.\n\n\"Over the past week Russian forces have made limited progress in capturing these cities,\" the ministry tweeted Sunday. \"It is likely Russia will continue to use its heavy firepower to support assaults on urban areas as it looks to limit its own already considerable losses – at the cost of further civilian casualties.\"\n\nZelenskyy appealed to Putin to hold talks with him directly and said ongoing negotiations with Russia were “not simple or pleasant\" but are necessary.\n\n\"I think that we have to use any format, any chance, in order to have a possibility of negotiating, possibility of talking to Putin,\" Zelenskyy told CNN's Fareed Zakaria.\n\n\"But,\" he added, \"if these attempts fail, that would mean that this is a third World War.''\n\n– David Jackson\n\nAs civilian casualties mount in Ukraine, Russia also taking major losses, including five generals\n\nIt's impossible to get precise figures for the civilian casualties in Ukraine, but even low estimates paint a grim picture. On the other hand, Russia is paying a hefty price as well, apparently including the loss of five generals.\n\nAt least 847 civilians, including 64 children, have been killed since Russia launched its offensive Feb. 24, the U.N. Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner reported Saturday. The agency acknowledged the actual figures are much higher. Agents also estimated the violence had left nearly 1,400 civilians injured, including 78 children. The Ukraine government estimates that 2,300 people have died in the ongoing siege of Mariupol alone.\n\nEstimates of Russian deaths also vary widely. The Ukraine government puts the Russian death toll at more than 14,000. Even conservative figures are in the low thousands – a much faster pace than in previous Russian offensives, threatening support for the war among ordinary Russians. Russia had 64 deaths in five days of fighting during its 2008 war with Georgia. It lost about 15,000 in Afghanistan over 10 years, and more than 11,000 over years of fighting in Chechnya.\n\nLess than four weeks into its invasion, Russia appears to be down five generals. Ukraine said Saturday that Lt. General Andrei Mordvichev was killed by an airstrike north of Crimea, adding that he was the fifth Russian general killed in the war.\n\nNATO summit to bolster support of Ukraine, show unity\n\nThe U.S. and NATO are trying to straddle the line between assisting Ukraine in its efforts to fight off the Russian invasion and getting directly involved.\n\nAt a special summit this week, NATO is expected to discuss enhancements of the military, humanitarian and financial support it members are providing Ukraine, officials said, while stiffening economic sanctions on Russia and President Vladimir Putin. At the same time, the officials caution about the need to keep the conflict from increasing in scope.\n\nIn several news show interviews Sunday, U.S. and global security officials said potential topics of discussion at the summit include the prospect of deploying a peacekeeping force in Ukraine and the chances of Russian-Ukrainian peace talks. And they again warned Russia against using chemical weapons in Ukraine.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on NBC's \"Meet The Press\" the summit will serve as a \"platform to demonstrate our unity, our support to Ukraine, but also our readiness to protect and defend all NATO allies.\"\n\n-- David Jackson\n\nZelenskyy asks Israel for help, cites similarities in Ukraine's struggle with what Jews endured\n\nUkraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy drew a parallel between what his besieged countrymen are enduring during the Russian invasion and the misery imposed on the Jewish people by the Nazis as he pleaded for help and a stronger stance against Russia's attack from Israel.\n\nIn a video address to the Israeli parliament Sunday, Zelenskyy urged the lawmakers to take action against Russia, accusing its President Vladimir Putin of trying to carry out a “final solution” against Ukraine. The term was used by Nazi Germany for its genocide of some 6 million Jews during World War II.\n\n“Our people are now wandering in the world, seeking security as you once did,” Zelenskyy said.\n\nZelenskyy, who is Jewish, also pointed out a Russian missile struck Babi Yar, the spot in Kyiv where over 30,000 Jews were slaughtered in 1941 by the Nazis and now serves as Ukraine’s main Holocaust memorial. “You know what this place means, where the victims of the Holocaust are buried,” he said.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney: US must stop telling Russia 'what we won't do'\n\nThe United States and NATO must stop publicizing their unwillingness to get too involved in the Ukraine war, Rep. Liz Cheney said Sunday. The West must make it clear that all options are being considered – and that use of chemical weapons could alter our calculation. She said \"telling the Russians what we won't do\" is not helpful, adding that it's very important that Russian President Vladimir Putin not \"reap any rewards\" for his aggression.\n\n\"Putin’s actions so far have demonstrated first of all, that the Russian military is nowhere near as capable as the world perhaps thought it was,\" Cheney said. \"Probably not as capable as Putin thought it was.\"\n\nPope denounces 'cruel and sacrilegious inhumanity' of war\n\nPope Francis denounced Russia’s “repugnant war” against Ukraine as “cruel and sacrilegious inhumanity.” In some of his strongest words yet since Russia’s invasion on Feb. 24, Francis on Sunday told thousands of people in St. Peter’s Square that every day brings more atrocities in what is a “senseless massacre.”\n\n“There is no justification for this,” Francis said, in an apparent reference to Russia, which sought to justify its invasion as vital for its own defense. But Francis again stopped short of naming Russia as the aggressor. Pontiffs typically have decried wars and their devastating toll on civilians without citing warmongers by name.\n\nFrancis also called on “all actors in the international community” to work toward ending the war. “Again this week, missiles, bombs, rained down on the elderly, children and pregnant mothers,” the pope said. His thoughts, he said, went to the millions who flee. “And I feel great pain for those who don’t even have the chance to escape,’’ Francis added.\n\nRussia regrouping, Ukraine military says\n\nRussian forces focused on sorting out logistics and regrouping on Saturday rather than undertaking offensive operations, Ukraine military officials reported in a Sunday morning update. The military maneuvers, or lack thereof, have experts around the world increasingly concerned that a stalemate could be on the horizon, with \"enormous casualties\" possible as troops focus on civilian targets.\n\nA report from the Institute for the Study of War concluded that Ukrainian forces have defeated the initial Russian campaign of the war, but the report also highlighted activity of Russian forces, which have shown signs of \"digging in around the periphery of Kyiv and elsewhere.\"\n\n\"Stalemate is not armistice or cease-fire. It is a condition in war in which each side conducts offensive operations that do not fundamentally alter the situation. Those operations can be very damaging and cause enormous casualties,\" Frederick W. Kagan, George Barros and Kateryna Stepanenko wrote in an assessment published Saturday.\n\nThe findings echo what experts told USA TODAY last week. A “quagmire is the realistic 'goal,’” said Michael O’Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\nRussia’s number of dead and wounded in Ukraine is nearing the 10% benchmark of diminished combat effectiveness, said Dmitry Gorenburg, a researcher on Russia’s security at the Virginia-based CNA think tank. The reported battlefield deaths of four Russian generals – out of an estimated 20 in the fight – signal impaired command, he said. On Saturday, Ukraine said it had killed a fifth Russian general.\n\nRussians will need massive troop numbers to hold cities they capture\n\nWhen it comes to the grinding job of capturing and holding cities, conventional military metrics suggest Russia needs a 5-to-1 advantage in urban fighting, analysts say. The formula for ruling a restive territory in the face of armed opposition is 20 fighters for every 1,000 people – or 800,000 Russian troops for Ukraine’s more than 40 million people, said Michael Clarke, former head of the British-based Royal United Services Institute, a defense think tank.\n\nThat’s almost as many as Russia’s entire active-duty military of 900,000, and it means controlling substantial Ukrainian territory long term could take more resources than Russia can commit, he said.\n\n“Unless the Russians intend to be completely genocidal – they could flatten all the major cities, and Ukrainians will rise up against Russian occupation – there will be just constant guerrilla war,” Clarke said.\n\nUkrainian refugees flee to Moldova amid harrowing Russian attacks\n\nOf more than 3 million refugees who have fled Ukraine since Russia's Feb. 24 invasion, about two-thirds have gone to Poland. But an estimated 350,000 have entered Moldova, one of Europe's poorest countries. Most are women and children, as most men of fighting age have been ordered to stay behind to defend their country.\n\nNow, government workers and aid groups are trying to help, conducting a hurried symphony across multiple languages, from Russian and Romanian, which is spoken in Moldova, to French and English. They're fingerprinting and photographing refugees, double-checking documents and providing emergency cash to the most needy.\n\nThe Ukrainian refugees in Moldova include Kristina Paleshev, whose five kids have been waking up at night startled by any loud noises, frightened that they are again under attack.\n\n\"We want to go back. I love my country and my town,\" Paleshev, 38, said, as a tear rolled down her cheek. \"I’m crying because our people are being killed.”\n\n– Trevor Hughes\n\nZelenskyy restricts political parties tied to Russia\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has ordered the suspension of activities of 11 political parties with links to Russia. The largest of them is the Opposition Platform for Life, which has 44 out of 450 seats in the country’s parliament. The party is led by Viktor Medvedchuk, who has friendly ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the godfather of Medvedchuk’s daughter.\n\nAlso on the list is the Nashi (Ours) party led by Yevheniy Murayev. Before the Russian invasion, British authorities warned that Russia wanted to install Murayev as the leader of Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking in a video address early Sunday, Zelenskyy said “given a large-scale war unleashed by the Russian Federation and links between it and some political structures, the activities of a number of political parties is suspended for the period of the martial law.” He added that “activities by politicians aimed at discord and collaboration will not succeed.”\n\nZelenskyy’s announcement follows the introduction of the martial law that envisages a ban on parties associated with Russia.\n\n20 babies from surrogate moms in bomb shelter\n\nIn peacetime, Ukraine has a thriving surrogate industry, one of the few countries where foreigners can contract women to carry their pregnancies. Now at least 20 of those babies are stuck in a makeshift bomb shelter in Ukraine’s capital, waiting for parents to travel into the war zone to pick them up.\n\nThey’re well cared for at the moment. Surrogacy center nurses are stranded with them, because constant shelling makes it too dangerous for them to go home. Russian troops are trying to encircle Kyiv. As Ukrainian defenders hold them off for now, the threat comes from the air.\n\nNurse Lyudmilla Yashchenko says they’re staying in the bomb shelter to save their lives, and the lives of the babies, some of whom are just days old. They have enough food and baby supplies for now, and can only hope and wait for the newborns to be picked up, and the war to end.\n\n►Ukrainian refugees:Millions of refugees are fleeing Ukraine.

But the timing was unusual and came after Trudeau was shown in a video with other NATO leaders appearing to mock the U.S. president. That followed sharp, public exchanges between Trump and France's President Emmanuel Macron a day earlier.\n\nAmid the disagreements – on funding, on how best to tackle global terrorism, on how to engage with Russia – NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg wrapped up the meetings by trying to talk up NATO unity, saying that the alliance \"was the most successful in history because we've changed as the world has changed.\"\n\nHe said NATO would study ways to \"further strengthen\" its political dimension. The military alliance of U.S. and European countries, plus Canada was formed after World War II as a bulwark against the Soviet aggression and to guard against European militant nationalism. Its scope has since widened to include cyberattacks, border issues, climate security, terrorism and more.\n\nOn many issues, the White House and other NATO leaders diverge, not least Trump's decision to support NATO member Turkey's recent incursion into Syria to root out Kurdish militants that Ankara considers terrorists. Those same militants were playing a key role in the U.S.-led coalition fighting the remnants of the Islamic State group.\n\nAnd taking questions after a meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Trump slammed Trudeau as \"two-faced\" and suggested the prime minister was upset that the president had \"called him out\" on the fact that Canada is not spending 2% of its GDP on defense spending, as required by NATO guidelines. \"I guess he's not very happy about it,\" Trump said.\n\nMore:Trump calls Trudeau 'two-faced' following video of NATO leaders appearing to gossip about him\n\nBut his comments followed widely circulated video footage, recorded Tuesday night during a NATO reception at Buckingham Palace hosted by Queen Elizabeth II, that revealed world leaders on camera apparently discussing and making fun of Trump, although he wasn't directly mentioned by name. None realized they were being overheard.\n\n\"He was late because he takes a 40-minute press conference off the top,\" Trudeau could be heard saying in the video, an apparent reference to Trump's long unscheduled Q&A session with journalists earlier Tuesday. Trudeau was seen standing in a huddle with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Macron and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte. Britain’s Princess Anne – the queen's daughter – was just visible behind Rutte's left shoulder.\n\nAsked about the video, Johnson said it was \"complete nonsense.\"\n\nTrudeau told reporters that they weren't laughing at Trump, but about the location of the next G7 summit, revealed this week to be the president's Camp David retreat.\n\n\"I have a very good relationship with Trump,\" he said.\n\nStoltenberg did his best to project NATO unity.\n\nHe rejected criticism from Macron that the military alliance is suffering from \"brain death.\" He also dismissed complaints from Trump that member states are not boosting their NATO military budgets quickly enough and insisted that the organization is adapting to modern challenges. Trump has called it \"obsolete.\"\n\n\"NATO is agile, NATO is active, NATO is adapting,\" Stoltenberg said before chairing a meeting of the alliance's members at a luxury hotel and golf resort outside London.\n\n\"As long as we are able to deliver substance … then NATO proves once again that we are able to respond to a shifting security landscape, and that's the best way to also provide unity of this alliance,\" the Norwegian national said.\n\nStoltenberg emphasized several times during his concluding news conference that \"NATO is the only place where the U.S. and Europe and Canada meet every day.\"\n\nTrump in Britain for NATO meetings:Macron talks may be more important\n\nStill, the tension threatened to undermine the credibility of the 29-nation alliance.\n\nThe meetings also cast Trump as the unlikely defender of an alliance he has repeatedly disparaged and railed against as far too dependent on U.S. funding.\n\n\"There’s an assumption among leaders that, because NATO has survived these types of crises in the past, it will brush aside this latest scare,\" said Jeremy Shapiro, a foreign policy expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations, a think tank.\n\n\"This would perhaps be true if France and Turkey were the only problems. However, they’re not. The issue is far bigger, and heralds from the U.S. – where an unenthusiastic president is unwilling to make commitments to, or work for the betterment of, Western defense,\" he added. \"Macron, not unjustifiably, sees Trump as turning his back on Europe and wants NATO member states, and the EU, to wake up to this reality.\"\n\nOther NATO leaders and diplomats were also at pains to put a brave face on a series of awkward encounters as leaders gathered for discussions on a range of security issues encompassing a resurgent Russia, China's growing military and technological prowess, trade and climate policies, and the evolving threat from international terrorism.\n\n\"If NATO has a motto, it is as Jens (Stoltenberg) says, one for all, and all for one,\" Johnson said in remarks opening the meetings, referring to Article 5, the NATO principle that if any one member is attacked, all will attempt to defend it.\n\nDo a deal:Trump signals trade deal with China could be delayed until after election\n\nRoyal treatment:Trump, first lady mingle with the queen, royal family NATO reception\n\nDespite the divisions, Johnson characterized NATO as a \"giant shield of solidarity.\"\n\nMacron stood by his comments, saying Wednesday that they had sparked vital discussions. \"It's allowed us to raise fundamental debates,\" he said. In particular, \"how to build sustainable peace in Europe.\" He added that \"(NATO) debates should be about other things than budgets and finances,\" an apparent reference to Trump's persistent gripes about many NATO members who haven't met the alliance's defense spending goals, currently 2% of GDP. Just nine members are expected to hit that level by the end of the year.

Later, in a closed-door meeting, Trump demanded that NATO allies double their defense spending to 4 percent of gross domestic product.\n\nAs the Brussels summit wrapped up, Trump said that after pressuring European countries to step up their contributions to NATO, he received pledges for increased defense spending.

Then, in a closed-door session with allies, he suggested that even spending the agreed-upon 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense wasn't enough. He wanted 4 percent.\n\nHis criticism softened during the 35-minute news conference Thursday. He described NATO as a “fine-tuned machine” and “much stronger than it was,” and he said the U.S. commitment to the organization “remains very strong.”\n\nHe insisted that NATO was as united as ever, despite the very public rift.\n\n“To see the level of spirit in that room is incredible,” Trump said.\n\nNATO allies have been unsettled by Trump's overtures to Putin. The president said Thursday that he views Putin not as a friend or an enemy but as a \"competitor\" and repeated his desire for better relations with the Kremlin.\n\nHe remained noncommittal on whether the United States might recognize Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea, which the United States views as illegal.\n\n\"So that was on Barack Obama's watch.

But the 40-year-old leader acknowledged this week it didn’t work, and instead said he was focusing his efforts on European partners.\n\n“The partner with whom Europe had built the order of post-war multilateralism seems to turn his back on this common history,” Macron said Monday in an annual speech to French diplomats.\n\nFor the first time since his election in May 2017, Macron appeared about to give up hope about influencing the 72-year-old U.S. president – what his aides often called “a work of conviction.”\n\nThe turning point might have been last month’s contentious NATO summit in which Trump assailed allies for not spending enough on defense.\n\nA few days after, Macron met with Putin in Moscow. His office said he wanted to make Europe’s voice heard.\n\nJust a month before the NATO summit, Trump had already roiled the weekend Group of Seven meeting in Canada by agreeing to a joint statement on trade, only to withdraw from it while flying to Asia.\n\nMacron listed on Monday the American policies on which he tried, in vain, to persuade Trump to change, listing his “doubts on NATO, aggressive and unilateral trade… the withdrawal from the Paris (climate) agreement, the exit from the Iranian nuclear deal.”\n\nFrancois Heisbourg, a former French government adviser and chairman of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, noted an “obvious change in tone” from the French president. He said that Macron had acknowledged that “since friendship doesn’t seem to be a language that works, he will do differently.”\n\nYet the French leader remains a man of dialogue, Heisbourg stressed, comparing him to a “horse whisperer,” for his at least earlier ability to rouse smiles in Trump.\n\nIn Macron’s mind, Trump has joined more wild horses like Russian and Turkish counterparts Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Heisbourg said.\n\nMacron and Trump’s friendship really started in Paris on Bastille Day last year, when Trump, the guest of honor, enjoyed so much the military parade on the Champs-Elysees Avenue that he said he wanted to stage a similar one in Washington.\n\nThe U.S. president reserved for his French counterpart the first state visit under his presidency in April. They showered each other with praise, made jokes, handshakes and even cheek kisses.\n\nBoth men still seem keen to keep their warm relationship despite their disagreement on some fundamental issues.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Tuesday that “the two leaders consult frequently on a wide range of global challenges. The president looks forward to continuing to work closely with President Macron to advance our shared economic and security interests.”\n\nThe two leaders last chatted on Aug. 11 about Syria, Iran, the Middle East and trade. Trump tweeted that he “had a very good phone call” with Macron.\n\nThe same day, Macron also talked with Putin.\n\nMacron and Trump are now scheduled to meet on Nov. 11 for the commemoration of the end of World War I in Paris, where the U.S. president has said he would attend.\n\nMacron hopes to seize the occasion to discuss global trade relations with other world leaders who have been invited.\n\n“I think we shouldn’t give in to one’s hegemony and everyone’s division,” he said in another blow to Trump’s tariffs hike policies.\n\nMeanwhile, Macron is looking for support for his proposals toward a more integrated European Union, with a common security doctrine and a shared budget for countries using the euro.\n\nOn Thursday, Macron was on the third day of a trip to Denmark and Finland. He plans to meet with counterparts from Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands next week. After that, he is scheduled to host German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Paris.\n\nMacron wants Europe to lead the way toward more multilateralism, as opposed to isolationism, to address the worlds’ challenges like migration, climate change, digital transformation and inequalities.\n\n“The real question is not so much to know if I will take Donald Trump by the arm during the next summit but how we will collectively get to grips with this moment of great transformation we are going through,” he said Monday.\n\nAP White House reporter Zeke Miller contributed to this story.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/08/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2023/04/04/ukraine-russia-war-live-updates/11597701002/", "title": "'The alliance is stronger': Finland joins NATO, Russia warns of ...", "text": "Finland formally joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on Tuesday, more than doubling the length of the alliance's border with Russia and drawing a warning of \"retaliatory measures\" from Moscow.\n\n\"Finland is stronger and safer within the alliance, and the alliance is stronger and safer with Finland as its ally,\" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at a ceremony in Brussels.\n\nFinland President Sauli Niinistö emphasized his country's desire to promote stability in Europe.

The Journal has denied the accusations and demanded the American journalist be released.\n\nEmma Tucker, editor-in-chief of the Journal, said Gershkovich’s family is “relieved to know we finally have contact with Evan” after the outlet previously reported a lawyer and representatives from the U.S. Embassy were denied access to him in jail. Gershkovich is being kept behind bars for two months pending an investigation and could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted.\n\n“They said Evan’s health is good, and he is grateful for the outpouring of support from around the world,” Tucker said. “We continue to work with the White House, State Department and relevant U.S. government officials to secure Evan’s release.”\n\nThe Biden administration has said Gershkovich’s release is a top priority. He is the first U.S. correspondent since the Cold War to be detained on charges of espionage.\n\n“These charges are ridiculous.

Russia \"will be forced to take retaliatory measures of a military-technical and other nature\" to stop perceived threats, the statement said. Details on those steps will depend on the conditions for Finland's integration into NATO, according to the statement.\n\n\"We are convinced that history will judge this hasty step taken by the authorities of this country without due regard for public opinion by organizing a referendum and a thorough analysis of the consequences of NATO membership,\" the statement said.\n\nWHAT IS NATO? History, facts, members and why it was created\n\nRussian military, Wagner mercenaries remain at odds: US official\n\nLeaders of the Russian military and Wagner, its associated mercenary group, have been squabbling over the direction of the war in Ukraine, according to a senior Defense Department official. This comes after Wagner founder Yevgeny Prigozhin recently complained that the military is providing his thousands of soldiers with insufficient ammunition.\n\nBattle lines in Ukraine have remained largely static, with heavy exchanges of artillery fire between Russia and Ukrainian forces backed by the U.S. and its Western allies. There has been not significant movement in recent weeks, said the official, who briefed reporters Tuesday on conditions set by the Pentagon.\n\nThe infighting among Russian commanders comes as Ukraine prepares an expected counteroffensive and the U.S. released another $2.5 billion in military aid. The official also said the Pentagon has trained about 4,000 Ukrainian troops split into brigades that will operate Stryker and Bradley armored personnel carriers. Training on U.S. Abrams tanks being sent to Ukraine has not yet occurred, the official said.\n\nThe Pentagon will also be buying trucks designed to carry 30mm guns that can shoot down Iranian drones that Russia has bought from Iran, the official said.\n\n– Tom Vanden Brook\n\nUS to provide Ukraine with another $2.5 billion in military aid\n\nThe U.S. will send Ukraine about $500 million in ammunition and equipment and will spend more than $2 billion to buy an array of munitions, radar and other weapons in the future, Blinken said in a statement.

Alarmed by the invasion, the long-neutral country applied to join in May, along with neighboring Sweden, seeking protection under the organization's security umbrella.\n\nFinland shares an 832-mile border with Russia, and the accession into NATO delivers a major blow to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has long complained about the alliance's expansion toward his country.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg emphasized the strategic benefits of Finland's entry during remarks Monday, saying the country \"will bring to the alliance substantial military forces – well trained, well equipped with also a large reservist army.\" Finland's membership will also \"more than double the size of the alliance's border with Russia,\" Stoltenberg said.\n\nTurkey last to ratify; Sweden still waiting\n\nTurkey, the last country to ratify Finland's NATO membership, sent official documents on Tuesday to Blinken, clearing the final hurdle for the country's entry.\n\nMeanwhile, Sweden, which applied for NATO membership along with Finland in May, is still waiting to win approval, something Stoltenberg expects in the coming weeks. Sweden has yet to fully implement new counter-terror legislation urged by Turkey that comes into effect June 1.\n\nTurkish President President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has accused Sweden of \"opening its arms” to the PKK and other groups classified as terrorist organizations by Turkey.\n\n\"I'm absolutely confident that Sweden will become a member,\" Stoltenberg said, adding that Finland's ratification was the fastest in NATO's modern history. \"It's a priority for NATO, for me to ensure that happens as soon as possible. \"\n\nWhat is NATO?\n\nNATO is an intergovernmental military alliance including two North American countries – the U.S. and Canada – and now 29 European countries. It was founded April 4, 1949 – exactly 74 years ago – after the end of World War II.\n\nWith the signing of the alliance, NATO countries agreed to collective defense, meaning an attack on one ally should be considered an attack on all.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/02/08/europe-diplomacy-ukraine-russia-what-we-know/6701961001/", "title": "Russia won't escalate crisis in Ukraine, Macron says: What we know", "text": "Sylvie Corbet and Dasha Litvinova\n\nAssociated Press\n\nKYIV, Ukraine – French President Emmanuel Macron said Tuesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin told him he would not further escalate the Ukraine crisis in their marathon talks in the Kremlin a day earlier.\n\nMacron's remarks on a visit to Kyiv came after the Kremlin denied reports that he and Putin struck a deal on de-escalating the crisis. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that “in the current situation, Moscow and Paris can't be reaching any deals.”\n\nMacron met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy amid mounting fears of a Russian invasion of its southern neighbor. Moscow has massed over 100,000 troops near Ukraine's borders, but insists it has no plans to attack.\n\nThe Kremlin wants guarantees from the West that NATO will not accept Ukraine and other former Soviet nations as members, that it halt weapon deployments there and roll back its forces from Eastern Europe – demands the U.S. and NATO reject as nonstarters.\n\nMore:Will Russia invade Ukraine? Talks, timing, desire for a long fight factor into strategy\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nAt a news conference after his meeting with Zelenskyy, Macron said Putin told him during their more than five-hour meeting Monday that “he won’t be initiating an escalation. I think it is important.”\n\nAccording to the French president, Putin also said there won’t be any Russian “permanent (military) base” or “deployment” in Belarus, where Russia had sent a large amount of troops for major war games that are about to kick off.\n\nPeskov said withdrawing Russian troops from Belarus after the war games was the plan all along.\n\nZelenskyy said he would welcome concrete steps from Putin for de-escalation, adding he didn’t “trust words in general.”\n\nMacron also sought to temper expectations.\n\n“Let’s not be naive,” he said. \"Since the beginning of the crisis, France hasn’t been inclined to exaggerate, but at the same time, I don’t believe this crisis can be settled in a few hours, through discussions”\n\nZelenskyy called his talks with Macron “very fruitful.”\n\nHe said France was giving $1.3 billion in financial aid to Ukraine and helping restore infrastructure in the war-ravaged east of the country.\n\nWestern leaders in recent weeks have engaged in high-level talks, and more are planned amid the backdrop of military drills in Russia and Belarus. On Tuesday, Russia’s Defense Ministry said six large warships were moving from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea for exercises.\n\nMacron said both Putin and Zelenskyy confirmed to him that they were willing to implement the Minsk agreements aimed at ending the separatist conflict in the eastern Ukraine. The 2015 peace deal, which ended large-scale hostilities in the region but has failed to bring about a political settlement of the conflict, is “the only path allowing to build peace ... and find a sustainable political solution,” he said.\n\nMacron said the presidential advisers of France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine will meet Thursday in Berlin to discuss the next steps. Dialogue is the only way to ease tensions, yet “It will take time to get results,” he said.\n\nWestern leaders in recent weeks have engaged in multiple rounds of diplomacy in the hope of de-escalating the tensions and preventing an attack. High-level talks have taken place against the backdrop of military drills underway in Russia and about to start in Belarus.\n\nMacron said he did not expect Putin to make any “gestures” on Monday, saying his objective was to “prevent an escalation and open new perspectives. ... That objective is met.”\n\nMacron said Putin “set a collective trap” when he initiated the exchange of written documents with the U.S. Moscow submitted its demands to Washington in the form of draft agreements that were released to the public, and insisted on a written response, which was leaked to the press.\n\n“In the history of diplomacy, there was never a crisis that has been settled by exchanges of letters which are to be made public afterward,” he said, adding that is why he decided to travel to Moscow for direct talks.\n\nPutin said after the meeting that the U.S. and NATO ignored Moscow’s demands, but signaled his readiness to continue talking.\n\nNATO, U.S. and European leaders flatly reject the demands that they say challenge NATO’s core principles, like shutting the door to Ukraine or other countries that might seek membership; but they have offered to talk about other Russian security concerns in Europe.\n\nPutin warned that Ukraine membership in NATO could trigger a war between Russia and the alliance should Kyiv move to retake the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow annexed in 2014. In that case, he said, European countries would be drawn into a military conflict with Russia where \"there will be no winners.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden has said that any prospect of Ukraine entering NATO \"in the near term is not very likely,\" but he and other NATO member nations and NATO itself refuse to rule out Ukraine's entry into the alliance at a future date.\n\nBiden met in Washington on Monday with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who also will travel to Kyiv and Moscow on Feb. 14-15. They threatened Russia with grave consequences if it invaded, and Biden vowed that the Nord Stream 2 Russia-to-Germany gas pipeline, which has been completed but is not yet operating, will be blocked. Such a move would hurt Russia economically but also cause energy supply problems for Germany.\n\nScholz warned Moscow that “a lot more could happen than they’ve perhaps calculated with themselves” in case of an invasion.\n\nBoris Johnson issues warning to Russia\n\nOn Tuesday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned Russia that invading Ukraine will only make NATO stronger, but said he still believes \"principled and determined diplomacy\" could defuse the crisis.\n\nWriting in The Times of London, Johnson urged allies to finalize plans for heavy economic sanctions that would come into effect if Russia crosses the border into Ukraine.\n\nHe said the U.K. is ready to bolster NATO forces in Latvia and Estonia as he prepared to meet the Lithuanian prime minister in London on Tuesday to show support for the Baltic nations.\n\nJohnson said he was considering dispatching RAF Typhoon fighters and Royal Navy warships to southeastern Europe. Britain said Monday it is sending 350 troops to Poland to bolster NATO's eastern flank. It already has sent anti-tank weapons to Ukraine.\n\nMore than 100 U.S. military personnel have arrived in Romania ahead of a deployment of about 1,000 NATO troops expected in the country in the coming days, Romania’s Defense Minister Vasile Dincu said, adding that “it won’t be long before the rest of the troops arrive.”\n\nU.S. officials have said that about 1,000 alliance troops will be sent from Germany to Romania, a NATO member since 2004. Romania borders Ukraine to the north. About 1,700 U.S. soldiers from the 82nd Airborne are also going to Poland.\n\nU.S. officials have portrayed the threat of an invasion of Ukraine as imminent – warnings Moscow has scoffed at, accusing Washington of fueling tensions.\n\nRussia and Ukraine have been locked in a bitter tug-of-war since 2014, when, following the ouster of Ukraine's Kremlin-friendly president, Moscow annexed Crimea and threw its weight behind a separatist insurgency in the east of the country. The fighting between Russia-backed rebels and Ukrainian forces in the east has since killed over 14,000 people.\n\nFrance and Germany in 2015 helped broker a peace deal, known as the Minsk agreements. The Kremlin has repeatedly accused Kyiv of sabotaging implementation of the agreements, and Ukrainian officials in recent weeks said that implementing them would be detrimental for the country.\n\nPutin offers hope for settlement\n\nAfter his meeting with Macron on Monday, Putin said without elaboration that some of the French president's proposals could serve as a basis for a settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, adding that they agreed to have a call after Macron's visit Tuesday to Kyiv.\n\nUkraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Tuesday that Kyiv was \"with interest anticipating the signals\" Macron brought from Moscow.\n\n\"We're open to dialogue, we're in a constructive mood, we're looking for a diplomatic solution, but we will not cross our 'red lines,'\" Kuleba told reporters.\n\nLitvinova reported from Moscow.

It can also be easily spread, whether dogs live in a home or are awaiting adoption.\n\nWhile the recent outbreak has been limited to South Florida, the illness can be found throughout the country at any given time, according to José Arce, president of the American Veterinary Medical Association.\n\n\"We'll see a case here and there, but then there are times where outbreaks will occur in different areas of the country at different moments,\" Arce told USA TODAY.\n\nHere is everything you need to know about CIRDC:\n\nYour dog is choking?: Here's what to do when something gets stuck in your pup's throat\n\nChocolate emergency: So your dog just ate some chocolate. Here's what you should do first.\n\nHow does CIRDC spread?\n\nSimilar to how COVID-19 spreads, CIRDC spreads whenever dogs are in close contact, such as at a dog park, a play date, groomer and shelters. Arce said another way the virus could spread is if a dog plays with a toy and then a different dog uses the same toy.\n\nMaria Serrano, chief veterinarian at the Miami-Dade County Animal Services, said the outbreak in South Florida likely came from a dog that entered a shelter.\n\n\"Respiratory diseases that are transmitted through aerosolized droplets are just very, very contagious,\" Serrano said.\n\nThe disease does not affect humans.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of CIRDC?\n\nCommon symptoms include coughing and sneezing, as well as discharge coming from the nose. As the disease develops, dogs may have difficulty breathing and may have secretions coming out of their nose and eyes, Arce said.\n\nSymptoms usually appear around five days after exposure, and mild cases usually last up to 10 days. Dogs could be tested by veterinarians to see if they have the disease.\n\nSome dogs may not show any symptoms, but they could still carry and spread the disease.\n\nDog rescue: Dog swept up in LA river triggers chaotic rescue after bystander jumps in\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?Sign up for our trending newsletter to get the latest news of the day\n\nHow sick do dogs get from CIRDC?\n\nMost cases of CIRDC are mild, but the disease can worsen and dogs can develop pneumonia if left unattended. Puppies, older dogs or immunocompromised dogs are the most susceptible to the virus and worsening symptoms.\n\n\"Not attended, it can even be the cause of death,\" Arce said.\n\nDogs with worsening symptoms can be hospitalized and treated with anti-viral medicine.\n\nThere's a CIRDC outbreak in Florida, can it spread nationwide? How worried should dog owners be?\n\nIn March, Miami-Dade County health officials noticed there was an increased amount of dogs infected with CIRDC. Ultimately, animal services decided on March 23 to indefinitely suspend offsite adoption events and wellness clinics performing spay and neuter surgeries, microchipping and vaccinations. Onsite adoptions of healthy dogs continued.\n\nSerrano said a quick response to the disease helped contain it.\n\n\"So far, it's going pretty well. The cases are already kind of decreasing. We're still separating the populations and making sure we leave the dogs at least 10 days in isolation to make sure that we have less risks of transmission to other dogs,\" Serrano said. \"I think we acted very promptly.\"\n\nEven though cases are decreasing, the news of the outbreak could cause fear in dog owners in nearby cities and states.\n\nHowever, Arce said dog owners shouldn't be worried. The disease has been around for nearly five decades, and it's around throughout the year. It's only when health officials say there's an outbreak of the virus in a certain area that dog owners should take caution.\n\n\"Unless the outbreak is in an area where I commonly would take my dog for a walk or to a park or something, I wouldn't be highly concerned. This is something that's always around,\" he said. \"You will hear from the public health officials in your area.\n\n\"When it's really severe, you will see articles everywhere,\" Arce said.\n\nHow do you keep your dog safe?\n\nSerrano and Arce said owners should make sure their dogs are up to date on theirvaccines. There isn't a vaccine dedicated to preventing illness from CIRDC as it is \"not a vaccine-preventable condition,\" according to the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Veterinary Medicine.\n\nHowever, Serrano said vaccines can partially protect respiratory systems while also strengthening immune systems.\n\nStill, she recommends if there is an outbreak, restrain dogs from having \"nose-to-nose\" contact with each other.\n\nArce said there really isn't much of a peak season of the disease, but the summer months when there are more dogs outside could be a period when the disease can easily spread. But as long as the dog is in good health, there shouldn't be much worry. Most cases are mild and self-limiting.\n\n\"I would just be made sure that my dog's vaccinations are up to date. That's the key,\" Arce said.\n\nFollow Jordan Mendoza on Twitter: @jordan_mendoza5.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/11/27/mystery-dog-respiratory-illness-states-map/71716644007/", "title": "Map shows mystery dog respiratory illness spread to 14 states", "text": "An unknown and potentially deadly contagious canine respiratory illness that began in one Western state this summer now spans more than a dozen states, the nation's lead non-profit veterinary organization is reporting.\n\nAs of Monday the disease had been reported in 14 states stretching from Florida to California and the cause of the mysterious illness remained under investigation, American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) President Dr. Rena Carlson, told USA TODAY.\n\nIn Oregon alone, veterinarians and animal sanctuary owners have reported more than 200 cases since mid-August.

While the existing vaccines may not specifically target the unknown infection, maintaining overall health through routine vaccinations helps support a dog’s immune system.\n\nAvoid dog parks, pet stores and grooming facilities with your canine companion, if possible.\n\nBe mindful of boarding. It is recommended to avoid boarding your dog \"unless absolutely necessary. Caution is advised rather than worry. There is a lot of interstate mobility among people and their pets and this may facilitate the transmission of the disease, as it appears to be highly contagious.\"\n\nIf your dog shows any signs of respiratory issues, including the symptoms listed above, contact your vet and keep your pet isolated from other animals until the matter is resolved.\n\nUntil the cause is determined, Michael Stepien, a spokesperson with the United States Department of Agriculture, said the federal agency will \"continue supporting states with testing when needed,\" but noted the agency's support role is limited to testing and collaborating with partners.\n\nContributing: Saman Shafiq\n\nNatalie Neysa Alund is a senior reporter for USA TODAY.

We are doing our best to educate the public and let people know that they should be vaccinated.\"\n\nAs of Tuesday morning, there were 11 confirmed cases and an additional seven cases that are under investigation in Ocean County, said the Ocean County Health Department.\n\nThere were also 68 confirmed cases and 11 suspected cases of measles as of Tuesday morning in nearby Rockland County, New York, where the Department of Health has been offering free measles vaccines to residents 6 months of age and older.\n\nIn addition, measles has been diagnosed in 17 children in the several mostly Orthodox neighborhoods in Brooklyn. Health officials there have reported an increased demand for vaccinations.\n\nThus far, no cases have been reported in Bergen or Passaic counties, but there is growing concern because of proximity and intermingling with the other affected communities in Lakewood and Rockland County. Both also have large Orthodox Jewish populations.\n\n\"Measles is highly transmissible. So it absolutely has the potential to spread, especially when people are not vaccinated,\" said Dr. Aryeh Baer, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Hackensack University Medical Center. He noted that people should take all precautions, because one in every 1,000 people who get measles die from it.\n\n\"Vaccination provides lifelong immunity. As a society, we should be helping to make sure everyone else is covered,\" he said.\n\nBergen County has a higher-than-average rate of vaccine exemptions among schoolchildren. For the 2017-18 school year, a combined 1,772 children in public and private schools were not fully vaccinated because of medical or religious exemptions, state data show.\n\nSeveral prominent ultra-Orthodox rabbis in Israel and in Brooklyn — including Rabbi David Niederman, a Hasidic rabbi and president of the United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburg and North Brooklyn — have urged followers to vaccinate their children, and some schools and synagogues have said that only those who are vaccinated may attend.\n\nAnd on Wednesday, the Orthodox Union and the Rabbinical Council of America released a joint statement urging all parents to vaccinate their children on the timetable recommended by their pediatrician.\n\nWhat are symptoms of measles?\n\nMeasles is transmitted by sneezing and coughing as well as direct contact with an infected person, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms include a high fever and rash, a runny nose, and red runny eyes. In some cases, the virus can lead to serious impairment or death.\n\nMost people born after 1957 received a measles vaccine, but some have not, either for medical reasons or because they came from a country where it wasn't routinely done.\n\nBecause of gaps in vaccine overage, various regions of the world have been hit in recent years with measles outbreaks, said the World Health Organization, which found that the number of people sickened with the virus in 2018 has exceeded the 2017 total.\n\nThe World Health Organization recommends that adults or adolescents unsure of their immunity status get a dose of measles vaccine before traveling overseas.\n\nThe recent outbreaks in Lakewood, New York City and Rockland County are linked to people who traveled abroad. In Rockland County, the cases have spread beyond the Orthodox community where they originated.\n\nOutbreaks have been reported in other 25 other states this year, including California, Florida, Nevada and Texas. There also has been a measles outbreak in Europe.\n\nL'via Weisinger of Teaneck, a founder of the Orthodox Jewish Nurses Association and a school nurse who has worked at several yeshiva day schools in Bergen County over the past 18 years, said she's worried that measles will spread to Bergen County.\n\n\"We have a large population of Rockland County students in our yeshiva day schools,\" she said, adding that she wants religious schools to ban families who refuse to vaccinate (for philosophical reasons), because it could harm students with immunity problems.\n\n\"The schools should kick out the anti-vaxxers because this puts everyone at risk,\" she said, explaining that religious schools are not required to accept philosophical or religious exemptions, which could place the community at risk. She hopes that all schools will advise parents that their children cannot be admitted without proof of immunization and refuse to accept any exceptions.\n\nDr. Maury Buchalter, a pediatrician at Tenafly Pediatrics, a practice with offices in Fort Lee, Paramus, Clifton and other locations, agreed. The problems arise, he said, when schools allow exemptions for parents who don't want to vaccinate their kids.\n\n\"As a practice, we recommend that if patients don't want to be vaccinated, they don't stay here,\" he said. \"It's a state law.

Seated at folding tables and speaking through face masks, students at the STEM-focused charter high school in Orem, Utah, tallied COVID-19 infection and death rates from one winter week – comparing national and statewide data with the virus’s toll at their school.\n\nFortunately, the school’s disease numbers weren’t real. Led by Micah Ross, a biology teacher, the academy piloted an app-based pandemic simulation, part of Operation Outbreak, a platform of lessons on infectious diseases and the public health response to their spread.\n\nAfter learning about virus biology, immune response and past pandemics, more than 100 students and staff downloaded an app that tracked a virtual virus. The “virus” spread by Bluetooth when participants were in close proximity for an extended time and was slowed by digital masks and vaccines students could get after taking quizzes based on the in-class lessons.\n\nCo-created by an educator in Florida and some infectious disease researchers at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Operation Outbreak predates the pandemic, and its developers are keen to expand its use beyond the crisis. For those who piloted the simulation in this extraordinary year, the meta-pandemic experience showed what data reveals and conceals about the global struggle with COVID-19.\n\n“Remember,” Ross said to her class, “all these numbers represent people.”\n\nCharter school project wins attention from Harvard\n\nThe partnership behind Operation Outbreak began with an international crisis and a star-struck 6-year-old.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2016, Ebola ravaged several West African countries, killing thousands and spreading isolated cases to Europe and the USA. As health authorities struggled to contain a virus spreading across borders, Todd Brown, a middle school civics teacher in Florida, saw a teachable moment: Fighting threats such as Ebola, he said, was as much about government decisions, media coverage, international cooperation and public trust as it was about good science and heroic medical personnel.\n\nBrown crafted civics lessons about outbreak response for his eighth graders at Sarasota Military Academy Prep, a charter middle school in Florida. In the spring of 2016, Brown, with the help of a few other teachers, capped off the unit with a day of experiential learning, in which a couple of hundred students roamed over the school grounds pretending to be government officials, epidemiologists, medical teams, media and members of the public as they confronted an infectious disease spreading through their ranks.\n\nThere was no app that first year. Instead, kids “infected” one another with stickers at designated times. “It was basically a scripted-out version of exponential spread,” explained Brown, who will leave the school this summer to work full-time with Operation Outbreak. The students’ goal was to contain the disease and use the evidence of its symptoms and spread to discover what it was (Ebola, MERS, bubonic plague, etc.) before it wiped out the whole population.\n\nThe next year, Brown’s simulated outbreak had a distinguished audience – Dr. Pardis Sabeti, a Harvard computational geneticist whose lab, affiliated with the Broad Institute, partners with scientists worldwide on infectious disease research and response. Brown had contacted Sabeti a couple of years earlier after reading her Time magazine profile to his science-loving daughter, then 6.\n\n“We both thought she sounded amazing,” Brown recalled. “I asked my daughter if she would like me to reach out and get an autograph, and she was super excited.”\n\nThe autograph request (fulfilled) led to more conversations, a Skype visit by Sabeti with Brown’s class, then the in-person visit with other members of her lab, who were impressed by Operation Outbreak and eager to lend their expertise.\n\nTeaching kids to hate America? Republicans want ‘critical race theory’ out of schools\n\nOne of the Sabeti Lab projects was developing models of disease spread that better accounted for the X factor of human behavior. The researchers hit on the idea of observing real people spreading a digital virus via Bluetooth around the same time that they observed Brown’s students scrambling to contain their sticker-based outbreak.\n\nIn the months that followed, one of Sabeti’s postdocs, Andrés Colubri, led the creation of Operation Outbreak’s mobile app, in which a virtual virus can be customized for how infectious it is, how virulent and whether it spreads asymptomatically. On-screen emojis differentiated the healthy, the sick and the deceased. Participants could earn digital “masks” by taking in-app quizzes on topics such as epidemiology, historical pandemics and the role of the World Health Organization. Sabeti’s team returned to the Florida middle school in 2018 to help pilot the app.\n\n“The student engagement was so strong. We were really amazed by that,” said Colubri, an assistant professor of bioinformatics and integrative biology at UMass Medical School.\n\nThe simulations grew increasingly elaborate. For instance, when Brown randomly allotted participants differing amounts of virtual money to buy personal protective equipment or the food they needed, one enterprising student with extra cash bought up all the PPE and resold it at a premium.\n\nBrown’s students playing government officials fed false information to the “media” to convince the “public” to quarantine. The media found out the truth, and the public no longer trusted or complied with any public health restrictions, accelerating contagion. Some students tried to fake their infection status by displaying screenshots of the happy, healthy emoji. And a student playing the role of a police officer panicked while confronting a classmate who refused to reveal his health status and “shot” him with a Nerf gun.\n\nCOVID-19 overtakes school's pandemic simulation\n\nIn late 2019, reality caught up with Operation Outbreak. That year’s pandemic simulation coincidentally used a SARS-like virus with asymptomatic spread. As the real virus became a pandemic in early 2020, the parallels were unmistakable. Both the simulated and the real pandemics were characterized by panic, hoarding and medical teams overwhelmed by the carnage, while superspreaders and misinformation hobbled containment efforts. Much as COVID-19 disproportionately affected disadvantaged communities, the students randomly given fewer virtual dollars at the start of simulations got sick and died at higher rates than their “wealthier” classmates.\n\n“The sociobehavioral parallels between our past simulations and the current pandemic are striking,” the Outbreak team wrote in 2020 for the journal Cell. “Simulations have repeatedly foreshadowed the political distrust and altercations that have increased alongside COVID-19 in the U.S.”\n\nThe value of pandemic education was suddenly evident. The data generated by simulations could serve as a guide for COVID-19 mitigation measures. In theory, a pandemic simulation could help school administrators show students and families the danger of superspreader events, or it could reveal the times and places where students had trouble staying socially distant.\n\nBacked by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the Outbreak team crafted lesson plans in two broad categories – science and governance – that could be tailored to different levels of complexity.\n\nThe operation partnered with Fathom Information Design, a Boston firm that helps organizations make use of their data, to create a dashboard that displayed time-lapse renderings of the simulation – participants were shown as numbered dots, color-coded according to infection status, that moved in and out of contact with one another, spreading the virtual virus, getting sick, then recovering or not.\n\nThere was a major catch. Though the real pandemic made Operation Outbreak extremely topical, it also made it far more challenging to implement. In the spring of 2020, most schools and colleges went remote and faced tremendous uncertainty about the next academic year.\n\n“So many schools were going online, and then back in person, and then bouncing around,” Brown said. “We weren’t going to run a full-scale, totally immersive simulation like we ran in the past. It wouldn’t make sense to kind of force congregation in the middle of a pandemic.”\n\nThe team opted for what Brown called “a light-touch approach.” In addition to piloting the draft lesson plans, K-12 and university partners could run a scaled-back simulation stretched over several days, in which participants went about their routines without role-playing or solving scientific mysteries but with optional quiz-earned digital masks and other protections.\n\nRemote schooling wasn’t the only challenge. Some schools welcomed the experiential learning but worried about the mental health ramifications for students acting out a pretend disaster in the midst of a real one.\n\n“You had to be sensitive that some of the people in your community may have lost loved ones,” said Karen Bruker, a science teacher at the Cambridge School of Weston, a private high school outside Boston. In the simulation Bruker led last November with about 100 students, participants could get very sick, but nobody died. School staff stressed that the simulated virus was similar to the one causing COVID-19, but it was not meant to be a precise digital imitation of the real pathogen.\n\nDuring a Zoom interview, Bruker shared the time-lapse display of a two-day simulated outbreak at her school. Starting at 8 a.m. on Day One, a few red dots of seeded “infections” moved through a constantly shifting web of gray dots, turning several more red before Bruker paused the playback at 10:30 a.m.\n\n“We already had eight secondary infections at this point,” said Bruker, who promptly emailed an update to students about the simulated surge, reminding them of social distancing and that a quiz for digital masks would soon be available. Participants, taking the hint, used the quiz to earn their masks, and secondary infections plummeted.\n\nSimulation brings COVID-19 lessons to campus\n\nAs usual, the simulated outbreaks revealed insights about human behavior along with lessons on viral contagion. At Brigham Young University, about 400 students in a nine-day pandemic simulation were offered a digital vaccine, obtained by scanning a QR code available in the university’s Life Sciences Building. The vaccines were promoted via daily emails, but only 15% of the students bothered to scan the code.\n\nThe simulation’s lead organizer, Curtis Hoffmann, a senior microbiology major, noted that most participants in a pre-simulation survey said they had no hesitancy about getting the actual vaccine. He blamed the low digital follow-through partly on the inconvenience of it being offered at just one location during a busy week that coincided with midterms.\n\n“One of the takeaways we shared to the university’s COVID-19 committee was to suggest they offer the vaccine at multiple sites on campus,” Hoffmann said.\n\nThe real pandemic prompted discussions about the purpose and limitations of computer models for predicting disease. At the Utah County Academy of Sciences, Ross’ class discussed why 14% of their simulation participants had died, far outpacing the state and national death rates.\n\nThey noted how tenuous results are in a simulated pandemic spreading among just 111 people. They mentioned technical glitches with the app on some of their Chromebooks that disrupted some of the quizzes needed to earn a digital mask and the fact that people who had been digitally “infected” in the simulation carpooled and came to school as they normally would, while in real life, truly ill students would stay home once they knew they were sick.\n\nRoss and her students talked about revisiting the simulation next year, involving more students, and they pondered how results might differ without a real pandemic lurking in the background.\n\n“If the pandemic isn’t currently raging, how would it change how you interact with your friends at school and outside school?” she asked.\n\nNear the end of class, Ross asked her students what changes they would want in pandemic simulations, and their answers revealed the real pandemic’s lessons. One suggested that the virus could mutate mid-simulation. Another ventured that participants should be randomly sorted into different groups based on population vulnerabilities and preexisting medical conditions.\n\n“Our data doesn’t personalize risk and variability,” he said. “You just see a bunch of dots.”\n\nThis story about a pandemic simulation was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.

The U.S. reported 39,972 daily cases of the coronavirus Thursday, a new daily record, according to Johns Hopkins.\n\nBut the actual number of infections is likely 10 times the number of reported cases, said Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, on Thursday. That would mean officials estimate that 20 million Americans, or 6% of the nation's 331 million people, have actually been infected, leaving the vast majority of the population susceptible.\n\nAmerica’s death toll also has taken a dramatic spike upward after New Jersey added 1,854 people to its official toll.

For first-in-the-morning updates, sign up for The Daily Briefing.\n\nInfections up in some hot areas\n\nNew coronavirus infections are surging in some of America’s hottest places. Florida on Friday became the second state, after New York, to report more than 8,900 new cases in a single day. But New York’s high was back in April.\n\nThat report came as Florida neared an all-time heat record. Sun-baked Texas and Arizona are also getting hit particularly hard by coronavirus. Outside the U.S., crippling outbreaks are underway in such sweltering places as India and Mexico.\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump suggested several times starting last winter that coronavirus would dissipate as warm temperatures came in April. “The virus that we’re talking about having to do, a lot of people think that goes away in April, with the heat, as the heat comes in, typically that will go away in April,” Trump told governors in February, The New York Times reported.\n\nTrump said at a February campaign rally in Manchester, \"The virus: They're working hard. Looks like by April, you know, in theory when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away. Hope that's true. ... We only have 11 cases and they're all getting better.”\n\nInstead, April was the deadliest month, claiming the lives of 57,723 Americans, Johns Hopkins University data indicate.\n\n– Mike Stucka\n\nNew Jersey says 1,854 additional residents likely died of coronavirus\n\nNew Jersey added 1,854 people to its official toll after counting them as probable COVID-19 deaths. The deaths occurred throughout the pandemic, but all the previously uncounted fatalities were included in Thursday’s total – creating an artificial one-day spike in national death numbers.\n\n“We report this out of nothing else than a solemn sense of duty,\" Gov. Phil Murphy said Thursday. \"For many families we hope these determinations will provide a sense of closure and of finally knowing. For our state, I hope it steels our resolve to do all that we can to save every single life that we can save.”\n\nThe state previously counted lab-confirmed cases. The newly released numbers add people whose deaths included COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 or novel coronavirus on the death certificates. They also include people who died in known outbreaks, like those in nursing homes, but without tests; and people who received an early but no-longer accepted coronavirus test, Gannett New Jersey reported.\n\nOn Wednesday, data reported from Johns Hopkins University said America recorded 754 deaths in one day; with New Jersey’s deaths reported Thursday, the count leaped to 2,425. Though relatively few of those deaths actually occurred recently, it’s the single-largest increase in coronavirus deaths since April 29 in the Johns Hopkins data.\n\n– Stacey Barchenger and Mike Stucka\n\nCalifornia urges one county to re-institute stay-at-home order\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom is urging Imperial County to \"pull back\" and reinstate its stay-at-home order amid a surge in positive coronavirus tests there and through much of the state.\n\nAbout 23% of people tested in the Southern California county, which borders the Mexican state of Baja California, are positive for COVID-19, according to Dr. Sonia Angell, director of the California Department of Public Health and state health officer.\n\nThat rate is \"particularly concerning,\" Angell said Friday afternoon. The state places counties on a watch list if more than 10% of people test positive.\n\n– Rebecca Plevin and Mark Olalde, Palm Springs Desert Sun\n\n16 NBA players test positive for COVID-19\n\nSixteen NBA players of 302 tested positive for the coronavirus, the NBA and National Basketball Players Association said in a joint news release Friday.\n\n\"Any player who tested positive will remain in self-isolation until he satisfies public health protocols for discontinuing isolation and has been cleared by a physician,\" both organizations said in a statement.\n\nTeams started mandatory testing for players on Tuesday, and Denver’s Nikola Jokic, Indiana’s Malcolm Brogdon and Sacramento’s Jabari Parker were among those who have tested positive.\n\n– Jeff Zillgitt\n\nTrump administration extends funding for testing sites in Texas\n\nThe federal government will continue to fund community testing sites across Texas as the state sees record-breaking increases in new daily coronavirus cases, Gov. Greg Abbott announced in a press statement Friday.\n\nThe Trump administration had planned to end federal funding of 13 coronavirus testing sites in five states on June 30 in favor of a \"more sustainable model\" done in coordination with the states and retail and pharmacy partnerships, according to a senior administration official earlier this week.\n\nThe sites – in Colorado, Pennsylvania, Illinois, New Jersey and Texas – were originally expected to stop receiving funding in May but received a 30-day extension. Texas is home to seven of the sites.\n\nFauci, task force urge adults under 40 to act more responsibly\n\nAdministration officials pleaded with adults under 40 on Friday to act responsibly to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.\n\nIn the first public meeting of the White House Coronavirus Task Force since late April, several administration officials said the rising number of cases in states like Florida, Texas and Arizona suggest that younger adults are not following public health guidance for containing the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nHealthy young people are less likely to suffer the worst symptoms of COVID-19, but they can still infect others – numbers suggest that everyone who catches the virus infects at least one other person, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. And some of those people will be vulnerable to breathing struggles, organ failure, immune overreaction and even death from COVID-19, he said.\n\n– Karen Weintraub\n\nPence doesn't wear face mask in task force briefing\n\nVice President Mike Pence on Friday mentioned everything health officials say Americans should do to protect themselves and others against the coronavirus — hand washing, avoiding touching the face, disinfecting frequently.\n\nHe pointedly did not mention two of the CDC's main pieces of advice — wearing face masks and social distancing. Pence was speaking at the first news conference the White House Coronavirus Task Force has held since April 27. He did not wear a mask during the news conference.\n\nHealth officials in attendance, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, wore masks except when speaking at the microphone.\n\n– Elizabeth Weise\n\nWhat we're reading\n\nStartling images reveal coronavirus forming tentacles in cells\n\nStartling, never-before-seen images show that the new coronavirus hijacks proteins in our cells to create monstrous tentacles that branch out and may transmit infection to neighboring cells.\n\nThe finding, accompanied by evidence of potentially more effective drugs against COVID-19, published Saturday in the journal Cell by an international team of scientists.\n\nBy focusing on the fundamental behavior of the virus — how it hijacks key human proteins and uses them to benefit itself and harm us — the team was able to identify a family of existing drugs called kinase inhibitors that appear to offer the most effective treatment yet for COVID-19.\n\n– Mark Johnson, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\n\nFlorida bars must stop serving alcohol as state sees almost 9,000 daily cases\n\nFlorida is ordering bars to stop serving alcohol effective immediately.The Department of Business and Professional Regulation on Friday morning announced on Twitter that it was suspending on premises consumption of alcohol at bars statewide.\n\nThe new state requirement only applies to bars, so restaurants that serve alcohol can remain open. The order announced Friday suspends the sale of alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises \"for all vendors licensed for such sale who derive more than 50 percent of gross revenue from the sale of alcoholic beverages,\" the state agency said in a news release.\"\n\nThe news comes as the state Friday smashed the daily record for new COVID-19 cases with 8,942 reported. That's a 62% increase over the previous record of 5,508 reported Wednesday.\n\n– Dave Osborn, Naples Daily News\n\nYoung Americans less likely to social distance, survey says\n\nNearly half of young Americans say they’ve hung out with people outside of their household without social distancing, according to a new survey.\n\nAmong Americans ages 18 to 29, 45% said in the past week they have socialized with people they do not live with while not maintaining social distancing, according to a new survey from the Democracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape Project. That is the highest rate among all age groups, with those ages 30 to 44 trailing just slightly at 42%.\n\nThat is almost two times the rate of other age groups. Among Americans ages 45 to 64, 28% reported socializing without social distancing. Americans over 65 were the least likely (21%) to have hung out with people they don't live with while not social distancing.\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nTexas closes bars, limits restaurant occupancy\n\nOne day after pausing additional efforts to reopen Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott on Friday announced another round of restrictions, including closing bars and limiting restaurant occupancy.\n\nThe executive order requires Texas bars to close at noon Friday, although those businesses can still remain open for delivery and take out, including for alcoholic beverages. Restaurant dining rooms can remain open, but the order moves occupancy levels from 75% to 50%.\n\nAnd outdoor gatherings of 100 or more must be approved by local governments, with exceptions for professional and collegiate sports, swimming pools, water parks, museums and libraries, zoos, and rodeo and equestrian events. Those businesses can remain open without approval from local governments but must operate at 50% occupancy.\n\n– Nicole Cobler, Austin American-Statesman\n\nTrump administration considering 'pool testing' for coronavirus\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert, told the Washington Post that officials are talking about implementing a new strategy that tests groups of people together.\n\nIt's known as pool testing, where samples from multiple people are combined and tested as a group.\n\nDr. Deborah Birx, coordinator for the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said this week that \"pooling would give us the capacity to go from a half a million tests a day to potentially 5 million individuals tested per day,\" according to health news site STAT.\n\nHere's how pool testing works.\n\nAnalysis: Younger people are a factor in surge of COVID-19 cases\n\nA USA TODAY analysis finds that while most cases prior to late May were people 45 and older, most new cases since then are among younger people.\n\nThe rapid growth in coronavirus infections among younger Americans is one factor behind why some states have broken single-day records this week, and it marks a new phase in a U.S. pandemic that first gained widespread attention with a Washington nursing home outbreak in late February and early March.\n\nTotal cases among people younger than 45 have grown nearly twice as fast as for people 65 and older since late May, USA TODAY's analysis of CDC data shows. The younger the age cohort, the more rapid the pace of growth.\n\nAlthough COVID-19 has been known mainly for its impact on seniors, experts said the disease can debilitate patients in young age groups as well. And they warned that an expansion in cases among younger people ultimately threatens any vulnerable person with whom they come in contact.\n\n– Jayme Fraser, Matt Wynn, Dan Keemahill and Karen Weintraub\n\nBiden says he'd require everyone to wear masks in public\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden said in a Thursday television interview he would require wearing face masks in public to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Asked by Pittsburgh CBS affiliate KDKA what he would do to help halt the surge in coronavirus cases, Biden said he would \"go back to making sure that everyone had masks.\"\n\nWhen asked if he would use federal powers to require the wearing of masks, Biden said, \"Yes, I would. From an executive standpoint, yes I would.\"\n\nBiden and Trump have struck different tones on face masks while coronavirus case counts continue to rise and the United States reaches new records for daily cases. Trump called masks a \"double-edged sword\" in an interview with the Wall Street Journal last week and has retweeted posts making fun of Biden for wearing one.\n\n– Nicholas Wu\n\nFlorida pauses reopening plan; Arizona stops elective surgeries\n\nIn Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis said in a press conference Thursday that he had no plans of moving to phase three of the state's economic reopening plan, according to WTFS-TV.\n\nPhase two kicked in June 5, allowing for 50% capacity in bars, restaurants, movie theaters, concert venues, arcades and other entertainment businesses, not including some hard-hit counties. There was no official date for phase three, but DeSantis said he's unwilling to start the final stage until the second phase has been successfully completed.\n\nMeanwhile, some Arizona hospitals are pausing elective surgeries or considering pausing them to ensure there’s enough capacity to handle the influx of patients. Hospitals were allowed to resume elective procedures May 1 provided they met certain criteria for available personal protective equipment, beds and staffing, according to an executive order from Gov. Doug Ducey in late April.\n\n– Rachel Leingang and Alison Steinbach, Arizona Republic\n\n18 family members in Texas test positive after birthday party\n\nEighteen members of a North Texas family tested positive for COVID-19 after attending a surprise birthday party in late May. Only one member of the family unknowingly had the virus at the time of the party, WFAA reports.\n\n\"We knew this was going to happen. I mean this whole time this has been going on we’ve been terrified,\" Ron Barbosa told WFAA.\n\nBarbosa, who is a volunteer EMT, and his wife, a doctor, chose not to attend the party, which was hosted by his nephew, due to safety reasons. Barbosa said his family suspects his nephew, who had a slight cough at the time of the party, was the family member who was unknowingly infected after possibly being exposed at work.\n\nThose infected include two young children, Barbosa’s elderly parents and his sister, who is battling breast cancer. Barbosa’s father, Frank, was admitted to the hospital on June 17 and placed in the intensive care unit soon after, where he remains.\n\nWhile it appears that most of Barbosa’s family is on the road to recovery, the experience serves as a warning for what could happen even when proper safety precautions are attempted. Barbosa says all 25 people who attended the party attempted to remain socially distant, and not all of the attendees were there for the entirety of the party.\n\n– Lauren Mitchell, Austin American-Statesman\n\nMore on the coronavirus from USA TODAY\n\nHow is your summer going amid the pandemic?

One such facility, Life Care Center in Kirkland, Washington, said in a statement that one of its residents and one of its associates have been diagnosed with COVID-19. The center is banning visitors for now.\n\nThe worldwide death count surpassed 3,100 Monday, and the number of confirmed cases increased to more than 90,000. Though 80,000 of those have been reported in mainland China, the crisis appears to be shifting away from that country, where hundreds of patients have been released from hospitals.\n\nThe World Health Organization reported that nine times as many new infections were recorded outside China as inside it over the past 24 hours.\n\nIn the U.S., the number of cases has reached 105, and companies are taking steps to continue operating while keeping their employees safe.

Sign up here\n\nHere's the latest on the outbreak of COVID-19:\n\nChina says cases are waning; 'containment is feasible'\n\nChina’s coronavirus caseload continued to wane Tuesday even as the epidemic took a firmer hold beyond Asia, with three countries now exceeding 1,000 cases and the U.S. reporting its sixth death.\n\nThe health ministry announced just 125 new cases detected over the past 24 hours, China’s lowest number since Jan. 20. Another 31 deaths were reported, all of them in the hardest-hit province of Hubei. The figures bring China’s total number of cases to 80,151 with 2,943 deaths.\n\nThe global shift in the COVID-19 epidemic was apparent with 2,410 recovered patients being released from Hubei’s hospitals and treatment centers, many of them hastily built over recent weeks to cope with the thousands of people sickened by the virus. But new infections outside China were far surpassing its totals.\n\nClusters of disease grew in South Korea, Italy and Iran, and the virus has turned up for the first time in New York, Moscow and Berlin, as well as Latvia, Indonesia, Morocco, Tunisia, Senegal, Jordan and Portugal. The worldwide death toll topped 3,000, and the number of cases tops 89,000 in about 70 countries.\n\nGlobal health officials sought to reassure the public that the virus remains a manageable threat.\n\n“Containment is feasible and must remain the top priority for all countries,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.\n\nTrump meets pharma CEOs\n\nPresident Donald Trump told pharmaceutical CEOs on Monday that he wants them to work together and speed development of a vaccine for coronavirus, though other government officials have said that process could take at least a year.\n\n“We will confront this challenge together,\" Trump told drug executives who were invited to a meeting at the White House. \"We will continue to do exactly what we’re doing.”\n\nThe guests, including the leaders of GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer, nodded their heads when Trump spoke of cooperation.\n\nTrump said he heard a vaccine could be ready in as little as three or four months, but Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said a new vaccine wouldn't be ready to \"deploy\" for at least a year.\n\nAlex Azar, the secretary of Health and Human Services, told the group Trump wants to challenge the normal lines for drug development, saying they \"can be a little slow and bureaucratic.”\n\nDevelopment and government approvals of vaccines for new viruses can take months or even years.\n\nVice President Mike Pence, who chairs the White House coronavirus task force, said the drugmaker CEOs have agreed to form a \"consortium\" to try to develop a vaccine.\n\nTravel restrictions to and from portions of Italy and South Korea are being put in place, Pence said, and anyone who comes to the United from those countries will be screened.\n\n– David Jackson, USA TODAY\n\nWashington state ramps up efforts\n\nKing County officials announced plans to buy a local motel and turn it into a quarantine facility for those who need to be isolated. The building is expected to be available by the end of the week.\n\nThe county, where five of the six deaths from coronavirus in the U.S. have been reported, will also place modular units on public properties.\n\n“We have moved to a new stage in the fight to contain and mitigate this outbreak,'' King County Executive Dow Constantine said.\n\nGov. Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency after the first death was announced Saturday.\n\nMultiple schools around the state have closed as a precaution, as districts undergo significant deep cleaning and disinfectant protocols.\n\nSan Antonio mayor declares public health emergency\n\nThe mayor of San Antonio on Monday blocked the release of quarantined cruise ship evacuees, declaring a public health emergency after a woman allowed to leave quarantine later tested positive for the new coronavirus.\n\nMayor Ron Nirenberg's declarations of a local state of disaster and public safety emergency effectively puts the more than 120 passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in limbo, unaware of how long they will be held in seclusion at Lackland Air Force Base to prevent the further spread of COVID-19.\n\nNirenberg and other San Antonio officials also said all passengers must test negative for the virus three times before they can be released.\n\nThe woman who sparked the mayor's alarm tested positive for the illness last month after she was evacuated from Wuhan, China, but was released from quarantine Saturday following two negative tests, officials said. After the woman's release, health officials learned that a third lab test came back “weakly positive.”\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Sunday that she was asymptomatic at the time of her release and met all criteria for release, and that she was returned to quarantine after the new positive test was discovered.\n\nShe was out of quarantine for about 12 hours, during which time she went to a hotel and a shopping mall, said Dr. Anita Kurian, assistant director of San Antonio Metropolitan Health Department.\n\nNirenberg said Monday that it was “totally unacceptable” that the woman was released from quarantine.\n\n“We simply cannot have a screw-up like this from our federal partners,” he said.\n\nNYC: 'It was a case of not if, but when'\n\nNew York state reported its first case, a 39-year-old Manhattan woman who contracted the virus while traveling in Iran, New York Gov.

Andrew Cuomo: Deaths will hit 'apex' at end of April\n\nNew York state's death toll from the coronavirus continued its sharp ascent with 391 people dying the in latest 24-hour period, New York Gov.

The virus has killed nearly 2,000 in the state, almost half the U.S. total.\n\n“That number will continue to go up,” Cuomo said. “That is people who have been on ventilators for a period of time. If you go on a ventilator, there’s roughly only a 20% chance that you will come off the ventilator. The longer you’re on the ventilator, the lower the chance you’ll come off.”\n\nCuomo also said there were 83,712 confirmed cases as of Wednesday afternoon, an increase of 7,917.

The seaside tourist spot is located in the county with Massachusetts’ highest vaccination rate.\n\nCDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said in a statement that the findings \"raised concern that, unlike with other variants, vaccinated people infected with delta can transmit the virus.\"\n\nBut the outbreak, fueled by the highly transmissible delta variant, could have been much worse without vaccines.\n\n\"The vaccines are working. Of the 900 cases related to the Provincetown cluster, there have been no deaths, 7 hospitalizations, and the symptoms are largely mild,\" tweeted Alex Morse, the town manager of Provincetown.\n\n\"The outbreak is contained and Provincetown is safe.\"\n\nDr. Ashish K. Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, called these \"very low rates\" on Twitter, adding that the numbers are \"consistent with theme that vaccines prevent severe illness.\"\n\nJha said as \"many thousands of people (some unvaccinated) showed up to celebrate July 4,\" the \"packed bars, clubs, and lots of mixing of vaccinated and unvaccinated folks in tight quarters\" created \"ideal conditions for COVID spread.\"\n\n\"Bottom line? P-town outbreak would've been a nightmare if no one was vaccinated,\" he said.\n\nEric Topol, founder and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, called Provincetown a \"perhaps worst case scenario\" on Twitter and added vaccines are highly effective in protecting against hospitalization and severe cases.\n\nPeter Hotez, dean for the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, said on Twitter while some breakthrough infections occurred, \"vaccines were still highly effective, saved lives\" in Provincetown.\n\nNew cases breaking some local, state records\n\nA deluge of delta cases is leading to record-breaking all-time weekly case counts in some places in the U.S., including in a dozen Louisiana parishes, 10 Florida counties, three Mississippi counties and three Oregon counties. The surge is also setting all-time case records in two states: Louisiana and Hawaii, according to USA TODAY analysis of Johns Hopkins University data.\n\nOn Friday, Florida logged a weekly case count of 110,447, blowing far past last summer's 83,090 weekly count. The Friday count puts the state in second place for the worst rate of new cases per person, behind only Louisiana.\n\nWhile Louisiana has 4.6 million residents, it accounts for more new COVID-19 cases than New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Maryland, Rhode Island and Delaware combined. These six states have 43.3 million residents combined.\n\nMore:DeSantis won't declare emergency but some Florida mayors are defying him with mask, vaccine mandates\n\nCongress fails to extend eviction moratorium, despite last-minute effort\n\nAfter scrambling for votes all day, the House of Representatives on Friday failed to pass a bill that would have extended a freeze on evictions that is slated to expire Saturday.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and Whip James Clyburn released a joint statement on the failed bill and blamed Republicans.\n\n\"It is extremely disappointing that House and Senate Republicans have refused to work with us on this issue,\" they wrote in the statement. \"We strongly urge them to reconsider their opposition to helping millions of Americans and instead join with us to help renters and landlords hit hardest by the pandemic and prevent a nationwide eviction crisis.\"\n\n-Chelsey Cox and Ella Lee\n\nSix test positive for COVID on Royal Caribbean ship\n\nSix passengers sailing on Royal Caribbean International's Adventure of the Seas, which departed from Nassau Saturday, have tested positive for COVID-19, Lyan Sierra-Caro, spokesperson for Royal Caribbean, confirmed to USA TODAY Friday. All are American citizens.\n\nThe tests came back as part of routine, end-of-cruise testing, which is offered as a courtesy by the cruise line since most passengers need to show proof of a negative test in order to return home. Travelers flying to the U.S. from international destinations are required to show proof of a negative COVID test or proof they recovered from the virus within the past three months.\n\n\"These guests were quarantined and then retested with a PCR test to confirm their diagnosis,\" Sierra-Caro said. PCR and antigen tests were offered to passengers, depending on their destination. The tests that came back positive were rapid tests, and those passengers were retested Thursday or Friday with a PCR test, which is more reliable.\n\n-Morgan Hines\n\nContributing: Mike Stucka, USA TODAY; Jeffrey Schweers, Tallahassee Democrat; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/31"}]}

Disappointing, yes – particularly on the heels of her best-ever Indianapolis 500 finish a year ago – but not unexpected.\n\nThe first couple of months of 2020 looked like just another down-to-the-wire run, hoping to make the Greatest Spectacle in Racing by the skin of her teeth – until it wasn’t.\n\n“There was one week where it all the sudden lit up, and it was going, going, going,” Mann told IndyStar earlier this month. “For a moment there, I really thought it was going to happen – my first-ever corporate sponsor.\n\n“I was close enough that I was starting to allow myself to hope again, which I never do, because I’ve been around this sport long enough that I know that’s the surest pathway to disappointment – to allow yourself to hope.”\n\nMann entered the IndyCar series at the peak of women’s participation in American open-wheel racing. Her series debut with Conquest Racing in the 2011 Indy 500 marked the fifth consecutive year with at least three drivers who are women entering a car and making the field. Three times in the eventual seven-year streak, four women drove in the race, with as many as five making qualifying runs in 2010.\n\nEven after longtime veteran Sarah Fisher retired in 2010, followed by the 2011 exit of Danica Patrick, one of the series’ most recognizable faces and dynamic forces, the future of drivers who are women in IndyCar still appeared vibrant. Ana Beatriz led three women drivers in the 2012 Indy 500 with a 13th-place finish, and Mann returned to the race in 2013 that saw four women take the green flag.\n\n“When I was on the Road to Indy ladder (2009-10 in Indy Lights), we had Danica and Sarah in IndyCar, and Simona (de Silvestro) and Ana were on their way,” Mann said. “And now I look around, and there’s hardly anyone there.”\n\nFor just the third time since her debut, Mann will watch this weekend’s Indy 500 from the sidelines, sandwiched between days-long road trips for various coaching gigs she’s lined up to make ends meet when she isn’t racing. And for the first time since 2000, when Fisher and Lyn St. James marked the first 500 with multiple drivers who are women, there’s not a single woman on the grid.\n\nThis past weekend’s qualifying for the 500 marked the first time a woman didn’t attempt to enter the race since the year before St. James’ Rookie of the Year run in 1992. It marks yet another question mark for the series’ present and future in a season sent into disarray by the coronavirus pandemic, with the most notable effect coming with this weekend’s first-ever fanless Indy 500. Mann’s absence also comes less than two months after IndyCar announced a new $1 million diversity initiative – Race for Equality and Change.\n\n“(Drivers who are women) have been an important part of what’s happened (at the Indy 500) over the years, and it’s something we hope will resume when we get through these COVID economic struggles,” said Penske Entertainment Corp. president and CEO Mark Miles. “And it’s something I hope can even grow in the future.”\n\nMann has her doubts.\n\n\"If they're serious about it, and it's not just a show piece, it actually needs to step up and do it's job, and that's not just about me, and it shouldn't just be about people who aren't racing right now. It should be about making sure someone young managed to do a full season in the Road to Indy program,\" she said. \"It's so much bigger than me, but to see that program be so micro-focused on the hot button topic of the moment, instead of being focused on the big picture, that's what it's going to take for this scenario not to happen again.\n\n\"IndyCar has to see the bigger picture.\"\n\nAdditionally, Mann stated Monday on Twitter that, to her knowledge, the series hasn't reached out to any young drivers who are women to aid in their attempt to make their way up the ladder, either through testing to land with a team or necessary funding to make a full season possible.\n\nIndyCar couldn't immediately be reached for comment.\n\nAdditionally, in a sport rightfully pegged as the most diverse major racing series, with 12 countries represented in this year’s Indy 500, Mann feels it’s a step backward for the field’s 16th-place finisher a year ago to not come close to securing a ride a year later, while 13 of the drivers who finished behind her, as well as five rookies, helped push the field to 33 drivers at the last-minute.\n\nThere’s blame to be placed, she said, but it doesn’t rest on the shoulders of team owners, who have helped her ride in seven previous 500s. And if IndyCar lives up to its pledge, and young drivers who are women with the proper level of talent begin to find it easier to crack into the ladder program, she won't have any qualms.\n\nThe issue's root cause, she believes, is with the lack of able corporate sponsors willing, outside a pandemic landscape, to live up to their own diversity pledges in terms of where they spend their money. And with next Sunday's race, she hopes this glaring hole in the 500 field sparks immediate change.\n\nMann would love to drive in three or four more 500s but her primary concern is for the drivers she hopes will follow in her footsteps. She helped crowdfund a season in the Lucas Oil School of Racing for British teenager Emily Linscott earlier this year.\n\nMore on drivers who are women in IndyCar:\n\nWhenever Mann is able to make her return to racing, she hopes it’s with a platform in place to help launch the careers of those nearly two decades younger than her, so that when she retires, she won’t have to watch another 500 that looks like this. She believes, however, that it’s going to take a major corporate sponsor – one of the many that tout diversity in the company handbook or even take public, active stances for women’s equality – to take a leap of faith.\n\n“Especially in a year where diversity has become such a massive talking point,\" she said. \"I understand the movement is focused in a different place, but as far as racing goes, an entirely white, male field isn’t exactly a good look when you’re trying to promote your new diversity program in the current climate. And I’m making statements now that mean I may never get to get back in an Indy car in the future, because I’m sort of taking a stand that not many people are willing to stand up and say.\n\n“At this stage, I’ve got to try and find that support for the next generation. I’ve got to help them have better opportunities than me. I’ve got to help them not have to be reliant on, effectively, the charity of team owners in order to be at the race.”\n\n'I started racing because of you'\n\nJanet Guthrie isn’t as much surprised as she is dejected. This is a problem she recognized more than 40 years ago when she became the first driver who is a woman in the Indy 500 field in 1977, where she qualified 26th, finished 29th and would take ninth a year later.\n\n“Even back then, I said, ‘What this sport really needs is a woman that has everything it takes: talent, desire, concentration, judgement, emotional detachment, the whole nine yards – plus her own fortune,'” she said. “I believe that’s still the case, and it’s still my opinion that a woman finds it more difficult to find sponsorship than a man of equal accomplishment.”\n\nGuthrie led the first successful charge at the 500, appearing initially in 1976 while passing her rookie tests. She was plagued by mechanical failures all month long, until A.J. Foyt loaned her one of his backup cars on the final day of qualifying. She got up to speed relatively quickly but never made a qualifying attempt.\n\nShe’d go on to run three-straight years, 1977-79, and was followed by Desire Wilson in the early 1980’s, who made three attempts in consecutive years (1982-84) but never made the field. St. James found her way to IndyCar in the early 90s at age 45, becoming the 500’s oldest Rookie of the Year honoree after finishing in11th place – the only one of six rookies still running at the finish.\n\nWith seven runs in the 500 and nine attempts, her final appearance came as another rookie who was a woman arrived on the scene -- Fisher. Though they were both collected in the Turn 1 crash off a Lap 74 restart, they made history competing in the first 500 with multiple drivers who were women.\n\nSeven years later, after a combined trio of top 10s from Fisher (ninth, 2002) and Patrick (fourth, 2005; 10th, 2006), the sport had reached its apex with women drivers.\n\nNot only were Fisher and, particularly, Patrick achieving high levels of success throughout the decade, including the latter’s groundbreaking win at Motegi in 2008, but they were consistently rated IndyCar’s most popular drivers – eight times from 2000-09.\n\nVisions of that decade’s Indy 500s elicit memories of little girls hanging along fence lines, their wiry arms stretching through holes, clutching a Sharpie and a logoed hat. But looking back, neither driver says she drove with the purpose of heightening the awareness of the sport for young girls who may have been dragged to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway each Memorial Day weekend by their parents, previously without a driver who looked like them.\n\n“There was no effort to make progress. The purpose of me racing wasn’t so more girls could race. That wasn’t the motivation,” Patrick told IndyStar, ahead of broadcasting this weekend's NBC’s race coverage with Mike Tirico.\n\nAdded Fisher: “I cringe at the idea of taking credit for other girls getting into racing. Having had to work really hard to get to where I’m at, I don’t want to take credit for all the hard work they had to put in.”\n\nStill, as Fisher roams around Whiteland Raceway Park, which she and her husband recently took ownership of, and other karting and short track racing venues around the country, she’s seeing it now.\n\n“I’m starting to meet some of these girls,” she said. “And they’ll come up to me and say, ‘I met you 15 years ago. Do you remember me? I started racing because I met you.’”\n\nIt makes sense. Girls who were six, seven or eight 10 to 15 years ago and pleaded to hop into a go-kart in the days and weeks after a May trip to IMS are now reaching the level of making the jump toward serious car racing.\n\nOther veterans of the sport have witnessed it, too.\n\n“I have Google alerts for ‘women in motorsports’, ‘women in racing’, and every day, I get 10-20 stories about women I’d never heard of in different types of motorsports,” St. James said. “It’s very encouraging because I know it’s happening organically. We aren’t trying to force something to happen.\n\n“You hope that, when the floodgates open, that there would be more to follow.”\n\nMore on this year's Indy 500:\n\nMann sees it – heck, she lives it. When she isn’t racing, she coaches young drivers and is an active member of the women racing collective Shift Up Now. Her title is \"professional adviser.\" A couple of years ago, she helped create the Pippa Mann Scholarship through the Lucas Oil School of Racing, inviting young drivers who are girls to send in resumes for the opportunity to receive two days of free racing – some possibly for the first time.\n\nWomen are beginning to flood the lowest levels of racing, particularly in the United States, yet we haven’t seen a rookie driver who was a woman at the 500 since 2012. From 2000 through 2012, seven new faces took the green flag on the famed 2.5-mile oval track.\n\n“How is this not a problem? How can we not realize this is a problem?” Mann said. “The paddock has adapted, but corporate America hasn’t.\n\n“Getting girls racing is great, but it’s not going to do any good if, as soon as they need to raise money to get them into the ladder system and to keep going, they can’t go anywhere.”\n\nStruggling to make ends meet\n\nIn 2014, Ayla Agren was on-track to follow Mann’s path. The Nordic and Swedish driver, who began karting at six years old, had finished a childhood trekking all over Europe searching for a way to launch her career. Mann had tried the route, too, but consistently ran into a culture that didn’t believe she could drive at the level of her male peers – even when she proved it.\n\n“It’s a surprise to them when I actually do the job I showed up to do,” Mann said of her racing experiences in Europe. “But here, when I show up, they expect me to be able to drive the damn racecar.”\n\nEarly this decade, after coming to the U.S., Agren did just that. She placed eighth in the 2012 Skip Barber Summer Series in her introduction to American racing, and two years later claimed the 2014 F1600 Championship, a 16-race series over eight weekends, driving for Team Pelfry. The title gave her a berth in the lowest rung of the Road to Indy Ladder – a realistic shot, with the right level of success, to reach IndyCar.\n\nBut even coming in with a championship to her name, she found herself behind the eight-ball at the start.\n\n“We were on the lower end of the testing budget, but we were able to do all the races,” Agren said of her 2015 season in US F2000. “But the next two were both compromised. We could only do half the races with barely any testing ahead of time, so I don’t really feel like I got a lot of results to show what I can do.\n\n“It’s one of those things where we couldn’t make ends meet.”\n\nThe same hurdle has blocked Sabré Cook, who struggled in her one partial season in U.S. F2000 in 2018, before jumping to Europe’s W Series the following year, then back to Indy Pro 2000 this summer.\n\n“All the sponsorship I’ve gotten to date I found myself or through connections my dad gave me,” she said. “I’ve had manager companies, but it’s so hard to find good people that know what they’re doing and are invested in you as much as you are.\n\n“And when you’re an underfunded driver, you can’t sell test sessions for races because no one gets to see those tests. The problem is, you have to sell races, and then go into races with far less prep than any other driver. It’s a double-edged sword when you and your sponsors are investing all this to get to the races, and then you’re not in the best situation to perform.”\n\nThose two women, along with Bruna Tomaselli (2018-19 in U.S. F2000), are the only women who have have driven in the Road to Indy Ladder system since 2017.\n\nGiven the several dozens that compete across all three levels every year, and with just five drivers graduating from the program to join the IndyCar ranks over the past two seasons, Mann doesn’t feel like it’s nearly enough. It’s her goal, in her final years of American open-wheel racing, to find partners, whether it’s a major corporation or an IndyCar team — or both — uniquely dedicated to helping elevate women in the racing community who have proven that they have what it takes.\n\nBut then there’s that double-edged sword Cook spoke of, and it’s no secret across the entire racing community – male or female. You need funding to flash your potential, but unless someone’s willing to take a chance on the impassioned plea of a teenager, your odds of reaching the top aren’t too high. Racing is unique compared to team sports such as football, basketball and baseball – where the greats almost always rise to the top.\n\n“You’re not asking for help for one year, but a several-year investment until you have the audience at races where it can help your sponsors,” Agren said.\n\nThe dream of landing a major sponsor\n\nDespite what some others around the paddock may believe, Mann insists that sponsorship funding is still heavily stacked against a driver who is a woman. The way team owners Dennis Reinbold and Ed Carpenter, as well as team president Larry Foyt, see the issue – funding issues at the upper-levels of racing hits all drivers of the same pedigree in similar ways. All three, through running drivers who are women, or in Carpenter’s case, driving for Fisher in 2011 and then teaming up to form CFH Racing during 2015, have participated with some of the series’ top drivers who are women in the past 15 years.\n\n“I don’t think it matters what gender you are,” Foyt said. “At this point in the sport, a lot of drivers deal with it, and it’s a shame. Pippa’s very deserving to be in the 500, but it’s just part of finding that budget to do it. Sometimes, you just don’t have it.”\n\nAdded Carpenter: “I fully expected Pippa to be part of this year’s race with the support and base that she’s built up. … But I think it’s less a situation of not having a woman. It’s tough for a lot of people to make it happen right now, regardless of your gender. It’s a disappointment. But I’m sure we’ll see Pippa or someone new coming back in the future.”\n\nBut, as Mann explains, it’s increasingly difficult, once you reach IndyCar, but don’t get a full-season opportunity with a developed and proven team, to stick around. And since Patrick left the sport after the end of the 2011 campaign, only Simona de Silvestro (2012-13 with Lotus-HVM Racing and KV Racing) has gotten that shot.\n\nIncreasingly, the cycle starts to feed itself: sponsors aren’t interested in unproven commodities who, because of lack of funding, haven’t been able to fully prove themselves with top-level equipment and engineers. And around and around it goes.\n\n“Every time, the story is always about the struggle. There isn’t a woman coming into the field with a strong team like Danica with Rahal,” St. James said. “Otherwise, it’s that, ‘Oh, here we go. Another struggling female driver in the field,’ and that doesn’t really inspire sponsors. And then young gals wonder, ‘Why do I want to go do that and be this odd, struggling, flailing person?’\n\n“You can be part of the change and feel good about it, rather than the one person trying to make it. It’s not cut out for everybody. As bad as I feel that we don’t have a woman in this year’s 500 field, I’d rather not have one than it be a sad, struggle kind of story. I’m just waiting for another solid one or two or three drivers to come in, kick (expletive), take names.”\n\nMann continues waiting, hoping that some company – just one – will buy into her message, and the message of others around racing, and see that there’s untapped talent waiting for a chance. Imagine the kind of attention they’d get in helping fuel the next Danica Patrick?\n\nThat’s what it’s going to take, as much as Mann's appreciated the help she’s received from the teams she’s worked with the past several years: Dale Coyne Racing, A.J. Foyt Racing and Clauson-Marshall Racing.\n\n“I want the next girls to have the funding to go to the big teams and get in good equipment and really show what (they) can do and be able to make the transition to IndyCar full-time and compete in every race weekend, not just once a year,\" Mann said.\n\n“My dream is to come back, and what if I can bring someone with me who not only wants to work with me, but help me work with the ladder, too. How cool would that be, if I had somebody that said, ‘You know what? We’d like to be part of doing one or two more Indy 500s with you, until the next person in the next generation is ready? But we want you to help us find the right person to be racing when Indy Lights gets going again next year.”\n\nAnd that takes corporate buy-in, which, beyond the one unnamed deal she had all-but locked up that fell through in early March due to the forecasted economic situation related to the pandemic, she’s yet to witness.\n\nThough she shies away from specifics, Mann says the potential deal was large enough to spark conversations with a team she’s yet to race for in her career. Had the realities in the U.S. not taken a dramatic turn for the worse the week leading up to St. Pete, she would have been on a plane to Florida to have a private in-person conversation about laying out the beginnings of an Indy 500 program.\n\n“I can tell you, it would have been really cool to have that brand associated with a woman in the Indy 500,” she said. “I’m always told, ‘It’s too big of a risk,’ and that’s incredibly frustrating. Even major companies who stand by this line of equality as one of their core values. When you talk to them about sponsoring a female racecar driver, they get twitchy and get cold feet.”\n\nFinding the proper perspective\n\nOn Sunday, Mann and others will be watching. Without fans on the grounds at IMS, racing diehards from around the world will tune into what’s typically billed as the largest single-day sporting event in the world.\n\nSome will watch up-close. Fisher will carry on her traditional role as the in-race pace car driver, with Patrick in front of the camera. Agren will be perched up in the upper reaches of IMS, spotting for DragonSpeed and Ben Hanley’s No. 81 entry in the program’s sophomore running in the 500.\n\nShe’s close to the action, and that means something, but her seat also gives Agren that much better a view of what’s missing.\n\n“For all those young girls, kids are led by example, and when you have role models like Pippa, or other women that we’ve had in previous years, it’s easier for girls to see them and realize, ‘I can make it there because they’ve made it there, too,’” Cook said.\n\nPatrick, though, sees it all through a different lens.\n\n“We have to look at it from further away to get the full perspective. It’s now more abnormal that there isn’t a girl than that there is,” she said. “I’d say it’s much more positive and accurate that this is a story that there isn’t someone there, instead of that there is.”\n\nEmail IndyStar motor sports reporter Nathan Brown at nlbrown@gannett.com.

Not only that, Akeel also hails from a country in which women have only been allowed to drive on public roads since 2018.\n\nThe Arizona desert is an ideal place to train for the Dakar Rally. Brandon Bunch/Can-Am\n\nThe Dakar\n\n‘The Dakar’ began life in 1978 as the Paris-Dakar Rally. It ran annually from France to Senegal until 2007 but when the 2008 event was cancelled due to security concerns, the rally was transplanted across the Atlantic, and ran through South America until 2020, when it moved again, to Saudi Arabia.\n\nToday there are five major vehicle categories in the rally: cars, motorbikes, trucks, UTVs and quad bikes.\n\nAkeel’s interest in motor vehicles goes back much farther than the arrival of this world-famous rally in her home country.\n\n“I had a big interest in cars when I was younger,” she tells CNN. “It wasn’t necessarily cars, actually, it was anything that could that I could drive and that included bicycles.\n\n“You know, I just love movement. I love being outdoors. I just love how it felt to communicate to the machine, to get it to go from A to B.”\n\nHer childhood was spent trying all kinds of different modes of transport.\n\n“I started driving things like go karts at a young age, and things like quad bikes,” she explains. “When I was a bit older, I drove two wheeled dirt bikes.\n\n“These are just vehicles that would be in private homes, on a farm or things like that, where I had access to these types of machines, and I would just use them for fun with my cousins and my friends on the weekends.”\n\nHer interest in motor vehicles solidified when her family moved to the UK, where she went to high school and, eventually, college.\n\n“I was very lucky to travel frequently with my parents,” she recalls. “We used to go to kart tracks in England and that was really fun.”\n\nAkeel is blazing a trail for other Saudi women in motorsport. Brandon Bunch/Can-Am\n\nThe chance to drive on the road\n\nAnother door that opened for Akeel in the UK was one at that point firmly closed to her at home – the chance to drive on the road – and she wasted no time obtaining her driving license, aged 17.\n\nShe even admits her choice of destination for her undergraduate studies – the University of London’s picturesque Royal Holloway College, on the English capital’s western outskirts – was influenced by the opportunities it presented to drive.\n\nIt was a move onto two wheels that set Akeel’s mind towards racing.\n\n“When I was 27, I got my motorcycle license, and that was a lot of fun. So, the motorcycle started to direct me towards the racing world.”\n\nAfter gaining a master’s degree in International Business, from Hult University, she moved to Dubai and started riding on the Dubai Autodromo racetrack.\n\n“I could see that I was really loving the sport and having a good time and some of the racers encouraged me to join them, to race the in the national series,” says Akeel.\n\n“I went and got the tests and the exams done for the racing license, and then I got a license issued from the Saudi Motor Sports Federation. And that’s how I started racing.”\n\nThe impetus to switch to cross country racing came, quite literally, as the result of an accident.\n\nIn February 2020, at a 600cc Superstock meeting in Bahrain, Akeel lost control of her bike and fell.\n\n“I had a ‘low side’ fall, which means I fell onto the track on the side that the bike was leaning toward, which is, you know, the, the lesser and easier fall.”\n\nThe six-feet-one-inch-tall Akeel considers herself fortunate.\n\n“I was very lucky. I had some broken bones in my pelvis, my spine, but they were all fractures that could heal naturally. So, I considered that to be a very lucky outcome and I was very relieved and very grateful.”\n\nAkeel drives a Can-Am UTV, designed to tackle the varied terrain of cross-country racing. PR Arabia\n\nMentally prepared\n\nAt the time, the Covid pandemic was beginning to precipitate widespread border closures and lockdowns, so Akeel returned home to Jeddah to recuperate.\n\nWhile resting up she began to consider the appeal of off-road and rally racing, especially as Saudi Arabia was welcoming the Dakar Rally for the first time.\n\n“It’s a great event. It’s international. It hosts a lot of people from all over the world, coming in big numbers, and it’s a lot of fun,” she explains.\n\nAkeel began competing in the FIA World Cup for Cross Country Bajas, a global rally series inspired by the eponymous races on Mexico’s Baja peninsula.\n\n“(I wanted) to get used to the idea of being in different situations, different terrain, which Dakar gives you, across 9,000 kilometers of Saudi Arabia and it’s actually very diverse,” she says.\n\n“So, when I went to the cross-country Baja World Cup, I had two rounds in the Middle East and three in Europe and each of those locations was a completely different way of driving.\n\n“So, I found, for example, it was muddy in Italy, and there was a lot of gravel and water in Hungary. There were a lot of bumpy, rocky parts in the Middle East with sand, with dunes. So that just got my mind prepared for variety and to be able to engage with the unknown.”\n\nBeing ready for the unexpected is a key feature of preparation for the Dakar, Akeel says.\n\n“If you have this mentality that anything can happen at any moment and you expect things to constantly evolve, then you can be well prepared mentally,” she explains.\n\n“And then physically, that’s a different story: so, I have my workout routine and I eat well and sleep well.”\n\nAkeel's success has already attracted a number of high profile sponsors. PR Arabia\n\n‘I have every right to be there’\n\nWith women only recently able to drive on the road in Saudi Arabia, Akeel is aware that she could be seen as a role model by her countrywomen, but she is philosophical about her own path and what she might represent to others.\n\n“I was very lucky to get my license when I was 17 and I had a head start on building that response time and those skills and driving skills,” she says.\n\n“I think it’s important to watch people do it because then you understand that it is possible for you, whoever you are, to get into the sport.\n\n“I mean, I remember when I was joining the first race, I didn’t think twice about … how many women had done this? Had they been from Saudi? Not Saudi? I didn’t think too much about that because the rules say I can be there.\n\n“You know, I have every right to be there. I have my license. I belong here. I have my car, I have my gear, I have my helmet. You know, so I meet all of the requirements. I have a full set of rights of belonging in the sport and that was what I needed.”\n\nThe 34-year-old Akeel says 'The Dakar' 'is \"like summer camp.\" Brandon Bunch/Can-Am\n\nA costly mistake\n\nIn her first attempt at the Dakar, Akeel finished a creditable eighth in her class in the 2022 race, but it could have been even better.\n\n“We were sixth (in the T3 class), which I was very happy with, being a first timer,” said Akeel. “But on the seventh day I had a problem with the turbo and the car had a bit less power. I started to use the brakes less and carry momentum through the turns. But that means more risk.\n\n“(My co-driver) said, ‘you know, if you don’t stop what you’re doing, you’re gonna have a problem’. But I ignored him, and I ended up turning a corner and was caught off guard by a rock and hit the brakes really quickly, and the impact broke the front of the car.\n\nThe mistake cost Akeel four hours and several places.\n\n“I reacted in an emotional way, and I didn’t make the right call,” she admits. “Dakar is a race that forces you to look at yourself and your decisions. And after that, I did change the way I drove.”\n\nCreating a path for women\n\nAkeel’s story has proven attractive to major sponsors, including the likes of Toyota and Canadian off-road specialist, Can-Am, which provided her with the all-important car.\n\n“Dania isn’t afraid to get in there and compete with the boys in a male-dominated sport,” said Anne-Marie LaBerge, Chief Marketing Officer at BRP, which owns Can-Am, of Akeel.\n\n“She is helping to create a path for women and future generations of young women to follow in Saudi Arabia, similarly to what Molly Taylor is doing in Australia, Cristina Gutierrez is doing in Spain, and Cory Weller is doing in the United States.\n\n“These are women creating a path for other women to push their limits and get in the game, whatever the rules are.”\n\nAs for the challenges of Dakar itself, Akeel sees it as a learning experience, but also primarily as fun.\n\n“Dakar reminds me of summer camp,” she says. “You know, every day we wake up, we get our gear on and we just drive for 400 plus kilometers. It’s the finest two weeks.\n\n“When I get in the car, it’s me and the co-driver and the car and the track. That’s it. That’s all that exists. Nothing else exists.”", "authors": ["Jonathan Hawkins"], "publish_date": "2022/12/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/motorsports/2022/05/08/miami-grand-prix-verstappen-victory/9673201002/", "title": "F1's reigning champ takes inaugural Miami Grand Prix by a whisker", "text": "Holly Cain\n\nSpecial to The Post\n\nMIAMI GARDENS — It was a rocky start to the inaugural Crypto.com Miami Grand Prix Formula One weekend for Max Verstappen, but a perfect, trophy-hoisting ending.\n\nThe reigning world champion, who struggled with various car issues during practice Friday and was unhappy with his third-place qualifying effort on Saturday, made up for it when it mattered most.\n\nVerstappen made a daring move in the opening two turns to take second place, then chased down pole sitter Charles LeClerc, passing him for the lead 25 laps into the race and ultimately beating him to the checkered flag by 3.786-seconds for his third victory of the season.\n\nLeClerc’s Ferrari teammate Carlos Sainz completed the podium, holding off Verstappen’s Oracle Red Bull Racing teammate Sergio Perez in a tight battle right to the finish line.\n\nThe win is the 23rd of the 24-year-old Dutch driver’s career and third in 2022 — cutting the two-time race winner LeClerc’s lead in the championship standings to 19 points.\n\n“It was a very good comeback,’’ Verstappen said. “I think I needed a good start. I didn’t know what to expect on the actual start. We had a good launch, and I saw the opportunity to go around the outside and so I tried and nothing worked. So I just tried to see the pace of Charles in front of me and pulled alongside and it was very close, I just couldn’t get into the DRS initially.\n\n“And then I think Charles started to struggle a bit more with the front tires and it seemed like ours was very good on the medium compound. So once I got ahead, I think that basically made my race because I opened up the gap.”\n\nIt was a dramatic 57 laps at the 3.363-mile, 19-turn Miami International Autodrome around Hard Rock Stadium — a maiden race that was every bit the “big event” its organizers had hoped for, generating considerable buzz both locally and nationally.\n\nFormer first lady Michelle Obama stopped by to take in Saturday practice. And such sports superstars as Michael Jordan, Tom Brady, Serena Williams and David Beckham joined celebrities such as Paris Hilton and Ashton Kutcher to tour the garages and meet drivers before the race — then sat trackside to enjoy one of the season’s most exciting races flag-to-flag.\n\nThe sold-out facility — estimated to have hosted 82,5000 people on race day — got to see F1 at its best — dramatic passing and a tight battle for victory between the season’s most accomplished duo — Verstappen and LeClerc.\n\nVerstappen and LeClerc, who's also 24, have been racing one another since childhood. And already this season is shaping to be a grown-up version of their go-kart and early Formula car days — the first real duel for a world championship between them.\n\nLeClerc was able to close the gap to Verstappen, benefiting from a caution period late in the race. As the field bunched up to take the green flag, it gave him an opportunity to try to retake the lead on the ensuing restart. But LeClerc was unable to get close another to attempt a pass.\n\n“We need to look at that and be on top of it for the next race,’’ LeClerc said of believing his tire degradation contributed to his losing the lead.\n\n“Apart of that, I think we were very competitive, at least as competitive as Max. After the safety car [for the caution period], I thought we would have a shot to take back the lead, but it wasn’t enough.”\n\nTheir close competition for the victory was indicative of the entire afternoon from the front to the rear of the running order. Sainz battled fourth-place finisher Sergio Perez all race in the same “Ferrari vs. Red Bull” competition between their teammates that decided the win.\n\nMercedes teammates George Russell and seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton went after it for fifth and sixth place. Ultimately Russell — on fresher tires — held off Hamilton to earn his fifth top five finish in as many races.\n\nThe full course caution period that regrouped the field came out for an incident between McLaren’s Lando Norris and Scuderia Alpha Tauri driver Pierre Gasly, who collided and scattered debris across the course. Neither could continue and joined Zhou Guanyu as the only drivers not classified in the final 20-car finishing order.\n\nThe last yellow came out with only three laps remaining. Mick Schumacher, a second-year F1 driver who competes for the only American team in the sport, Haas F1 Racing, had been on pace to score the first points of his career. But he collided with fellow German driver and four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel during the final laps and Schumacher instead finished 15th.\n\n“The car was really good so I’m gutted that we didn’t get to stay in position — I think it was our best race so far this year,’’ said Schumacher, the 21-year old son of seven-time champion Michael Schumacher.\n\n“We’re all racers, we’re all trying and it was always going to be tough to keep new tires behind us and it was very unfortunate to end the race in that way. We were on the road to getting points, but we’ll have to wait some more.’’\n\nThe series takes a two-week break before the next race in Spain on May 23.\n\nNOTES\n\nTwo-time W Series champion Jamie Chadwick made it a clean Miami sweep Sunday, scoring her second series victory in as many days on the Miami International Autodrome. On Saturday, she made a last-lap pass for the win. On Sunday, she won pole position and was out front all race — easily leading Nerea Marti to the checkered flag by three seconds.\n\nThe 23-year old British driver — who drives for former American Olympian Caitlyn Jenner’s first-year team — has now won four consecutive races in the female-only W Series — dating back to last season. She now holds a 24-point lead over Sunday’s third-place finisher Alice Powell in the championship standings.\n\nAmerican Chloe Chambers, 17, who won top rookie honors on Saturday, finished 10th on Sunday.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/08/world/royal-family-line-of-succession/index.html", "title": "British royal family line of succession: Who's who | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nCharles has become Britain’s new King following the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, at the age of 96.\n\nThe Queen became the sixth female to ascend to the British throne in February 1952, after the death of her father, King George VI.

Strikes and spares are hard to score, which is why you get three bowls on each turn instead of two. Scoring is a throwback to the pre-computer days – paper only (so brush up on your math skills or have your phone handy).\n\nDetails: Action & Atomic Duckpin Bowl\n\nThe Children's Museum of Indianapolis\n\nYou can spend an entire day at this sprawling complex, which was named \"best museum for families\" in the 2017 USA TODAY 10Best Reader's Choice poll.

The blurs of bobbing pink necks are distinctly woodpecker-like in their chaotic, slurp-tastic quest for krill. Feedings are daily at 11 a.m., 1 and 3 p.m. Pro tip: Buy more than one $3 ticket the first go-around. You’ll immediately want to do it again.\n\nDetails: The Indianapolis Zoo\n\nRhythm Discovery Center\n\nGet your beat on at the Rhythm Discovery Center in the heart of Downtown.

The best part is there are plenty of cool restaurants in the area when you need to refuel.\n\nDetails: Discover Mass Avenue\n\nNewfields\n\nIt may still be catching on with residents and critics, but the Newfields name was meant to unite all of the different parts that, to this point, have been pinned underneath \"Indianapolis Museum of Art.\" That includes the IMA, The Garden, The Virginia B. Fairbanks Art & Nature Park: 100 Acres, and the Lilly House. It will still host events such as the Penrod Arts Fair and the Summer Nights outdoor film series, as well as newer offerings such as the Spring Blooms exhibition and \"Winterlights,\" a holiday display of more than 1 million lights. And there is still the IMA's revolving art exhibits and its permanent collection to peruse, including the 1629 self-portrait by Rembrandt.\n\nDetails: Newfields\n\nScottish Rite Cathedral\n\nThe auditorium of Scottish Rite Cathedral, the neo-Gothic Freemason building in the heart of Downtown, is the long-lost doppelganger of the Ministry of Magic courtrooms in the Harry Potter movies. Resident Freemasons give free guided tours of the Masonic fraternity – that’s right, the cathedral isn’t actually a church – from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Tuesday through Friday. Don’t worry, though: They won’t make you face the Wizengamot.\n\nDetails: Scottish Rite Cathedral\n\nSoldiers and Sailors Monument\n\nThere’s plenty to explore at this iconic 284-foot white limestone spire on Monument Circle. Climb 331 steps to an observation deck at the top of the monument, designated a National Historic Landmark, or an elevator will bring you 90 percent of the way. Built between 1887 and 1902, it celebrates Hoosier veterans from all wars prior to World War I. The Col. Eli Lilly Civil War Museum is on the lower level. Admission is free.

It’s the state’s first brewpub and the oldest operating brewery. And the best part is that it has hardly changed. Find a spot with your dog on the patio in the summer months or curl up next to the fireplace for some winter hygge. The menu has everything from stick-to-your-ribs comfort dishes to fresh vegan burgers and salads. Your best beer choice is the classic IPA or an Extra Special Bitter cask ale.\n\nDetails: Broad Ripple Brewpub\n\nCafe Patachou\n\nMartha Hoover has made her impact on the local food scene and Cafe Patachou is a must-stop for brunch – scratch that – this is the place for brunch in Indianapolis. Sure there is avocado toast, but you'll toss that healthy millennial trend in a second for a piece of thick, buttered cinnamon toast. Fresh sandwiches and salads round out the lunch menu. If you're lucky, you'll catch it on a warm day where you can sit on the patio with the dogs.\n\nDetails: Cafe Patachou\n\nChatterbox Jazz Club\n\nDusty decorations, checkered-flag pennants and colorful Christmas lights adorn this local jazz bar that oozes diveyness. Trumpet players feet from your ear, knocking back a Raspberry Kiss while bemoaning days gone by with a 20-year regular through a soft music mist. Mass Avenue isn’t a magic planet, but the Chatterbox might be.\n\nDetails: Chatterbox Jazz\n\nCity Market\n\nOn the surface, it’s a sprawling market hall teeming with crème brûlée, crêpes, and too many kinds of cookies to count. You can buy a trio of tacos from The Tamale Place for under $10 or spring for a palm-sized Blueberry Steak Bacon Lollypop (feat. a “VERY thick” hunk of bacon doused in blueberry syrup) from Gomez BBQ. But below the stalls and stands is a maze of catacombs, dark corners and maybe even paranormal activity. Take a tour through the dimly lit labyrinth of Roman arches on the first and third Saturdays of the month, May through October. If you’re feeling extra-brave, check out one of the special Halloween paranormal investigation tours.\n\nDetails: City Market\n\nEagle's Nest\n\nFood & Wine named this rooftop eatery the most romantic restaurant in Indiana. Located in the Hyatt Regency, Eagle’s Nest couples American cuisine with a 360-degree view of Indianapolis’ skyline. It's the only revolving restaurant in Indianapolis. Diners will be treated to nearly two full turns with views of the Indiana Statehouse and other Downtown Indianapolis sites during the course of a leisurely meal.\n\nDetails: Hyatt Regency\n\nHotel Tango Whiskey\n\nThe veteran-owned distillery was one of the first to open in Indiana. Find the rustic, warehouse-style taproom in the historic Fletcher Place neighborhood just southeast of the city center. There you can taste the Indiana-made rum, vodka and whiskey in cool craft cocktails. Fun fact: Spirits are named following the military phonetic alphabet – Romeo Rum, Victor Vodka, Golf Gin and more.\n\nDetails: Hotel Tango Whiskey\n\nMallow Run Winery\n\nIndiana wines get a bad rep for being too sweet, but this south-side getaway offers varieties for all wine drinkers. Stop in for a quiet tasting and cheese plate or spice things up with a \"Pizza and Wine Night\" or one of the many concerts on the grassy hill behind the winery's renovated barn.\n\nDetails: Mallow Run Winery\n\nMilktooth\n\nYou’ve had brunch – waffles swimming in syrup, bagels coated in cream cheese, last night’s overdone omelet – but you haven’t had Brunch. Culinary connoisseurs travel from across the U.S. to plunk themselves down on spinning stools in a converted Fountain Square garage and commend their morning into Milktooth chef Jonathan Brooks’s masterful hands. Cornmeal Dutch baby pancakes that find their soulmate in strawberry rhubarb, sorghum-glazed bacon and zucchini bread waffles that Eater.com’s Bill Addison described as the best he’s ever eaten. There’s a reason Conde Nast ranked it one of the best restaurants in the world in 2016. But don’t mess with perfection – not that you could, anyway. All modifications are “politely declined.”\n\nDetails: Milktooth Indy\n\nPork Tenderloin Sandwich\n\nNo bucket list would be complete without tasting a real Hoosier tenderloin. IndyStar food writer Liz Biro gives a greasy thumbs up to the tenderloin at Castleton’s Metro Diner, but you can find one at diners or mom-and-pop restaurants statewide. Expect a crispy fried piece of pork at least twice the circumference of the bun, dressed up with a tomato slice and lettuce – and sometimes other surprising toppings.\n\nDetails: Indiana's Best Tenderloin Sandwiches\n\nSaraga International Grocery\n\nYes, Indianapolis now has non-stop flights to more than one international destination, but it's a longer slog to make it to Asia and Africa. If you only have an afternoon or evening, head to one of the three locations for Saraga International Grocery instead, ideally their 62,000-square-foot signature store on the west side. There, you will find foods from all over the world, some of which will be familiar. Flex your gastro-tourism and see how many different countries you can represent in a single meal.\n\nDetails: Saraga International Grocery\n\nShapiro's Delicatessen\n\nThis place is basically an Indianapolis rite of passage. Navigate the buffet-style restaurant where you'll find sandwiches piled high with freshly-sliced meats and all the amazing carb-heavy sides you'd ever want – mac 'n' cheese, potato pancakes, potato salad, noodles with sour cream and more. You will eat until you can't breathe and still have leftovers to last you the next several days.\n\nDetails: Shapiro's\n\nSlippery Noodle Inn\n\nIndiana's oldest continually operated bar in the original building, which opened in 1850, has been used for many things over the years, including a luxurious inn, a German club, a bordello and a way station on the Underground Railroad used to help slaves escape to the north before the Civil War. The Depression-era Brady and Dillinger gangs reportedly used a wall in an out building on the property for target practice. Famous musicians – including Luther Allison, Buddy Miles, Matt \"Guitar\" Murphy and Clarence \"Gatemouth\" Brown – have played at \"The Noodle\" over the years.\n\nDetails: Slippery Noodle Inn\n\nTraders Point Creamery\n\nThe dairy farm and artisan creamery in Zionsville is a cheese and ice-cream lover’s dream. The picturesque grounds include livestock, historic barns, a farm store and The Loft Restaurant where you can try the organic, grass-fed dairy products in delicious dishes. The most important stop, though, is The Dairy Bar for the best milkshake you’ve ever tasted.\n\nDetails: Traders Point Creamery\n\nSt. Elmo Steak House\n\nYour newest frenemy – fresh horseradish – has too much pride to hide. Chunks of it swim boldly in the gleaming, red cocktail sauce that's slathered all over four jumbo shrimp. No other appetizer will make you crave another bite and cry uncontrollably at the same time. St. Elmo's Steak House has been a Downtown staple since 1902, so if you make it through that appetizer, stick around for its world-class chops and seafood.\n\nDetails: St. Elmo Steak House\n\nSun King Brewing Co.\n\nThe resurgence of local craft beer in Indianapolis began when these guys opened in 2009. Since then, Indiana-made beers have been swarming local taps. Sun King is also a leader in canning craft beer. The tasting room in an old warehouse space began with just filling growlers and Hot Pockets on the menu. Now it’s a spot for pints, tons of cool merchandise and the attached café Oca serves pork belly to pair with the brewery’s popular Osiris Pale Ale, Sunlight Cream Ale and Wee Mac Scottish-style Ale. Sun King also has a tap room in Fishers and a distillery in Carmel.\n\nDetails: Sun King Brewing\n\nWorkingman's Friend\n\nThis is like a museum, but it’s actually a bar/restaurant. This west-side Indianapolis diner known for its hamburgers served how they were served in around 1953, which means they are thin and crispy on the edges and fantastic. The WMF has been in the same family since it opened its doors – in 1918.\n\nDetails: Workingman's Friend\n\nMusic, art and theater\n\nFirst Friday Galleries\n\nYou’ve climbed to the top of the Soldiers and Sailors Monument, choked down your first St. Elmo shrimp cocktail (those are tears of joy, right?), and taken in your first Indy 500. But have you explored Indy’s thriving art scene? On the first Friday of every month, approximately 15 galleries across the city open their doors for a free night of noshing, sipping, and painting pondering, often accompanied by concerts or spoken word artists. From June through October, the First Friday Food Truck Festival in the Old National Centre parking lot offers a perfect pre-art appetizer.\n\nDetails: First Friday Galleries\n\nIndiana Repertory Theatre\n\nThis is the place to go to see classic, layered plays. Productions like \"Dial 'M' for Murder\" and \"Raisin in the Sun\" mingle with works like \"Pipeline,\" Dominique Morisseau's drama that chronicles a mother's fight against race, class and money as she tries to bring her son through a broken education system. The works are staged in one of the most ornate buildings Downtown – the former Indiana Theatre movie palace. Make time to check out the lobby ceiling and white-glazed terra cotta.\n\nDetails: IRT Live\n\nIndianapolis Shakespeare Co.\n\nFood trucks, Sun King beer, and sword fights? Count us in. Pumpkin pants and tights? Not so much. The Indianapolis Shakespeare Company puts on a free modern-dress, two-hours-or-less Shakespeare play each summer in the White River State Park amphitheater. The stage provides a picture-perfect frame as the sun sinks over the White River (don’t forget your sunglasses!), and the stellar acting is just a bonus.\n\nDetails: Indianapolis Shakespeare Company\n\nIndianapolis Symphony Orchestra\n\nOne of the country's best orchestras, the versatile Indianapolis Symphony, is known for its precise interpretations of classical works and its swinging renditions of pops. Most of its season, which includes the nationally renowned IPL Yuletide celebration in December, is performed at the Hilbert Circle Theatre on Monument Circle Downtown. If you're around during the summer, hit up a Kroger Symphony on the Prairie concert. You can set up a picnic on the grass at Conner Prairie while you listen to musical stylings by Beethoven, the Beatles, Abba and more.\n\nDetails: Indianapolis Symphony\n\nOld National Centre\n\nDavid Bowie, Prince and touring productions of “The Book of Mormon” and “Wicked” have graced the stage of the Murat Theatre in Old National Centre. Built in 1909 as the Downtown Indianapolis headquarters for the Murat Shriners, Old National Centre was renovated in the mid-1990s by the same concert company, Sunshine Promotions, that built Ruoff Home Mortgage Music Center in rural Noblesville. Entertainment at Old National Centre isn’t confined to a single room: You can catch bands, comedians and more at the upstairs Egyptian Room or subterranean Deluxe.\n\nDetails: Old National Centre\n\nRuoff Home Mortgage Music Center\n\nThis venue’s name has been fluid across 30 summers, but music superstars reliably visit the Noblesville amphitheater known first as Deer Creek Music Center. The Dave Matthews Band recently performed its 40th show at the 24,000-capacity venue that has also been called Verizon Wireless, Klipsch and Ruoff Home Mortgage Music Center. The live-music destination hosted the Farm Aid benefit in 2001 as well as the opening date of Lollapalooza in 2003 – the final touring edition of the festival now identified with Chicago.\n\nDetails: Ruoff Home Mortgage Music Center\n\nThe Cabaret\n\nThe Cabaret, Indy’s posh landing pad for Broadway stars on Pennsylvania Street, has hosted big names such as Ramin Karimloo, Mandy Gonzalez, Jennifer Holliday and Norm Lewis. With a seating capacity of 180, it promises intimate encounters with the performers, with meet-and-greets after most gigs. Bonus: If you’re under 35, a ticket in the high cocktail section can run as low as $40, or $25 if you’re a student.\n\nDetails: The Cabaret\n\nThe Palladium\n\nOpen since 2011 and touted by its founders to “last 500 years or more,” the Renaissance-influenced Palladium makes a flashy architectural mark in Carmel. Inside, it’s a concert hall that’s hosted acts ranging from Joshua Bell to “Weird Al” Yankovic. Beyond performances, the venue is home to the Great American Songbook Foundation and its collection of artifacts related to jazz standards, Broadway shows and Hollywood musicals.\n\nDetails: The Center for the Performing Arts\n\nThe Stutz\n\nIt is a universally acknowledged truth that art is better when paired with classic cars and concerts. The Stutz building, a shuttered 400,000-square-foot car factory that produced the 1914 Stutz Bearcat car that drove in the first Indianapolis 500, is a labyrinth of still-lined hallways and lampposts. Nowadays, more than 80 artists call the studios home. The Stutz Artists Association hosts events throughout the year, including an annual open house each April. It may be a yellow-bricked building, but there’s no yellow brick road to the exit – grab a map!\n\nDetails: The Stutz\n\nColts, Pacers and other sporting events\n\nBankers Life Fieldhouse\n\nThe arena, which opened in 1999 with a cutting-edge design that gave a nod to the high school basketball fieldhouses seen around Indiana, is home to the NBA's Indiana Pacers and WNBA's Indiana Fever. Though it was designed primarily for basketball, it also can accommodate an NHL-sized ice rink inside. It is now the location for the Indiana high school boys and girls championships, but it also has hosted everything from short course swimming to arena football to bull riding to professional wrestling.\n\nDetails: Bankers Life Fieldhouse\n\nHinkle Fieldhouse\n\nBuilt in 1928 with an original seating capacity of 15,000, Hinkle Fieldhouse was the largest basketball arena in the country until 1950. Nicknamed \"Indiana's Basketball Cathedral,\" it hosted the state's high school basketball championship for decades, including the \"Milan Miracle,\" the 1954 victory of tiny Milan High School over Muncie Central High School, which later helped inspire the movie \"Hoosiers.\" It's now a National Historic Landmark and is home to the nationally renowned Butler Bulldogs, who still play on the original floor.\n\nDetails: Hinkle Fieldhouse\n\nIndianapolis 500\n\nThere is a reason they call it the \"greatest spectacle in racing\" because, well, it is. The Indianapolis Motor Speedway is huge – it can easily house every Big Ten Conference Football Stadium within its two-and-a-half-mile oval. And capacity? Race day regularly attracts a crowd of 300,000. And they pack the house for the traditions: the singing of \"Back Home Again in Indiana,\" the fly-over during the National Anthem, the balloons, the milk, the kissing of the bricks. Did we mention the 200-lap race at speeds over 150 mph? This event should land on every bucket list, not just an Indiana one.\n\nDetails: Indy 500\n\nIndianapolis Indians\n\nVictory Field has been recognized as one of the best ballparks in the minor leagues by Baseball America, Sports Illustrated and Midwest Living. The lawn seating in the outfield makes for an ideal evening out for families with young kids. Tickets range from $11 to $17 and the team offers promotions, such as Dollar Menu (Mondays), Craft Bear Nights, 2-for-1 tickets (Tuesday) and Kids Eat Free (Sunday), as well as the one-offs with bobbleheads and super heroes.\n\nDetails: Indianapolis Indians\n\nLucas Oil Stadium\n\nCheer on the Indianapolis Colts – and hopefully watch quarterbacking phenom Andrew Luck throw many more touchdowns – at the cavernous multipurpose stadium, which seats 67,000 and covers nearly 2 million square feet. Lucas Oil opened in 2008 and is sometimes referred to by fans as \"The House That Peyton Built,\" after legendary Colts Quarterback Peyton Manning. It features a retractable roof that can open and close in about 10 minutes.\n\nDetails: Lucas Oil Stadium\n\nNotre Dame Football Game\n\nSports fanatics know you can’t pass through Indiana without stopping in South Bend for a Notre Dame football game. But even if you care more about French fries than field goals, you’ll want to watch the drum major of the “Oldest Band in the Land” lead the marchers onto the field, feet flying higher than the Rockettes'. Pro tip: Leaving before snapping a photo with the “Touchdown Jesus” mural on the side of the library is like walking out of a Marvel movie before the credits.\n\nDetails: University of Notre Dame\n\nTrails, parks and other thrills\n\nBad Axe Throwing\n\nHit a pothole? Break up with your boyfriend? Lose out on the last piece of cheesy bread at Yats? Bad Axe Throwing has an axe for that. For around $40 per person, you can launch axes at wooden bullseyes at this Meridian Street space. If you’re feeling particularly vehement, you can even bring your own axe (darts are so last decade).\n\nDetails: Bad Axe Throwing\n\nCultural Trail\n\nThis is the single key ingredient to beating the \"I'm-new-to-Downtown-Indy-and-I-don't-know-how-to-navigate\" feeling. The Cultural Trail is an urban bike and pedestrian path that connects neighborhoods around the center of the city. Follow it to find the best restaurants, art galleries, theaters, venues and retail shops.\n\nDetails: Indy Cultural Trail\n\nDowntown Canal\n\nYou haven't seen Indianapolis until you've seen it from the water. Work your feet on a pedal boat or your arms on a kayak. Either way, you can propel yourself along the three-mile canal and back. Pedal boats, which seat four, are $35 and bike rentals, which start at $25, can fit three people and two small children in the front basket.\n\nDetails: Wheel Fun Rentals\n\nKnobstone Trail\n\nAt 58 miles in length, the rugged Knobstone Trail is Indiana's longest hiking trail. From a trailhead 15 miles north of Louisville, the trail winds through state forest land in Clark, Scott and Washington counties. The nearly 20,000 feet in elevation changes make it a popular training trail for area hikers hoping to attempt the storied Appalachian Trail.\n\nDetails: Knobstone Trail\n\nMonon Trail\n\nThe Monon Trail is rightfully lauded for how easy it makes riding a bike or walking up to Broad Ripple and parts north, but if you're looking for something different, the White River/Wapahani Trail and Central Canal Towpath are much more scenic and far less crowded. (It's a great way to travel up to the IMA for Penrod!) Your enjoyment in riding on the dirt/clay trail next to the central canal will vary inversely to how long ago it last rained, but don't let the creepy trees and plants to the side scare you away.\n\nDetails: IndyParks\n\nSpeedway Indoor Karting\n\nFormer IndyCar driver Sarah Fisher’s place is a blazing bastion of Indy 500 history. The 14-turn, two-level road course brings out the maniac in even the most composed ‘karter, and the banked oval calls to mind a scaled-down Speedway (sans, sadly, a pint-sized Yard of Bricks). To refuel after your race, check out the onsite 1911 Grill, where you can grab soft pretzel sticks, burgers and, of course, Hoosier tenderloins the size of your hand (okay, two hands). That is, assuming your organs have stopped vibrating by then.\n\nDetails: Speedway Indoor Karting\n\nTurkey Run State Park\n\nTrail 3 at beautiful Turkey Run State Park near Rockville is the ultimate family challenge for weekend hikers. You traverse a suspension bridge, navigate bluffs overlooking Sugar Creek, climb a set of ladders and wade a shallow stream through a narrow gorge. It's easy enough for elementary-age children to conquer but challenging enough for parents to feel like they've completed a workout. Cool off in the nearby Turkey Run Inn after your trek through a slice of Indiana's back country.\n\nDetails: Turkey Run State Park\n\nFestivals, events and conventions\n\nCircle City Classic\n\nMore than 25 years ago, Rev. Charles Williams, then head of Indiana Black Expo, started an annual football game, showcasing two HBCUs. Proceeds from the Circle City Classic game, played in Lucas Oil Stadium, go to scholarships. But even if you're not a football fan, you can participate by attending the parade that precedes the game. Lasting almost two hours, the parade includes high school bands, local organizations and plenty of showmanship and spirit.\n\nDetails: Circle City Classic\n\nCircus City Festival\n\nPeru is known as the Circus City, because several large circuses used to spend the winters there. This museum contains (among many other things, including songwriter Cole Porter’s 1955 Cadillac), the skull of a once-beloved circus elephant named Charley who became reviled after turning on his trainer and drowning him in the Mississinewa River. The elephant was later destroyed. Every summer, the town puts on its own amateur circus during an eight-day festival in mid-July.\n\nDetails: Circus City Festival\n\nCorn Mazes\n\nPennsylvania likes to claim the first corn maze in the United States, but each fall, Central Indiana gives the Keystone State a run for its money. Take your pick of corn mazes in which to lose yourself. One of our favorites is the Conner Prairie corn maze northeast of Indianapolis. There's nothing like wandering a verdant labyrinth, dried out husks crunching beneath your feet, to make it feel like fall. Once you escape – assuming you escape – celebrate your success with an apple-y treat; there's sure to be one available at whatever farm you've found to test your maze-solving ability.\n\nDetails: Conner Prairie Corn Maze\n\nCovered Bridge Festival\n\nParke County in West Central Indiana is home to 31 rustic covered bridges, each with its own charming past. Each fall, the Parke County Covered Bridge Festival in Rockville – which will be celebrated from Oct. 12-21, 2018 – celebrates that unique heritage with free entertainment, shopping and food vendors. Guided bus tours are offered from the Rockville Courthouse Square, and you also can order a free brochure with a map and five suggested driving routes here. Beware that the festival and nearby roads can be crowded, so leave yourself plenty of time to enjoy yourself.\n\nDetails: Covered Bridge Festival\n\nGen Con\n\nDowntown Indianapolis is often taken over by conventioneers, but few have the pageantry and style of Gen Con, the annual gaming convention. Even if you don't have a ticket or pass, roaming the Indiana Convention Center makes for wonderful people-watching. Actually have a ticket? Get ready to fall into the orbit of people who love games – board games, RPGs, video games.\n\nDetails: Gen Con\n\nGermanFest\n\nEach October, the Athenaeum pits dachshund against dachshund in a snappy sprint for the canine crown (a.k.a. a handful of treats) at GermanFest. The actual racetrack is only about 45 feet long, but the lederhosen, bandana and tutu-clad dogs turn it into an NYC-caliber runway. Not all the dogs finish (hey, hay bales can be downright distracting), but they’re stinking cute even when they’re going for the glory tail-first.\n\nDetails: GermanFest at the Athenaeum\n\nIndiana State Fair\n\nAround 900,000 people go to the fair each year. If you've lived in Indiana through at least one August, there's no doubt you were one of them. The Indiana State Fair has something for everyone. Like animals and don't mind the smell? Step inside the Swine Barn. Thrill seeker? Try the amusement games and rides along the Midway. Gourmand – but not too picky? The fair offers a range of treats from lemon shakeups to grilled corn to all things fried, including butter. In the exhibition halls, you can marvel at your neighbors' ability to paint a sunset, bake a cake or grow a gourd. No wonder there are more than two weeks to take it all in.\n\nDetails: Indiana State Fair\n\nIrvington Halloween Festival\n\nWouldn’t it be great if Christmas lasted for an entire week? That’s what happens when Irvington, an Indianapolis neighborhood about 15 minutes east of Monument Circle, hosts a spookily spectacular eight-day Halloween celebration. You don’t have to cross the pond – or land a time machine – to step into Victorian London. Just hit up the Masquerade Ball. After surviving Jack the Ripper’s rampage, put some spook in your spokes with a zombie bike ride, or play it safe by hitting up a street fair with more than 120 vendors.\n\nDetails: Irvington Halloween\n\nLotus World Music Festival\n\nBloomington’s four-day international music and arts fest flies you to Belgium, Russia and Germany sans plane, boat or train – only instruments. More than 12,000 music-lovers rock out at venues ranging from night clubs to churches. And don’t worry if you don’t know any of the acts on the bill – no one does. The goal is to experience music from around the world, not mainline Justin Bieber for a weekend.\n\nDetails: Lotus Fest\n\nMecum Car Auction\n\nEach May, the auto auction house Mecum brings hundreds of high-end vintage cars to the Indiana State Fairgrounds and sells them to the highest bidder. Watching people buy cars might not seem like entertainment, but the museum-quality cars are so cool, it works – the auction is televised! There’s an air of celebrity to it, too. Last year, for instance, Reggie Jackson, the 1970s baseball star known as “Mr. October,” sold 18 of his own cars, including a 1961 Chevrolet Corvette with just 29,300 miles on it.\n\nDetails: Mecum Auctions\n\nSymphony on the Prairie\n\nEvery city's arts community brings the indoors outdoors in the summer and Indy is no exception. The Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra heads to Conner Prairie (and brings along some guests) in Fishers each summer for a two-month series of concerts al fresco. And Newfields host its own movie series under the stars in Indianapolis with a lineup ranging from the classics to the Heartland Film Festival. So you can choose whether to picnic your way through Prokofiev or Puccini. Just don't forget the bug spray.\n\nDetails: Symphony on the Prairie and Newfields' Summer Nights Film Series\n\nThe Mini\n\nYou don't need to be a world-class athlete, or even in particularly great shape, to participate in the Indianapolis Mini-Marathon. The race, on the first Saturday of May each year, draws thousands of weekend warriors who want to gain the satisfaction of completing 13.1 miles, often with friends and family. The course includes a lap around the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, and more than a few participants stop to kiss the bricks as they pass the famed Pagoda.\n\nDetails: Indianapolis 500 Festival Mini-Marathon\n\nToboggan Run\n\nYou don't need to ski or skate to speed the winter away. Make the most of winter with a visit to the Toboggan Run at Pokagon State Park near Angola. You'll whiz down the quarter-mile track at a speed that drops 90 vertical feet. You can squeeze four people onto a toboggan, but keep in mind extra weight may slow the ride. The top recorded speed on the run is 42 miles per hour. And because the track is refrigerated, you don't even need snow to enjoy the fun.\n\nDetails: Toboggan Run at Pokagon State Park\n\nDay trips\n\nAmish Country\n\nThe clip-clop of the horses and black buggies let you know when you’ve entered Amish country in Northeastern Indiana. Sit down to a family style meal at the massive Das Dutchman Essenhaus restaurant in Middlebury, bid on a cow at the cattle auction or find a bargain at the massive Shipshewana Flea Market. You can experience life on an Amish farm at Amish Acres in Nappanee. The Amish are known for their quilts, baking and beautiful flower gardens, all of which you can find here.\n\nDetails: Shipshewana\n\nColumbus Architecture\n\nColumbus, Indiana, (pop. 46,000) has architectural bragging rights to match big cities. The American Institute of Architects ranks it sixth in the nation for architectural innovation and design, right behind Washington, D.C. Irwin Miller, once the head of Cummins Engine Co., offered to help pay for construction costs of new buildings – if the architects came from a short list. The result? More than 70 buildings designed by I.M. Pei, Eliel and Eero Saarinen, and others. Walking and bus tours are available.\n\nDetails: Columbus Architecture Tours\n\nHistoric Madison\n\nTransport yourself back to the height of the industrial age by visiting Madison’s 130-block historic district along the Ohio River, about 100 miles south of Indianapolis. The leafy and lovely downtown features majestic storefronts and homes from the early 1800s to the 1930s, a scenic river walk and plenty of restaurants and shops. Don’t miss touring the Greek Revival splendor of the Lanier Mansion, the trickling waters and hiking trails of Clifty Falls State Park or the spectacular views of the Ohio River from the bluff at nearby Hanover College.\n\nDetails: Historic Madison\n\nHoliday World\n\nThis southern Indiana theme park is what would happen if that dream (nightmare?) you had about a sunburnt Santa Claus in his swim trunks chasing a turkey through a graveyard came to life. Playing off the town’s real-life name, Santa Claus, Holiday World pays homage to holidays from Halloween to the Fourth of July. And it loves superlatives. The world’s longest water coaster, Mammoth, offers a three-minute shoot through stomach-sinking drops, and the world’s tallest water ride, Pilgrim’s Plunge, dumps riders 131 feet down a hill that looks like a Banker’s Life Fieldhouse-tall straw stuck in a swimming pool. Wooden coasters are plentiful, from the Edgar Allen Poe-inspired Raven to the 4,000-foot-long Headless Horseman hunt, The Legend. Bottomless soft drinks are included with admission – but maybe save those for the Star Spangled Carousel.\n\nDetails: Holiday World\n\nNashville\n\n“I am not,” you say, “driving an hour south just to shop!” Good news – beautiful Brown County has more than just a labyrinth antique mall, handmade apple butter and handcrafted tables and chairs so charming they’ll turn you off IKEA forever (okay, maybe just until you get a fresh whiff of those Swedish meatballs). Five minutes southeast of the rustic shopping mecca lies Brown County State Park, a hiker’s heaven featuring humming waterfalls, 90-foot fire tower views of misty forests and saffron sunsets, and fall foliage so colorful it’ll make a Katy Perry concert seem drab by comparison.\n\nDetails: Brown County\n\nPioneer Village\n\nThe Pioneer Village at Spring Mill State Park near Mitchell offers a quick trip back to the days when Indiana was still a part of the frontier. You can buy cornmeal from a working grist mill, explore settlers' homes and shops, and enjoy old-fashioned Hoosier flower gardens. The state park's other attractions, including hiking trails and guided cave tours, also are worth a drive. Before leaving the area, be sure to check out the Gus Grissom Museum near the park entrance. Grissom, a native of Mitchell, was one of America's first seven astronauts.\n\nDetails: Spring Mill State Park\n\nSpelunking in Southern Indiana\n\nSpelunking was once a risky proposition. But Southern Indiana now has four caves, each distinct, that allow visitors to head underground for some breathtaking experiences. The Indiana Cave Trail encourages visitors to hit all four of these experiences from the mile-long-plus subterranean boat ride in Bluespring Cavern to the stunning stalcites and stalagmites of Marengo Cave. And, on a hot summer day there's no faster way to cool off than to descend into the depths of the earth. Prices vary from cave to cave, depending on the tour.\n\nDetails: Indiana Cave Trail\n\nThe Hoosier Gym\n\nPart museum, part gymnasium, the Hoosier Gym in Knightstown is a must-see for fans of Indiana high school hoops and fans of the 1986 classic “Hoosiers” starring Gene Hackman. It's a short drive from Indianapolis – only about 45 minutes. So grab a ball and see if you can match Jimmy Chitwood’s accuracy or Ollie’s under-hand heave. Other events at the gym include actual games by visiting high school teams, occasional screenings of the movie on the court and other special events.\n\nDetails: The Hoosier Gym\n\nWilstem Ranch\n\nLocated on over 1,000 acres in Paoli (a two-hour drive south of Indianapolis), Wilstem Ranch offers year-round giraffe and kangaroo encounters. But the real draw here is the elephant spa encounters (through November). Wilstem offers a once-in-a-lifetime chance to bathe one of three elephants, love on them and learn more about the peaceful pachyderms.\n\nDetails: Wilstem Ranch\n\nIndyStar producers Dwight Adams, Amy Haneline and Ethan May and several IndyStar reporters and editors contributed to this story.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/01/21"}]}

Tucker Civic Center will be filled.\n\nThat's fairly normal throughout the Florida State men's and women's basketball season. But this is a different kind of competition entirely.\n\nRiot Games has brought its ultra popular PC/Mac video game \"League of Legends\" to town in the form of a four-day tournament dubbed the Mid-Season Invitational.\n\nThe competition brings together six of the world's best professional video game teams from across the globe. It's effectively a six-team regional battle with champions from North America, Korea, China and Europe meeting up to wage war in a fantasy realm.\n\n\"This puts Tallahassee on the international stage,\" said Te'rel Bowman, Director of Event Services for the Civic Center. \"They've been in Paris, Milan, Seoul. For a little sleepy town to wake up and be a part of the world stage really brings us into a new era on how we do business here.\"\n\nVideo gaming is intensely popular in Asia and beyond, and amateur gaming tournaments have been around for a while. But the last decade has seen a rise in popularity and the creation of professional gaming. ESPN has even televised the competitions in a segment of the entertainment industry dubbed \"esports.\"\n\nLast year's \"League of Legends\" World Championship in Seoul, South Korea, had 32 million viewers worldwide watching online. This year's World Championship will have group phases in Paris, bracket stages in London, and then conclude in the finals in Berlin.\n\nAnd Tallahassee was the recipient of the first-ever Mid-Season Invitational, which would be like the champions of various soccer leagues — English Premier League, Spanish La Liga, Colombian Liga — getting together to determine bragging rights.\n\n\"When we heard this was coming to Tallahassee, we were all freaking out,\" said Nick Kostrab, a sophomore computer science major at Florida State University, who runs the 700-member League of Legends club at FSU. \"I didn't believe it was happening when people told me, and I looked online and saw the news feed. They don't even do this on the East Coast, so hearing it was coming to Tallahassee was pretty mind blowing.\"\n\nThree broadcasts are being used to allow the \"League of Legends\" fanbase to watch the events in Tallahassee globally— one for America which was sent to a studio in Los Angeles, another a Korean broadcast and a third directed to China.\n\nThe Civic Center production was massive, requiring more than 200 workers to assimilate the large stage and the many intricate components.

Infuriated that the pipe would carry water pumped from beneath their farms, a crowd gathered and drove away the crew of workers in a fit of shouts.\n\nThen the protesters set fire to the plastic pipes, leaving them charred and warped on the side of the road.\n\nAs tensions rose in the days after that confrontation, threats flew between the protesters and a group of men sent by the company that was laying the pipes. Some of the men wielded wooden clubs, a machete and a baseball bat. Some of the protesters faced criminal charges.\n\nIn this feud over water, small farmers in the Peruvian town of Ocucaje are trying to challenge what they view as a water grab by a company that exports grapes and asparagus. It’s a type of conflict on the rise in parts of the world where groundwater is overexploited and in decline. And in southern Peru, disputes over water have grown especially bitter as some big farms have bought up wells and started piping water to fields miles away.\n\nDuring the past two decades, an agricultural boom has transformed the Ica Valley, turning a desert bordered by sand dunes into rows of asparagus, grapevines and avocado orchards that supply supermarkets in the United States, Europe and Asia. As more and more water has been pumped from wells, groundwater levels have been falling throughout much of the Ica Valley.\n\nSome wells have gone dry, and farmers with small plots complain the newly arrived mega-farms are using up their water.\n\nLeading the resistance in Ocucaje is Joselyn Guzmán, a 21-year-old college student whose family grows lima beans, corn and cotton on their 25-acre farm.\n\nIf the company manages to lay the pipeline, Joselyn said, it would then be able to send the water miles away to one of its farms. She and others in town fear that could leave their fields dry.“We don’t want them to come and exploit our water,” Joselyn said emphatically as she walked down an unpaved lane, followed by more than a dozen farmers and townspeople.\n\n“That’s what we don’t want, for them to take Ocucaje’s water,” Joselyn said. “We don’t want the water to be taken away because it’s the only livelihood we have.”\n\nThe company, Agrícola La Venta, has applied to the government water authority to start pumping from three inactive wells that it bought from an association of local farmers. Water from the wells would flow through about eight miles of pipes to a farm that produces table grapes for export.\n\nThe company insists its wells wouldn’t have any negative effects for neighboring farmers. But Joselyn and others are worried that allowing the pumping would shrivel their crops, which are flood-irrigated once a year when the Ica River swells with seasonal rains, and are then sustained by the moisture that remains in the soil.\n\nThey’re also alarmed about the idea of letting the company pipe away water because in town they’re already struggling with serious water shortages. Their drinking water comes from a well located beyond some dry hills on the other side of town.\n\nThe taps usually flow just once every 10 days or so, and people collect their rations in buckets and barrels. Those struggles for water, Joselyn said, have magnified people’s outrage about the company’s plans.\n\n“What is it they want? To extend their pipes in order to just wait for the permit and suck out the water and take it to their farm,” Joselyn said. She stood beside the charred sections of water pipe, which were strewn in the sand along the road several hours after the confrontation.\n\nPointing down the road, she exclaimed: “Look there. There are the thugs.”\n\nIn the distance, a group of men stood among the trees near one of the company’s wells. She said they weren’t from Ocucaje and had been brought in by the company to intimidate the protesters. She said the men had insulted and threatened people.\n\n“Every time we want to defend what’s ours, because in reality it’s ours, they always send thugs, always,” Joselyn said.\n\nTownspeople stood around listening to Joselyn. Her mother, María Agustina Trillo, chimed in: “We’re David and they’re Goliath.”\n\nWhen night came, the group retreated to a crossroads in the countryside. They vowed to keep vigil through the night to prevent the digging machines from coming back.\n\nThe next morning, Joselyn said she had heard the company was digging in another spot, and she wanted to go. She led the way, giving directions from the backseat while I drove.\n\nOn the road, we passed the men who had been standing guard at the well. I had tried to talk with them earlier, but one of them had told me “we’re just workers,” and said we could talk with a higher-up later.\n\nNow, as we drove past them, one of the men held a large machete as he walked. Others carried wooden clubs. They were joined by a woman who stood watching us pass, holding a baseball bat at her side.\n\nAs we drove on, a car cut in front of us and stopped, blocking the way. Men climbed out.\n\nThey no longer held their weapons, but they quickly approached the car. As one man walked toward us, he motioned for us to turn back, his hand making a circle in the air.\n\n“What’s going on, buddy?” Joselyn asked as she opened the door and stood to face him.\n\nWithout warning, he threw a punch. The jab hit her squarely in the mouth.\n\nAs she retreated into the car, one of the men cursed. Another yelled: “We’re going to go to your house!” They tapped on the windows.\n\nThe man who had punched her yanked open the front passenger door. “Don’t film!” he barked at us.\n\nAnother man slammed the door shut.\n\n“Back up, back up,” Joselyn said as we began to roll away. In tears, she held a hand to her mouth and phoned her parents. “Mamá! Come over here. They’ve hit me.”\n\nAlong the highway north of Ica, a large sign reads: “The Drilling of New Wells is Prohibited.”\n\nAt the bottom is a phone number and a plea: “Report clandestine drilling.”\n\nThe signs were put up by the National Water Authority to underline a ban on new irrigation wells that has been in effect for many years in this part of Peru.\n\nDespite the ban, new wells have continued to proliferate across the Ica Valley and the neighboring farming areas of Villacurí and Lanchas. In one 2012 report, the government estimated that 74 percent of the 1,760 wells in the area were unlicensed and illegal.\n\nThe declines in the aquifers have been so pronounced, and so potentially devastating to the local economy, that the water authority’s officials say they have been trying to reinforce their policies and get a better handle on the quantities of groundwater being used. This year, the government has for a limited time allowed owners of unpermitted wells to apply for licenses and avoid penalties.\n\nIt’s unclear whether that step will bring greater order to a situation that some describe as a chaotic, unmanaged free-for-all in which the aquifers are being progressively depleted.\n\n“The same thing is happening with water as it is with other aspects of society in Peru. That is, there is no regulation,” said María Teresa Oré, a professor of water resources management at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru in Lima.\n\n“You can see the same thing in traffic. People don’t obey the stoplights. They blow the horn. That’s what is happening,” Oré said. She said regulations have been largely unenforced, licenses for wells have been doled out despite the ban, and heavy pumping has been allowed to continue unchecked.\n\n“If you have the ability to run your pump 24 hours a day, you do it,” she said. “There’s nobody who can tell you no. And that’s what has happened.”\n\nThe depletion of coastal aquifers in Peru mirrors similar crises in places from California to China and India. Year after year, much more water is being drawn from the ground than the rains and snow can naturally replenish.\n\nMeasurements taken by NASA’s GRACE satellites, which have been monitoring changes in water supplies around the world, show losses of water since 2002 across large portions of South America.\n\nThe satellites have measured the impact of severe drought in Brazil and the melting of glaciers in the Andes due to global warming. They have also recorded major declines in parts of Chile and in the vast Guaraní Aquifer, which underlies farming areas and cities in northern Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and southern Brazil.\n\nA team of researchers led by University of California, Irvine professor Jay Famiglietti, who is also senior water scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, has produced maps from the satellite data. The map of South America shows the melting of glaciers in Peru, Bolivia and other Andean countries as patches of yellow, orange and red. But the map doesn’t capture the depletion of smaller coastal aquifers, apparently because of the relatively large-scale nature of the satellite data, which show regional changes at a resolution of roughly 200,000 square kilometers. There are also other limitations with the satellite data, including that the effects of groundwater pumping are lumped together with changes in rainfall, snowpack and surface water.\n\nStill, measurements of water levels in wells show that significant groundwater depletion is occurring in parts of Peru.\n\nThe aquifers in and around the Ica Valley are a case in point. The National Water Authority has estimated that wells are pumping out roughly double the amount of water – in some areas more – than what naturally seeps back into the aquifers from the water that flows down from the Andes.\n\nA USA TODAY/Desert Sun analysis of Peruvian government data found that groundwater levels have been falling in about 60 percent of the wells for which measurements are available in the Ica area. The average drop over the past 12-18 years has been about 16 feet.\n\nIn some areas, the water levels have plunged by more than 80 feet since 2001. In one well in Villacurí, the water table has fallen 128 feet since 1997.\n\nThe drawdown accelerated in the 1990s, when the Peruvian government started a push to attract more investment in export crops.\n\nIn the Ica area, the acreage planted with asparagus has exploded, skyrocketing from 1,015 acres in 1991 to 25,698 acres in 2011. Peru has become the world’s top exporter of fresh asparagus.\n\nOther crops such as grapes and paprika peppers have also proliferated, along with pomegranates, blueberries, snow peas, tangelos and avocados.\n\nMuch more groundwater is pumped from this stretch of the coastal desert than any other part of the country. The National Water Authority has warned in its most recent plan for the Ica area that without action to slow the decline of aquifers, severe water shortages could lead to plunging farm output and job losses within years.\n\nWhile large farms have been investing to keep the water flowing, other farmers in the area are struggling.\n\nIn the community of La Venta, an association of farmers sold two of their wells a decade ago to an asparagus export company because the wells were failing and no longer worked. The group didn’t have the money to fix the wells, and facing debts, they chose to sell.\n\nLooking back on that decision, Mamerto Cuya Villagaray said his 15-member association ended up with a raw deal. The new owners promptly fixed up the wells and ran pipes miles away to its fields.\n\n“These wells run day and night, and we’ve realized that it’s taking away flow from the wells around here,” Cuya said, standing next to the brick pump house, which was topped with an electrified fence. “They’ve caused us harm.”\n\nHe complained that the company quickly obtained permission to run a power line to the well, something he has been unable to secure for his association’s one remaining well, despite years of trying. “Maybe they need to be bribed. I don’t know. I’m waiting for them to give me the license.”\n\nWithout electricity, they must rely on a diesel pump which costs more to run.\n\n“Every year we end up in debt,” Cuya said. The banks have started foreclosing and farmers have been losing their land.\n\nWells all around the area have been declining, he said, and within several years the association’s well could go dry.\n\n“It’s going to make us disappear,” he said. “Without water, what are we going to do?”\n\nAt dawn, Cuya flicked a switch and the diesel motor roared to life, sending water coursing through a canal to flood rows of cotton.\n\nNear the well, he passed an empty field dotted with scraggly weeds. The farmer, he explained, couldn’t afford to pump water to this part of his land. “If you don’t have money, you can’t buy water.”\n\nIn the moments after she was punched, Joselyn held a hand to her mouth and wept. She met her parents and a dozen other townspeople on a dirt road just outside town. They crowded around her to hear the story: how the men surrounded the car, how one of them gave her a kick and punched her.\n\n“We were going through a public place,” she said, anger rising in her voice. “I’m going to continue with this. This gives me even more courage to continue on. I don’t care if my life’s in danger. I don’t care.”\n\nShe went to the doctor and filed a police report that same day in August. Some people from the town kept watch on a dirt road, saying they hoped to prevent Agrícola La Venta’s workers from starting to lay pipe again.\n\nThe company has offices in Lima and Ica, and on its website promotes its efforts to be socially responsible and use water sustainably.\n\nReached by phone, Javier De los Ríos, the company’s manager and director, insisted he wouldn’t approve of any violence by his workers.\n\n“I haven’t hired anyone to attack anyone,” De los Ríos said. He said the people who were trying to block the pipe-laying work had acted aggressively and forced the company to pull its machines out of the area. “Didn’t they go looking for a fight, as we say here?”\n\n“They burned seven of our pipes,” he said. Referring to Joselyn, he added: “The little chubby one, the one that you say they hit… she poured the gasoline to set the pipes on fire.” He said his workers had seen her do it.\n\nAs for the rest of the incident, he said, “I’ve asked my security people and they’ve told me that they haven’t tried to do anything to the journalists who came and that they haven’t seen them.”\n\n“They could be lying to me because they aren’t exactly little angels, and if that were the case, I apologize. But that’s not endorsed by us,” he said.\n\nDe los Ríos defended his company’s plans. He said the company didn’t yet have government permission to use the three wells but was applying for authorization.\n\nAs for his opponents in Ocucaje, he said, “the issue here is political.” He said an “ultra-leftist” group has been stirring up controversy, and he accused a local governor of being an “agitator.”\n\nHe argued that pumping water from the aquifer won’t affect the shallow layer of moist soil that the town’s farmers rely on. Their complaints, he said, are based on false concerns.\n\nHe pointed to one 2014 report by the government water authority showing groundwater levels remain relatively high in Ocucaje – between 7 feet and 23 feet underground – and that the water level has been stable in the area. The report focused on the problem of salt buildup in the soil, which has ruined some farmland, and concluded it’s due to poor drainage and farmers’ reliance on flood irrigation.\n\nIn another report in 2012, government engineers recommended monitoring groundwater levels and allowing Agrícola La Venta to start using three wells.\n\nThe National Water Authority is still evaluating the company’s proposal. Jorge Ganoza Roncal, director of the authority’s regional Chaparra-Chincha branch in Ica, said the agency will determine whether local farmers would be affected by the pumping. While the company has been awaiting approval, dissension has been festering in the town.\n\nDe los Ríos said some people in Ocucaje have faced death threats for siding with his company. He pointed out police detained three men suspected of making those threats after finding ammunition and explosives in their car. According to an account in the Peruvian newspaper Correo, a prosecutor found the evidence insufficient and released them.\n\nJoselyn argued the explosives were planted to discredit those who oppose the company. As for the torched pipes, she said, “it was the people.”\n\n“If we didn’t burn something, they weren’t going to pay attention to us,” she said. “It was a protest.”\n\nShe and four other people are facing criminal charges including endangerment of public safety, causing damages by starting a fire, extortion and rioting.\n\nTheir conflict parallels similar frictions between small-acreage farmers and large industrial farms in places around the world. And it also carries echoes of Peru’s right-versus-left political battles and entrenched tensions between the poor and the wealthy.\n\nCompanies have been buying up wells from old farming cooperatives. Those cooperatives are a legacy of the agrarian reform of the late 1960s and 70s, which was promoted by the leftist military ruler Juan Velasco Alvarado and involved seizures of plantations nationwide.\n\nIn Ocucaje, Agrícola La Venta bought inactive wells from one of those farming cooperatives. The deal was approved in a vote by the cooperative’s members, and while the company obtained legal title to the wells, complaints about the process have persisted among some in Ocucaje.\n\nIn Joselyn’s home, a protest sign hangs on a wall facing the front door. It reads: “DON’T TAKE AWAY THE WATER, WE’RE THIRSTY”\n\nShe said her family’s farm is at risk along with others. If they company is able to pump from the wells, she said, it could end up taking over much of the area and pushing out the small farmers.\n\n“It’s our water,” Joselyn said. “I want people to realize the danger we’re in.”\n\nHer mother, María Agustina, added: “The water belongs to the people – to us, who were born and raised here.”\n\nShe vowed to continue the fight, and tears welled up in her eyes.\n\nWhen strong winds blow in from the Pacific and sweep across the dunes, they stir up huge clouds of sand and dust that blot out the sun. They leave towns covered in an orange-brownish haze.\n\nThese dust storms are a reminder that the desert of southern Peru is among the driest places on the planet. But where water is pumped from beneath the sand, the desert blooms into productive farmland.\n\nAt the end of a road that cuts through wind-rippled sand dunes, Miguel Bentin and his brother Juan Pablo have created an island of green in what was previously barren desert.\n\nWhen they founded their company, Valle y Pampa, in 2008 and started building a fence on the land, some veteran farmers were skeptical they could make farming work among the undulating dunes.\n\n“When we first came, you needed a GPS to know if you were in or outside the property,” Miguel said.\n\nThey had studied the area in the province of Pisco, north of Ica, and had confirmed there was water to be tapped. The Pisco River lies about 4 miles to the north, and they found water underground that appeared to be seeping downhill from the river.\n\nThey have six wells on their 3,700 acres but for now are using only two. On more than 500 acres, they’ve planted asparagus, blueberries and pomegranate trees.\n\nThey also invested in an ultra-efficient irrigation system. Called high-frequency irrigation, the system uses sensors called tensiometers to measure the moisture in the soil and automatically sends out small pulses of water at short intervals throughout the day in order to keep soil moist around the plants’ roots. This technology, while costlier than others, uses much less water than conventional drip irrigation.\n\n“We are as efficient as we can be with the conditions we have,” Miguel said, standing on a dune overlooking the pomegranate trees.\n\nThe Bentin brothers have made efficiency a priority because they want to avoid the water problems that are plaguing other areas. While groundwater levels have been falling elsewhere, Miguel said the levels of their wells have held steady.\n\nThat doesn’t mean technology alone can save Peru’s aquifers, he said, because when farmers can squeeze more earnings from the same amount of water, they can be tempted to vastly expand their acreage and keep overpumping. But he said the technology, combined with other efforts, can certainly help.\n\n“I think we have a green future,” he said, “if we do things right.”\n\nHis brother Juan Pablo led a tour of the farm, where workers were moving along rows cutting sprigs of asparagus. Harvesting the crop is especially labor-intensive because a shoot of asparagus can grow 4 inches in a day. If it isn’t collected quickly enough, the asparagus can grow too large for export and be wasted.\n\n“This crop is coming very well,” Juan Pablo said, driving past a field of bushy plants. While asparagus requires more water than other crops, he said, their farm has managed to grow it with half the water that other farms use.\n\nTo the south in Villacurí, flower farmer Amalia Ghiglino has also adopted similar water-saving technology. She said her company, Florisert, has cut its water use by more than 50 percent by switching from a conventional irrigation system to high-frequency irrigation.\n\nShe made that change after the water from one declining well became too salty and the farm lost more than 60 acres of wax flowers. Ghiglino secured permission to seal the well and drill a new one, and since then has dramatically reduced the farm’s water footprint.\n\n“People are getting more conscious of the importance of maintaining and taking care of our water,” Ghiglino said. She said farmers, after years of overexploiting the aquifer, now realize that without action, “we can just collapse.”\n\nGroundwater levels in the area have fallen from 131 feet to 177 feet deep during the past 15 years, but she said the water table has recently stabilized. And her business has taken off, sending wax flowers that end up in bouquets in the United States, Canada, the Netherlands, Korea and Japan.\n\nWorking with the government, she and other farmers in Villacurí have formed an association. They’ve been backing a government plan, the Pisco River-Seco River Basin Water Consolidation Project, which will capture water from the Pisco River and bring it by canal to supply farms and relieve the pressures on the aquifer, which receives very little natural recharge.\n\nThe canal is to be built with both government money and private sector funding, similar to the Chavimochic Special Project, an irrigation system that channels water from the Santa River to Peru’s northern coast and has made possible a major expansion of farmland.\n\nBuilding the canal from the Pisco River would help ease the water problems in the Villacurí area, but the proposal doesn’t make it any less urgent for farmers to reduce their water use, said Micha Hadas, an Israeli irrigation specialist who works with both Ghiglino and the Bentin brothers. He said if more of the big companies that use the bulk of the water shift to similar water-saving systems, they would go a long way toward safeguarding groundwater.\n\n“It’s definitely in danger due to overexploitation, due to wasting of water, due to irrigating in a less efficient and irresponsible way,” Hadas said.\n\nHe said if the authorities would simply enforce the rules that already exist, that could help address the depletion problem. “We take the water, and everybody takes what they can. It’s without control and without discipline.”\n\n“We’re damaging the aquifer in an almost irreversible way,” Hadas said. “The aquifer is falling and the water is growing saltier and saltier. In very little time, that could cause an economic disaster.”\n\nIn Ica, mototaxis swarm around the entrance of the shopping mall, where the bustling crowd shows how the farming boom has rippled through the economy.\n\nA billboard across the street advertises a new housing development, apparently for the wealthier set, with an attractive pledge: “A home with water 24 hours a day.”\n\nMany people in the area would jump at the chance to have that. In rural towns south of Ica, residents say their taps have been running once or twice a week, usually for just a couple of hours.\n\nFarmworker Marta Bellido, who was at work harvesting asparagus, said the water often comes on while she and her husband are at work. When they can’t be there, they ask neighbors to collect water for them in jugs and barrels.\n\n“We get what we can, and sometimes there’s none,” Bellido said after emptying a load of asparagus into a crate.\n\n“The big farms have water. We on the other hand don’t,” she said. “They have it because they have money to bring groundwater.”\n\nShe said she wishes her family could receive at least an hour of water a day.\n\nMany Peruvians lack access to running water, both in rural areas and in growing urban slums.\n\nIn the slums that blanket the hills around Lima, tanker trucks rumble down dirt roads selling water. On some of the hilltops stand large rectangular nets that capture droplets of water from the fog that rolls in from the ocean. Water trickles from the netting and is collected to be used in community gardens.\n\nIn the Ica Valley, public water agencies run the taps sporadically. Jesus Natividad Neyra said she pays 8 soles – or about $2.50 – a month for water that comes twice a week.\n\n“We have to fill up quickly because it’s only two hours that they give us,” Neyra said. She had just finished filling her plastic barrels with a hose and was scrubbing laundry in a tub on her front porch. When the hose stopped flowing, she said: “They should give us better service.”\n\nOn another street, farmer Flor Gamboa said that on top of the dismal water service, less has been flowing to her field of asparagus from a well operated by the local farming cooperative. She said in the past there was plenty of water, but that changed when Chilean-owned businesses put in large farms nearby.\n\n“Where is there going to be enough water? They dig deeper. They take the entire flow. Nothing is left here, just very little water,” Gamboa said. “The big farms hurt us, the small farmers. They harm us a lot.”\n\nShe said some of her neighbors have stopped farming due to the lack of water, and at some point the only option may be to go work for a big farm. “What do they care? They only care about shipping off their crops.”\n\nHuman rights activist Jorge Aparcana said agro-export companies have been aggressively buying up wells, pumping heavily, and leaving small farmers with dry wells.\n\n“That’s injustice and exclusion,” said Aparcana, a leader of the Ica Human Rights Commission. “I agree with having investment, but it can’t be done in whatever way without any sort of control.”\n\nAparcana said it’s nothing short of a “crime” to grow asparagus in the desert because it’s such a thirsty crop. He argued there ought to be gradual efforts to outlaw water-guzzling crops in the area. And even though the big farms have brought jobs, he said, tensions have grown as small farmers have been pushed aside.\n\n“My fear,” he said, “is that it could be a breeding ground for more violence.”\n\nConflicts have surfaced before, such as in 2009, when protesters tried to block a company from laying pipes to carry water from wells to farmland miles away. Police in anti-riot gear were called out and used tear gas to disperse the crowd. The company eventually was able to complete its project.\n\nDavid Bayer, an American activist who has lived in Peru for decades and who joined farmers in those protests, said he’s concerned about the potential for violence and hopes conflicts can be avoided. If supplies of drinking water run out, he said, anger could spill over.\n\nBayer is a former USAID official who first came to Ica as a Peace Corps volunteer in the 1960s, and he has studied and written about the problem of groundwater overdraft in Ica. He said one agro-exporter who moved away to another area had acknowledged being concerned about possible violence. Bayer said the man told him he feared that if townspeople run out of water, they could storm his farm and burn it down.\n\n“It’s a very serious situation,” Bayer said, “and the most important thing is we have no emergency plan.”\n\nOthers argue the agro-exporters unfairly get a bad rap. They say that the big farms use water much more efficiently than small farms, and that towns have faulty water service due to a lack of government investments in infrastructure.\n\n“I’ve had problems with communities that think by putting a well in an area, we’re affecting water they never had,” said Jorge Vargas Corbacho, who grows avocados, grapes and citrus on about 1,200 acres. “There’s a lot of ideology in this issue because there are people who complain, rightly, that they don’t have water, but the government doesn’t have a presence in some communities, and the one they complain to is the business next-door or the biggest farmer, which doesn’t replace the government.”\n\nHe acknowledged that agriculture is using much of the water and it’s leading to declining groundwater levels. But he said if a drinking water well is drilled deep enough and in the right place, it will gush water. He offered an analogy: “The government has to build a sidewalk for people to walk on.”\n\nDriving out the gates of his farm, Vargas Corbacho continued to a neighborhood where he said the city government had paid a high price to drill a well – and in an area where there’s little water to pump. Only small quantities have been flowing from the well, leaving people coping with a shortage.\n\n“Close to the hills is the worst part, and they drilled it right over there,” he said, pointing to the pump house. “A bad place to look for water.”\n\nIn the middle of the desert, a lagoon shimmers.\n\nThe oasis of Huacachina has long been naturally fed by groundwater seeping into a low spot between mountainous sand dunes. The views of silvery water and palm trees against the sand have made it a popular destination. People come to explore the waterfront and take tours on dune buggies that go racing over the hills of sand.\n\nThe lagoon that visitors see isn’t entirely natural anymore. Its water level has been falling. In order to maintain it, the community has been periodically pumping water into the lagoon to offset the declines.\n\nWater was added twice during the past year because the shores were receding, said Luis Oliva Fernandez Prada, a former mayor of Ica. “They regained one meter.”\n\nFernandez Prada said he also refilled the lagoon once during his tenure as mayor a decade ago. He suspects less water from the Ica River is recharging the aquifer because the city has grown, covering the ground with concrete and homes in areas where water used to seep into farmland.\n\nThe city’s name, Ica, means “springs” in the indigenous Quechua language. A century ago, water gushed from the ground in several spots around the city, including in its central plaza. Those springs have long since disappeared, along with other wetlands similar to Huacachina.\n\nDespite the decline in the aquifer, Fernandez Prada is optimistic. He said farms are making water-saving changes, the government is improving its oversight by making sure wells are licensed and metered, and projects are being drawn up to bring more water from the Andes to the desert.\n\n“This place has generated jobs, money for the country, food for the world,” Fernandez Prada said. “Ica is destined to be the California of Peru in accelerated economic growth.”\n\nThe future of this farming region, though, depends on a supply of groundwater that continues to shrink. And the country also faces challenges as Andean glaciers melt and rainfall patterns shift due to global warming.\n\nGroundwater could help the country through dry times, but there will be less to draw on if Ica and other regions continue to draw down their reserves.\n\nIn a detailed 2010 report, researchers with the organizations Progressio, Water Witness International and the Peruvian Center for Social Studies concluded that unsustainable water use in the Ica Valley has had a negative impact on small and medium-sized farms and has contributed to social conflicts.\n\n\"Unless action is taken, the overexploitation of the aquifer will eventually exhaust the water resources which the city of Ica and its population of over a third of a million people depend on,\" the researchers said in the report. \"In a perverse process of self-destruction, all but the most powerful farmers will be forced out as the resource becomes scarcer and more expensive to access.\"\n\nPeru passed a water law in 2009 that established measures to regulate groundwater. Since then, organizations made up of groundwater users have been formed. But in practice, government controls remain weak and rules often go unenforced.\n\nThe government has recognized the proliferation of unlicensed wells as a problem and is trying to solve it by permitting well owners in the Ica area to apply for licenses this year, said Ganoza, director of the National Water Authority’s regional branch. Anyone caught drilling a new well without permission in 2015 or thereafter, he said, could face criminal charges.\n\nGanoza said regulators are also working to gather better information about how much groundwater is actually being pumped.\n\nWhen the agency studies whether to grant permission for a well, officials look at whether that pumping would affect other adjacent wells. Ganoza said he has assured people in Ocucaje that the agency will carefully evaluate whether the proposed pumping by the company would be detrimental to their farms. And if there are harmful effects, he said, the water authority would not grant permission.\n\nWater managers in Ica have also been backing proposals to capture more water in the Andes and route it to the Ica River to alleviate the stresses on the aquifer.\n\nThere have long been tensions over water between Ica’s farm owners and people in the neighboring Andean region of Huancavelica, where impoverished communities that rely on herding llamas and alpacas have opposed the diversion of water to the coast.\n\nGovernment officials from both regions have recently been in talks backed by the Peruvian government aimed at smoothing over those tensions. They’ve been discussing a proposal to build a canal that would bring water from the Pampas River, which flows on the other side of the Andean divide toward the Amazon, to the Ica River.\n\nBringing more water from the highlands is critical in order to avoid a “collapse” in the Ica area, said Alfredo Sotil, manager of the Ica Valley Groundwater Users Board, who recently attended a meeting in Lima where officials of the two regions discussed plans for a watershed-level council.\n\nSotil’s association has already been carrying out projects to recharge the aquifer using water from the Ica River. He said those efforts seem to be paying off. Up until 2013, the aquifer was declining by an average of about 1.5 meters per year. But last year, after the organization routed more water to areas where it could seep into the aquifer, he said, the average annual decline slowed to about 1 meter.\n\n“If it’s slowing down the decline, we know that some of what we’re doing is working,” Sotil said. He said the area can still capture more of the water that flows down the Ica River, and that can help farms use their wells less.\n\n“The aquifer could end up being in balance at some point,” he said. “That’s the idea.”\n\nSlowing the depletion will be a monumental challenge, especially because water levels have been dropping so rapidly.\n\nPeruvians could look to neighboring Chile for examples of ways to manage their dwindling coastal desert aquifers. In Chile’s Copiapó Valley, in the Atacama Desert, wells have gone dry and some farmland has been abandoned as groundwater levels have dropped. To try to address the problem, the association of groundwater users in Copiapó is actively monitoring water levels in wells, promoting water-saving irrigation and working on a proposal that would require cutbacks in water use.\n\nAs Peruvians confront growing strains on water supplies, they could also look to the country’s ancient waterworks for an example of collective ingenuity that carried a sustained flow of water to the coastal desert year after year.\n\nCenturies ago, people built the Aqueducts of Cantalloc – dozens of subterranean water collection tunnels that capture groundwater from sources at the base of the mountains and carry the water downhill to farmland in the desert. Archaeologists say this engineering feat was the work of the Nazca people, the same culture that left the mysterious Nazca Lines in the desert.\n\nThey built distinctive spiral-shaped openings above the canals called puquios.\n\nSome of the aqueducts have been cleaned and maintained by groups of farmers, and they still carry water to fields of potatoes and other crops. Standing above a puquio, it’s still possible to see water flowing down through a passage that was built perhaps 1,500 years ago.\n\nIn Peru today, the question is whether people will develop analogous innovations to use water more sustainably – and whether they will act before many more wells dry up.\n\nUSA TODAY Investigative Reporter Steve Reilly contributed to this report.\n\nThis special report was produced with a grant from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.\n\n.​", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/12/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2018/12/28/worst-year-ever-2018-trump-1968-vietnam-war-column/2239141002/", "title": "My millennial daughter calls 2018 the worst year ever. I nominate ...", "text": "Thomas Dombrowsky\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nMy millennial daughter, a recent law school graduate, believes that 2018 was the worst year ever. She cites rampant political partisanship and vitriol, a president under investigation, sexual violence, and worsening wage and income inequality.\n\nShe opines that U.S. involvement in overseas wars never seems to end, and that our Middle Eastern wars have caused numerous casualties and weakened American military capability and status in the world.\n\nFinally, my daughter points out that 2018 delivered major mass shootings, historic natural weather disasters and data showing last year's record number of opioid overdoses.\n\nI listened, then I acknowledged that she might be right for her generation, but I then offered some perspective only age and experience is capable of providing.\n\nMy generation would likely vote for the year exactly one-half century ago as the absolutely worst year in our lifetimes.\n\n1968 takes the cake for me. I flew into Vietnam in June 1968 as a young captain. I learned on arrival that Robert Kennedy, the man many hoped would end the war, had been assassinated. Considering what was going on back home, I thought, I might be safer in Vietnam than in America.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nApollo 8 astronauts delivered a 1968 Christmas message that calmed a ravaged nation\n\nI was a military spouse on my own at Christmas. It was painful but also special.\n\nAs a Syrian refugee in America, I watched my country collapse. But there is a path to hope.\n\nI ended up doing two tours. I was very proud of the young men I led in Vietnam in a war that most came to believe would not be won as previous wars had, and these brave men often took the brunt of America’s frustration with the war.\n\nFiery protests at home ...\n\nToday’s polarization pales compared with the Vietnam War debates between the “hawks” and “doves.” My generation’s parents, the \"Greatest Generation\" of World War II, did not understand the boomer attitudes toward the conflict in Southeast Asia.\n\nThe radical anti-war Weathermen would soon form to rail against the establishment, often using violent methods. And the 1968 assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King incited the Black Panther movement to violent confrontation, ignoring King’s commitment to nonviolence.\n\nDr. King’s death also led to fiery protests in many American cities. Active duty soldiers as well as National Guard troops helped restore order.\n\nRacial divides and anti-war sentiments culminated with riots at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, where protesters were beaten by police on live television.\n\nIt was during 1968 that the women’s rights movement gained momentum, with protests at the Miss America pageant. Roe vs. Wade was decided five years later, and we’ve been agonizing over the issue of abortion and feminism ever since.\n\nThe Republican Party nominated Richard Nixon, who had a “secret plan” to end the war, which we later learned was nothing really new and did not end the war as fast as he asserted it would.\n\n... and deadly unrest abroad\n\nIn 1968 alone, nearly 15,000 U.S. service members were killed in Vietnam. The North Koreans seized the USS Pueblo in international waters and imprisoned its crew. The Vietcong and the North Vietnamese army waged the Tet Offensive.\n\nU.S. soldiers massacred Vietnamese civilians in the village of My Lai, a fact not revealed to most of us until 1969, when eyewitness accounts and photos were provided to Congress. An investigation showed that U.S. soldiers killed more than 500 women, children and old men. It was covered up by our military leaders.\n\nThe “Prague Spring” was a tentative move by the Czech people toward democracy, but it was crushed after a few months by a Soviet invasion as America, overburdened by the ongoing Vietnam War, did nothing and the European NATO allies, who did not support America’s involvement in Vietnam, also stood by.\n\nI understand why young people view 2018 as a terrible year. I agree it has been pretty bad. But for many my age, 1968 is and will probably always be — let’s hope — the worst year we endured.\n\nThankfully, that year came to an end, as will this one. Make no mistake, 1968 was truly painful. But we came through it, and we became a stronger country because we learned lessons and made changes. The most important lesson for me was that you do not blame the soldier for bad war policy.\n\nToday’s problems also will be resolved, as long as Americans support and preserve the values and institutions of our democracy, as the Founding Fathers intended.\n\nThomas Dombrowsky, a retired lieutenant colonel and Vietnam veteran, teaches courses in American military history at Gettysburg College.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/12/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/08/tech/twitter-unbanned-users-returning/index.html", "title": "The mass unbanning of suspended Twitter users is underway | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThousands of previously banned Twitter users, including members of the far-right and users sharing blatant misinformation, have begun to have their accounts restored to the platform, according to an independent analysis.\n\nThe mass restoration of accounts comes after new owner Elon Musk said late last month that he would offer “general amnesty” to many who had been removed from the platform. In following through on that commitment, however, Musk risks further alienating other users and advertisers, and exacerbating concerns among watchdog groups about the rise of hate speech on the platform under his ownership (a fact Musk has attempted to refute).\n\nAmong those recently unbanned are a range of large and small accounts, including users promoting NFTs and cryptocurrencies, users tweeting about sports, many users tweeting in languages other than English, as well as both users that appear to be left-leaning and pro-Trump, according to observations by CNN.\n\nBut the restored accounts also include far-right figures such as Andrew Anglin, a self-professed white supremacist who founded the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer, and Patrick Casey, who is associated with the far-right group “America First” and was subpoenaed by the House January 6 committee for his involvement in the Capitol riot.\n\nA number of accounts restored in recent days, including many with thousands of followers, used their first tweets in years to thank Musk for allowing them back on the platform, according to a review of their posts by CNN. Some also quickly began sharing conspiracy theories about issues such as Covid-19 and the 2020 US Presidential election.\n\nA data set of many of the unbanned accounts compiled by researcher and software developer Travis Brown, who worked for Twitter for a year in 2014 and last year began a project tracking hate speech on the platform, shows dozens of users who have had their bans reversed are using QAnon-related phrases or hashtags in their account bios. The dataset was built using Twitter’s API and a tool Brown had originally built to observe and track high-profile Twitter suspensions.\n\nThe accounts that have been restored includes “a really strange mix of accounts” that includes apparent far-right extremists and QAnon adherents, but also, for example, a Miley Cyrus fan account that has been repeatedly suspended and appears aimed mostly at growing a large following, Brown said.\n\nBut Brown added that other accounts he has observed as part of his hate speech tracking project have yet to be reinstated, raising questions about the criteria Twitter is using to restore previously banned accounts, although it’s possible Musk’s reinstatement process will take time. Many users on Twitter have also raised questions about Musk’s move last week to again suspend Kanye West, who has made numerous antisemitic comments, while restoring the accounts of other white supremacists and Neo-Nazis. In another instance, Musk tweeted that he would not restore Alex Jones’s account because of a personal preference.\n\n“I’ve found it really hard … to generalize about how and why certain accounts are allowed back,” Brown said.\n\nTwitter, which has made substantial cuts to its public relations team, did not immediately respond to a request for comment and questions on the number of previously banned accounts restored or its process for doing so.\n\nMusk said last month that he would begin restoring most previously banned accounts to the platform, after having polled his Twitter followers about whether to offer “general amnesty to suspended accounts, provided that they have not broken the law or engaged in egregious spam.” The poll, which garnered more than three million votes, finished with more than 72% voting in favor of the proposition. It is not clear how Musk and Twitter’s remaining staff are sorting out which accounts were banned for spam or illegal activity.\n\nThe new Twitter owner had already begun to restore the accounts of some prominent, controversial users that had previously been banned or suspended from the platform, most notably former President Donald Trump, as well as conservative Canadian podcaster and all-beef diet promoter Jordan Peterson and the right-leaning satire website Babylon Bee.\n\nSome of the accounts restored in the latest wave have already raised concerns from civil rights groups. The Anti-Defamation League on Monday described as “deeply disturbing” Twitter’s decision to allow Anglin back on the platform.\n\n“The return of extremists to the platform has the potential to supercharge the spread of extremist content and disinformation, and this in turn could lead to the increased harassment of users,” Yael Eisenstat, vice president of ADL’s Center for Technology and Society said in a statement to CNN. “Musk’s actions to date show that he is not committed to a transparent process that incorporates the best practices we have learned from civil society groups.”\n\nBefore taking over Twitter, Musk said he disagreed with the platform’s policy of permanent bans, which were typically doled out only after a user had received a number of “strikes” for repeatedly violating Twitter’s policies, including those against Covid-19 or civic integrity misinformation.\n\nShortly after acquiring the company, Musk said he would create a “content moderation council” prior to making major changes, but there is no evidence such a group was ever formed or involved in the decisions to bring back violative accounts. Instead, Musk has appeared to make the decisions himself.\n\nMusk and Twitter have repeatedly stressed that the platform’s rules have not changed, despite restoring accounts that had repeatedly violated its rules and ceasing enforcement of the company’s policy prohibiting Covid-19 misinformation. In a blog post last month, Twitter said that its trust and safety team “remains strong and well-resourced, and automated detection plays an increasingly important role in eliminating abuse.” Content that violates Twitter’s rules, it added, will be demoted on the platform.\n\nYoel Roth, Twitter’s former head of trust and safety who left the company following Musk’s takeover, criticized the billionaire Twitter owner’s top-down approach to content decisions in an interview with journalist Kara Swisher last month, suggesting that the platform had started to be run by “dictatorial edict rather than by a policy.” He also raised concerns about layoffs that hit Twitter’s safety teams.\n\nRestoring additional, previously banned accounts could exacerbate several big issues Twitter is currently facing. It could further alienate Twitter’s advertisers, many of whom have fled the platform in the wake of the chaos since Musk took over and out of fear that their ads could end up running alongside objectionable content. Musk has said the departure of key Twitter advertisers in recent weeks has led to a “massive drop in revenue” for the company.\n\nAds for major brands, including Kia, Amazon, Snap and Uber, have already begun to appear alongside tweets from reinstated accounts such as Anglin’s, according to reporting from the Washington Post and observations by CNN. (Kia told CNN it “continues to monitor the evolving Twitter environment and work closely with their teams on advertisement placement and usage.” The other brands did not immediately respond to CNN’s requests for comment.)\n\nIt could also draw more attention from Apple, which Musk previously tweeted had threatened to remove Twitter from its app store. Musk later said that the concern had been resolved following a meeting with Tim Cook, but Apple has previously shown a willingness to remove social media platforms from its app store over concerns about their ability to moderate hate speech and other potentially harmful content. Getting booted from Apple’s app store would be detrimental to Twitter’s business by making it harder for the iPhone maker’s more than one billion global customers to access the app, and difficult if not impossible for iPhone users to receive app updates.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/12/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/25/politics/biden-new-cold-war-russia/index.html", "title": "Biden wages first showdown of new Cold War-style duel with Russia ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPunishing sanctions were never going to stop Russian missiles, tanks and bombs. But the Biden administration hopes they offer an early edge in the first showdown of a new and dangerous 21st century coda to the Cold War.\n\nHours after Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine, the US drew battle lines for what is sure to be a bitter standoff with the Kremlin likely to last at least until President Joe Biden or Russian President Vladimir Putin leaves power.\n\nThe US leader vowed on Thursday to make Putin a “pariah” by isolating Russian banks, punishing his rich cronies, supporting Ukrainians and containing the Kremlin’s attempt to roll back the outcome of the last generational Washington-Moscow struggle, which brought democracy to Eastern Europe.\n\nWhile Russia seeks to clamp down on Ukraine, biting sanctions are sure to trigger a reaction that will escalate the confrontation between the Russian leader and the West. Referring to the impact of economic warfare, James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence, told CNN’s Erin Burnett: “I rather doubt Putin will sit still for that,” predicting he could seek to inflict pain on the US, for instance, with cyberattacks.\n\nA third factor will also dictate this first chapter of the new US-Russia showdown – the capacity of the Ukrainian people to resist invasion, a possible occupation and what could turn out to be puppet pro-Moscow leaders. A related question of whether the United States should send arms to support a rebellion against Moscow is about to become a hot political issue in Washington.\n\nHistory may record this as the moment when the United States girded for a second great, years-long confrontation against Russia – this time one rooted in a battle between democracy and autocracy, rather than between communism and capitalism.\n\n“Putin’s actions betray his sinister vision for the future of our world, one where nations take what they want by force. But it is a vision that the United States and freedom-loving nations everywhere will oppose with every tool of our considerable power,” Biden said in his Thursday speech at the White House.\n\nHis message of freedom echoed President Harry S. Truman’s speech at the beginning of the original Cold War, which coined the Truman Doctrine that set the stage for years of US policy against the Soviet Union.\n\n“Putin will be a pariah on the international stage. Any nation that countenances Russia’s naked aggression against Ukraine will be stained by association,” Biden said.\n\nBy ostracizing Russia, Biden will change the world. And there will be costs for the United States. Other nations will once again be forced to choose between Moscow and Washington. Putin, spurned in polite diplomatic society, will have an incentive to cause maximum possible disruption to US foreign policy. Russia has been a vital player in attempts to quell the Iran and North Korean nuclear showdowns but may now perceive an advantage in blocking Washington on issues vital to US national security. And Putin’s isolation may push him further toward China, America’s rising superpower rival, which has a strong interest in seeing the US bogged down in Europe.\n\nBut Biden has very little choice but to try to punish and contain Russia. The size of Putin’s invasion, his assault across Ukraine instead of in pro-Russia separatist areas and the alarming rhetoric that he spewed this week mean the world is in a far more dangerous place than it was three days ago.\n\n“What do we do with a country that has simply flaunted the entire international system of rule of law?” asked Steve Hall, a former CIA chief of Russia operations, said on CNN on Thursday. “The answer is we somehow have to contain them and make them a pariah state,” Hall said.\n\nFormer US Ambassador to NATO Ivo Daalder agreed. “The need now is to focus on containing … and through containment effect internal change in Russia,” Daalder told CNN. “It’s the only way we won the Cold War and how we have to fight this new fight, which is not for weeks or months, it’s going to be years.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Biden forcefully condemns Russia's invasion of Ukraine (full remarks) 13:48 - Source: CNN\n\nPutin’s rhetoric cranks up the heat\n\nThat sense of a new and prolonged test of wills between the US and Russia has been fueled by Putin’s rhetoric and action in a shocking few days.\n\nThe enormous scale of the offensive in Ukraine so far is hardly the act of a leader willing to keep lethal force constrained. Its ambition is unmistakable as Putin seeks to change the established geopolitical outcome of the Cold War on the ground in Eastern Europe. The expansionist rhetoric in Putin’s speeches this week also raised the question of whether he plans to eventually move on other former Warsaw Pact territories – a far more dangerous proposition since those such as Poland, Romania and the Baltic States are now in NATO and enjoy the bloc’s self-defense protections. Russian incursions on one of these states could involve the US and Russia in direct combat and a cycle of escalation that, at worst, could end in nuclear war.\n\nA feeling that the West and Moscow could be returning to the scary nuclear brink that saw millions live under the threat of instant annihilation for decades has been raised by the Russian President’s wild warning this week. “No matter who tries to stand in our way or all the more so create threats for our country and our people, they must know that Russia will respond immediately, and the consequences will be such as you have never seen in your entire history,” said Putin, who before the invasion took part in a theatrical test firing demonstration of Russian’s nuclear-capable missile arsenal.\n\nAsked whether Putin was threatening nuclear war, Biden said Thursday he didn’t know. But the Russian leader’s untamed aggression toward the West, fixation on reversing the outcome of the Cold War and extreme demands for concessions that would buckle NATO have introduced a worrying and unpredictable element in international relations. Of course, Putin could be bluffing. Such behavior wouldn’t be surprising for a former KGB colonel trained to exacerbate his adversary’s greatest fears. But the cost of finding out could be unthinkable.\n\nA hole in the sanctions regime\n\nIn past crises – with Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan, for instance – the capacity for even punishing sanctions regimes to trigger political change inside enemy nations has often been overestimated in Washington. Still, supporters of the Biden administration argue that the newly announced sanctions on Russia could have a significant effect, even if they are too little too late for some observers.\n\n“They will put pressure on him,” Rhode Island Democratic Sen. Jack Reed told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “The Lead” on Thursday, noting unusual political demonstrations against Putin in Moscow.\n\nMaximum pressure from sanctions takes time to build, another reason why the confrontation between the US and Russia figures to be prolonged. It also requires unity and can be undermined by US adversaries who break sanctions blockades. This may be where Putin’s recent visits for talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping turn out to be extra significant. And even the current US and allied sanctions are not as strong as they could be.\n\nBiden admitted on Thursday that European nations were not yet ready to throw Russia out of the SWIFT financial messaging system, which is the backbone of global banking payments, trades and currency exchanges. Expelling Russia would severely inconvenience nations like Germany, which rely on the system to buy Russian natural gas and oil exports. The dilemma underscores how reliance on Moscow’s energy could undermine NATO unity.\n\nUkrainians area already fighting the battle\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Thursday that 137 Ukrainian solders had been killed since the invasion began and 316 soldiers had been wounded. Ukraine claims to have shot down several Russian jets and helicopters. Given the superior numbers of Russian troops, it is inevitable that Ukraine will eventually fall. But many experts believe that a long insurgency could develop, and raise the cost for Putin of the invasion.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken told lawmakers in a conference call on Thursday that the battle for Ukraine would take “a long time to play out.”\n\nCNN’s Manu Raju, citing a source familiar with the call, reported that Blinken said that the endgame of the invasion would be dependent on the Ukrainian people.\n\n“Will they allow themselves to be subjected to a puppet government?” he asked, according to the source.\n\nBlinken’s comments pointed to one of Putin’s greatest vulnerabilities in the crisis. A country the size of Ukraine cannot be subdued even with around the 190,000 troops that Putin massed on the borders if the populace wants to revolt. A puppet government installed by Russia would not only face questions of legitimacy. It could trigger the kind of popular uprising that took place in 2014 and ousted Putin-backed Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, which led directly to the current invasion that is meant to crush Ukraine’s democracy and dreams of moving toward the West.\n\nThe extent of Ukrainian resistance is critical to US policy going forward since it would weigh on the question of whether Washington would fund an insurgency in the country, which would mirror the 1980s effort that helped oust Soviet troops from Afghanistan. There’s strong support in Congress but it would also potentially require the cooperation of European states to serve as transit routes, and they may be wary of antagonizing Putin further. Phil Mudd, a former CIA counterterrorism official who is now a CNN analyst, said US intelligence agencies would be trying to establish the effectiveness of the Ukrainian defense and whether there were opportunities to to help.\n\n“We focused on one piece, ‘What are the Russians doing?’ Now some of the attention has got to shift to the other piece – can we help the Ukrainians?” Mudd told Tapper.\n\nThe idea that the United States would end up effectively fighting a proxy war in Europe against Russia after 30 years of peace would have been unbelievable even a few months ago, despite tense relations with Moscow.\n\nBut it may become a new reality in a new Cold War-style duel with Russia.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/02/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/26/china/china-protests-xinjiang-fire-shanghai-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Protests erupt across China in unprecedented challenge to Xi ...", "text": "Beijing CNN —\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping on Monday faced unprecedented dissent after thousands of demonstrators protested in cities across China over the weekend against his zero-Covid strategy – with some daring to openly call for his removal in the streets.\n\n“Step down, Xi Jinping!

When asked about protesters calling on Xi to step down, he replied: “I’m not aware of the situation you mentioned.”\n\nThough the protests made headlines in international media, Chinese state media carried stories and opinion pieces stressing the severity of the Covid outbreak and the need to persevere with methods to stamp it out.\n\n“Practices have proven that our Covid measures can stand the test of history, they are scientific and effective,” said an opinion piece published by the Xinhua news agency on Monday. “Perseverance prevails.”\n\nBut the challenge to zero-Covid posed by the spread of more contagious variants was underlined Monday when China reported 40,052 new local cases – the sixth consecutive day of record figures, according to the National Health Commission.\n\nNearly 4,000 of those infections were identified in Beijing, where – without referring to the protests – city authorities on Sunday banned blocking entrances to residential compounds under lockdown, adding that access must be granted to emergency services.\n\nProtests in Shanghai\n\nDemonstrators stand by protest signs in Shanghai, China, on Saturday, Nov. 26, 2022.

The protest gradually dispersed before dawn, the witness said.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, hundreds of Shanghai residents returned to the site to continue protesting despite a heavy police presence and road blocks.\n\nVideos showed hundreds of people at an intersection shouting “Release the people!” in a demand for the police to free detained demonstrators.\n\nCrowds shouting \"Release the people!\" in Shanghai. @whyyoutouzhele/Twitter\n\nThis time around, police adopted a more hardline approach, moving faster and more aggressively to make arrests and disperse the crowds.\n\nIn one video, a man holding a bundle of chrysanthemum gave a speech while walking on a pedestrian crossing, as a police officer tried to stop him.\n\n“We need to be braver! Am I breaking the law by holding flowers?” he asked the crowd, who shouted “No!” in reply.\n\n“We Chinese need to be braver!” he said to the applause of the crowd. “So many of us were arrested yesterday. Are they without job or without family? We should not be afraid!”\n\nThe man put up a struggle as more than a dozen officers forced him into a police car, as the angry crowd shouted “Release him!” and rushed toward the vehicle.\n\nOther videos show chaotic scenes of police pushing, dragging and beating protesters.\n\nIn the evening, after one protester was violently dragged away, hundreds of people shouted “triads” at the police, in reference to local crime gangs, according to a livestream.\n\nBBC journalist Edward Lawrence was arrested at the scene of the Shanghai protests on Sunday night and later released, according to a statement from the BBC. A BBC spokesperson expressed concern about Lawrence’s treatment, claiming he was “beaten and kicked by the police.”\n\nOn Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao acknowledged Lawrence’s arrest, claiming he had not identified himself as a journalist before being detained.\n\nPolice officers block Shanghai's Urumqi Road on Sunday.

A small crowd first gathered along the Liangma River for a vigil for the victims of the Xinjiang fire, before it grew in size and eventually marched down the city’s Third Ring Road.\n\nPeople chanted slogans against zero-Covid, voiced support for the detained protesters in Shanghai, and called for greater civil liberties. “We want freedom! We want freedom!” the crowd chanted under an overpass.\n\nA Beijing protester holds a candal in demonstrations on Sunday night. Ng Han Guan/AP\n\nSpeaking to CNN’s Selina Wang at the protest, a demonstrator said he was shocked by the turnout.\n\n“Every conscientious Chinese should be here. They don’t have to voice their opinions, but I hope they can stand with us,” he said.\n\nIn the southwestern metropolis of Chengdu, large crowds demonstrated along the bustling river banks in a popular food and shopping district, according to a protester interviewed by CNN and videos circulating online.\n\nThe gathering started with a minute of silence to mourn the Xinjiang fire victims, later turning political as the crowd grew in size, numbering into the hundreds.\n\n“Opposition to dictatorship!” the crowd chanted. “We don’t want lifelong rulers. We don’t want emperors!” they shouted in a thinly veiled reference to Xi, who last month began a norm-shattering third term in office.\n\nProtesters hold up blank papers and chant slogans as they march in protest in Beijing on Sunday night. Ng Han Guan/AP\n\nIn the southern city of Guangzhou, hundreds gathered on a public square in Haizhu district – the epicenter of the city’s ongoing Covid outbreak that has been locked down for weeks.\n\n“We don’t want lockdowns, we want freedom! Freedom of expression, freedom of the press, freedom of arts, freedom of movement, personal freedoms. Give me back my freedom!” The crowd shouted.\n\nUniversity campuses\n\nAcross China, protests have also broken out on university campuses – which are particularly politically sensitive to the Communist Party, given the history of the student-led Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests in 1989.\n\nIn the early hours of Sunday morning, about 100 students gathered around a protest slogan painted on a wall at the prestigious Peking University in Beijing. A student told CNN that when he arrived at the scene at around 1 a.m., security guards were using jackets to cover the protest sign.\n\nA security guard tries to cover a protest slogan against zero-Covid on the campus of Peking University in Beijing.

No to Covid test, yes to food,” read the message written in red paint, echoing the slogan of a protest that took place on a Beijing overpass in October, just days before a key Communist Party meeting at which Xi secured a third term in power.\n\n“Open your eyes and look at the world, dynamic zero-Covid is a lie,” the protest slogan at Peking University read.\n\nThe student said security guards later covered the slogan with black paint.\n\nStudents at the Communication University of China, Nanjing gather in a vigil on Saturday evening to mourn the victims of the Xinjiang fire. @whyyoutouzhele/Twitter\n\nStudents later gathered to sing the The Internationale before being dispersed by teachers and security guards.\n\nIn the eastern province of Jiangsu, at least dozens of students from Communication University of China, Nanjing gathered on Saturday evening to mourn those who died in the Xinjiang fire. Videos show the students holding up sheets of white paper and mobile phone flashlights.\n\nIn one video, a university official could be heard warning the students: “You will pay for what you did today.”\n\nHundreds of students at Tsinghua University in Beijing gathered on Sunday to protest against zero-Covid and censorship. Obtained by CNN\n\n“You too, and so will the country,” a student shouted in reply.\n\nThe campus protests continued on Sunday.

ISIS later claimed responsibility for the shrine attack, saying in a statement that one of its members had “targeted groups of Sunni refusal infidels inside the shrine with his machine gun.”\n\nThe state news agency ISNA said security forces “did not prevent” protesters from visiting Amini’s grave in Saqqez, which is also her birthplace, but reported that clashes took place after people left the site.\n\n“There were no clashes between mourners and police at the burial site, most were chanting Kurdish slogans, some moved towards the city with the intention of clashes, one of them raised the Kurdish flag,” ISNA said.\n\nIn videos shared on social media, large crowds of people and lines of cars are seen making their way to Saqqez’s Aichi cemetery where Amini is buried. Groups of people in the videos are heard chanting “women, life, freedom” and “death to this child-killing regime.”\n\nOther videos show plumes of smoke rising from several fires in the streets of a different neighborhood nearby.

As part of his presidential announcement, Pence billed himself as a Reagan conservative, leading the Republican Party back to pre-Trump days.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, “His team’s improbable bet is that a 'Reagan coalition' – composed of the Christian right, fiscal conservatives and national security hawks – can be reassembled within a party transformed by (Donald) Trump.” It may be a long shot, but it at least represents a coherent alternative vision for the GOP to the backward-looking anger and resentment favored by the former president, and increasingly by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nIt was the standard line on the “Mad Men” TV show: “If you don’t like what’s being said, change the conversation.” So how can Pence, Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin or former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley change the GOP’s conversation?\n\nLet’s look at the issues that animated GOP conservatives from Ronald Reagan through the beginnings of MAGA.\n\nRepublicans need a candidate who is a fiscal conservative\n\nA Reaganite candidate has a glaring opening with fiscal conservatives. President Reagan worked hard to limit domestic discretionary spending. Necessary military spending that ended the Cold War drove most of the Reagan era deficits. In contrast, Trump cared not a whit about reining in the federal budget.\n\nAccording to the conservative Manhattan Institute, “Trump left the White House with the largest peacetime budget deficit in American history and a national debt exceeding 100% of the economy for the first time since World War II.”\n\nSome of that spending was pandemic related, but not all. As usual, Trump is unapologetic, and he opposed the recently concluded debt ceiling agreement to solve a problem he helped to create.\n\nBiden wins with debt ceiling deal:Debt ceiling deal reveals the impotence of Donald Trump's MAGA movement\n\nThe concept of limited government is seldom discussed in today’s GOP. The latest right-wing fantasy is the notion of using big government for \"conservative ends.\" Never mind that the main conservative end is freedom.\n\nThis notion has led DeSantis to embrace state power and wage war against “woke” ideas, including the free speech rights of a private company (Disney), the biggest employer in his state. It also underlines his administration’s energetic efforts to censor school library books and curriculum plans, in some cases if only a single parent complains.\n\nIs there a market for a presidential candidate who speaks candidly about the need for a return to limited government, fiscal discipline and budget reform?\n\nTrump’s biggest supporters have been social conservatives. These voters have been willing to overlook his spotty personal life to focus instead on his appointment of originalist judges. A Supreme Court with three Trump appointees overruled Roe v. Wade. Republican state legislatures have responded by passing laws outlawing abortion in virtually all cases, a position that has little public support.\n\nGOP must learn from midterms to win:If Republicans don't listen to Nancy Mace on abortion, the party can count on losing big in 2024\n\nRepublican Party used to be the party of law and order\n\nAn even bigger Republican problem is criminal justice. Republicans since Richard Nixon have fancied themselves as the law-and-order party. However, deference to Trump’s misdeeds has taken on a higher priority. Case in point: the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nTrump’s rhetoric about that horrible day has become radicalized, and he now seems to justify the actions of those convicted of violent crimes. He has teased pardons for even the most violent offenders and called an African American policeman who defended the Capitol a “thug.” He smirks when reminded that the rioters’ chant that day was “Hang Mike Pence.”\n\nDeSantis has followed Trump’s lead and promised that if elected president, he would be aggressive in issuing pardons for Jan. 6 rioters, even one for Trump himself. Yes, really.\n\nIs there a market for a candidate who will defend the GOP’s historic commitment to the rule of law, peaceful protest and American democracy?\n\nReturn to pro-democracy, pro-freedom foreign policy\n\nForeign policy is probably where Trump’s crabby semi-isolationism most differs from Reagan’s freedom-oriented alliance of democratic nations. Reagan energized the international coalition that vanquished the Soviet Union and brought freedom to Eastern Europe and most of the old Soviet Republics. Reagan’s American-led coalition was unabashedly pro-democracy and pro-freedom, forward looking and unalterably opposed to aggressive authoritarian states, including the Soviet Union, where Vladimir Putin was a loyal KGB officer.\n\nBy contrast, Trump and his MAGA Republicans are unwilling to defend Ukraine against unprovoked Russian aggression. In a recent CNN Town Hall, Trump refused to say whether he would support a Ukrainian victory if elected next year.\n\nDeSantis characterized the conflict as a “territorial dispute,” before walking it back.\n\nWhy US can't stop supporting Ukraine:America's billions in aid to Ukraine isn’t charity, but it can't be wasted\n\nPutin’s goal is to reconstitute the old Soviet Union, which represents a direct threat to American interests and world stability. American and NATO support leading to a Russian defeat in Ukraine would be a massive setback to all of the totalitarian states of today – Russia, Iran, North Korea and China.\n\nIs there a market for a candidate who will argue that our national interest demands that America be involved in world affairs by supporting democracy and opposing aggression by authoritarian states?\n\nOne other important Reagan characteristic that has been lost by Trump and his clones is tone. Reagan saw a Republican Party that was optimistic, forward looking and focused on policies to win new adherents to the cause. Trump’s focus is pessimistic, backward looking and dedicated to preserving his narrow base. MAGA demonizes the most vulnerable groups in America for political gain. Reagan grew the pie. Trump sliced it differently. In 1984, Reagan won 59% of votes and 49 states when reelected. Trump received only 47% of the vote in losing reelection in 2020.\n\nIs there a market for a Republican who will focus on the future, enhanced opportunity and a positive agenda that addresses the real needs of America? It’s called changing the conversation.\n\nIt wasn’t that long ago that these Reagan principles had the overwhelming support of Republicans. Maybe when Republicans finally get tired of losing, they’ll return to the party’s historic traditions that worked well for a long time.\n\nFrank Donatelli, a former deputy chair of the Republican National Committee, is the chairman of the Reagan Ranch Board of Governors.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/27/americas/brazil-election-women-voters-asequals-intl-cmd/index.html", "title": "Black and poor women may decide who will be the next president of ...", "text": "This story is part of As Equals , CNN's ongoing series on gender inequality. For information about how the series is funded and more, check out our FAQs .\n\n(CNN) On Sunday, Brazilian voters will decide who will be their president for the next four years -- and polls and experts suggest women will be key in determining the outcome.\n\nThis time round, the electronic voting machines will show the names of just two candidates, as decided by the first round of the election on October 2nd: former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of the Workers' PartyLh and current president and candidate for the Liberal Party, Jair Bolsonaro.\n\nIn the first round, Lula da Silva received 57.2 million votes (48.4% of the total), 1.8 million less than what was needed to reach the 50% threshold for victory. Bolsonaro got just over 51 million votes (43.2% of the total), and in a distant third place came the most prominent woman to run in the election: Simone Tebet of the Brazilian Democratic Movement party, with almost 5 million votes.\n\nPolls had predicted Bolsonaro's performance to be lower ahead of the first round, but they were, within the margin of error, accurate in the percentage of votes that Lula da Silva could receive. Now, in this final stage of a deeply polarized contest, some of the research institutes that conduct these polls are drawing attention to the choices being made by women voters.\n\nWomen make up 51.1% of the Brazilian population and represent 53% of the electorate. Put another way, there are more than 8 million more women voters than men.\n\nIn previous years, experts say this difference would have mattered less to presidential candidates. According to anthropologist Rosana Pinheiro-Machado, Professor in the School of Geography at University College Dublin in Ireland, the core of Bolsonaro supporters remains men and until recently, Brazilian women were less engaged in politics and often simply voted as their husbands did.\n\n\"That started to change since the feminist spring in 2015, with the internet and the popularization of feminism on TV, on the radio, in schools, when politics became a topic talked about among all women,\" says Pinheiro-Machado, who researches both the growth of the far-right and feminism in Brazil's marginalized communities.\n\nThe result of this growing political consciousness among women, Pinheiro-Machado explains, is growing opposition to Bolsonaro from women and especially poor women, following the rise in hunger and poverty during his presidency.\n\n\"The resistance to Bolsonaro is the women of the poor neighborhoods,\" she tells CNN.\n\nPinheiro-Machado's analysis is supported by polling data. In a poll conducted by the Datafolha Institute between October 17 and 19, Lula da Silva leads among women. The institute conducted more than 2900 face-to-face interviews with voters over the age of 16 in 181 municipalities across all regions of the country. Among those surveyed, 51% of women said they intend to vote for the former president, compared to 42% who said they will vote for Bolsonaro.\n\nThe need to attract women voters -- and the displeasure with Bolsonaro among certain groups of women -- is reflected in both Bolsonaro's and Lula da Silva's campaigns, where prominent women are being brought into the spotlight in order to appeal to voters.\n\nBolsonaro's campaign counts on the participation of the first lady Michelle Bolsonaro and the evangelical pastor Damares Alves, who is the former Minister of Women, Family and Human Rights, and was recently elected senator. Lula da Silva's, in turn, has the backing of Simone Tebet and has increased the visibility of his wife, sociologist Rosângela da Silva (known as Janja), who has played an active role coordinating the campaign agenda and engaging in dialogue with supporters.\n\nEven among women, class and race will divide voters\n\nWhile polling data can be flawed, there are other socio-economic and cultural trends that can help illuminate how women might vote on Sunday.\n\nAccording to the Marielle Franco Institute, created to expand the legacy of the Rio de Janeiro city councilwoman murdered in 2018, Black women are the largest demographic group in the country, mainking up more than 25% of the population. This group is mostly made up of the descendants of enslaved people (Brazil had the highest enslaved population of any country that was involved in the transatlantic slave trade, according to the Transatlantic Slave Trade Database, which mapped data on the movement of enslaved people around the world). This demographic is also overwhelmingly poor -- and became even more so during the pandemic.\n\nAs such, anthropologist Pinheiro-Machado points out that, though it is difficult to say with certainty, it is highly likely that this group will support Lula da Silva. The Datafolha Institute poll also found Lula da Silva to be ahead with people on the lowest family income, with 57 % saying they will vote for him, compared to 37% for Bolsonaro.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2011, during his term as President, Lula da Silva introduced Bolsa Familia, a government cash transfer program for low-income families based on certain conditions, such as keeping their children in school and making sure they are vaccinated. Through this and other government programs, Pinheiro-Machado believes he changed women's lives in a \"multidimensional way,\" by enabling female empowerment at different levels, from self-esteem to improving the options available for their daughters. A UN Women report states that of the 50 million people who benefitted from Bolsa Familia, 92% are women responsible for their family.\n\nBolsonaro introduced a monthly benefit for low-income households known as Auxilio Brasil with restrictions on the profile of families who could access it and this month brought the payment dates forward, which some critics see as politically motivated\n\nPinheiro-Machado adds that Bolsonaro also continues to give misogynistic speeches and postures, which further distances him from these voters.\n\nA low-income woman who was already an adult during Lula da Silva's tenure would have the memory of everything that the Bolsa Familia did for her: the financial autonomy she gained, how much the family's health improved, the fact that her children stayed in school, and the fact that her children could go to college,\" the anthropologist tells CNN.\n\nIf Black and poor women are more likely to vote for Lula da Silva, Pinheiro-Machado believes Bolsonaro's campaign will count on the support of two other demographic groups.\n\nThe first consists of equally poor and many Black, but older, evangelical women who support Bolsonaro as a result of his moral agenda, particularly grounded in a fear of the decline in traditional gender roles.\n\nThe second group are women who belong to Brazil's upper-middle class, who, according to Pinheiro-Machado seek to follow a more elite and conservative lifestyle, based on neoliberal and religious values.\n\nInvestment to tackle gender-based violence eroded\n\nWhile the outcome of the election will matter to all Brazilians (Latin America's largest country faces a range of crises, most notably economic and environmental) there is much at stake for women.\n\nFirst is the issue of femicide. A woman is a victim of femicide -- defined as the killing of a girl or woman on the basis of her sex or gender -- every 7 hours, according to the Brazilian Public Security Yearbook 2022 , which states that more than 1340 women were killed for this reason in 2021.\n\nDespite this tragic statistic, the Bolsonaro government recently cut the budget to combat violence against women by 90%. The government program intended to promote gender equality and to confront gender-based violence was also cut and replaced with one that focuses on \"strengthening the family\" and on the \"defense of life from conception\".\n\nThere were also cuts in investments to the Brazilian Women's House (Casa da Mulher Brasileira, a public institution which provides services for women) and in the Women's Call Center (which keeps a record of complaints, provides guidance for victims of violence and information on laws and campaigns).\n\nTo justify the changes, the Bolsonaro government claims that it is providing more resources for the area through budget plans. These plans, however, are not included in the official budget as resources specifically intended for this sector or for combating gender-based violence, as stated in a report by the Institute for Socioeconomic Studies (Inesc).\n\nLiliane Machado, a researcher in the field of feminist and gender studies and professor at the Faculty of Communication at the University of Brasília, recalls that Alves was called to the Senate in 2020 to explain the cuts and explains that the Public Ministry of Brazil is investigating why they were made.\n\n\"After all, violence against women has not decreased, on the contrary, an increase was recorded during the pandemic, and more and more is needed of political policies to end this violence.\" Machado tells CNN.\n\nBrazilian philosopher Djamila Ribeiro, a renowned researcher of Black and decolonial feminism in Brazil, believes the current government has not only introduced policies that have set back the fight against gender-based violence but also the fight against poverty and inequality, with cuts in social programs that economically empowered women.\n\n\"All these policies affect women, whether in the economy, health, housing, education, we don't think of gender apart from these debates,\" she says.\n\nInesc's report supports Ribeiro's view, showing that policies for women -- and resources allocated to them -- in the first three years of the Bolsonaro government did not adequately address gender violence in the country.\n\nUsing federal public budget data released by the Brazilian Senate, Inesc also found that in 2022 the Bolsonaro government allocated the least amount of resource yet to combating violence against women.\n\nLula da Silva has pledged to change this in his government plan , which includes proposals to prioritize gender inequality by focusing on fighting hunger and unemployment and promoting wage equity.\n\nThe former president proposes the creation of the Ministry of Women, the restoration of a specific program to combat gender violence and the strengthening of the Femicide and the Maria da Penha laws - which aim to protect women from domestic and family violence.\n\nHe has also proposed creating a housing program aimed at women, mainly single mothers, Black and peripheral women, and to expand the network of day care centers, elderly centers and full-time schools in the country.\n\nBolsonaro, in turn, has not outlined specific proposals for women in his next administration, but has vowed to continue paying the monthly Auxilio Brasil payments to low-income families and spoken on the importance of inserting young people and women in the job market and investing in entrepreneurship for various groups, including women. Any changes for women are linked to those for families, with the government plan stating that \"the Bolsonaro government understands the family as the cell or base of society.\"\n\nYet a win by Lula da Silva doesn't automatically translate into gains for women.\n\nThe existence of a deep-rooted far-right population and the fact that Bolsonaro's party and allies won 14 of the 27 Senate seats contested in 2022, (giving the current president's party a plurality in the legislative house) is likely to make any possible Lula da Silva administration in 2023 more difficult by challenging plans to invest heavily in the environment; and programs for women and combatting other progressive agendas. He will also be limited by the state of the nation's economy.\n\nStill, there is some optimism about the future of equity and gender policies in Brazil. The legislative elections, which took place at the same time as the first-round presidential vote earlier this month resulted in a record number of Indigenous, Black and Trans women being elected to the National Congress.\n\n\"For the first time in the country's history, we managed to elect people from groups that, a few years ago, would have been unimaginable to elect,\" Ribeiro tells CNN. \"I look at the context from this perspective of hope ... [there are] people who we know will be in power fighting for us and making a mandate of the people.\"", "authors": ["Mariana Fagundes", "For Cnn"], "publish_date": "2022/10/27"}]}

The Visual Artists Rights Act of 1990 granted artists some rights, but they are still being tested in the courts.\n\nMore:Detroit's whale mural returns to Broderick Tower after storm damages ad that covered it\n\nRepresentatives for Broderick Tower, with its neoclassical architecture, told the Free Press on Wednesday it rents apartments, offices and space for advertisements to another company. It notes on its website it \"first pierced the skyline of Detroit in 1928 at Grand Circus,\" and is at \"the epicenter of Agustus Woodward’s hub and spoke street plan.\"\n\nLast year, Wyland sought to take the issue to the Michigan Supreme Court. The mural, which depicts swimming whales, is public art, but also reminds Detroiters that, despite being miles and miles away from the ocean, it is still connected to the sea and has a role in protecting whales.\n\nWyland, a Michigan native and conservationist, has painted life-size whale murals worldwide. His interest in whales began as a teen and he has a gallery that sells licensed merchandise. His work has been featured on license plates, United Nations stamps and a cruise ship.\n\nWyland painted the 20-story mural on the back of the 34-story Broderick Tower, making it highly visible in Comerica Park by Detroit Tigers fans and TV cameras broadcasting games. Since 2006, the Wyland mural has been covered by various ads, leading to a public outcry.\n\nWyland filed a brief with the high court last year arguing that covering it was a violation of federal law, and told WDIV-TV (Channel 4) that he was disappointed Rocket Mortgage would consider \"destroying the integrity of a work of art that is loved by so many.\"\n\nAnother issue he raised, WXYZ reported, was historic preservation tax credits.\n\nIn August, Wyland issued a statement to the Free Press through Steve Creech, president of the Wyland Foundation, calling the storm damage to the ad ironic.\n\nHe added: \"After years of contention, soda ads, car ads, appeals to the state supreme court, and Rocket Mortgage completely disregarding any communication with us to find another building for their ad instead of covering up a legacy work of public art, it finally took Mother Nature to step in and say, 'Let me handle this.' \"\n\nStill, perhaps, for those who now know the story behind the whale mural and the advertising, the new ad also offers a new, unintended message: If there isn't more of an effort to protect them, the world's whales, like those on the mural, can be blotted out.\n\nContact Frank Witsil: 313-222-5022 or fwitsil@freepress.com.

It's a guided tour — an exploration of the variety of artists and styles on display, an accounting of the strengths (and sometimes weaknesses) of some of the most notable works in town and the context in which to better understand the work.\n\nMost of the art included was done with permission, but some pieces were not. Most works are fully realized murals, but some especially artful traditional graffiti writing — with its sine qua non of stylized letters and signatures — is also included.\n\nStreet art is bringing an inspired jolt of creativity, urban life, aesthetic beauty, civic and ethnic identity and neighborhood revitalization to Detroit. The art functions as both metaphor and manifestation: It promises a better future while creating a more rewarding city in the present.\n\nGraffiti writers have long treated the decaying ruins of Detroit like a blank canvas. But in the last four or five years, a loose coalition of artists, enthusiasts, grassroots organizations, galleries and sympathetic businesses have emerged to champion the positive impact of authorized street art.\n\nOf course, distinctions between graffiti and murals, authorized and unauthorized work and art and vandalism — particularly in the context of the tens of thousands of abandoned buildings in Detroit — remain slippery. But those topics are for another day. This package is about celebrating the art and encouraging you to hit the streets to see for yourself.\n\nThe Atlanta-based Hense (Alex Brewer) combines his graffiti roots with formal training in contemporary art to create large-scale, disorienting abstractions. What's best about this 2014 piece is the way the clash of hot colors, zigzagging patterns and jumble of geometric and biomorphic shapes nearly collapses into chaos — but doesn't.\n\nWhat unites it all are the jazzy rhythms and subtle rhymes of color and shape — like the opposing red and pink protractor curves in the center and the various shades of blues across the picture. The best vantage point is the island in the middle of Broadway.\n\nCoda: Like many street artists, Hense paints under a pseudonym, a convention rooted in the anonymity sought by graffiti writers and the alter-ego performance aspect of the genre akin to hip-hop.Madison Building, 1555 Broadway\n\nTerrific draftsmanship, moody color and sly repetition inform this work by the young Barcelona, Spain-based Aryz (pronounced Arr-ease), who displays a depth of expression unusual for street art. The shadow of Diego Rivera's \"Detroit Industry\" murals seems to hover in the noble humanity that Aryz brings to his four identical working-class figures. 25 E. Grand River at Library\n\nThe Spanish-born twin brothers Raoul and Davide Perre, the New York-based graffiti team better known as How & Nosm, contributed this dazzling and gargantuan mural that leads you hundreds of feet up the ramp at the Grand River entrance to the Z garage — the 10-story downtown garage boasting more than 20 murals. It's a virtuoso work, with the pair's striking command of spray-paint techniques and surreal imagery — severed fish, human heads, faces, body parts and so much more — rendered in swirling red, pink, black and white.\n\nThe tremendous energy of it all — and the way the building blocks coalesce into a giant machine-like structure — recall the assembly line of Diego Rivera's murals at the Detroit Institute of Arts. The Joe Louis-like fist at the top of the ramp underscores the title, \"Unexpected Punchline.\" Z garage, Grand River at Library\n\nMcGee, the dean of Detroit's visual arts scene and an especially important African-American artist, was commissioned by New Detroit to create this untitled abstraction in 1974. The work is badly faded but worth seeing as a reminder that outdoor murals, particularly geometric abstractions, have a long history in Detroit. Public art programs in the '70s also gave us murals by John Egner (Park Shelton Apartments), Steve Foust (1314 Gratiot), as well as pieces by Al Loving (First National Building) and others that were eventually painted over.\n\nAcross the street from the Crowne Plaza Detroit, McGee's diamond patterns once danced in vibrant reds, purples, greens, blues and mustards. The city or a nonprofit should work with the (abandoned) building's owner to restore the mural — consulting, to the degree possible, with McGee, who is 90 but not in good health. 234 W. Larned\n\nThe Chicago-based artist known as Pose (Jordan Nickel) has managed the neat trick of creating an immersive art environment within the already immersive art environment of the Belt — the art-filled concourse running through the downtown Z garage. He's painted a huge swath of the wall, including gutters, and added a fake doorway, steps, windows, trash cans, wooden fence, etc. At one point the paint leaps off the wall into the viewer's space, covering a bench and steps.\n\nThe bold patterns and colors include pop art quotes (a Roy Lichtenstein woman's face in close-up and one of the painter's expressionist brush stroke parodies). Mostly, Pose succeeds in creating a clever wonderland where a real and imagined city alley merge into one. The Belt, middle of Z garage, between Grand River and Gratiot\n\nRemarkably well-preserved, this 1973 circular abstraction was commissioned by the late art collector James Pearson Duffy, who championed Detroit's Cass Corridor artists in the late '60s and '70s, including Sestok. Though the Edward W. Duffy business (mechanical tubing and pipe) is no longer in the Duffy family, the mural remains on the warehouse in the Delray neighborhood in southwest Detroit.\n\nIt's a beaut. The thin, colored rings suggest the cross section of the trunk of an ancient redwood, and they play optical games with your eyes. The piece, painted in oils, sits exquisitely in the center of the stair-step shape of the wall, whose original gray color (not part of Sestok's mural) has been repainted a high-contrast brown that really makes the art pop. Edward W. Duffy building, 5840 W. Jefferson\n\nThough it's not an especially compelling mural in subject or form, Shepard Fairey's recently completed piece on One Campus Martius bears inclusion here. First, it's massive. At 184 feet tall it's the largest mural that the celebrity street artist, based in Los Angeles, has created. Second, Fairey's subsequent arrest by Detroit police on felony charges for allegedly doing unauthorized work while working on his sanctioned mural has made worldwide headlines. It also sparked a local debate over the relationship of street art to graffiti and vandalism and the role public art has in revitalizing the city. (Fairey is due back in court Thursday.)\n\nThe One Campus Martius mural, commissioned by real estate mogul Dan Gilbert and others, rises in a tower of stenciled red, cream and black geometry and is adorned with some of Fairey's familiar images: an Andre the Giant face, a five-pointed star, wavy curves of lotus leaves, a peace sign and the scales of justice. Nothing connects specifically to Detroit or holds much surprise, but the colors wear well. The mural looks best as you approach downtown from the northeast on Gratiot — a beacon of the downtown core. One Campus Martius\n\nThe Detroit graffiti writer known as Kosek created this 40-foot virtuoso example of wildstyle — stylized, interlocking text so abstract that reading the letters is impossible. Just enjoy the dynamism of the ride, the way the orange paint jitterbugs across the wall, how the blue creates 3-D depth and the bursts of purple that tease the eyes. Don't miss the fish head hiding on the right side of the work.\n\nCoda: The X-MEN tag at the top right is a shout-out by the artist to other members of the crew of graffiti writers with whom he's associated. Legends Wall, Newark at St. Anne\n\nThe brilliant orange, purple and aquamarine palette sets the tone for this immediately appealing untitled work by the Mexico City artist called Saner (Edgar Flores). Saner's street art, like his work for galleries, trades in Mexican cultural iconography like the animal and demon masks here that connect contemporary figures with their ancient ancestors and the spiritual world. Given his grotesque face, the central chief-like figure might be a stand-in for a politician today — watch your wallet. BeeBe's 2 market, 1421 Springwells\n\nThe East Coast-based Marka27 (Victor Quinonez) was born in Mexico, raised in Dallas and attended art school in Boston. His mural on the side of El Asador restaurant uses the extreme contrast of a black background, rainbow stripes and a haloed portrait to pack an especially dramatic punch. The billowy shawl draped around the neck shows real painterly skill. El Asador Steakhouse, 1312 Springwells\n\nThis fantastically decorated garage in the heart of a residential street in southwest Detroit represents a collaboration of two young Detroit artists drawing on Mexican culture (the skull representing not death, but a life well-lived) and classic wildstyle graffiti letters.\n\nThe garage is part of the Alley Project, a remarkable graffiti-based art program under the umbrella of the neighborhood youth development agency Young Nation. The project includes an empty lot where kids can learn to paint, an alley filled with murals by pros and kids, and nearby satellites like the Mungar-Diaz garage. Here's what art-based community building looks like at a granular level. Avis at Elsmere (near 8868 Elsmere)\n\nOne of the most prolific Detroit-based street artists, Malt's work can be seen all over the city. He blends aerosol techniques and acrylics, and he's especially known for crafting fantastic birds, including owls, and other creatures. His owl at the Lincoln Street Art Park isn't his most elaborate composition, but there's something irresistibly humorous about its truculent expression and know-it-all vibe. Lincoln Street Art Park, 5926 Lincoln\n\nThe respected veteran Detroit street artist known as Fel3000ft, who started as a kid doing illegal tagging but no longer works without permission, made this deeply personal and ambitious work as a tribute to his late father. Stretching a long way through the underpass, the painting tells the story of a boy (the artist) who has written a letter to his departed father. We see the text in the center of the mural – \"I am trying to be the man you want me to be. I really miss you. …\" And we see the boy launching a paper airplane (the letter) and follow it as it soars through the city landscape. Fel will tell you the boy is hoping the letter reaches his father in heaven. Deftly painted and plotted, the work reveals a heartfelt sentiment rarely encountered in graffiti culture, and the result is an unusually touching piece of street art. Lincoln Street Art Park, underpass, past Fisher tunnel, 5926 Lincoln\n\nControversy surrounds this mural and its Detroit artist, Sintex (Brian Glass). A piece by Sintex originally held this spot as part of the Grand River Creative Corridor mural project. But in 2014, the head of the project, Derek Weaver, invited the noted Baltimore artist Gaia to repaint the wall as part of the planned rotation of murals along Grand River. In a guerrilla act, Sintex then painted over Gaia's new piece.\n\nThat launched an ugly volley of vandalism within the city's graffiti scene and competing claims of who gave whom permission to do what. But beneath the schoolyard bullying and name-calling, there were more serious issues at stake, among them the values and opportunities given to national artists compared to locals in Detroit's evolving graffiti scene, and questions of authenticity and gentrification.\n\nLeaving aside the ethics and efficacy of his actions, Sintex's portraits in \"Our Land Til Death\" link racial and ethnically charged heroes, symbols of resistance and victims — Chief Crazy Horse, Elijah Muhammad, Malice Green, Aiyana Jones and Vincent Chin — to make a point of standing your ground. Parking lot at 4731 Grand River\n\nThe world of graffiti and street art is largely dominated by men and is a haven for machismo, but there are a number of Detroit women in the game, including Desiree Kelly. Her \"Abe in Shades\" is a delight. But the humor of President Abraham Lincoln in kaleidoscopic sunglasses (and accompanied by the words \"Four Score\") is matched by a savvy composition in which the top of the building crops the head dramatically. 4239 Grand River\n\nThese 16 large portraits filling the windows of an abandoned building co-opt one of the most dispiriting cliches of Detroit's decay — busted-out windows. Macdonald literally uses art and a power-to-the-people take on local history to transform the urban landscape. The well-executed paintings include a range of homegrown political and cultural leaders and activists, among them Rosa Parks, John Conyers, Walter Reuther, Maryann Mahaffey, Helen Thomas and Grace Lee Boggs. The fact that unauthorized pieces of graffiti remain near ground level adds a raw edge, not letting you forget the neighborhood context. 5729 W. Grand River\n\nThe Charleston, S.C.-based artist called Patch Whisky (Rich Miller) specializes in cartoonish monsters rendered in Day-Glo colors. His Grand River Creative Corridor work walks an engaging tightrope between exuberant fantasy and flat-out weirdness. A giant purple-faced fish spews green slime out of one eye. A moon-faced, green creature with a blue tongue throws up Pepto-Bismol colored liquid. The closer you look, the more bizarre the show. Approx. 4120 Grand River, between Rosa Parks and Warren\n\nWhat's best about this imposing painting of a ferocious shark is the way it lunges at an angle across the entire side of Kap's Wholesale Foods as if it were rising out of the sea to terrorize Eastern Market. Created by the well-known Los Angeles artist Shark Toof (natch), the open-mouth imagery evokes memories of the Hollywood poster for \"Jaws,\" including the red-and-blue palette. But not even Spielberg's Great White had teeth as sharp as this. 2630 Riopelle\n\nTwo highly admired veterans of the graffiti scenes from opposite coasts teamed up for this Eastern Market piece in 2012 — the Los Angeles-based Revok (who had taken up residence in Detroit for a couple of years, after going to jail for graffiti crimes in L.A.) and the New Yorker called Rime (Joseph Tierney). \"A Man's Threat & a Woman's Pet\" blends Revok's authoritative and flexible command of lettering with Rime's humorous cartoon imagery. It's an especially fun, colorful piece, the artists creating a more organic composition and unified feeling than in most street art collaborations. 1501 Division\n\nThe New Zealand-based Askew One reflects the rapidly expanding Middle Eastern population in Hamtramck in this abstract mash-up of the American and Yemeni flags and their combined red, white, blue and black stripes and white stars. On a nakedly exposed south wall abutting an empty lot on a slightly gritty stretch of Jos Campau, the piece offers a fresh, evocative take on the American melting pot in an area where nearly a quarter of the population is now of Arab descent, most from Yemen. 88600 Jos Campau, Hamtramck\n\nThe haunting power of Chilean muralist Dasic Fernández's 80-foot-wide painting comes not only from its Yemeni cultural references, but the deep expression the artist brings to each of the three figures in the triptych-like composition. From left to right there's a yellow-turbaned farmer, a girl with her head covered save for her yearning eyes and a woman in a hijab who peers across street and into the future. It all reads as a metaphor for drawing strength from cultural roots, the promise of immigration and a better, freer future in America. Sheeba restaurant, 8752 Jos Campau, Hamtramck\n\nDetroiter Kobie Solomon's ginormous painting on the west wall of the main Russell Industrial Center's building No. Two is billed as the largest mural in Michigan at 8,750 square feet. Visible from I-75, the work is Solomon's clever take on the composite animal of Greek mythology, rendered here as a combination of elements of the logos from the four professional sports teams in Detroit, as well as images representing the city's industrial might and creative soul — the lion's mane is made of paint brushes, pencils and the like. Russell Industrial Center, 1600 Clay\n\nMaybe Detroit's most drop-dead gorgeous mural, Katie Craig's breathtaking waterfall of color against a sky-blue ground tumbles down story after story of a large building at the corner of East Grand Boulevard and Beaubien. Craig, in her late 20s when the mural was dedicated in 2011, connects the dots between graffiti art and the modernist tradition of color field painters like Morris Louis, Helen Frankenthaler and Jules Olitski. It's all about visual pleasure. Craig, a graduate of the College for Creative Studies who later studied at Cranbrook, earned the commission through a CCS program that links communities with public arts projects and funding support. 2937 E. Grand Boulevard\n\nStill under construction, the northern end of the Dequindre Cut remains a beneath-street-level forest of unauthorized graffiti, ranging from wildstyle tagging to profane doodles and slogans. But this piece by an artist who goes by the name of Feis will stop you cold: A shadowy figure, hiding amid the artist's signature lettering, wears a blue hooded sweatshirt and points a giant handgun right at you. Drawing meaning and intensity from its location, the piece remains a disturbing reminder of the city's dangerous past and, for too many, its present reality. Dequindre Cut Greenway, St. Aubin and Gratiot\n\nThe husband-wife partnership of Steve and Dorata Coy is better known as Hygienic Dress League, a collective whose often monochromatic palette and favorite imagery (such as people wearing gas masks ) make its work around town instantly recognizable. The collective's two murals in the Dequindre Cut face each other on a stretch of the path at the southern end closer to the riverfront.\n\nOne mural features a gas-masked figure holding a bird; the other includes five standing figures of uncertain costume and headgear. The earth tones of the walls blend into the natural setting. What does it all mean mean? I don't know for sure, except there's surely an undercurrent of environmentalism at play. I'm more interested in the way the murals give off the uneasy vibe of ritual, making me feel like the subject of an experiment in which I didn't agree to participate. Dequindre Cut Greenway, St. Aubin & Atwater\n\nDating back to 1985, this badly damaged mural covers the side of an decaying abandoned building that once housed a drug rehabilitation center. Created by Detroit artist Curtis Lewis, the piece illustrates African-American political and cultural leaders, among them Malcolm X, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Marcus Garvey, Frederick Douglass, Mary McLeod Bethune, Muhammad Ali, Stevie Wonder and many others. It was in its day a monument to black pride, but now, like so much of the surrounding neighborhood, speaks to failed dreams, the impact of institutional racism and the tragedy of modern Detroit. 9980 Gratiot\n\nAt the end of the so-called Legends Wall along Newark (behind the Michigan Central Station), the young Detroiter known as HelloMelo contributed this snazzy piece showing a piano player leaning against the artist's signature. The musical theme is pure Detroit and the curvy keyboard may be winking at the famous bar at Baker's Keyboard Lounge as the keys fly into the abyss. Legends Wall, Newark, between Vernor and 20th\n\nPresumably painted by the same Astro whose tag can be found all over the city, this unauthorized work, signed \"Astro Boy 94,\" has a beguiling, apparition-like quality. At least to my eye it suggests an abstract car moving swiftly to the viewer's left. Arrow Chemical Products, 2055 St. Anne, at Newark\n\nI'm not at all sure what exactly the Mexico City-based Benitez is getting at in this imaginative, enigmatic piece, whose beautifully painted, gently stylized figures and symbols evoke some kind of cultural narrative and memory piece. But what are those two doodle-like heads doing on the left, including the science-fiction figure at the top? This is a work that stays in the mind long after you see it. Cultural Garage, 3439 Livernois\n\nNot yet 30, the Montreal-based Mastrocola is another artist who has transitioned from the graffiti world to more formal mural work and traditional painting on canvas in an abstract language. Of his two 2014 works in the Grand River Creative Corridor, this is the more impressive — soothing curvilinear shapes, rolling waves of color that let you relax in a sea or urban grit. The piece also makes an interesting contrast with the similarly colored, but much less elegant mural on the building next door by the Detroit artist Elmer. 15th and Forest\n\nOf the five murals the Dusselfdorf-based German-Austrian collective known as the Weird completed two years ago in Eastern Market, my favorite is this piece in the heart of the market. The cartoon figures are fun if a little dopey, but the piece makes its mark by the sly way it snakes around the south and east facades of Motor City Produce and the pleasing purple-and-teal palette. 2611 Russell S.\n\nObsessive mark-making defines San Fransico-based Victor Reyes' mesmerizing black-and-white abstraction that tumbles across a large exposed wall in Hamtramck. Up close the piece reveals tight curves and angles crushed together, but from a distance the patterns coalesce into a monolith that the artist smartly allows to breathe with the negative black space in the bottom left and top right. 2238 Holbrook, Hamtramck\n\nAt more than 6,000 square feet, this optimistic mural by the Australian-born artist Meggs (David Hooke) casts a large shadow over a barren stretch a little south of the Russell Industrial Center. I find the tiger image and the words \"Rise Up\" a little cheesy, but Detroit can use all the cheerleading it can get, and it's hard not to be impressed by the size and execution of the mural; the fact that Los Angeles-based Meggs didn't paint over the unauthorized graffiti at the bottom of the piece is a welcome gesture of respect for local graffiti artists. Don't miss the many other unauthorized and authorized pieces elsewhere on the industrial structure, particularly the large collaborative work on the north facade. 6398 Russell St. at Trombly\n\nSometimes the biggest delights come in the smallest packages. Trumping the numerous large murals on a tiny stretch of Winder Street in Eastern Market is this modest-sized collaboration by Detroiter Glenn Barr and the Czech-born, Fla.-based artist called Bask (Ales Hostomsky). Barr's young boy finds himself chained to Bask's shadowy demon, a metaphor perhaps for the dangers of the streets. The boy's defiant stance suggests he'll make it. Red Bull House of Art, 1551 Winder\n\nNarcissism and an outlaw mentality run deep in the DNA of graffiti culture. After all, signing your name to a building illegally under the cover of darkness is a pretty strong look-at-me gesture. But when does traditional graffiti tagging turn into art? This authorized piece by the New York-based artist Wen One seems to capture the moment of transformation. The flurry of purple wildstyle calligraphy morphs into three-dimensional abstraction. Letters, arrows and high-keyed color explode with energy and abandon. It's perfectly suited to the side of Ponyride, an incubator for creative entrepreneurs and artists. Ponyride, 1401 Vermont\n\nThe 10 floors of the downtown Z garage and the alley (Belt) that runs between its two wings offers a concentration of nearly 40 murals by some of the biggest names in the world of graffiti and street art, as well as some of Detroit's leading figures. The project represents a collaboration of developer and Quicken Loans founding chairman Dan Gilbert, who commissioned the artists through his Bedrock Real Estate Services, and the Library Street Collective, a gallery that selected the artists and curates the spaces. (The gallery, which backs up to the Belt, has partnered with Bedrock to bring other public murals downtown.)\n\nThe Z garage is located at 1234 Library Street. Enter the garage from Gratiot or Grand River; the alley runs between those streets.\n\nBest known for its farmers market that draws tens of thousands on peak Saturdays and a growing restaurant and retail trade, Eastern Market is also home to dozens of large-scale authorized murals — and a plethora of unauthorized graffiti. Since 2011 the publisher 1xRun, which operates the Inner State Gallery, has worked with Eastern Market Corp. and building owners to make the market a vibrant center of street art.\n\nComing attractions: \"Murals in the Market\" (Sept. 17-25), a festival boasting 45 artists from around the world and Detroit who will create dozens of new works.\n\nThe Cut, an idyllic recreational path that connects the riverfront to Eastern Market, runs for more than a mile between Gratiot and Woodbridge, just west of St. Aubin. The Detroit Riverfront Conservancy, which manages the Cut, has commissioned a dozen Detroit artists to do murals on the concrete bridge supports and walls along the way; but the conservancy has also left many more examples of illegal graffiti undisturbed, allowing a sense of urban grit to remain.\n\nSouthwest Detroit — notably Mexicantown and the thoroughfares of Vernor, Springwells, Bagley and Livernois — has become a haven for street art, especially works rooted in Mexican culture. Eastern Market's Inner State Gallery has connected artists with businesses and property owners; and various neighborhood initiatives like the Southwest Urban Arts Mural Project and the Alley Project champion street art as a means of community and youth development.\n\nOne of the most photogenic concentrations of graffiti in Detroit can be found on a stretch of Newark between 20th Street and Vernor, behind the Michigan Central Station. The adjacent Arrow Chemical Products company grew so weary of trying to police and clean the unauthorized tagging of the concrete wall along Newark that company officials contacted Derek Weaver, who heads the Grand River Creative Corridor, a street art initiative.\n\nWeaver obtained permission from the Canadian railroad company that owns the wall and organized a 2013 project in which the cream of local graffiti artists were invited to legally tag the wall. With more than 30 works, the spot, initially called \"Station Walls,\" is now better known by its informal name of the Legends Wall. Vandals and other taggers have stayed away out of respect. Moral of the story? If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.\n\nThanks to a number of grassroots efforts, among them the Detroit Beautification Project spearheaded a few years ago by Matt Eaton and others, Hamtramck has become a center for authorized murals, a number of which reflect the cultural heritage of the increasing number of Middle Eastern immigrants that have settled in the community. The Jos. Campau corridor is the place to start looking for murals, along with the back of Keyworth Stadium (off Roosevelt) for a collection of authorized graffiti.\n\nLaunched in 2012 by Derek Weaver, principal of 4731 Group, a real estate company, the Grand River Creative Corridor has brought more than 100 murals to mostly abandoned buildings along the corridor. It runs along Grand River, from roughly Rosa Parks to Warren, and the artists included are both international street art and graffiti stars, as well as Detroiters.\n\nOne of the hidden gems of Detroit, the outdoor Lincoln Street Art Park and Sculpture Garden was founded in 2011 by Matthew Naimi as an outgrowth of Recycle Here!, his next door operation started in 2005. Just to the southwest of the Fisher Building in the shadow of New Center, the park is a wonderland of murals, graffiti and found-object works responsible for activating a once-abandoned area.\n\nThere are authorized works on the Recycle Here! building and contiguous walls, but as you wander down Lincoln Street there's an explosion of unauthorized graffiti in an alley (dubbed Fisher Canyon for its killer views of the Fisher Building). An art and graffiti-covered underpass exists in a gray area of legality, ignored by city, county and railroad officials. 5926 Lincoln", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/08/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/06/06/future-of-downtown-cincinnati-enquirer-coverage/70270378007/", "title": "The Future of Downtown Cincinnati: Enquirer coverage", "text": "This year, The Enquirer is examining what the Future of Downtown Cincinnati might look like.

Email real estate reporters Sydney Franklin or Randy Tucker. Are you a downtown resident, worker or business owner? Fill out our questionnaire so we can get to know you better and learn what downtown topics you care about the most.\n\nHere's what we've covered so far:\n\nThe future of Downtown Cincinnati is being built now\n\nLong before the pandemic began, a new era of Downtown Cincinnati was emerging. Towering office buildings were being converted to apartments and the revival of Fountain Square by the Cincinnati Center City Development Corp. breathed new life into Downtown. But COVID-19 pummeled Downtown's office culture and now the city center is shifting from a job hub to a lifestyle center instead.The Enquirer's Future of Downtown series isn't just about the many changes coming to the physical city. It's also about encouraging you, our readers, to consider what you want the future of Downtown to be and what it will take to get there.\n\nDowntown Cincinnati: What the past tells us\n\nThrough the 235 years of the Cincinnati's history, the 1-square-mile urban core of Downtown has been the heart of the Queen City, according to Enquirer historian Jeff Suess. The architecture we see today was born between the 1870s and the early 20th century when structures like the Roebling Suspension Bridge, Central Trust Tower and Carew Tower were built. During that time, Downtown transformed from its former reputation as a working-class, immigrant community to an urban office park that attracted hill dwellers for shopping and entertainment. Suess argues that current development plans for Downtown seem to aimed at \"recapturing what made downtown Cincinnati special, the way folks remember it but updated for today's needs.\"\n\nDowntown Cincinnati shifting from job hub to lifestyle center in wake of COVID-19\n\nBusiness reporter Randy Tucker confirmed that downtown is evolving into a residential food-and-entertainment district. \"Think suburban 'lifestyle centers' that include apartments, shops, restaurants and recreation – but in historic buildings and without the surrounding acres of parking lots,\" he wrote. Numbers back this up. From 2010 to 2020, the number of people living Downtown grew by more than 20% to just over 5,800 residents, based on U.S. Census data compiled by The Enquirer in its Neighborhood Report Card. But hundreds of new residents have moved Downtown over the past two years alone to urban enclaves like Fourth and Race or City Club Apartments. Other office-to-condo conversions are popping up post-pandemic, suggesting Downtown's population is sure to grow even more over the next several years.\n\nThese are the developments shaping the future of Downtown Cincinnati\n\nSixteen developments are expected to usher in a new season of activity for Downtown Cincinnati. At the top of the list is the city and county's plan to renovate and expand the aging Duke Energy Convention Center on Elm Street, a $200 million undertaking that should bolster Cincinnati's chances for attracting national events and conventions. Also under construction are a handful of residential projects inside historic Downtown structures, several of which will boast well over one hundred units in each apartment complex. Learn more about each project here.\n\nMore: Terrace Plaza Hotel after 75 years75 years ago, Terrace Plaza Hotel was the talk of the town. Now it's a forgotten icon\n\nFrom the editor: Brent Spence Bridge isn't the only project we need to get right\n\nThe Enquirer's editor-in-chief Beryl Love wrote about the need for Cincinnati to make smart decisions when it comes to the development of not only Downtown, but one of the biggest infrastructure projects of our time: the Brent Spence Bridge corridor project. \"If the past is any indication – remember the debates over where to build what is now Great American Ball Park, and more recently, the controversy over parking lot space for Bengals tailgating at The Banks? – there will be no shortage of opinions on the best path forward,\" he said. \"We need to ensure future generations benefit from the decisions made today.\"\n\nMore: Queensgate, a downtown extensionWhat does Queensgate want to be? A 'canvas' awaits its destiny\n\nWhat concerns residents about visiting Downtown Cincinnati\n\nWe polled Cincinnati.com readers on their reasons for visiting Downtown and their reasons for staying away. Hundreds of responses revealed that crime, panhandlers and parking are what concern them most, while the top reason for coming to the central business district was to see special events like sports or concerts. Shopping wasn't a major attraction. Read more on what we learned from your responses here.\n\nWhat is it really like living and working in downtown Cincinnati?\n\nMany of us work or have spent time in downtown Cincinnati, but what is it really like to live there day-to-day? As part of The Enquirer's Future of Downtown project, two reporters, Emily DeLetter and Haadiza Ogwude, decided to show you.\n\nBoth took a day and filmed their experiences living, working and socializing Downtown: Emily's during a weekday and Haadiza's on a weekend.\n\nMore: Meet the dogs of DowntownMeet the dogs of Downtown Cincinnati. The city is their backyard\n\nHas Kroger's Downtown supermarket lived up to the hype?\n\nAfter a 50-year absence, Kroger opened its first new downtown Cincinnati supermarket as residents and economic development officials cheered, reported The Enquirer's Alexander Coolidge. But then six months later, the COVID-19 pandemic began. Longtime residents of Downtown and area business owners commented on whether or not the five-year-old urban location has been successful. No, it hasn't been able to count on a booming lunch-time crowd since work-from-home culture has shrunk the number of people working out of Downtown offices, but it's nice to have, people argue.\n\n\"The whole point was to get one,” said Rick Dieringer who has lived nearby on Court Street since 1980. Still, he has to visit the Kroger store in Newport for odd items that a smaller format store doesn’t always carry.\n\nTaylor Swift shows why Cincinnati and Hamilton County built The Banks\n\nThe Enquirer's Sharon Coolidge details why The Banks, which broke ground in 2008, was made for major events like Taylor Swift's series of concerts hosted at Paycor Stadium. Everything that's happened in Cincinnati over the last two decades, she argued, led Swfit to pick the city for her Eras stadium tour.\n\n\"You want to be able to take advantage of the opportunities that are presented around the country,\" said former Mayor Mark Mallory. \"We're building Cincinnati to the point that we can accommodate just about anything going on around the country. It puts us on more equal footing with other cosmopolitan cities.\"\n\nMore: That's So Cincinnati: RestaurantsJapp's in Over-the-Rhine reopens as part of 'entire Cincinnati renaissance'\n\nFrom Winston Churchill's favorite bathroom to a speakeasy: 6 downtown Cincinnati gems\n\nDowntown Cincinnati has a plethora of iconic staples that people visit frequently. Many locals can't even count the number of times they've ventured to Fountain Square or Great American Ball Park. But the neighborhood also has a rich history filled with hidden gems. So we decided to search for unique destinations Cincinnatians might not know exist, or have just simply forgotten about.\n\nFrom a suite where Winston Churchill himself once stayed to a fun little speakeasy, we visited several distinct locations throughout the area. Take a look for yourself here.\n\nCincinnati's convention center will close for 18 months, meaning major shifts for Downtown\n\nDowntown Cincinnati's Duke Energy Convention Center is getting a face-lift soon. But to do so, it will have to shut completely for 18 months starting in late June or early July 2024. City and county officials, along with officials from Cincinnati Center City Development Corp., or 3CDC, confirmed that a full shutdown is required to get the construction done as quickly as possible. 3CDC said the $200 million renovation and expansion of Cincinnati's longtime convention center will be completed in time for convention events booked for January 2026.\n\nWhile necessary, closing the convention center Downtown will have repercussions for the hospitality and entertainment industries, some of which are hard to predict. The production groups behind two annual staple events have already threatened to pull out for the next several years.\n\nMore: What does 3CDC build in Downtown?Cincinnati's 3CDC: What is it, what are its next projects\n\nIs downtown Cincinnati safe? Your questions answered\n\nWhenever we write about Downtown Cincinnati and its future, commenters always raise one topic: safety. So we talked to locals, interviewed the police and analyzed crime data to answer the frequent questions and comments we get from readers about living in and visiting Downtown.\n\nHere's what we found out: The likelihood that you'll be a victim of violent crime is very low and doesn't happen randomly to those who do experience it. Police data reveals that victims typically skew Black and male between the ages of 18 and 40. It's more likely that a visitor to Downtown will have their car broken into or stolen, but that's a city- and nationwide problem right now.\n\nThe good news? In Downtown Cincinnati, there are plenty of eyes on the street watching out for resident and visitor safety, from 3CDC's ambassadors to the police department. And the more people that move downtown over the next few years, the safer officials and locals estimate it will become.\n\nMeet the people that make up Downtown Cincinnati\n\nWhat makes someone want to live Downtown? Why choose a neighborhood where parking isn't free, greenspace is limited and privacy is harder to come by?\n\nWe asked Downtown locals − those who live or work in the central business district below Central Parkway. They told us they're attracted to Cincinnati's city center for a variety of reasons, chief among them being walkability, access to entertainment and the chance to really be part of a storied place. Check out this personal portrait essay by nearly all of The Enquirer's staff photographers, featuring 15 people who are invested in Downtown's future.\n\nMore: A Downtown arena?

Since its $5.5 million overhaul led by the Cincinnati City Center Development Corporation, or 3CDC, along with Kroger and Rookwood Properties, its sidewalks are wider, its historic storefronts are spiffed up and the upper floors of the buildings have been turned into new apartments and condominiums.\n\nOn the ground floors, Cincinnati mainstays like Avril-Bleh's butcher shop now mix with newer restaurants such as Mid-City along Court Street. Restaurateurs see the district as an attractive alternative to Over-the-Rhine and other parts of the city.\n\nHundreds more hotel rooms are coming to downtown Cincinnati. Here's why\n\nHundreds of more hotel rooms are coming to downtown Cincinnati in the form of boutique hotels − small-capacity spaces that offer more personalized services than big brands. These properties tend to attract more leisure travelers than corporate professionals, and in a post-pandemic market, that's a big deal. Across the region, boutique hotels are popping up at a record pace to accommodate this boost in casual travel. Over the next two years, 741 rooms will be added to the market. Just under half of those will be concentrated Downtown.\n\nMore: Impact of GE's exit from The BanksGE workers' exit from Downtown adds to office woes\n\n‘It reminded people what cities can be.’ The Contemporary Arts Center celebrates 20 years\n\nOpened 20 years ago, the Contemporary Arts Center remains as surprising as ever and even more important for Downtown’s future. The $34 million project (roughly $57 million in today’s dollars) was such a big deal for the city that The Enquirer dedicated eight pages of a Sunday spread in June 2003 to its opening with the headline, ”A Center With Impact.”\n\nOne reason for its impact was the timing, coming after the civil unrest of 2001 and the national attention it brought, added Brendon Cull, president and CEO of the Cincinnati USA Regional Chamber. ”At that time, there were still questions about what the future of the city was going to look like,” he said. ”Then enter Zaha Hadid and this building in the heart of downtown. For this community’s psyche, the center was a hugely important investment in 2003 because it reminded people what cities can be, places for creativity, art and culture.”\n\nMore: Homeless aren't a danger Downtown'They are fearing people.' Downtown's homeless, panhandlers not a safety threat\n\nFrom the editor: In a changing Downtown Cincinnati, what would you preserve at all costs?\n\nThe Enquirer's Executive Editor Beryl Love considers the impact of the Future of Downtown series and recaps the final event hosted by the paper, a special panel discussion held at the Contemporary Arts Center in December. Panelists included: Christy Samad, senior vice president of event management at Cincinnati Center City Development Corp.; Paula Boggs Muething, chief legal and administrative officer for FC Cincinnati, former Cincinnati City Manager; Tim Elsbrock, regional president of Fifth Third; Jackie Bryson, president of the Downtown Residents' Council; Ricardo Grant, founder of Paloozanoire, LoVe on Fourth, Gallery At Gumbo and Cinema OTR; and Morgan Rigaud, founder of Skate Downtown Cincy.\n\nA full recording of the panel can be found here.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2022/03/11/detroit-eyesores-redeveloped-others-not/9424307002/", "title": "Some of Detroit's eyesores are getting redeveloped, others not", "text": "They are the big old buildings that put Detroit on the map — and not in a good way.\n\nThese structures sat empty and deteriorating for years, oftentimes decades, and were widely interpreted as symbols of the city's dramatic decline. Their abandonment brought the wrong sort of attention to Detroit for city leaders desperate to reverse the outward flow of population and businesses.\n\nNow, a growing number of these old eyesores and \"dinosaur\" buildings are finally being acquired by private developers with realistic plans for renovating or repurposing them, and in some instances, to bulldoze them to build warehouses or distribution centers that could employ hundreds of people.\n\nThe recent interest is generally the result of two trends: demand for new housing in Detroit, and demand for new industrial warehouses and distribution centers in metro Detroit. One exception is Ford Motor Co.'s ongoing rehab of Michigan Central Station into office space (plus a hotel) for the automaker's new Detroit mobility and innovation hub.\n\n\"The high occupancy (rate) in the industrial sector is leading people to get creative to get the needed space,\" said Andy Gutman, president of Southfield-based real estate firm Farbman Group. \"On the residential side, there is a high demand, especially in Detroit, and there’s cachet to the city and people want to be there.”\n\nMany of these projects are only financially feasible with assistance from government tax breaks and other development incentives. That is because of the expensive construction work involved in rehabbing long-neglected and sometimes contaminated buildings, plus the lower leasing rates and investment returns for Detroit real estate compared with larger markets such as Chicago.\n\nDetroit Mayor Mike Duggan has made cleaning up and repurposing these forlorn properties a priority of his third term in office, and the topic was a focus Wednesday night in his annual State of the City address.\n\n\"There are about a dozen sites in this city that have just devastated Detroit's reputation internationally for blight,\" the mayor said earlier in the week when announcing the planned $134 million redevelopment of the old Fisher Body Plant No. 21 into hundreds of apartments. \"The Fisher Body Plant ... is one that shows up in every national gallery of the ruins of Detroit.\"\n\nMore:Out-of-state developer on the prowl for metro Detroit's big eyesores\n\nMore:Midtown Detroit shopkeeper is closing his former 'bachelor pad' store\n\nBelow are some of the eyesores and \"dinosaur\" buildings that sat vacant and decaying for years, and are now undergoing or set to undergo a dramatic transformation with redevelopment.\n\nThe list includes some empty Detroit buildings that were not major urban ruins on the level of Michigan Central Station or the Packard Plant, yet were identified in past Free Press stories as dilapidated high-rises in need of saviors.\n\nA second list identifies prominent buildings and sites in the city that are still vacant and awaiting occupants or development. Several of them are not yet in disrepair and appear in decent condition, such as the former Detroit Police headquarters at 1300 Beaubien.\n\nFormer 'dinosaurs' and eyesores\n\nLee Plaza\n\nThis 16-story building, 2240 W. Grand Blvd., dates to 1927 and was originally a luxury residential hotel. It last operated as public housing for seniors before city housing officials closed it in 1997 for financial reasons.\n\nIn January, the Duggan administration announced it will be restored as roughly 177 units of mixed-income housing, including affordable apartments for seniors, through a joint development by Detroit-based Roxbury Group and Ethos Development Partners.\n\nOld State Fairgrounds\n\nIn 2009, the Michigan State Fair left the old State Fairgrounds on 8 Mile in Detroit. There were a number of early visions, yet few workable plans, for redeveloping the 158-acre site and its collection of old buildings.\n\nToday, the site is home to a nearly completed 4-million-square-foot Amazon fulfillment center. The center is expected to create 1,200 new, full-time jobs once it opens later this year — Amazon won't say precisely when.\n\nIn addition, early construction work is underway for a new transit center within the to-be-rehabbed Dairy Cattle Building that will replace a nearby bus hub on Woodward Avenue.\n\n\"Now instead of waiting outside in the rain and the cold, they're going to be indoors in a beautiful center,\" Duggan said.\n\nAs part of the project, the fairgrounds coliseum is being razed, although a part of its façade will be preserved. And the bandshell will be moved to Palmer Park.\n\nBook Tower and Building\n\nProminent in the downtown skyline, the 38-story Book Tower and its adjacent and shorter Book Building, 1916 Washington Blvd., were besmirched in grime and had sat mostly empty for years until their purchase in 2015 by Dan Gilbert's Bedrock real estate firm.\n\nBedrock is now in the final stages of a long and extensive $313 million renovation, and plans to reopen the buildings later this year as a mix of hotel, residential, retail and office space.\n\nTwo Ilitch-owned buildings\n\nThe Ilitch family organization has been rehabbing two long-vacant downtown buildings that it owns: the Women's City Club and the United Artists Theater Building.\n\nThe six-story Women's City Club, 2110 Park Ave., dates to 1924, has a Pewabic tile indoor swimming pool and is on the National Register of Historic Places. Olympia Development recently received a temporary certificate of occupancy, and a flexible office and co-working space brand called Spaces is now fitting out the building in prepation for opening.\n\nThe 18-story United Artists Theater Building, 150 Bagley St., dates to 1928 and is an office building attached to the old United Artists movie theater. The office building has been largely vacant since the mid-1970s and owned since 1997 by the Ilitch organization.\n\nThe Ilitch organization has partnered with a minority-owned enterprise, Bagley Development Group, to redevelop the building as 148 market-rate and affordable apartments to be called Residences@150 Bagley, expected to be done in late 2023 or early 2024. The defunct theater is to be razed to create parking for the future residents.\n\nAMC Headquarters\n\nThe old and massive American Motors Corp. headquarters, 14250 Plymouth Road, was last used by Chrysler and has been vacant since 2010. The structure dates to 1927 and once sprawled 1.4 million square feet before a back section was torn down.\n\nLast month, Detroit City Council approved a redevelopment deal in which Missouri-based NorthPoint Development will demolish the entire structure, including a unique Art Deco tower, and construct a 728,000-square-foot building for a to-be-determined auto parts supplier that could potentially bring hundreds of jobs to the neighborhood.\n\nDemolition could begin late this year, and the new structure could be ready in late 2023 or early 2024.\n\nCadillac Stamping plant\n\nNorthPoint also is redeveloping the site of the former Cadillac Stamping plant, 9501 Conner St.., which had been mostly vacant since the 1980s. The stamping plant was demolished last year and construction is underway on a new 684,000-square-foot manufacturing center to house auto supplier Lear Corp. and employ 450 people.\n\nFisher Body Plant No. 21\n\nThe old Fisher Body Plant, 6051 Hastings St., opened in 1919 and was later used by General Motors until 1984. It then housed a succession of industrial paint companies until 1993, when the six-story building was abandoned.\n\nThis week, city officials joined with developers Gregory Jackson and Richard Hosey and announced plans to remediate and redevelop the old factory into 433 residential apartments, plus retail and co-working spaces. Pending the necessary approvals, construction could begin next year and finish in 2025.\n\nMichigan Central Station\n\nThe most well-known Detroit building under renovation, Michigan Central Station, opened in 1913, closed in 1988 when the last train pulled out, and then devolved into what many outside observers considered a graffiti-covered symbol of Detroit's decline.\n\nOwnership passed to a Downriver real estate investor, who dreamed of putting a casino and upscale restaurants in there, and later in 1995 to the Moroun family, which owns the Ambassador Bridge.\n\nThe abandoned depot was attracting urban explorers from around the world by the late 2000s when Detroit City Council passed a resolution requesting its demolition. But that effort was stymied, including by restrictions on using federal stimulus money to raze a structure on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nFord made international headlines in 2018 when it bought the train station and some nearby properties, including a disused school book depository. The automaker is now busy renovating the depot to be the centerpiece of its future Detroit mobility and innovation district.\n\nThe renovations are to finish in 2023, and Ford plans to bring 5,000 workers to the district, of which 2,500 will be Ford employees.\n\nCurrent eyesores and 'dinosaurs'\n\nPackard Plant\n\nWhat remains of the old Packard Plant on the city's east side was by now supposed to be newly opened offices and cultural space. However, Peru-based developer Fernando Palazuelo was unable to build the ambitious project that he started in 2017, and since the COVID-19 pandemic, he has instead tried to entice industrial buyers such as NorthPoint to the site.\n\nThe city of Detroit is in court trying to take possession of the property.\n\nSouthwest Detroit Hospital\n\nThe old Southwest Detroit Hospital, 2401 20th St., near the edge of Corktown, is a 1970s structure that was once clad in stainless steel and has been empty since 2007.\n\nIn what was a surprise to many, four years ago a \"coming soon 2020\" sign for a \"mixed-use development\" appeared on the property.\n\nToday, the hospital building is still abandoned and the \"coming soon\" sign is getting raggedy. (The \"2020\" has since been whited out.) There also was a giant break in the property's security fence visible this week.\n\nDetroit businessman Harley Brown, a member of the property's ownership group, told the Free Press this week that there are no plans to publicly discuss. The ownership group is said to include prominent landlord Dennis Kefallinos.\n\nBrewster Wheeler Recreation Center\n\nThe old Brewster Wheeler Recreation Center dates to 1929 and is where boxer Joe Louis once trained and generations of Black Detroiters learned to swim. It is adjacent to the demolished Brewster-Douglass public housing projects and has been vacant since the early 2000s.\n\nThe rec center was slated for demolition in 2014, but the Duggan administration said it could be saved if the right developers came forward.\n\nA group that included KC Crain, president and CEO of Detroit-based media company Crain Communications, ultimately stepped up. Their plan, announced in spring 2015, was to redevelop the two-story building as events space and a restaurant with a rooftop beer garden. Nearly seven years later, construction has yet to begin and the building remains empty.\n\n“With COVID-19, it obviously didn’t make sense to move forward with the restaurant idea we’d set out,” Crain said Thursday in a statement. “The pandemic affected our plans, as it did for many others. We will have news to share soon.”\n\nExecutive Plaza Building\n\nThe former Executive Plaza Building, 1200 Sixth St., is a complex of two towers at the periphery of downtown that has been vacant since the early 2000s, when its state office tenants moved to Cadillac Place in New Center.\n\nIt is now owned by Danou Enterprises and available for lease or purchase.\n\n“It is one of the biggest vacancies that we have,\" said Levi Smith, a real estate broker with P.A. Commercial. \"It's a great building in the fact it has 1,200 parking spaces and it's halfway between the (central business district) and the new Ford mobility and the train station.\"\n\nOld Wayne County Building\n\nThe ornate Wayne County Building, 600 Randolph St. in downtown, dates to 1902 and has been empty since 2009, when county government moved to the Guardian Building. The county sold the building in 2014 to a group of private and unnamed New York investors, who four years later announced they had spent nearly $7 million renovating the structure and were seeking a tenant to move in.\n\nIt still sits empty.\n\nA representative for the CBRE office in Southfield said this week that the firm is no longer marketing the building. A past spokesman for the New York group didn't return a message seeking comment.\n\nAborted Wayne County jail site\n\nTwice in the 2010s, a slice of land along Gratiot entering downtown at 1400 Saint Antoine St. was heralded as the future site of big projects. But each time those projects were later relocated, and today the land remains undeveloped.\n\nThe first, a new Wayne County jail, was halted during construction in 2013 amid cost overruns; its ruins stood unfinished at the site for years. Gilbert's Bedrock firm later took possession of the land in exchange for building the county a new jail and justice complex at Interstate 75 and Warren.\n\nThe second project, announced in fall 2019, was a collaboration between Bedrock and real estate mogul Stephen Ross for the University of Michigan, called the Detroit Center for Innovation.\n\nHowever, Gilbert and Ross last year canceled their collab, and Ross went on to partner with the Ilitch organization to build the Detroit Center for Innovation on land west of Fox Theatre that is currently a parking lot.\n\nBedrock has said it still intends to build something on the Gratiot site, although no formal plans have been announced.\n\nBedrock did not respond to a message for comment.\n\n1300 Beaubien\n\nDesigned by architect Albert Kahn and known simply by its address — 1300 Beaubien — the former Detroit Police Department headquarters has been empty since 2013, when the department moved into new headquarters on 3rd Avenue near MGM Grand Detroit casino.\n\nBedrock purchased the old DPD building in 2018, and the following year announced plans to make it a boutique hotel and conference center. However, because those plans appeared tied to the Detroit Center for Innovation being built nearby on the failed jail site, their current status is a question mark.\n\nContactJC Reindl: 313-222-6631 or jcreindl@freepress.com.

Genetic material from infected mosquitoes will be sent to Yale University, according to a statement from South Alabama. Workers at Yale’s public health school will sequence DNA to help understand how the virus and spread over the past two decades in the United States. “They are looking at how the virus has evolved over time by sequencing genomes,” says Jonathan Rayner, who works in infectious diseases at the South Alabama medical school, which says it is the first school in the state to join in the project. West Nile virus killed nearly 170 people nationwide last year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 2,647 cases of West Nile virus were reported last year, 550 more cases than in 2017.\n\nAlaska\n\nSoldotna: Project Homeless Connect 2020 has just about everything it needs to be a success, but it’s missing volunteers. The annual event provides a one-stop shop for those experiencing or at risk of homelessness. During the event, community members can come in for a free meal, blankets, clothes, diapers, shower and laundry vouchers, haircuts and a number of other services all provided at no cost. Similar events occur in other parts of Alaska, including Anchorage and Juneau, and this year events will be taking place in Homer and Seward to cover the entire peninsula. Project Homeless Connect will take place Jan. 29 from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the Soldotna Regional Sports Complex. Those who wish to volunteer can contact Stuart at 907-283-3125.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A lawmaker has proposed ending the state’s practice of hiring private companies to provide health care for its 34,000 prison inmates and instead turning that duty back to the state. Democratic Rep. Diego Rodriguez of Phoenix says his bill to end privatized health services at Arizona’s 10 state-run prisons was inspired by numerous accounts about inmates with minor ailments later facing serious health problems because the privatized system responded slowly or inadequately. “It’s broken, and people are dying because of this,” says Rodriguez, who disputes the claim that privatization has saved the state money. But Rep. John Kavanagh, a Republican from Fountain Hills who opposes the bill, says ending privatization would lead to high costs for the state, including higher pension costs. “It’s a lot cheaper having a private company do that,” Kavanagh says.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Holiday Island, a lakeside community, has received enough signatures from voters to try once again to become an incorporated city after a failed effort in 2017. State laws regarding incorporation were changed this year, making it easier for Holiday Island to incorporate this time around, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. The changes include exemptions in population limits, allowing Holiday Island to incorporate should voters approve a ballot initiative. As an incorporated city, Holiday Island will be able to enforce its own codes and receive state money from taxes to maintain streets and roads. A spokesman for Holiday Island Citizens for Incorporation, Dan Kees, says the petition drive to get the incorporation on the 2020 general election ballot received 557 signatures from voters; only 498 were needed.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The commercial Dungeness crab fishing season in the San Francisco Bay Area has begun after a monthlong delay, allowing fishermen to start hauling in the wiggly crustaceans in time for the holiday season. Fishing boats began returning through the Golden Gate Bridge on Sunday with bins packed with crabs and headed to wholesalers at Pier 45, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife pushed back the season to lower the risk of whales getting entangled in fishing lines. The recreational crab season began Nov. 2 as scheduled. Boat captains said they saw no whales and faced rough waters on the first day of crab fishing. The commercial Dungeness crab industry in California takes in $40 million to $95 million a year. In recent years, the season has also been cut by elevated levels of the neurotoxin domoic acid found in some crabs.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has downgraded the air quality rating of the state’s biggest population center. The EPA finalized the move Monday, lowering the ozone status of Denver and eight other northern Colorado counties from “moderate” to “serious.” That will force the state to work harder to reduce harmful pollution but also bring tougher and costly regulations for businesses. Gov. Jared Polis took the unusual step of inviting the EPA to downgrade the rating, saying in March that Colorado would no longer ask for an exemption from standards by claiming some of the pollution was drifting into the state from elsewhere. He said in August that it was time to stop “sugar-coating” Colorado’s air problems. The reclassification requires the state to revise its plan to reduce ozone-forming emissions, which can aggravate asthma and contribute to early deaths from respiratory disease.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A new base is being raised in a key battleground of the state’s opioid epidemic: the bustling Park Street corridor where drug deaths in Hartford are most concentrated. The harm reduction center opens in January in a former law office on Grand Street, its ammunition a combination of director Mark Jenkins’ straight talk and belly laugh and his large stocks of clean syringes and heroin cookers, fentanyl test strips, condoms and candy, the Hartford Courant reports. Jenkins supplies them to drug-dependent people and sex workers to alleviate the dangers they face and ultimately draw them in to recovery. His organization, the 5-year-old Greater Hartford Harm Reduction Coalition, has operated a drop-in resource center on Albany Avenue since last summer, but it’s essentially an outpost in the epidemic, serving a population with far lower rates of fatal overdoses than the neighborhoods around Park Street.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A bright-eyed puppy just might be what you need to get in the holiday spirit. Families can host a shelter pet from the Brandywine Valley SPCA for a short stay over the holiday season, as part of the organization’s holiday sleepovers program. BVSPCA says the program gives pets a “much needed” break from life in the shelter while giving families a fun guest during the holidays. “Sleepovers have been shown to reduce stress for shelter animals, and we also learn more about the pet’s personality in a more natural environment,” Walt Fenstermacher of BVSPCA said in a statement. There are two sleepover options: the “Santa Sleepover,” for pickup Dec. 20-23 and return Dec. 26-30, and “Winter Break,” with pickup Dec. 20-23 and return Jan. 2-5. This is BVSPCA’s second year offering holiday sleepovers. Last year, more than 30 pets spent the holidays with a family.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Public safety advocates say the Metro put riders of a crippled Red Line train in danger, possibly breaking a federal guideline and its own policy, by sending a train full of people toward tracks that were seen sparking moments earlier, WUSA-TV reports. “There was a moment of panic,” says Joe Twinem, who took video of the incident in a tunnel near Tenleytown Metro. It was the first of three such arcing track insulator incidents that snarled morning and evening rushes last week. Twinem says a smoky haze filled his train car. Firefighter Dave Statter, a former WUSA9 reporter, calls the incident similar to the 2015 tunnel fire that killed a woman. The National Transportation Safety Board subsequently told Metro to stop using trains carrying passengers to investigate track problems. Metro is investigating the incident.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: Universal Parks and Resorts on Monday pledged 20 acres of land for affordable housing in the state, a day before the company asked county officials for millions of dollars for road construction that will allow it to build a third theme park, Epic Universe. The theme park company said the land for affordable housing will accommodate 1,000 mixed-use housing units in Orlando. The metro area is in the middle of an affordable housing crisis for its hospitality-driven workforce. Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings has made affordable housing a top priority and had recommended working with corporate partners to come up with solutions to the metro area’s housing needs. Universal also said it would make another 3 acres available for mass transit.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The mayor ordered city courts Monday to soon begin restricting public access to records involving people cited for minor marijuana offenses. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms issued an administrative order that Atlanta’s Municipal Court by Feb. 1 must make court records for possession of less than an ounce of marijuana accessible only to law enforcement. Bottoms said in a statement that racial disparities in criminal cases involving small amounts of pot justified the change. “The fact remains that communities of color are disproportionately affected by the lingering stigma of victimless, minor offenses – even long after the accused have paid their debts,” Bottoms said. “This outmoded practice deprives our communities and workforce of brilliant and promising minds, all because of an unfair justice system that can and will be course-corrected.” The American Civil Liberties Union applauded the move.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: Hawaii County has proceeded with efforts to restore access to public roads inundated by lava following the opening of a Big Island highway last month. About 13 miles of public roads were covered by lava from the 2018 Kilauea volcanic eruption affecting portions of Highway 137, Highway 132, Pohoiki Road and others, the Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports. Temporary access was established to Highway 137 a year ago, and Highway 132 was restored last month, officials said. However, multiple other affected roads have remained closed throughout southeast Hawaii Island. Highway 132 was fully covered by the Federal Highways Administration, but reimbursement for other affected roads would need to come through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, officials said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A portion of a lawsuit brought by an Idaho family against the U.S. government after a boy and his dog tripped a cyanide-spraying, predator-killing trap near their home has been dismissed. U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill dismissed all personal injury claims Friday related to cyanide exposure to Mark and Theresa Mansfield and their son. Canyon Mansfield was playing with his dog in March 2017 near his home when the then-14-year-old triggered the trap that the U.S. Department of Agriculture placed to kill coyotes. The dog named Casey died. Winmill agreed with U.S. Department of Justice attorney Michele Greif that the Mansfields didn’t prove they experienced ill effects from cyanide exposure or will experience them in the future. The devices, called M-44s, are embedded in the ground and look like lawn sprinklers.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: City agencies are telling people to stop feeding the raccoons that populate the city’s northern lakefront. People are hand-feeding kitchen scraps to the dozens of raccoons living in the area, which the agencies say is dangerous, WBBM-TV reports. “We ask that visitors not feed wildlife in parks or along the lakefront for their own safety and the health and wellness of the animals,” Chicago Park District spokeswoman Irene Tostado said in a statement. Chicago Animal Care and Control said it has not received any raccoon-related service requests from the area. Raccoons are rabies carriers and can transfer other diseases and pests such as roundworm, the Humane Society advises.\n\nIndiana\n\nVincennes: A preservation group that saved an ornate church from demolition has found a buyer who plans to turn it into a rural retreat. Indiana Landmarks spent seven years trying to find a buyer for the former Palmyra Cumberland Presbyterian Church, located just outside Vincennes in southwestern Indiana. That perseverance recently paid off when the nonprofit found a private, out-of-state buyer for the Gothic-Revival church, which dates back to 1892. The new owner plans to restore the building and use it as a rural retreat. The church, designed by local architect J.W. Gaddis, retains many of its original, ornate features, including limestone accents and decorative metal finials. The steeple even houses the church’s original bell. Tommy Kleckner, director of Indiana Landmarks’ Western Regional Landmarks Office, says the group took a loss on the sale – at less than $30,000 – because staff felt the building was well worth saving.\n\nIowa\n\nCenterville: A Nativity scene removed from a county courthouse lawn in southern Iowa won’t be returning. The scene was erected Nov. 18 outside the Appanoose County Courthouse in Centerville, but some residents complained that a religious display should not be placed on government property. City Administrator Jason Fraser had approved the display’s location but told organizers it needed to be moved before Thanksgiving. It took until Dec. 9 before enough volunteers could be gathered to move the display off the lawn and to a new spot about two blocks south. The county owns the building and the land underneath; the city owns the lawn. The Daily Iowegian reports that at Monday’s City Council meeting, several speakers sharply criticized the scene’s removal and asked that it be moved back.\n\nKansas\n\nOverland Park: A 13-year-old girl who was arrested for making her fingers into the shape of a gun and pointing at classmates has been placed on a juvenile diversion program. The Overland Park girl, who was originally charged with felony threatening, was set to go before a judge Tuesday, but the Johnson County Juvenile Court hearing was canceled. A spokeswoman for the Johnson County district attorney confirmed she is on diversion but provided no details, The Kansas City Star reports. Under diversion, a charge can be dismissed if a juvenile successfully meets certain conditions set by authorities. The girl’s mother told The Star previously that a boy asked her daughter who she would kill if she could kill five classmates. The girl reportedly made the shape of a gun with her fingers and pointed at four students, then herself.\n\nKentucky\n\nHodgenville: The Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park is offering a new book club, and the first book selection will be about the former president’s wife. The first Parks and Pages Book Club discussion will be held Jan. 24 on the book “Mrs. Lincoln and Mrs. Keckly: The Remarkable Story of the Friendship Between a First Lady and a Former Slave,” according to a statement from the National Park Service. People can attend at the Kentucky park or join a virtual discussion on the park’s Facebook page using the “Facebook Live” feature. The park service says all books during the club’s first year will be on the same theme: presidential first ladies. The book for January can be purchased in the park’s bookstore, and a couple of copies are available in the park’s library. More book titles will be announced throughout 2020.\n\nLouisiana\n\nDenham Springs: The city has created a housing board that will address the issue of properties that are still dilapidated three years after a flood destroyed most of the area. The 2016 flood devastated much of the Livingston Parish area. Officials in Denham Springs said they’ve been lenient and patient with residents whose homes were damaged by the flood. However, Mayor Gerard Landry told The Advocate that now is the time to focus on the community and neighbors who are living near potentially hazardous homes. “We’ve kind of had a hands-off approach for the last few years out of compassion, but at some point in time I have to have more compassion for the people next door,” Landry said. The Housing Appeals Board, made up of city officials, will meet monthly to discuss the 70 homes in the city that are vacant and deteriorating.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Someone spray-painted graffiti about the treatment of the homeless on the sidewalk outside City Hall, police said Monday. The graffiti states, “No one deserves to be out in the cold,” and “No cap on the new shelter.” Advocates for the homeless have been lobbying city officials to make sure everyone who needs shelter is afforded it at a new facility 5 miles from the old one. The city said in a statement that it “respects all opinions regarding policy matters, but we do not tolerate criminal acts, and defacing city property is not the right way to share your message.” Officials said the city plans to press charges if the person or people who made the graffiti are located. Meanwhile, the graffiti is being removed from the plaza outside City Hall.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The city is renaming a courthouse after the late Congressman Elijah Cummings. The Baltimore Sun reports the City Council voted to make the change Monday. Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young had asked the council to push the legislation forward. He intends to sign the bill and formally unveil the new name for Courthouse East in the near future. Cummings was chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform. He was also a powerful advocate for Baltimore and civil rights. He died in October. Young said in a statement that the courthouse will “stand in perpetuity as a monument to Cummings’ service to the common man, the rule of law in our society, and his commitment to economic justice for all.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The city’s Museum of Fine Arts is hosting a holiday celebration with music and free tours of its collection of Jewish art. Wednesday afternoon’s event will mark the sixth year the museum has hosted a Hanukkah observance. It’s being presented in partnership with the Jewish Arts Collaborative and the Combined Jewish Philanthropies organization. Participants will hear traditional songs performed in Yiddish and Hebrew, and events for children include dancing, storytelling and arts and crafts. Organizers say it’s the largest community Hanukkah gathering in Boston. A centerpiece of the celebration is “Brighter Beyond,” a collaborative, interactive blacklight experience that invites visitors to add their light to a glowing installation led by artist Tova Speter. The museum will offer tours of its Judaica collection and four 15-minute talks. It will also offer Hannukah treats such as latkes.\n\nMichigan\n\nMarquette: A snowstorm that swept across parts of the Midwest and dumped as much as 2 feet of snow in the state last month formed ideal conditions for skiing and snowmobile riding in the Upper Peninsula, but crews are still busy clearing fallen trees blocking trails. Though many trails remain open, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources cautioned that some may be impassable and said riders must be extra alert for logs, rocks or stumps that could be obscured by the snow. “The number of downed trees and limbs is astonishing,” said Rob Katona, central Upper Peninsula trails specialist with the DNR’s Parks and Recreation Division. “We haven’t seen conditions like this in recent history.” The heavy snow weighed down young birches, oaks and other small trees, leaving them arched to the ground across trails, sometimes entirely buried under the snow, the Iron Mountain Daily News reports.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The state’s Board of Pardons has approved a request that could lead to a posthumous pardon for a man convicted of sexually assaulting a Duluth woman in 1920. Max Mason was among a group of black circus workers accused in the assault. Three were lynched from a light pole by an angry mob of local residents. Two others went to trial, and Mason was the only one convicted. His supporters believe he was falsely accused and say a pardon would restore justice in a “horrific and shameful episode in Minnesota history.” The board’s vote could open the door for another review of Mason’s original pardon request, which was denied in 1924. Mason was convicted on what some thought was weak evidence. Supporters noted a lack of evidence corroborating the woman’s allegation and a physician’s exam that appeared to contradict her claim, according to the Minnesota Historical Society.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state’s Small Business Administration is now offering low-interest loans to homeowners, businesses and nonprofit organizations who suffered losses when torrential rain caused widespread flooding last spring. The National Weather Service estimates some south Mississippi areas received up to 15 inches of rain in a span of days in May 2019, washing out train tracks, flooding rivers and prompting water rescues, news outlets report. To help in the recovery, Gov. Phil Bryant wrote to the administration last month requesting assistance for eight heavily affected counties, The Biloxi Sun-Herald reports. The Small Business Administration approved business disaster loans, economic injury loans for nonprofits and home disaster loans for citizens last week.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Elected officials in Jackson County are adding plaques to statues of the Kansas City area county’s namesake noting that the nation’s seventh president was a slave owner and forced thousands of Native Americans off their lands. The plaques that will be added to statues of Andrew Jackson outside courthouses in downtown Kansas City and in nearby Independence will note: “Almost two centuries later, we hold a broader, more inclusive view of our nation,” KMBC-TV reports. Jackson began his term as president in 1829, almost three years after the Missouri State Legislature named the county after him because he was a hero of the War of 1812. “This statue of Jackson reminds us we are on a path that, in the immortal words of Martin Luther King Jr., bends toward justice. In turn, we must acknowledge the past injustices to help us create a greater nation built upon humane policies to light our way and the way of humanity everywhere,” the plaques will read.\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: One of Glacier National Park’s most infamous thoroughfares is scheduled for a much-needed face lift next year. Many Glacier Road, which provides access to the popular Many Glacier Hotel and some of the park’s most well trafficked hikes, will be closed to vehicles from April 1 to May 17 and again from Sept. 21 to Dec. 16. During the intervening months, construction projects on the road are anticipated to cause delays of at least 40 minutes and as long as three hours each way from the nearby town of Babb to the Many Glacier Hotel. The construction project is expected to continue in 2021, the Flathead Beacon reports. For years, travel on Many Glacier Road has been an unpleasant adventure for park visitors. The road runs along the Sherburne Reservoir, and the waters of the artificial reservoir have contributed to instability underneath the roadway, causing massive potholes and dramatic undulations.\n\nNebraska\n\nScottsbluff: The City Council has reduced its funding commitment to the local zoo, a commitment that includes a contingency clause for further cuts if city sales tax revenue were to drop. The agreement approved Monday night runs for five years at $300,000 a year, a drop of $50,000 yearly from the 10-year commitment that ends in September next year. The $350,000 a year was becoming unsustainable because of lower sales tax revenue and city spending increases, city officials have said. Riverside director Anthony Mason said fundraisers and private donations could make up the funding difference. Any further reduction of funding would have to be approved by a three-fourths vote of the City Council. Scottsbluff City Manager Nathan Johnson says the hope is that by investing in the zoo, the returning tourism dollars will stimulate city’s sales tax revenue.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: With costs falling for hepatitis C treatment, state prisons are launching a program to test all inmates for the blood-borne virus. The Department of Corrections has budgeted about $6.8 million and plans to hire contract staff to screen all inmates in coming months, including those just entering the system, Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. Nevada has about 13,000 men and women at seven correctional centers, nine conservation camps and two transitional housing facilities, corrections department spokesman Scott Kelley said. In a report Friday to the Legislature’s Interim Finance Committee, deputy prisons chief John Borrowman called curing chronic hepatitis C before releasing inmates “an invaluable step toward (virus) elimination and successful community reintegration.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nFranconia: A shelter located inside a 19th-century barn is planned to undergo an ambitious reconstruction. The Bancroft House has planned demolition and reconstruction of its Franconia property after decades of struggling financially, the Caledonian Record reports. The barn currently offers free room and board to residents, allowing them to save up the rent and deposits required for securing housing when they leave. “Currently the barn’s floor has collapsed, and critters have easy access to the interior, preventing us from accepting linens, towels, and anything with fabric or stuffing, which rodents will quickly use as nesting material,” says Kevin Johnson, a member of the shelter’s board of directors. The organization has spent the past few years trying to improve the nonprofit’s financial health, and demolition has proven to be the most cost-effective way to address the deteriorating structure.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Wildlife officials are extending the second phase of the state’s black bear hunt because the harvest objectives for the year have not been met. The six-day hunt had concluded Saturday. But it will now resume Wednesday and continue through Saturday. Officials say 265 bears were harvested during the first phase of the hunt in October. Another 37 were culled last week, meaning 302 bruins were killed overall. New Jersey’s bear management policy mandates that the hunting season be extended by four days if less than 20% of tagged bears are killed. The harvest rate for this season stands at 14.7%. That harvest rate is deemed necessary to provide better ecological balance to the bear population and reduce the potential for bear-human encounters.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: New Mexico State University has been awarded a grant that will go toward building the only botanic garden within 100 miles of the southern New Mexico campus. The garden will be used to grow and study plants native to New Mexico and the Chihuahuan Desert that might attract bees and other pollinators. In addition to the research side, officials are aiming to create a garden that will be welcoming for visitors. The plan incorporates paths throughout the garden and a large gazebo for shade and outdoor events. Rather than straight rows of plants, it will be designed using a paisley pattern made up of four repetitions with the same plants in each plot. Officials say it will likely take several years for the garden to be completed.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Gov. Andrew Cuomo proposed new legislation Tuesday that would close a loophole in state law that often prevents prosecutors from bringing rape charges when victims become drunk of their own volition. The governor wants to amend the state’s definition of who cannot legally consent to sexual activity. That currently does not include someone who remains conscious – but is too drunk to consent – after becoming voluntarily intoxicated. “While New York has some of the most aggressive laws in the nation when it comes to combating this insidious disease, a loophole in current law allows rapists to walk free and vacate their heinous crimes based on a legal technicality,” Cuomo said in a statement. “Our laws must protect the people of this state – not condone rape as a punishment for consuming alcohol.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nMonroe: An item found in the state in 1973 may be thousands of years old, according to the state’s office of archaeology. The 7-inch carved artifact found by a Monroe landowner is suspected to be a grooved adz, a tool used for smoothing or trimming wood, The Charlotte Observer reports. It could have been used to carve bowls, dugout canoes or other objects, according to a North Carolina Office of State Archaeology statement. The item’s age is unclear, but it may have been made about the time when many grooved axes were being made and used, according to the office’s 3D model and description of the item. That means it likely dates to the Late Archaic period between 3,000 and 1,000 B.C. Indigenous groups in the area over the years include the Catawba Nation and the Lumbee Tribe, according to the Observer.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A group seeking to legalize recreational marijuana in the state can begin circulating petitions to try to bring the issue to voters. Secretary of State Al Jaeger approved the format of the petition Monday. LegalizeND would need to gather and submit nearly 13,500 signatures by July 6 to get a proposed measure on November ballot. The proposed measure would allow any person over the age of 21 to use, possess and transport up to 2 ounces of prepared marijuana, but it would ban home growing of the plant. The group gathered enough signatures to put a legalization measure on the ballot in 2018, but that effort failed 41% to 59%.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state unveiled its new Ohio School Safety Center on Tuesday as a panel that will advise that office begins its work. The new office under Ohio Homeland Security is intended to help educators and police prevent and address violence involving schools and students. It began its work months ago with a staff that included intelligence analysts scanning social media and websites for threats. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine has said the center also will review school safety plans, help train school threat-assessment teams and share best practices. It will get input from a new working group whose 40-plus members were announced Monday. Among them are representatives of schools and school employees who work with students in crisis, as well as emergency responders, other state offices and organizations that promote children’s wellness.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt said Tuesday that he’s taking over gambling negotiations with Native American tribes from the attorney general and plans to hire his own out-of-state legal team. Stitt also announced at a news conference that he intends to offer tribes an extension that would allow casino gambling to continue after Jan. 1, when Stitt maintains the current compacts expire. “The language in this extension will allow each side who signs on to the extension to retain their legal positions,” Stitt said. “I want business to continue as usual while we resolve this dispute.” Attorney General Mike Hunter took over several months ago as the state’s lead negotiator with the tribes, but Stitt said Tuesday that he felt it was best to have “one unified voice.” He said his office is working on finalizing a contract with an out-of-state law firm to assist his office in negotiating with the tribes.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Members of a homeless encampment are planning to stage a protest at the Capitol, possibly this week, after a citywide camping ban went into effect Monday. The plan was announced as city officials prepared to give the homeless 24 hours’ notice Tuesday to depart the camp at The ARCHES Project, a downtown social services provider. Those who refuse to leave could face civil citations. “We have nowhere to go now,” said Anthony Stevens, the camp’s unofficial spokesman. “We can’t go back to the parks, we can’t go to where we can hide, because they’re just going to come in, mow everything over and send us on our way.” The ban, passed at the start of December with a two-week delay, was aimed at clearing city sidewalks and other public property of homeless camps. City councilors OK’d the ban but aborted a proposal to prohibit sitting and lying on sidewalks.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Policymakers announced a task force Monday that will take a broad look at the state’s juvenile justice system in hopes of improving the results it produces. Legislative leaders and Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf announced formation of the group at a Capitol news conference, giving it nearly a year to issue recommendations about how to make people safer, improve accountability and save tax dollars. Its members will be appointed by Wolf, the court system and the Legislature. House Majority Leader Bryan Cutler, R-Lancaster, said the concept is to use data and research to reconfigure the juvenile justice system to improve results. “I’d like to say there is no such thing as a bad kid,” said Sen. Mike Regan, R-York. “However, we all know kids do bad things.” Wolf said the project will build on clean slate legislation, reductions in the state prison inmate population, an end to automatic driver’s license suspensions and other adult justice reform changes in recent years.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Critics of a state campaign finance law say it violates the First Amendment. The law requires the disclosure of the top five donors behind any campaign communication during state election cycles. In addition, it requires groups producing the communications to file public reports of any donor who gave more than $1,000. The law is the subject of a federal lawsuit filed by conservative advocacy groups, though it also has critics on the left, The Boston Globe reports. Critics of the bill have argued that identifying donors encourages them not to participate in the democratic process. Supporters of the bill have argued that it will enlighten voters as to who is trying to influence their decision at the ballot.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: A prosecutor said he will decide by January how to handle convicted and sentenced to a year in prison for using his power and office to push a personal assistant to have sex with him. The other charges against ex-Greenville County Sheriff Will Lewis cover a range of additional misconduct including lying about conducting a background check on a deputy, giving someone a badge who was not qualified and intimidating his employees to try to keep them from cooperating with investigators. The evidence, including recorded phone calls, made the affair case the strongest to get a conviction, so prosecutors decided to try Lewis on two counts of misconduct in office first, Solicitor Kevin Brackett says.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: A little boy who always dreamed of getting a train for Christmas finds himself on a magical adventure – with a distinctly Black Hills twist – in a new book starring the 1880 Train. “Marlon McDoogle’s Magical Night” introduces readers to 12-year-old Marlon, who’s waiting for a Christmas surprise his grandfather promised him. However, Marlon could never predict what would happen when his grandfather arrives on Christmas Eve and tells the boy, “We have lots of work to do!” The pair drives off in Grandpa McDoogle’s old truck for an unforgettable encounter with visitors from the North Pole and a wild ride aboard the 1880 Train. The book is the latest project from Sean Covel of Deadwood, the producer of films including “Napoleon Dynamite” and the author of “Porter the Hoarder” books that were recently distributed in elementary schools throughout South Dakota, the Rapid City Journal reports.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A nonprofit group has handed over statues of Confederate leaders Nathan Bedford Forrest and Jefferson Davis to the Sons of Confederate Veterans, two years after they were removed from public parks in the city, officials said Tuesday. City of Memphis legal officer Bruce McMullen said the statues of Forrest and Davis have been given to Forrest’s descendants and the Sons of Confederate Veterans “to display them as they wish.” The statues’ location was not disclosed, but they could be re-erected at some point. Memphis and the Confederate veterans’ group have battled in court over the statues’ removal from two city parks. Forrest’s equestrian statue, which stood over the grave of the Confederate general and his wife, and the monument of Davis, the Confederate president, were removed from the parks under the cover of night Dec. 20, 2017.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A 19-year-old man has been arrested after mercury was found spilled in the city, leading dozens of people to be decontaminated as a precaution, FBI said Monday. The agency’s Houston office said on Twitter that Christopher Lee Melder has been charged with burglary and unlawful disposal of hazardous material. He is also charged on an outstanding felony drug possession warrant. It wasn’t immediately known whether he had a lawyer, and authorities didn’t immediately say if the spills were intentional. City officials said, according to the FBI, that he broke into a lab at an undisclosed location and took the mercury. Someone called 911 about 11:15 a.m. Sunday to report a white liquid on the ground, Houston Fire Chief Sam Pena has said. Officials later determined less than a pint of mercury was spilled outside a Walmart, a Sonic Drive-In and gas station.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints defended Tuesday how it uses and invests member donations after a former church employee charged in a complaint to the Internal Revenue Service that the faith had improperly built a $100 billion investment portfolio using member donations that are supposed to go to charitable causes. The vast majority of member donations are used to fund church operations, temples, missions, education and humanitarian needs, while another portion is “methodically safeguarded through wise financial management and the building of a prudent reserve for the future,” church spokesman Eric Hawkins said in a statement. The IRS complaint from a former church investment manager alleges the Utah-based faith sets aside about $1 billion a year from the $7 billion it receives annually in member donations, the Washington Post reports.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Voters in the city will have a say in March 2020 on whether legal noncitizens can vote in city elections. The City Council passed a resolution Monday to go to voters. The charter change would have to approved by the Legislature, WCAX-TV reports. Independent Burlington City Councilor Adam Roof had pushed the proposal, saying that all Burlington residents are affected by decisions made by the local government, regardless of their citizenship status, so they should be allowed to vote. A similar charter change in Montpelier stalled in the Senate during the last legislative session, after it was approved in the House.\n\nVirginia\n\nArlington: A redevelopment plan for Amazon’s second headquarters has been unanimously approved by a county board, clearing the way for the company to transform 6.2 acres into twin 22-story buildings. The Arlington County Board voted 5-0 on Saturday to give Amazon final approval to began building the headquarters known as HQ2, news outlets report. HQ2 will be an approximately 2 million-square-foot mixed-use set of buildings that will house a day care facility for employees and other residents, ground-level retail shops, an underground parking garage and an indoor event space for county-sanctioned events. Amazon promised the county a $20 million commitment for affordable housing because the site was once zoned for residential use and because the company is adding 590,000 square feet of density to the area.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: The Spokane Tribe of Indians will finally be compensated after some of their ancestral homelands were flooded by the giant Grand Coulee Dam seven decades ago. The U.S. House on Monday approved and sent to President Donald Trump a bill that sets up yearly payments to the tribe based on a similar system for the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, who also lost land when the dam and its reservoir were created. The Spokesman-Review reports the Spokane Tribe will receive $6 million a year for 10 years and $8 million a year after that. The money will come from revenues of the Bonneville Power Administration, which sells electricity generated by Grand Coulee and other federal dams in the Northwest. Trump is expected to sign the bill, the newspaper reports.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nPoint Pleasant: The site of a bridge that collapsed 52 years ago and killed dozens of people has been recognized as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark. The American Society of Civil Engineers’ recognition for Silver Bridge was announced Sunday during a ceremony where the suspension bridge once stood, news outlets report. The bridge named for the color of its aluminum paint crossed the Ohio River, connecting Point Pleasant, West Virginia, and Gallipolis, Ohio, and first opened to traffic in 1928. It collapsed Dec. 15, 1967. Eyewitnesses reported it took seconds for the bridge to fold like a deck of cards, sending dozens of cars and people into the water below. The National Transportation Safety Board later determined the collapse was caused by an eyebar that fractured due to stress corrosion and corrosion fatigue.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The new leader of the state’s jobs agency is pledging to refuse to award state tax credits to technology manufacturing giant Foxconn for employees who don’t work in Wisconsin – but a new state audit shows the agency’s procedures leave the door open. For the second time in as many years, the nonpartisan Legislature Audit Bureau is warning the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. to change its procedures to ensure taxpayers don’t end up paying for work that doesn’t benefit the state economy. Foxconn struck a deal in 2017 with state lawmakers to build a $10 billion LCD panel manufacturing facility in southeastern Wisconsin in exchange for $3 billion in state incentives. The project – once hailed by President Donald Trump as the “eighth wonder of world” – has since been scaled back, but the state’s contract with the company hasn’t changed.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The state Republican Party has passed a resolution opposing the addition of another vaccine to the requirements for children in school. The Department of Health is considering changes to vaccine rules that will be sent to Republican Gov. Mark Gordon for approval, The Casper Star-Tribune reports. The department added meningococcal vaccine to the required list of school inoculations. The disease can cause meningitis, a life-threatening illness that attacks the central nervous system. The GOP resolution said the party opposes adding the meningococcal vaccine to the required list due to statements from U.S. Supreme Court justices about a vaccine “regulatory void.” The resolution also referred to money paid by a national program to compensate those injured by vaccines and a Johns Hopkins University study saying medical or hospital error is a leading cause of U.S. deaths.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/08/22/stranger-tourists-phish-plague-kinkajou-attack-news-around-states/39994527/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nDecatur: The city is trying to figure out how to ban guns from a water park were two people were shot. The Decatur Daily reports officials say they need a change in state law before banning visitors from bringing guns into Point Mallard water park. But a state lawmaker from the city says minor changes would allow a gun ban. The issue is a state law that allows weapons at many public venues. A teenager was arrested after two people were wounded during a shooting at Point Mallard in June. City attorney Herman Marks says state law prohibits an outright ban on guns. Republican state Sen. Arthur Orr of Decatur says lawyers tell him the city could prohibit guns if it also controls access and increases security.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The governor has vetoed additional funding for the state’s ferry service that was placed in the budget by the Legislature. Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy vetoed $5 million Monday that was added to the Alaska Marine Highway System budget, CoastAlaska reports. The Legislature previously cut $43 million from the ferry system’s budget. A fiscal note attached by the governor’s office called the budget item “premature” ahead of a $250,000 study, due in October, commissioned to reshape the ferry system. “I don’t know how it could be premature,” independent state Rep. Dan Ortiz of Ketchikan says. “We could see that these areas were going to be without needed services.” Coastal residents have told Ortiz they’re prevented from traveling even in emergency situations unless they find airplane travel while facing up to seven months without ferry service, he said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Arizonans spend more time on their phones on average than everyone else in the country, according to a study based off Apple’s screen-time tracking system. SimpleTexting, a text marketing service, used screen-time data from 2,103 survey respondents to show how much of the day users spend tweeting, watching YouTube videos and more. Arizona had the highest average daily screen time at 276 minutes – more than twice the 131-minute average of the lowest state, Oklahoma. Weekly, Arizonans spend an average of 32.2 hours on their phones. That’s roughly 12 hours more than the national average, according to the study. That means that over a year, the state’s residents average about 70 full days using their smartphones.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The governor and attorney general are setting aside $1.5 million to create a legal services clinic for military veterans. Gov. Asa Hutchinson and Attorney General Leslie Rutledge on Tuesday announced they were each allocating $750,000 to create the University of Arkansas Little Rock William H. Bowen School of Law’s Veterans Legal Services Clinic. The clinic is the first of its kind in Arkansas and will enable students at the law school to provide legal services free of charge to veterans throughout the state. Enrolled students will be trained to represent veterans on various legal issues under the supervision of a clinical facilitator. The clinic will also provide free continuing legal education for practicing attorneys on veteran-specific legal issues.\n\nCalifornia\n\nHayward: A 400-pound security robot that was knocked over by a vandal last month in Northern California may help bring its attacker to justice. The Hayward Police Department on Tuesday released images of the suspect that the Knightscope K5 robot captured before it was damaged. The 5-foot-tall robot, described by police as an “R2D2” figure, was guarding a parking garage when it was pushed over Aug. 3. K5’s photos show a young man in a black T-shirt and jeans running up moments before the attack. Police are asking for the public’s help in finding him. The company that built the robot, Knightscope, tells the Fresno Bee that the robot is expected to make “a full and speedy recovery.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Thousands of people who planned to camp during three days of Phish concerts at a stadium outside the city will no longer be able to because of concerns that fleas in and around nearby prairie dog burrows could spread the plague. The Denver Post reports public health officials are still finding infected fleas in fields surrounding Dick’s Sporting Goods Park in Commerce City. The stadium’s owner decided to ban camping during the concerts over Labor Day weekend, and the band posted the notice on its website Tuesday. Between 2,000 and 3,000 people were expected to camp. The band’s well-known Shakedown Street, where fans sell souvenirs and food, also will not be allowed because the area normally used by vendors outside the stadium is on a dirt road.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state is looking to purchase up to 2,000 megawatts of offshore wind power. The Department of Energy and Environmental Protection says it has released a request for proposals for offshore wind power as required by a new state law. The department says it’s the state’s first solicitation dedicated specifically to offshore wind development, and the timing aligns with a similar offshore wind solicitation by the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources. Connecticut already plans to purchase about 300 megawatts of offshore wind power from the Revolution Wind project, which is planned for federal waters south of Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont says the new request represents “the future of the state’s environmental, energy and economic potential.” Bids are due by Sept. 30.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth Beach: A wealthy developer has won a court battle against neighboring property owners in a fight over oceanfront views from their multimillion-dollar homes. A judge ruled Tuesday that Louis Capano III can build his beachfront mansion in Rehoboth Beach without complying with setback rules that were informally agreed to, but never formally adopted, by his neighbors. The judge noted that while other property owners voluntarily built to those more restrictive setback standards, they tried and failed three times to formally amend the community’s declaration of restrictive covenants. Other property owners complained that Capano’s house will obstruct their own panoramic views of the ocean. They wanted to prevent Capano from building within 30 feet of the coastal construction building line established by state environmental regulators to protect the beach and dunes.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The district has enacted emergency regulations to stop the federal government’s plan to house unaccompanied migrant children there. The Washington Post reports the regulations by Mayor Muriel E. Bowser’s administration were adopted Friday and prohibit licensing facilities housing more than 15 residents. They also require the director of the city’s child welfare agency to sign off on facilities housing between eight to 15 children. The rules expire in December. Maryland-based Dynamic Service Solution applied to open a temporary 200-bed shelter in the district. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services awarded it a $20.5 million contract to operate the shelter for children ages 12 to 17. DHHS has defended the shelter and its treatment of unaccompanied minors.\n\nFlorida\n\nLake Worth Beach: Officials say a small, raccoon-like rainforest creature ran into an apartment and bit a man after he opened the front door to head to work. WPEC-TV reports the kinkajou bit his foot and scratched his leg but didn’t seriously injure him. A woman who witnessed the incident at the Lake Worth Beach apartment said it sounded “like a 300-pound man was tackling him in the kitchen.” Natalie Dulach said the furry mammal with sharp claws clung to the man’s leg as he fought to get it out. The man managed to lock the long-tailed animal in the bathroom until wildlife officers arrived. A Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission report says the kinkajou was taken to a wildlife facility. Officers didn’t say where it came from.\n\nGeorgia\n\nPalmetto: A small-town grocery store has grown in popularity and sold more Eggo waffles than ever in recent years, thanks to Netflix’s “Stranger Things.” Fans of the ’80s-set sci-fi show have sought out filming locations such as the former Bradley’s Big Buy grocery store since the show premiered in 2016. The third season has prompted more fans to visit Georgia, benefiting local businesses. Fans are dressing up as characters, reenacting scenes and taking photos at a grocery store, a mall, downtown Jackson and more. Creators Matt and Ross Duffer set the series in fictional Hawkins, Indiana, but filmed in Georgia, which offers tax breaks and other film industry incentives. A building on Emory University’s Briarcliff Campus in Atlanta served as the show’s Hawkins Laboratory. In Duluth, crews transformed a vacant wing and food court in Gwinnett Place Mall into Starcourt Mall.\n\nHawaii\n\nLihue: Officials say an island stream is coming back to life with help from a watershed restoration project. The Garden Island reports the project funded through a state Department of Health grant has produced positive results in the Waipa Stream on Kauai. The effort that began in 2016 aims to remove dense bush from stream banks and surrounding areas while clearing space for native plants. Officials say food forests are taking root, and there is a new swimming hole. The project overseen by the Waipa Foundation has placed fencing around fields to block feral pigs and in pasture land with horses and cows. The fencing keeps the animals out of the water and helps lower bacteria levels below the state threshold for clean streams.\n\nIdaho\n\nMurphy: The largest-ever project in the U.S. to remove thousands of juniper trees to help imperiled sage grouse has started in the state. The Bruneau-Owyhee Sage-Grouse Habitat Project aims to remove junipers on 965 square miles of state and federal land in Owyhee County. Officials say the multiyear project that started this spring could become a template for other western states, as junipers have expanded due to fire-suppression by humans and are taking over vast sagebrush areas and forcing out sage grouse. Sage grouse survival is entirely dependent on sagebrush. Between 200,000 and 500,000 sage grouse remain, down from a peak population of about 16 million. Environmental groups fought the project, contending it was being driven by grazing interests. But federal officials gave final approval earlier this year.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: New security measures will be put in place next month for tours of the governor’s mansion. State Police acting director Brendan Kelly says starting Sept. 3, individuals will have to sign up in advance for tours, provide a photo ID for proof of identity when they arrive, and be screened by metal detectors. Kelly says the measures, adopted after a review of other states’ mansion tour policies, show a commitment to giving mansion guests a safe and welcoming experience. The mansion reopened last year after renovations that cost $15 million. Former Gov. Bruce Rauner spearheaded the renovations because maintenance had been deferred for years. Officials say thousands have visited the mansion since it reopened.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Larry Bird likes the mural but not the tatts. An artist says she’ll remove most tattoos from a large painting of the former NBA star on a multifamily residence in the city. The tattoos include two rabbits mating on his right arm and a spider web on a shoulder. Artist Jules Muck says she was just trying to be funny. The mural is a replica of Bird’s appearance on a 1977 Sports Illustrated cover when he played college ball for Indiana State. Bird’s attorney, Gary Sallee, says the former Indiana Pacers executive “needs to protect” his brand and “doesn’t want to be seen as a tattooed guy.” Muck says an “Indiana” tattoo will remain on Bird’s arm in the mural.\n\nIowa\n\nJohnston: The first waterway access point of the Central Iowa Water Trails project opened Tuesday, with the inaugural launch for a new carry-down access site on Beaver Creek. Entering the creek before the access point was constructed was difficult, Mayor Paula Dierenfeld says. “You used to have to drag a canoe across leaves and mud ... but, now, that’s all changed,” she said. As part of the ceremony, Dierenfeld was one of the first to hit the water in a kayak – something she had never done before, she said as she was getting in. She’s previously only been in canoes. The mayor was also given a ceremonial paddle with “Johnston” inscribed on it. Johnston approved the $350,000 plan last year to build the boat ramp. Next year construction will launch on an access point near Terra Park. The overall project plan is to transform 150 miles of waterways in central Iowa into a recreational amenity.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: The struggling Kansas City T-Bones baseball team is being evicted from its stadium because of unpaid debts. The Unified Government of Wyandotte County/Kansas City Kansas announced Monday that it’s ending its management agreement with the T-Bones and has given the team until Sept. 13 to remove all its property from the publicly owned stadium. The government said in a news release that the T-Bones owed a total of nearly $763,000 in current and past-due utility bills and past-due payments for use of the stadium. The Unified Government said it intends to pursue all remedies to collect the debt. The T-Bones are part of the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball and not affiliated with Major League Baseball.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Two Democratic lawmakers say they have a proposal that would eventually more than double the state’s minimum wage. Sen. Reggie Thomas of Lexington and Rep. Kathy Hinkle of Louisa say they’ll introduce the measure in the House and Senate during the 2020 session, and it would gradually raise the state’s minimum wage until it reaches $15 an hour by 2027. The lawmakers say the increase would result in a livable wage for more Kentuckians. Hinkle says the bill is aimed at helping people now juggling two or three jobs to support their families. The minimum wage in Kentucky is $7.25 an hour. Their bill would not apply to businesses with annual gross revenues under $500,000. Previous efforts to raise the minimum wage have died in the Legislature.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLivingston: U.S. Rep. Garret Graves says Livingston Parish will receive a $5.3 million federal grant to fund the elevation of 88 homes that were substantially damaged during the 2016 flood. Graves says the money is part of the $300 million in federal hazard mitigation funds he worked to secure in the months after the flood. Officials say that money is part of the overall $3 billion in federal funding for Louisiana flood protection and drainage improvements. WAFB-TV reports Livingston Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparation Director Mark Harrell said all of the 88 properties will be elevated above the Base Flood Elevation and in compliance with local building ordinances.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The National Endowment for the Humanities is going to help a pair of cultural institutions engage more with the public about the state’s bicentennial. U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree says the funding is going to the Maine Humanities Council and the University of Maine, Augusta, both slated to receive $100,000 for public discussion programs. Pingree says the grants will help “lift up diverse voices and increase access to cultural programming for all Mainers.” The Maine Humanities Council plans to use its funding to support programming for Maine’s bicentennial celebration next year. UMA’s funds will help with a 15-part speaker series called “Maine’s Midcentury Moment” that will also be a part of the university’s bicentennial programming.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Scientists in the state have been warning of a growing “dead zone” in the Chesapeake Bay. Now the numbers are in, confirming their dire warnings were correct. Natural Resources Department data shows an area with little to no oxygen spread to 2 cubic miles by late July, making it one of the worst in decades. By comparison, July dead zones averaged about 1.35 cubic miles for the past 35 years. The worst section includes the lower Potomac and Patuxent rivers and much of the bay, from Baltimore to the mouth of the York River. University of Maryland environmental scientists say heavy rains washed wastewater and agricultural runoff into the bay and produced oxygen-stealing algae. Scientists fear it could harm crabs, oysters and the state’s seafood industry.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: A state public transit agency is considering a fare-free bus system. The Telegram & Gazette reports the Worcester Regional Transit Authority Advisory Board voted unanimously last week to conduct a fare analysis that includes consideration of a fare-free system. In a report in May, The Research Bureau called the WRTA “a perfect candidate” for a fare-free bus system. The report calculated that the $2 million to $3 million annual cost to provide free service could be made up through cost savings, increased governmental aid and partnerships. The report said offering the service for free would reverse the system’s declining ridership. WRTA Administrator Dennis Lipka says to go fare-free, “we have to find a sustainable way of making that up,” and one-time grants would not be sufficient.\n\nMichigan\n\nEmpire: Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore has welcomed its 50 millionth visitor. The National Park Service says other visitors applauded when Meghan Boertman entered Sleeping Bear’s visitor center in Empire, in northern Michigan west of Traverse City. She was joined by her husband, Spencer, and their children, Jacoby and Levi. It was the first visit for the Boertmans, who live in Norton Shores, near Muskegon. They received an annual park pass, along with a plush black bear, souvenir books and a DVD. Officials say the milestone comes a year ahead of Sleeping Bear National Lakeshore’s 50th anniversary. Visitor statistics are culled from road, visitor center and campground counters as well as North and South Manitou islands.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The state’s film and TV production incentive program is changing after questions were raised about past awards, including $267,000 for Jimmy Fallon’s “Tonight Show.” Minnesota Public Radio News reports the board that runs the Snowbate program announced the changes Monday. Awards would not go to shows built around a national event in Minnesota, nor to projects featuring political candidates. The idea is to fund projects that rely most on in-state workers or feature Minnesota prominently. MPR reported last month that some Minnesota Film and TV board members had questioned the rebate for Fallon’s show to come to Minneapolis during the 2018 Super Bowl. Questions were also raised last fall about a documentary on politician Ilhan Omar.\n\nMississippi\n\nOxford: The University of Mississippi will open a new $32 million campus recreation center this month. The center will include workout space, an indoor climbing wall, fitness studios, basketball courts and other facilities. It’s in a former warehouse of a Whirlpool appliance factory that closed in 2009. Ole Miss began construction in 2016. Campus recreation director Peter Tulchinsky says the new center will accommodate a student population that has doubled since 1983, when Ole Miss opened the Turner Center, its existing recreation facility. The Turner Center will remain open. Ole Miss is basing its parking and transportation department at the center south of Mississippi 6, creating a bus hub and a 700-space parking lot. The center is free for students. Faculty, staff, alumni and community members must buy memberships.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A judge has temporarily blocked a new state law that sought to shield large hog, poultry and cattle farms from stringent local health rules. Cole County Presiding Judge Patricia Joyce’s action means the measure won’t take effect as scheduled Aug. 28. Critics of the law have requested it remain on hold through a Sept. 16 court date. If implemented, it would prevent local officials from passing more stringent regulations than the state on large farms. It’s directed at protecting the interests of industrial farms known as concentrated animal feeding operations, which can produce beef, pork, poultry, dairy and eggs more efficiently than traditional farms can but also stoke concerns about air and water pollution.\n\nMontana\n\nTwo Dot: U.S. Forest Service officials have reached a deal with a landowner meant to increase public access to the eastern side of the Crazy Mountains. The Great Falls Tribune reports the Forest Service will allow landowner Mac White motorized access across public land to reach isolated parcels he owns. In return, the Forest Service will get an easement to build a trail into the Helena-Lewis and Clark National Forest. That will allow access from the eastern side of the southwestern Montana mountain range into the remote Big Elk Canyon. The Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports that work will also begin on a new trail on the western side of the Crazy Mountains next week. The project is meant to reroute and replace parts of a trail where access had been in dispute.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Officials are moving 24 teenage girls out of a state-run facility for female juvenile offenders after learning that many were confined to buildings with fire hazards, holes in the wall, and mold and water damage. The Department of Health and Human Services announced the move Monday after some state lawmakers voiced concerns about the conditions and a lack of staff and programming at the Youth Rehabilitation and Treatment Center in Geneva. The campus in rural central Nebraska serves as a rehabilitation center for girls ages 14-18 who have broken the law and been rejected by other private treatment facilities. All of the 24 girls who live on campus were sent there by the courts as a last resort, and many have significant behavioral and mental health problems.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The Burning Man Project has announced it will be hosting a ticketed conference in the city next year. The May 6-9 conference, dubbed “Learning Man,” aims to explore how Burners can “build bridges between our realities and work to create a better world.” Tickets will go on sale in October. The organization has not released the ticket pricing, nor the location of the conference, but says it will be far from a boring, nametag convention. More than 1,500 creators, connectors and cultural ambassadors from the Burning Man community and beyond will gather to “ideate, learn, build networks, and support thriving year-round communities made stronger by their intelligent and conscious integration of Burning Man culture,” a statement says.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDerry: Town officials are trying to figure out how a recently opened time capsule from 50 years ago has nothing in it. Library director Cara Potter tells WMUR-TV that since she started there five years ago, the safe has been sitting on a shelf. Before that, it was kept at the old municipal building in town. The combination was on the back of the safe. Potter said it took several tries to get it open recently on the 50th anniversary of when it was sealed in 1969. But it was empty. No one has a list of what was originally put inside. Officials said they have no idea who could have opened it and taken the items. They even speculated that nothing was put in there in the first place.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: A young girl discovered something slithery at an airport security checkpoint – a 15-inch-long snake. Transportation Security Administration officials at Newark Liberty International Airport said in a release that it appears the thin, black snake with a yellow ring around its neck was forgotten by a traveler Monday night. The girl alerted a TSA officer, and a gray checkpoint bin was placed over the snake that officials said was harmless. Officials closed the security lane temporarily, and Port Authority police took the snake away. New Jersey Federal Security Director Tom Carter says Newark has a robust lost-and-found system, but the owner of the snake should not call them or expect to be reunited with the reptile. It’s unclear where the snake was taken.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A new report says the state is now on track to collect an unprecedented $7.8 billion in the budget year thanks to skyrocketing oil production. According to the Albuquerque Journal, the report says total state revenue collections were roughly $273 million above projected levels through April largely because of oil production in southeastern New Mexico. The higher-than-expected revenue surge for the budget year that ended June 30 could allow for additional spending increases on public schools, roads and other programs. Legislative and executive economists will release new official revenue estimates at a legislative hearing in Red River later this month. New Mexico was already expecting a $1.3 billion budget surplus for the fiscal year.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A landmark Pepsi sign along the East River will also promote JetBlue for the next six weeks, and critics are finding it hard to swallow. An illuminated blue logo advertising the airline was added to the 60-foot Pepsi-Cola sign in Long Island City, Queens, this week. The new signage celebrates a partnership in which JetBlue will serve PepsiCo drinks on flights. The city Landmarks Preservation Commission issued a permit for the JetBlue logo through Oct. 1. But City Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer, a Democrat who represents the area, says some constituents are complaining. Van Bramer says that even a temporary JetBlue sign “shouldn’t be there.” Nancy Rooney, a PepsiCo vice president of marketing, says the iconic Pepsi-Cola sign is “the perfect symbol” to celebrate Pepsi’s JetBlue partnership.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Legislation that prohibits production and possession of smokable hemp next year while laying regulatory groundwork to expand the state’s industrial and medicinal hemp industry has cleared a second legislative chamber. The state House voted 63-48 on Wednesday for the General Assembly’s annual farm bill. Smokable hemp lacks the concentration of the compound that gives marijuana its high. But law enforcement wants smokable hemp banned because it looks and smells the same – making it otherwise impossible to differentiate during police stops. House members defeated an amendment to delete the proposed May 1 smokable hemp ban. Hemp growers say smokable hemp is an emerging moneymaker for them. The bill now returns to the Senate, where a version already passed, but the measure’s top backer wants the ban delayed until next June.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Lawsuits from environmentalists and landowners have made investors skittish and delayed progress another year on the proposed $800 million oil refinery near Theodore Roosevelt National Park, the developer’s top executive says. Meridian wants to build the refinery just 3 miles from the state’s top tourist attraction, drawing more than 700,000 visitors annually. Environmental groups argue pollution from the factory will spoil scenery and air quality at the 30,000-acre park. Meridian began site work last summer, aiming to have the Davis Refinery operating by mid-2021. Meridian Energy Group CEO William Prentice says the company now plans to have the factory running in 2022 due to funding and legal setbacks. Securities filings show the company has raised less than 5% of construction costs. And the company has two disputes pending before the state Supreme Court.\n\nOhio\n\nDayton: Comedian and Buckeye State native Dave Chappelle is coming home to host the Gem City Shine block party from 4 to 10 p.m. Sunday. The Oregon District Benefit Concert and Community Event will be hosted by the Yellow Springs native. The Oregon District is where a shooter killed nine people Aug. 4. Local and national entertainment will be featured on the main stage during the block party, according to a release. The event will be used to honor the lives of people lost and “reclaim the community’s favorite places to shop, dine and enjoy time with family and friends,” according to the news release from Downtown Dayton Partnership. There will be opportunities at the block party to donate to The Dayton Foundation’s Oregon District Tragedy Fund and the Oregon District Business Association.\n\nOklahoma\n\nNorman: A judge is expected to rule next week on whether consumer products company Johnson & Johnson helped fuel the state’s opioid epidemic in the first such case against a drugmaker to go to trial. A court spokesman says Cleveland County District Judge Thad Balkman is expected to read his decision in open court at 3 p.m. Monday. Before the six-week trial began May 28 , two other groups of defendants who manufactured opioid drugs reached settlements with Oklahoma. The state claims the companies helped create a public nuisance by aggressively marketing painkillers and downplaying the risk of addiction. The state estimates it will cost as much as $17 billion to abate the crisis. Attorneys for the company maintain they acted responsibly and followed strict industry regulations.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A free legal assistance program for immigrants in the city has provided nearly 350 people with lawyers to represent them in deportation hearings in its first year. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports the program called Universal Reception also helped at least 105 people apply for refugee status. Portland’s City Council approved the service last year and put $500,000 toward its budget from property tax collections. This year, Multnomah County allocated $290,000 to the initiative, and the state approved an additional $2 million to expand the service statewide – the first state to do so in the nation. The people who have received free legal services through the program come from Colombia, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Honduras, Iran, Iraq, Mexico, Nicaragua, Russia, Ukraine and Venezuela.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A committee of Pennsylvania Game Commission staff has recommended a statewide ban on feeding white-tailed deer. The agency biologists say that banning artificial feeding stations would help slow the spread of wildlife diseases. They’re asking residents to voluntarily stop feeding deer. The commission often addresses wildlife outbreaks of insect-borne infections, West Nile virus and other flare-ups, but its scientists are most concerned about chronic wasting disease in deer. The neurological disorder is fatal, and exposure cannot be detected until shortly before the deer’s death. The disease has spread to herds in 23 states. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports that municipalities that have proposed feeding bans in the past have faced opposition and eventually abandoned the idea after backlash from voters who enjoy the pastime.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state ethics commission has decided to open a formal investigation into Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo’s dealings with the company that runs the state’s lottery. The Rhode Island Republican Party filed a complaint. WPRI-TV reports the commission voted Tuesday to open the investigation. Brandon Bell, special counsel for the party, alleges Raimondo violated state law by negotiating and entering into a tentative agreement with International Game Technology to extend its services until 2043 without going through a competitive bid process. Jonathan Berkon, a lawyer for Raimondo, says they’re confident the commission will find this “latest partisan complaint has no merit.” Raimondo and legislative leaders announced the proposed terms in June. The deal needs legislative approval.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Population growth and crowded highways have paved the way for a passenger ferry service in the area that’s expected to begin in October. The Post and Courier reports the Daniel Island Ferry is expected to carry up to 49 passengers from a Wando River dock near Children’s Park on Daniel Island to the Charleston Peninsula. There will be stops at the Charleston Maritime Center and Joe Riley Waterfront Park. It won’t be the first time Daniel Island residents have been able to commute by boat to the peninsula, but it would be the first regular commercial ferry service the area has seen in decades. Last year, Charleston Water Taxi temporarily offered a commuter schedule when the James B. Edwards Bridge between Daniel Island and Mount Pleasant was shut down.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: The city is expected to lose more than $2 million in state funding over the next two years following the congressional repeal of South Dakota’s tax on internet service. The 2016 Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act, which required the state to stop taxing internet services by mid-2020, is projected to lead to a $700,000 loss in state funding next year and $1.4 million the following year for Rapid City. The South Dakota Municipal League estimates it will result in a total revenue dip of $7 million to $10 million for all of the state’s municipalities by 2021. The tax applies to retailers that conduct more than $100,000 worth of business in South Dakota annually or more than 200 transactions a year.\n\nTennessee\n\nTownsend: The Great Smoky Mountains National Park has received what it calls a “priceless” donation of Cades Cove artifacts. The cove was a thriving community before the National Park Service began purchasing the land in 1927. Dan and Sidney Lawson were two of its residents. According to the park, Dan Lawson led singing at the Methodist Church, and Sidney Lawson helped to educate children in the cove. Their cabin is preserved as part of the Cades Cove Historic Landscape. Now their great-granddaughter Robin Derryberry, of Chattanooga, has donated a handmade dresser, a family Bible, and wedding and other portraits. Derryberry says her family wants the items to be in a place where they can be enjoyed by the public and preserved for future generations.\n\nTexas\n\nCorpus Christi: NASA is flying drones over the city to test the safety of the unmanned devices in a dense urban environment. The tests this month in Corpus Christi are part of a four-year project with the Federal Aviation Administration to develop a national drone traffic management system. NASA says in a news release that the drones are flying at altitudes between 200 and 400 feet. It says a city presents obstacles that can reduce line of sight and hinder communication. Urban weather conditions can hamper flight, and cities often lack safe landing options. NASA spokesman Darryl Waller said Tuesday that the agency is gathering and reviewing data with the aim of addressing these issues. He said the Corpus Christi testing has gone well and will conclude Friday.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is reminding members that coffee is prohibited no matter how fancy the name, that vaping is banned despite the alluring flavors and that marijuana is outlawed unless prescribed by a competent doctor. The new guidance in the August issue of a youth magazine for members of the Utah-based church doesn’t include any fundamental changes to the religion’s strict health code. But the significant clarifications seem to reflect growing concern about young Latter-day Saints’ adherence to the rules. The article says it aims to clarify issues that could be confusing to young people about the religion’s “Word of Wisdom,” a set of rules about foods and drinks. The article warns that drinks with names that include the terms cafe, caffe, mocha, latte or espresso or that end in -ccino usually have coffee in them.\n\nVermont\n\nRutland: The Vermont Agency of Transportation is planning to start a program to provide residents in recovery with transportation assistance. Ross MacDonald, public transit coordinator for the agency, says the program will be first introduced in Rutland and the Northeast Kingdom and will work in cooperation with recovery centers and transportation providers. The goal is to help residents having trouble getting to treatment appointments or to and from their employment. The Rutland Herald reports the recovery centers will contact the regional transit center for clients to see if any trip costs are covered through eligible health care programs. If it is not covered, the recovery center will use its allocation and budget to pay for the trip. The Federal Transit Administration has provided $160,000 to fund the program.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: The city is suing the state in an attempt to remove an 80-foot Confederate monument from its downtown. The city of Norfolk’s suit, filed in federal court, targets a Virginia law that prevents the removal of war memorials. The suit claims the city’s free speech rights are being violated because it’s being forced to project a message it no longer supports. The 1907 monument was erected at a time when the South was being romanticized and slavery was de-emphasized. Council members voted in 2017 to move the monument to a cemetery. University of Virginia law professor Richard Schragger said Norfolk is employing a relatively novel and untested legal strategy in federal court. The main legal question is whether cities have free speech rights.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A new federal lawsuit seeks to establish a “protection zone” for endangered orcas in the Pacific Northwest. The Center for Biological Diversity and the Orca Relief Citizens’ Alliance sued NOAA Fisheries in U.S. District Court in Seattle, saying the agency has failed to act on a petition it filed in 2016 that sought to bar vessels from a 10- to 12-square-mile area west of San Juan Island where the orcas feed from April through September each year. Canada has already announced that no vessel traffic will be allowed from June through October in three sanctuary zones in prime orca feeding habitat. Advocates say vessel noise interferes with the echolocation the orcas use to hunt. The whales are struggling with a dearth of their preferred prey, Chinook salmon.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Can a governor be forced to live in the capital city? A persistent lawsuit seeking to do just that with Gov. Jim Justice was back in a courtroom Wednesday. The Republican billionaire has been frequently criticized by members of both major parties for being absent from the statehouse. A Democratic lawmaker’s lawsuits have accused Justice of violating a passage of the state Constitution that says the governor “shall reside at the seat of government.” The result has been a legal back-and-forth on the definition of the word “reside.” There are also issues on the authority and ability of the courts to chaperone the whereabouts of the state’s chief executive. Wednesday’s hearing rehashed some of those questions. After a short discussion, a circuit court judge extended the case by asking for more documents from Justice’s legal team and Del. Isaac Sponaugle, who filed the suit.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The Milwaukee Bucks now have an official team chocolate milk. The Bucks and the state’s cult-favorite gas station and convenience store Kwik Trip partnered up on the chocolate milk, the pair announced in a news release Wednesday. The chocolate milk with a green label and Milwaukee Bucks logo will be available at all Wisconsin Kwik Trip locations beginning Oct. 1. The team’s official milk will also be served at the Bucks’ training center and the Froedtert & the Medical College of Wisconsin Sports Science Center. The 16-ounce bottles come in 1% and whole milk. The milk comes from Kwik Trip’s Nature’s Touch brand. Kwik Trip is also becoming the presenting partner of Bucks Sundays at Fiserv Forum during the 2019-20 season.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A draft bill has been passed that would make it easier for indigenous people in the state to vote. The Casper Star-Tribune reports the state’s Select Committee on Tribal Relations passed draft bill language Monday and asked the Corporations, Elections & Political Subdivisions Committee to sponsor the legislation this fall. State lawmakers say the proposed bill would allow driver’s license numbers and Social Security numbers to be printed on tribal ID cards, allowing tribal citizens to use one card when registering to vote. Officials say federal law states a tribal ID can currently be used to vote if presented with a driver’s license number or the last four digits of a Social Security number.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/09/20/three-mile-island-hawaiian-sirens-roundabout-record-news-around-states/40175521/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: The state historical commission apparently will retain control of the last U.S. slave ship, the Clotilda. The deadline has passed for any potential owners to claim the wreckage of the wooden schooner, which was burned near Mobile after illegally bringing about 110 captives to Alabama from Africa in 1860. Because no one claimed the ship’s remains, the state can now move forward in federal court to take permanent possession. Researchers identified the wreckage of the ship earlier this year north of Mobile. Officials say they’re unsure how much of the Clotilda remains, but they believe at least some of the hull could be intact in the muddy bottom of the Mobile River near an island. It’s unclear what might be done with the wreckage or whether it can be raised.\n\nAlaska\n\nHomer: A pastor wearing a colander on his head offered the opening prayer on behalf of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster to open a local government meeting, the latest blessing from a nontraditional church since a court ruling. Barrett Fletcher, the Pastafarian pastor, noted the duties performed by the members of the Kenai Peninsula Borough Assembly in his Tuesday message, adding a few of them “seem to feel they can’t do the work without being overseen by a higher authority, “ Kenai radio station KSRM reports. “So I’m called to invoke the power of the true inebriated creator of the universe, the drunken tolerator of the all lesser and more recent gods, and maintainer of gravity here on earth. May the great Flying Spaghetti Monster rouse himself from his stupor and let his noodly appendages ground each assembly member in their seats,” Fletcher said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Progressive Democrats want their party to censure Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, saying she’s not standing up to President Donald Trump. Dan O’Neal of the Arizona Democratic Party Progressive Caucus told ABC15 that the party’s liberal wing wants Sinema “to vote like a Democrat rather than supporting Trump half the time.” A proposed censure resolution cites Sinema’s vote to confirm Trump’s Cabinet appointees, including Attorney General William Barr and Interior Secretary David Bernhardt. It also cites her failure to support “net neutrality” legislation that requires internet companies to treat content equally. Sinema was a liberal member of the Arizona Legislature but has moved closer to the political center as a member of Congress. Democratic state committee members may consider the resolution at a meeting Saturday.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The City Board is extending a program that pays minimum wage to homeless people who pick up litter. KATV reports that the board’s unanimous vote Tuesday approved an ordinance for $160,000 to fund the Bridge to Work program for one more year to determine its effectiveness. The money will pay for wages, transportation and supplies. The initiative that began six months ago aims to help homeless people in Little Rock. More than 450 participants have so far cleaned up 130 sites, gathering over 2,000 bags of trash. The Canvas Community Church, which runs the program, says 13 people have landed full-time jobs since the program began. City board member Kathy Webb says the program is exciting because it gives people the opportunity to work and move into homes.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The University of California is dumping fossil fuel investments from its nearly $84 billion pension and endowment funds, calling them a financial risk. An opinion article in the Los Angeles Times says UC will make its endowment fund “fossil free” by month’s end, and its pension fund – which covers 320,000 people – will soon follow. The article was written by the university’s treasurer and the chair of its Board of Regents Investment Committee. A global campaign for universities and other organizations to disinvest has been waged by climate activists for nearly a decade, but the article says the decision was made for financial rather than political reasons. The article says UC is placing bets “that clean energy will fuel the world’s future.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The mayor is proposing to set a $15-an-hour minimum wage in the city by 2021. The Denver Post reports Mayor Michael Hancock and Councilwoman Robin Kneich were formally announcing the proposal Thursday. The full City Council would have to approve before it becomes official. The statewide minimum is $11.10, rising to $12 next year. A new state law allows cities to set their own rates. The federal minimum is $7.25, but the U.S. Department of Labor says 29 states and the District of Columbia have higher rates, up to $14. The Denver proposal would reach the $15 amount in two steps, at the beginning of 2020 and 2021. Hancock already has raised the minimum wage for city employees and contractors to $15 an hour.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: A police officer says in a lawsuit that he was discriminated against by his department because of his facial tattoos. The New Haven Register reports Officer Jason Bandy sued city police this week. His attorney says the department has “no rules, regulations or policies” regarding tattoos or body art, and no women in the department have been disciplined because of piercings, makeup, jewelry or other items. Chief Otoniel Reyes said the department cannot comment on personnel matters or on pending litigation. The former chief recommended firing Bandy because the tattoos violated a general order requiring officers to “present a neat and clean appearance.” Bandy agreed to cover the tattoos while on duty. According to a previous Register story, the tattoos include a Latin phrase, date and the letter “D.”\n\nDelaware\n\nNewark: Christiana Care Health System, the state’s largest private employer, will begin offering paid parental leave to its employees for the first time. Christiana officials announced Wednesday that the system will grant at least 12 weeks of paid parental leave to its 12,000 employees for parents to use during the birth, adoption or fostering of their child. Employees told the news outlet that they previously had to use paid time off, disability leave, and benefits from the Family and Medical Leave Act, a federal law that entitles employees to 12 weeks of unpaid leave. Last year the Delaware General Assembly passed legislation granting state employees 12 weeks of paid family leave. The state government is Delaware’s largest employer.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: An organization advocating for low-wage immigrants has filed a legal challenge to a Trump administration rule that may deny green cards to immigrants who use public services. Georgetown Law School’s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection and CASA filed a legal challenge in U.S. federal court this week. Lawyers say changes to the so-called public charge rule violate due process under the U.S. Constitution. Federal law already requires those seeking to become permanent residents or gain legal status to prove they will not be a burden to the U.S. – a “public charge,” in government speak. But the new rules detail a broader range of programs that could disqualify them, including Medicaid, food stamps and housing vouchers.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Florida Power & Light plans to install 1,000 electric-charging stations at 100 locations across the state. The utility says the stations would be located on major roadways; at public parks, shopping malls and tourist destinations; and at major employers, such as Office Depot in Boca Raton. FPL spokeswoman Alys Daly told the South Florida SunSentinel she didn’t have a cost estimate. The charging stations would go through regulatory approval in Tallahassee as part of a future cost-recovery filing with the Florida Public Service Commission. The company’s chargers are universal, compatible with all electric cars, as well as plug-in hybrids. President and CEO Eric Silagy said it’s part of the company’s plan to move toward more sustainable energy sources.\n\nGeorgia\n\nJekyll Island: Coastal Georgia is gearing up for its annual food festival dedicated to deciding who cooks the state’s best shrimp and grits. Organizers expect more than 45,000 visitors for the Jekyll Island Shrimp & Grits Festival that kicks off Friday. The festival’s main attraction is a Saturday showdown between chefs from eight Georgia restaurants in a contest of shrimp-and-grits recipes. This year’s kitchen battle features returning champions from Eagle Creek Brewing Company of Statesboro and Atlanta’s West Egg Cafe. The weekend at Jekyll Island also includes a craft brew fest, an artists’ market and a kids’ zone. Attendees looking to burn off their extra calories will have a chance as the festival hosts its first 5K road race on a course through Jekyll Island’s historic district.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Officials say emergency sirens were accidentally activated on Oahu during a police training exercise. The Hawaii Emergency Management Agency said Wednesday that the sirens went off during Honolulu Police Department training. Police issued an alert shortly after the 5 p.m. false alarm saying there was no emergency. Residents heard the siren in areas near downtown Honolulu. The episode echoed the moment last year when the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency mistakenly sent an alert about an incoming ballistic missile to cellphones and broadcast stations in Hawaii. The agency didn’t trigger emergency sirens during the false missile alert, though some military bases turned on theirs. The false missile alert was also issued during a training exercise.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: State health officials say a cat has tested positive for rabies for the first time in 27 years. The Department of Health and Welfare says the cat in Owyhee County was behaving aggressively and bit its owner. It tested positive for a strain of rabies normally associated with bats. The department’s state public health veterinarian, Dr. Leslie Tengelsen, said in a prepared statement that rabies is fatal virtually 100% of the time. She said the cat was likely exposed to a rabid bat, and that’s how it became infected. Tengelsen said pet owners should vaccinate their dogs, cats, ferrets and horses against the disease. Ten bats have tested positive for rabies in Idaho this year.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Four Wheaton College students have sued the city, claiming rules for a popular park undercut the First Amendment’s guarantees of freedom of speech and free exercise of religion. Earlier this year, Chicago’s Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events divided Millennium Park into 11 sections and prohibited “the making of speeches and passing out of written communications” in 10 of them. Millennium Park is home to Cloud Gate, better known as The Bean, by British artist Anish Kapoor. Plaintiffs’ attorney John Mauck says because it is a major tourist attraction, “that’s where you want to get your message out.” Chicago Law Department spokesman Bill McCaffrey says Millennium Park rules “protect First Amendment rights while also respecting the rights of patrons to use and enjoy the park.”\n\nIndiana\n\nCarmel: Dave Schweikert has been going around in circles for weeks – training to break a record and ride his bicycle around a roundabout for 24 hours straight. His Friday ride will be the last of a series of events hosted by the city in celebration of National Roundabout Week, set by the Federal Highway Administration. Schweikert’s long trip to nowhere is for a good cause: The 51-year-old Noblesville resident hopes to raise money for World Bicycle Relief. The international nonprofit organization focuses on large-scale, comprehensive bicycle distribution programs to aid poverty relief in developing countries around the world. Schweikert’s ride is set for 7 p.m. at Carmel’s first roundabout at Main Street and River Road. He hopes to finish by 7 p.m. Saturday.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: More than 200 scientists from 38 colleges and universities in the state have signed on to a climate change statement that warns of “sobering extreme heat projections” for the Midwest that will put people, livestock and pets at risk. The statement released Wednesday says the World Meteorological Association identified July as the hottest month in more than 140 years of record-keeping. The scientists say the atmosphere and earth’s surface are warming at an unprecedented rate, and by mid-century temperatures in Iowa will exceed 90 degrees for 67 days per year, compared to the average of 23 days in recent decades. Peter Thorne, director of the University of Iowa Environmental Health Sciences Research Center, says adaptations will include expanded disaster preparedness, increased energy use, and curtailment of outdoor work and recreation during times of extreme heat.\n\nKansas\n\nOverland Park: A Johnson County school district has voted to add LGBTQ protections to its nondiscrimination policy. The Shawnee Mission school board voted unanimously Monday night to adopt the LGBTQ language. It joins nearby districts in Olathe, Blue Valley and De Soto, who have added similar language. The Kansas City Star reports the vote came after 10 residents spoke against changing the policy, while a handful of others supported the proposal. Board member Deb Zila said she believed the change reflected the district’s practice of welcoming all children and trying to accommodate them as best it can. Opponents said they feared that schools are teaching students about sexuality at too young of an age or that transgender students might be allowed to use the bathroom of their choice.\n\nKentucky\n\nElizabethtown: Officials say this central Kentucky city is set to become the state’s first urban trail town. The News-Enterprise reports the title will go to Elizabethtown for its Greenbelt Trails system, and officials plan to recognize the accomplishment with a ceremony Oct. 1. Elizabethtown Trail Town Advisory Board member Matt Deneen says the state Department of Tourism developed the new classification as a blueprint for expanding its Trail Town program into urban centers around Kentucky. Most communities now in the Trail Town program are in the state’s coal fields. The program was originally designed to help promote adventure tourism in rural communities, but now it is moving into urban areas. Elizabethtown’s Greenbelt Trails network features 16 trails, including the Freeman Lake Trail.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The federal government has declared agricultural disasters in two of the state’s parishes because of floods during the past year. A news release Wednesday says farmers in another 11 adjacent parishes can also apply for low-interest emergency loans. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue says flooding between Sept. 1, 2018, and July 17 made Catahoula Parish a primary disaster area. Farmers and ranchers in Avoyelles, Caldwell, Concordia, Franklin, LaSalle and Tensas can also apply for Farm Service Agency loans to recover from those floods. Vermilion Parish received the designation for rain and floods June 5-15. Adjacent parishes under that declaration are Acadia, Cameron, Iberia, Jefferson Davis and Lafayette.\n\nMaine\n\nDover-Foxcroft: The director of the Baxter State Park Authority is floating the idea dropping the “Mount” from “Mount Katahdin.” Eben Sypitkowski told Piscataquis County Commissioners in an email that Katahdin gets its name from an Abenaki or Penobscot term that means “greatest mountain.” Therefore, he said, there’s no need for the word “Mount.” He said that’s redundant, like calling it “Mount Greatest Mountain.” He wrote that he applied to the USGS Board of Geographic Names for a name change of the summit. He said he wanted feedback on a township that also bears the Mount Katahdin name. The proposal was met with skepticism. Chairman James White said Thursday the commissioners aren’t convinced the change is necessary – especially considering the cost of changing maps and signs.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Motorists are being told to expect major delays on the Bay Bridge starting next week as a deck rehabilitation project gets underway. The Maryland Department of Transportation says in a news release that two-way operations on the westbound span will cease Tuesday in preparation for the Maryland Transportation Authority’s $27 million deck rehabilitation project. The authority had scheduled the work to begin earlier this month, but Gov. Larry Hogan worked with the contractor to maintain three westbound lanes for commuters and beachgoers through the last weekend of the month. That will help travelers attending events including this weekend’s Sunfest celebration in Ocean City. It’s expected to reopen in time for the 2020 summer travel season.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The number of prison inmates in the state placed in solitary confinement remains “staggeringly high,” according to a prisoners’ rights advocate, despite an overall drop in the number of people behind bars. The Boston Globe reports at least 2,100 prisoners were placed in isolation one or more times last year, according to biannual reports from the Massachusetts Department of Correction. Inmates in isolation, which the department calls “restrictive housing,” are allowed outside their cell one hour a day, five days a week. James Pingeon, a staff attorney with Prisoners’ Legal Services, called the number “staggeringly high” and said many people are placed in solitary for minor infractions. Prisons officials said last year’s figures do not reflect the changes they’ve made to isolation policies since criminal justice overhaul was signed into law in April 2018.\n\nMichigan\n\nMackinac Island:Could it be a fear of horses? Buzz is rampant on the island that Vice President Mike Pence plans to break with a century-old tradition barring motorized vehicles and ride to the Grand Hotel aboard a Chevrolet Suburban SUV on Saturday. Pence is a scheduled speaker at this weekend’s Mackinac Republican Leadership Conference, held every other year on the island. He is the first sitting vice president to speak at the conference, first held in 1953. Gerald Ford, Harry Truman, John F. Kennedy, George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton have all gone to Mackinac, mostly before or after their time in the White House, and they all got around by horse-drawn carriage. Pence’s purported break with precedent for island visitors comes just days after he reportedly told House Republicans that last year Triple Crown winner American Pharaoh bit him so hard on the arm that he “almost collapsed.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The Minnesota Court of Appeals has handed environmental groups a victory by suspending two key permits for a planned PolyMet copper-nickel mine ahead of a hearing next month. The appeals court put PolyMet’s dam safety permit and its permit to mine on hold, ruling Wednesday that the Department of Natural Resources failed to adequately consider two important developments that happened after the agency issued the permits in November 2018. One was the massive failure of a tailings basin dam at an iron mine in Brazil in January that was somewhat similar to the dam PolyMet plans to build near Hoyt Lakes, in the Iron Range about 190 miles northeast of Minneapolis. The other is the acquisition of a majority stake in PolyMet by the Swiss commodities giant Glencore in June, Minnesota Public Radio reports.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state’s alligator program coordinator says great weather, high water and increasing expertise made for a good alligator season in public waters. Ricky Flynt of the state Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks says hunters took 918 alligators from public waters this year. That’s 153 more than last year. The state record of 982 was set in 2015, when 997 hunters and guests went out, and nearly 70% of the groups harvested at least one alligator. With 816 permit holders and their guests participating this year, about 75% of the groups brought in at least one alligator. Paul Edwards of Okolona and five guests tied a state record by catching a 10-foot-long female. The 10-day public harvest ended Sept. 9. The private lands season runs until 6 a.m. Monday.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: Longtime University of Missouri professor Michael Budds has donated $4 million for a music studies center at the university. The university announced Wednesday that his donation will be used to create the Budds Center for American Music Studies. Budds taught music at the university for nearly four decades until retiring as a full-time faculty member this year. He teaches one class per semester. Budds was inducted into the Missouri Music Hall of Fame in 2014. The Columbia Missourian reports Budds is the last surviving member of his immediate family and said the center is a way to memorialize his parents and siblings. The center in the Fine Arts Building in the music school will promote American music through research and performance and will collect music memorabilia and academic material for research.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: National Park Service officials say motorized electric bicycles are now allowed in Yellowstone, Grand Teton and Glacier national parks, along with Wyoming’s National Elk Refuge. The joint announcement Thursday follows an order signed late last month by Interior Secretary David Bernhardt allowing the pedal bicycles with electric motors wherever traditional bikes can go in national parks. The guidelines posted on the Yellowstone, Glacier and Grand Teton websites say e-bikes and traditional bicycles are barred from boardwalks, snow routes and nearly all backcountry trails. E-bikes can reach speeds of 28 mph or higher. Outdoor and conservation groups have objected to allowing them in parks without additional study or public notice.\n\nNebraska\n\nAtkinson: A boy with brain cancer who scored a touchdown at a Nebraska practice game is playing football for real. Thirteen-year-old Jack Hoffman took the field Monday to play center for his junior high team in Atkinson, located 179 miles northwest of Omaha. Hoffman underwent chemotherapy after being diagnosed with cancer in 2011. In 2013, he drew national attention when he ran for a player-assisted, 69-yard touchdown in the Huskers’ spring game. Andy Hoffman says his son relapsed in 2014 and participated in a clinical trial that helped. The tumor worsened in 2018, so now Jack is back in a clinical trial. Jack wanted to play football, so his parents checked with doctors, who said it was their decision. The Hoffmans finally left it up to the eighth grader.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Mayor Hillary Schieve has announced an ambitious plan to jump-start the construction of 1,000 homes in 120 days. Schieve said Wednesday that the pilot program would help combat the city’s housing crisis by deferring fees the city charges for such things as sewer hookups and road infrastructure until the back end of the project. The deferrals would be provided as loans worth $8,400 per unit to be repaid under a predetermined agreement with the city. Eligible developers must have already completed construction of at least one multifamily housing project worth at least $10 million. They also must plan to build a minimum of 30 townhouses, apartments or condominiums in designated “opportunity zones” and begin construction within 18 months of execution of the city agreement.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Medical marijuana patients in the state soon will be able to get prescriptions even if they haven’t had the same doctor for three months. Republican Gov. Chris Sununu vetoed a bill to eliminate the waiting period last month, but both the House and Senate voted Thursday to override his veto. In his veto message, Sununu said current law allows patients to obtain appropriate treatment while preserving responsible prescribing. But lawmakers who support the bill argued that it was unfair to make patients wait three months when no such rules apply to far more dangerous drugs, including opioids.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJersey City: The city is announcing a partnership with ride-hailing service Via to offer on-demand bus service. Mayor Steven Fulop says it’s a response to unreliable service by New Jersey Transit, adding that it’s the first partnership of its kind in New Jersey. Riders will be able to request a bus from their smartphone and be picked up at a nearby “virtual” bus stop. Service will run Monday through Friday and cost $2 per ride, with discounts for senior citizens and low-income residents. NJ Transit currently operates 20 bus routes in Jersey City as well as light rail service. A spokeswoman said Thursday that the agency has expanded bus service in Jersey City in recent years to meet increasing demand.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state would eliminate tuition and fees for in-state undergraduate and community college students of all ages under a proposal from Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham that requires legislative approval. The “opportunity scholarship” would tap the state general fund to cover costs not already paid for by federal scholarships and local lottery proceeds, a so-called last-dollar approach used by a handful of states that offer more limited free tuition. “By making college significantly more accessible to New Mexicans of every income, of every background, of every age, we are putting students first,” Lujan Grisham said in a statement. “We are creating meaningful opportunity for all.” Free tuition would be available at continuing education programs for older students who return to school but not for graduate studies such as medical or law school.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: There’s a new push to ban those tiny bottles of shampoo, conditioner and bath gel from hotel rooms across the state. State Sen. Todd Kaminsky announced his legislative proposal Wednesday, calling single-use toiletry bottles a big source of plastic waste. The Long Island Democrat cited estimates that hotels in New York City alone dispose of an estimated 27 million plastic toiletry bottles annually. If the ban were enacted, hotels could instead use wall-mounted dispensers or packaging made from non-plastic materials. The idea is gaining support in the industry, with the Hotel Association of New York City and the state Hospitality and Tourism Association both backing Kaminsky’s idea. Last month Marriott International, the world’s largest hotel chain, announced plans to eliminate small plastic toiletry bottles worldwide by December 2020.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nChapel Hill: The Trump administration is threatening to cut a grant for a Middle East studies program run by the University of North Carolina and Duke University. The administration says the program misuses federal funds to advance “ideological priorities” and unfairly promotes “the positive aspects of Islam” but not Christianity or Judaism. A recent letter from the Education Department orders the Duke-UNC Consortium for Middle East Studies to revise its offerings by Sunday or risk losing funding from the National Resource Center program. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos ordered an investigation following complaints that the consortium hosted a taxpayer-funded conference with an anti-Israeli bias. The department objects to some of the consortium’s offerings and says it has a “lack of balance” in its teachings on religion.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The North Dakota Department of Health says more people in the state are using child car seats correctly. Data compiled by health officials shows 72% of those with car seats were using them improperly in 2018. That figure is actually an improvement and compares with 86% in 2009. In the past five years in North Dakota, 8 children have died and 1,037 youngsters 12 and younger were injured in motor vehicle crashes. The health department recommends keeping children in rear-facing car seats for as long as possible. Once a child outgrows the rear-facing seats, a forward-facing car seat with a harness should be used. And, after outgrowing the forward-facing seat, children should be placed in a booster seat until they are the right size to use just a seat belt.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: On the eve of the city’s boisterous annual Oktoberfest celebration, hundreds of people, some covered in fake blood, and first responders rehearsed for the worst – a terror attack in the riverside entertainment area. The morning-long exercise Thursday at The Banks area and at Great American Ball Park, where the Cincinnati Reds play, used a scenario of a large truck carrying chemicals and crashing into a crowd. Regional emergency management agencies, first responders and hospitals took part in the large-scale exercise. West Clermont High School students applied moulage to casualty actors from area colleges. The Oktoberfest Zinzinnati is expected to draw about half a million people this weekend. A kick-off event, the “running of the wieners” dachshund race), was set for a couple of hours after the mass casualty training.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: State Department of Corrections officials said Wednesday that numerous weapons, cellphones and drugs have been found by investigators following a series of apparently coordinated fights at six state prisons that left one inmate dead, dozens injured and prisons statewide locked down. “A lot of shanks … broken broom handles, broken faucets, faucet heads that have a cord attached to them,” according to department spokesman Matt Elliott. “The types of weapons inmates typically use and fight with.” Bobby Cleveland, director of the Oklahoma Corrections Professionals, an association for prison employees, said the fights had “to be a coordinated effort,” noting they included minimum security lock-ups. Cleveland said inmates can use contraband cellphones to coordinate attacks among prisoners at other facilities.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Newly released scores from this spring show the state’s schools have recorded their poorest performance in the five-year history of Oregon’s current reading, writing and math tests. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports the scores released Thursday indicate only 40% of students across grades three through eight have mastered math, and just over half can read and write proficiently. So many high school students sat out the nationally benchmarked tests, known as Smarter Balanced exams, that their results, which were down sharply in reading and writing, are not reliable. State schools chief Colt Gill cautioned against reading too much into the test results, noting that an in-depth end-of-year test on reading, writing and math doesn’t capture the breadth of subjects that students should learn in a well-rounded curriculum.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The shutdown of Three Mile Island, site of the United States’ worst commercial nuclear power accident, is imminent. Exelon Corp. officials said the plant will stop producing electricity around noon Friday, following through on a decision the Chicago-based energy giant made in May after it became clear that it would not get a financial rescue from Pennsylvania. Three Mile Island’s Unit 1 opened in 1974 and is licensed to operate through 2034. But Exelon has complained that the plant is losing money in competitive electricity markets. Three Mile Island also faces particularly difficult economics because the 1979 accident left it with just one reactor. Decommissioning it could take decades. No nuclear plant that was proposed after the accident has been successfully completed and put into operation in the United States.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNorth Kingstown: A study from Bryant University shows businesses at the massive Quonset Business Park have pumped $4.3 billion into Rhode Island’s economy. The economic assessment also showed the more than 200 companies located inside the former Navy base are responsible for 17% of the manufacturing jobs in the state. About 12,000 people are employed at the business park, with 6,800 directly involved in manufacturing. The Bryant study, which was commissioned and funded by the Quonset Development Corporation, showed the average wage of an employee at Quonset is $59,235, well above the state’s average of $49,795. The study found those wages created nearly $1.3 billion in income for Rhode Island households in 2018.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: State officials say a growing drought is threatening to devastate farmers, and they worry dry conditions will spread. A special committee that reviews drought voted Wednesday to place 31 of South Carolina’s 46 counties into a moderate drought – the second in four worsening stages. The vote came after the Drought Response Committee had a long discussion on whether to advance some counties to severe drought based on crop damage. Chris Toole says it has barely rained in two months at his farm in Orangeburg County, and he expects to lose half his corn, cotton and peanuts. Officials say water levels in streams and reservoirs are still OK.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nChamberlain: Fees to enter and use the state’s parks may be increasing. The South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks Commission is seeking comments from the public about proposed increases to state park and camping fees as the park system faces $8 million in flood damage, which includes tree damage, shorted electrical pedestals, and washed-out roads and campsites, according to GFP. The increase in fees would provide about $3 million in additional revenue. GFP is proposing to increase the daily park entrance fee from $6 to $8 and the annual park entrance pass from $30 to $36. The commission is expected to vote on the increase during its meeting Oct. 3-4 in Chamberlain. Comments can be submitted at least 72 hours prior to the meeting online.\n\nTennessee\n\nKnoxville: The University of Tennessee will set up a livestream at a rock that’s often painted by students to promote events but was recently marred by an anti-Semitic message. Knoxville campus Chancellor Donde Plowman wrote Wednesday that the livestream feed will be made available for anyone to see, showing that the university community is taking collective responsibility for the Rock. Plowman wrote that university police have increased patrols at the campus landmark, adding that they believe the people responsible for the hate speech written there are not students or members of the campus community. Plowman wrote that the university has revised its campus space rental policy to restrict rentals to unaffiliated third parties. Additionally, a new group, programs and special lectures are in the works to further awareness.\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso: The FBI is offering a reward to help identify suspects in arson fires at three Catholic churches in the area. Authorities say St. Matthew Catholic Church, St. Patrick Cathedral and St. Jude Catholic Church were targeted with incendiary devices in an attempt to start fires at the churches in May and June. The churches were damaged, but no one was injured. The FBI said Thursday that it’s offering a $5,000 reward in the case. The churches serve a primarily Hispanic community still reeling from a mass shooting targeting Latinos in which 22 people were killed at an El Paso Walmart last month.\n\nUtah\n\nOrem: Police used their vehicle sirens to drive a 2-year-old bear up a tree after its presence in a northern Utah town caused traffic delays Wednesday morning. State Division of Wildlife Resources spokeswoman Faith Heaton Jolley said division personnel then were able to tranquilize the bear and catch it in a large net when it fell out of the tree. Jolley said the brown-colored black bear was placed in a trap in the bed of a pickup truck and driven to the Wasatch Mountains, where it was released. Pictures show him jumping out of the truck and running away. Jolley says it is unusual for a bear to be roaming city streets that are several miles away from mountains east of the city where wildlife biologists think it came from.\n\nVermont\n\nSouth Burlington: The first two of what will become 20 F-35 fighter aircrafts arrived Thursday at the Vermont Air National Guard, the first guard unit to receive the next-generation fighter. The aircraft will be based at the Burlington International Airport. The delivery follows years of hard work and planning. “The F-35 coming into Burlington really secures our mission and our future,” says Col. David Smith, the commander of the 158th Fighter Wing that is the new home to the F-35s. But for some members of the community, the arrival of noisier aircraft marks the failure of years long efforts to keep the Air Force from delivering the planes to an airport located among residential neighborhoods in the middle of Vermont’s most populous county.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Dominion Energy announced plans Thursday to seek approval to build what it says would be the largest offshore wind project in the United States off the Virginia coast. The company says the project would include about 220 wind turbines in federal waters it has already leased 27 miles off Virginia Beach. If approved as proposed, Dominion says the approximately $7.8 billion project could produce more than 2,600 megawatts of energy during peak wind by 2026, enough to power 650,000 homes. “This is, to us, big news. It’s a big step for us to accomplish our carbon reduction goals,” says Mark Mitchell, vice president of generation construction for Richmond-based Dominion. The project has been years in the making. Dominion already has an offshore wind pilot project underway, which state regulators approved last year despite their concerns about its cost.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: U.S. protections for the waters that a group of endangered orcas call home could soon expand beyond the Seattle area to encompass much of the West Coast. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued a proposal Wednesday to increase the critical habitat designation for southern resident killer whales by more than sevenfold under the Endangered Species Act. Just 73 orcas remain in the Pacific Northwest population, the lowest number in more than three decades. The latest proposal calls for an additional 15,626 square miles of federally protected habitat that would run from the border with Canada down south to Point Sur, California.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nBuckhannon: A federal biologist says federally protected vultures are invading the state, having migrated from Central and South America about 45 years ago and now settling up the East Coast. Thomas Elliott is a wildlife biologist and district supervisor with the wildlife services program of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. The Inter-Mountain quotes him as saying the birds first appeared in eastern West Virginia about 15 years ago and have spread across the state. Black vultures are predatory creatures with some scavenging tendencies. Elliott says the birds kill livestock and pets and destroy people’s property, even ripping rubber off tires. He says the vultures have no true predator.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state’s schools chief says a nearly $600 million boost in education funding is a “down payment” on equity and closing the state’s persistent achievement gap. State Superintendent Carolyn Stanford Taylor calls that gap a “crisis.” She delivered the message Thursday during her first state of education address at the Capitol. Taylor took over as state superintendent after her predecessor, Tony Evers, was elected governor. The speech comes a week after standardized test scores showed that less than half of Wisconsin students are proficient in math and English. The scores also showed a continuing achievement gap. Stanford Taylor says progress is being made to address “deep, persistent gaps in achievement, access and opportunity.” Democrats say the poor test results showed the need to increase funding for K-12 schools, while Republicans say they showed that the status quo was not working.\n\nWyoming\n\nPinedale: Lawmakers have voted to advance a bill raising the state minimum age to purchase tobacco products to 21 years. The Casper Star-Tribune reports that lawmakers aim to limit minors’ access to tobacco products, including cigarettes, cigars, chewable tobacco and nicotine-infused vapor products. Officials say the bill was one of several being considered by lawmakers Wednesday, but it also requires approval of the full Legislature. State lawmakers say currently people age 18 and older are allowed to purchase tobacco products. Officials say 18 states have risen their minimum smoking age to 21 with some exemptions for military members. Officials say enforcing existing laws and a higher purchase age could be effective at discouraging young people from purchasing products illegally. Officials say 95% of smokers start before the age of 21.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/phoenix-breaking/2021/11/01/arizona-prison-health-care-trial-jensen-v-shinn/6243559001/", "title": "Arizona prison health care trial: Daily updates on Jensen v. Shinn", "text": "The landmark trial Jensen v. Shinn began Nov. 1 in Phoenix, the latest chapter in an almost decade-long struggle to determine whether Arizona’s prisoners are getting the basic health care they are entitled to under the law.\n\nThe federal trial pits Arizona against the people held in its prisons, who argue in a class-action lawsuit that the medical services they receive are so poor, they constitute cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nThe state’s health care contractor, Centurion, is the latest in a string of companies that have failed to pass muster with the courts.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nNov. 19: Psychiatrist’s rosy assessment of health care system at odds with prisoner testimony\n\nWho testified: Dr. Joseph Penn\n\nDr. Penn is a correctional psychiatrist who manages health care in Texas prisons. He was called as a witness by the defendants. He reviewed health care records and conducted tours to assess the quality of care provided in Arizona prisons.\n\nWhat did he say?\n\nPenn told the court he believed there is appropriate, adequate access to medical care, mental health care and medications in state prisons.\n\nHe acknowledged there was a “breakdown” in the system that led to a prisoner suicide he reviewed.\n\nPenn told the court prison health care staff work with patients to create treatment plans.\n\nPenn said it’s hard to find psychologists to work in the prisons.\n\nHe believes the prison offers more access to counseling than is available to the general public.\n\nPenn said he did not find any evidence in the prison health care system of people recording information or making health care decisions that were beyond their scope of practice or licensure.\n\nHe claimed patients can reach out to a statewide administrator to ask for medicine that is not provided in the Centurion formulary.\n\nPenn told the court he believed security staff attempted to call mental health staff to talk with a patient before using pepper spray on them, but they are not always available.\n\nPenn said the Arizona prison suicide rate, or the number of suicides per 100,000 prisoners, is low compared to other states.\n\nCross-examination\n\nDr. Penn said he charges $8,000 a day to testify in out-of-state cases.\n\nAfter spending the morning speaking glowingly of the National Commission on Correctional Health Care accreditation standards, which he called the “Rolls Royce” of standards, Dr. Penn admitted that he was the board chair of the NCCHC until November 1, 2021.\n\nArizona pays NCCHC to be reviewed and accredited and then pays yearly fees to maintain the accreditation.\n\nDr. Penn said Centurion gives financial support for NCCHC conferences and provides grant funding for the NCCHC. Centurion is Arizona's privatized prison health care contractor.\n\nPlaintiff attorneys read from notes made by Dr. Penn’s consultant, who had reviewed incarcerated patient medical records. Those notes included the following statements: “Died by suicide by hanging. Ambulance team refused to go to patient’s location due to policy and he was brought to medical on a gurney.” “Waiting almost 3 weeks to have psychotic complaints addressed.” “On suicide watch 6/21/19-7/8/19 but saw no psychiatric provider until 7/18/19.”\n\nJudge Silver asked Dr. Penn if he thought it was appropriate that the patient had not been seen by a psychiatric provider. He said that it could be the patient was seen by a mental health worker with a lower level of training and licensure.\n\nWhy it matters\n\nDr. Penn spoke very enthusiastically about the state of health care in Arizona prisons and the accreditation organization by which they are judged. But he later admitted to previously working for that organization less than three weeks ago.\n\n— Jimmy Jenkins\n\nNov. 18: Judge questions use of force on seriously mentally ill prisoner\n\nWho testified: Jeffrey Van Winkle\n\nVan Winkle is the warden of the Florence state prison who oversees operations of maximum custody units. He was called as a witness by the defendants.\n\nWhat did they say?\n\nIn response to the settlement agreement in 2014, he said the prisons put recreation enclosures into maximum custody units, gave prisoners more access to programming and made the windows in the cell doors larger.\n\nVan Winkle said that prisoners in maximum custody have varying amounts of out-of-cell time, access to programming and recreation. The highest custody levels are not guaranteed time out of their cells.\n\nVan Winkle said the prison operates in 12-hour shifts to help with staffing deficiencies.\n\nHe said a pest control service regularly sprays the prisons, but “we do have issues with bugs — we live in farmland out in Florence.” He noted that this summer has been the worst in 22 years. He said they try to “eradicate bugs the best we can.”\n\nHe said prisoners often complain about food portions.\n\nVan Winkle said Dustin Brislan, an incarcerated person who previously testified, made hundreds of complaints about staff retaliation against him through a prisoner hotline. Van Winkle said investigations did not find any merit to those complaints.\n\nCross-examination\n\nJudge Silver asked Van Winkle about the repeated use of force on Rahim Muhammad, an incarcerated person who previously testified about his mental health care treatment in the prisons. Prison staff used pepper spray on Muhammad and shot pepper balls at him more than 40 times, many times while he was committing acts of self-harm. Van Winkle said it is the security staff’s job to keep a prisoner from harming themselves, and chemical spray is a tool they use to stop that behavior. “Obviously it wasn’t working,” Judge Silver said. “Did you go back and tell anyone it wasn’t working?” Van Winkle said he discussed the problem with Centurion staff every day. “They are well aware of it,” he said.\n\nVan Winkle said self-harm incidents are spontaneous, so they don’t always have mental health staff available to treat the prisoner.\n\nVan Winkle said Muhammad’s self-harming behavior was a “spontaneous event,” despite acknowledging it had happened at roughly the same time every day.\n\nPlaintiff attorneys showed Van Winkle prison records that indicated classes and programming had been canceled for days at a time.\n\nVan Winkle said Florence has been understaffed since he began working there in 2016.\n\nDespite out-of-cell time being canceled for prisoners, Van Winkle confirmed the Department was still reporting the hours in compliance records submitted to federal court as though the prisoners had actually been able to leave their cells.\n\nVan Winkle told the judge the Department believes they can count canceled out-of-cell time as compliant with the settlement agreement stipulation if the time was canceled due to staffing shortages.\n\nHe said that necessary signatures were missing from documents attesting that prisoners declined to go to recreation.\n\nWhy it matters\n\nVan Winkle’s testimony further confirmed that state prisons are chronically understaffed. Echoing testimony from a different warden, Van Winkle told the court about discrepancies between actual out-of-cell time being offered to prisoners and what the staff records as out-of-cell time. Judge Silver seemed skeptical of the prisons’ repeated use of pepper spray on Rahim Muhammad.\n\nArizona Department of Corrections Medical Director Grant Phillips’ testimony was cut off at the end of the day. His testimony will resume on Friday.\n\n— Jimmy Jenkins\n\nNov. 17: Prison health care workers confirm low staffing levels\n\nWho testified: Dr. Bobbie Pennington-Stallcup\n\nStallcup is a psychologist and a mental health program director for the Arizona Department of Corrections. She was called to testify by the defendants.\n\nWhat did they say?\n\nStallcup monitors contract requirements with Centurion and ensures DOC practices are in line with national standards.\n\nShe also monitors compliance with court-ordered mental health performance benchmarks.\n\nStallcup reviews cases of incarcerated people who died by suicide to see if the deaths could have been prevented.\n\nAfter noting an increase in self-harm incidents, Stallcup said she developed programming to reduce the behavior among incarcerated people.\n\nWhen incarcerated people arrive at a prison, Stallcup said they are given a mental health intake screening to address their needs.\n\nStallcup said they have increased the number of residential treatment beds, which can provide better mental health care.\n\nStallcup told the court the prison health care system develops a treatment plan for incarcerated patients to address their specific symptoms.\n\nCorrections officers are provided with suicide prevention training, according to Stallcup. She said staff members who work in specialized mental health units receive three additional days of training.\n\nCross-examination\n\nMental health workers at the Eyman complex told Stallcup there was not enough staff to do their jobs properly and she said she was concerned about it.\n\nStallcup expressed concern that Centurion had not fully staffed the health care contract at several prisons.\n\nDuring her employment, Stallcup said there has never been a time when all of the mental health staff positions were completely filled.\n\nStallcup said Centurion provided her with staffing reports that were inaccurate and did not represent the actual number of full-time employees working in the prisons.\n\nThe standout quote\n\n“Staffing is critical. You can have the best plans on Earth, but it doesn’t matter if you don’t have the staff to carry them out.”\n\nWhy it matters\n\nStallcup’s experience and position in the prison health care system give her a valuable perspective, and her testimony made clear that she was concerned about overall staffing levels and the quality of care being provided to patients.\n\nWho testified: Dr. Elijah Jordan\n\nJordan is the Yuma prison medical director for Centurion. He was called to testify by the defendants.\n\nWhat did they say?\n\nJordan said there is one full-time doctor on-site at the Yuma prison.\n\nHe told the court that prisoners are submitting more health needs requests now that they are able to do so with a tablet.\n\nJordan said they treat a lot of patients with diabetes and high blood pressure, as well as cancer.\n\nHe said there is a backlog for patients who need to see a GI specialist.\n\nJordan said the pandemic impacted them at Yuma “dearly,” making it more difficult for patients to access nurses and doctors.\n\nJordan said they have nurses translate for patients who speak other languages.\n\nCross-examination\n\nJordan said he worked as the acting medical director at the Winslow prison at the same time he was the medical director at Yuma.\n\nHe said Yuma is not equipped to handle a patient who needs acute care, and that they do not have an in-patient facility.\n\nJordan said nurses were not using the correct assessment tools with patients.\n\nWhy it matters\n\nJordan admitted he was the medical director of two different prisons at the same time, furthering the case made by plaintiffs that the health care system is understaffed, and it is causing harm to incarcerated patients.\n\nWarden Jeffrey Van Winkle’s testimony was cut off at the end of the day, so he will continue on Thursday.\n\n— Jimmy Jenkins\n\nNov. 16: Corrections director claims prisoners have better access to care than he does\n\nWho testified: David Shinn\n\nShinn is the director of the Arizona Department of Corrections. He is a named defendant, and he was the first witness to testify for the defense.\n\nWhat did he say?\n\nShinn told the court he believes the prison health care system provides greater access to care than services that are available to people in the community.\n\nShinn described corrections as a “challenging business.”\n\nShinn testified that running the Arizona prison system was “by far one of the most challenging assignments I have ever had” in a professional career that he began as a corrections officer in 1991. But Shinn said he had a “tremendous willingness to achieve success and make the lives of the men and women in our custody better.”\n\nWhen asked what he had done to increase the quality of health care in the prisons, Shinn pointed to the addition of staff to the state’s health care monitoring bureau, which oversees the state’s contract with Centurion of Arizona.\n\nDespite its history of performance failures in Arizona, Shinn spoke glowingly of Centurion, saying it had done “an extraordinary job” in general, and specifically during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nShinn said Centurion’s management of the pandemic response had produced “exceptional results,” citing a 99% recovery rate among infected prisoners.\n\nOf Centurion, Shinn said: “There is virtually nothing we will not do to help them succeed.” But when asked how the director was holding the company accountable to live up to its contractual obligations, he had no answers.\n\nCross-examination\n\nShinn admitted that shortages of corrections officers and health care staff were impacting the delivery of care, but he said he was focused on total systemic improvements, instead of individual facilities.\n\nShinn said health care costs for the department had nearly doubled since the privatization of services more than a decade ago, while the prison population has declined. He said the state currently spends approximately $7,700 per prisoner, per year on health care.\n\nShinn confirmed that some prisons have nearly 50% staff vacancy rates, which affects the provision of health care.\n\nShinn told the court he believes being incarcerated in an Arizona prison was one of the safest places to be during the pandemic: “I believe it’s been proven and evidence based — yes.”\n\nThe standout quote\n\n“They often have greater access to care than I do as a private citizen,” Shinn said of the people in Arizona state prisons.\n\nWhy it matters\n\nIn the past, the Department of Corrections has attempted to deflect blame onto its health care contractor. Yet, despite years of continued performance failures, Shinn praised the efforts of its current contractor, Centurion.\n\nBetter care? Arizona Corrections director claims prisoners have better access to health care than he does\n\nWho testified: Larry Gann\n\nGann is an assistant director at the Department of Corrections, where he monitors the department’s contract for health services in the prisons.\n\nWhat did he say?\n\nGann told the court that the department has developed a traveling troubleshooting team that looks at performance measures that different prisons are struggling to meet to help them come into compliance.\n\nHe found that each facility had different processes for achieving court-ordered performance measures and said he has been working to implement a more unified system.\n\nGann said 64% of prisoners in Arizona state prisons are on some kind of medication.\n\nIn fiscal year 2021, Gann said there were 302,000 health needs requests submitted from Arizona state prisons. He said this number increased after the department suspended co-pays during the pandemic.\n\nGann said it has been difficult to find off-site specialty care providers for the department to work with.\n\nEvery prison is laid out differently, which Gann said makes it difficult to establish one staffing model for all of the health care facilities.\n\nGann said it has been difficult to maintain staffing numbers because the prisons are competing with other health care sectors in Arizona as well as with higher-paying offers from other states.\n\nGann told the court that Centurion has paid $17 million in sanctions and $4 million in staffing offsets since the beginning of its contract with the Department of Corrections. The sanctions are for failing performance benchmarks, and the offsets are used to repay the state for unfilled contract positions.\n\nCross-examination\n\nGann acknowledged that the Centurion contract has never been fully staffed.\n\nDespite being in charge of monitoring the contract, Gann said he cannot track the number of full-time health care employees working in the prisons.\n\nGann said the department relies on Centurion to determine how many health care staff members are needed\n\nWhen there isn’t enough health care staff, Gann said people start cutting corners and it can impact proper documentation practices.\n\nGann said the Tucson and Yuma prisons have serious staffing problems and were recently forced to cancel opportunities for prisoners to see a nurse.\n\nHe found some prisons were not properly distributing insulin to diabetic patients.\n\nGann said he is unable to reconcile staffing reports provided by Centurion with payroll records to monitor its contract compliance.\n\nThe standout quote:\n\nGann said he is “not a fan of Centurion’s staffing tracking.”\n\nWhy it matters\n\nGann is in charge of making sure taxpayers are getting their money’s worth out of the prison health care contract, but he testified that he was unable to verify numbers provided by Centurion to hold the company accountable.\n\n— Jimmy Jenkins\n\nNov. 15: Deputy warden testimony casts doubt on DOC records\n\nWho testified: Deputy Warden Lori Stickley\n\nStickley is a Deputy Warden at the Eyman prison complex, SMU-1, which houses prisoners in the highest custody level. She was called as a witness by the plaintiffs.\n\nWhat did they say?\n\nStickley confirmed the Department of Corrections policy of keeping prisoners sentenced to life in prison at the maximum custody level for two years, regardless of their disciplinary record.\n\nWhen prisoners are reclassified, and given a new custody level, Stickley testified they are not always given notice of the change, or if the level remained the same.\n\nStickley testified that critical security staffing positions are often vacant, and the health care system is short staffed, resulting in the cancelation of recreation time and programming for seriously mentally ill people.\n\nThe prison is so understaffed, Stickley said they changed the rules so that officers only were required to conduct wellness checks on prisoners once every hour.\n\nStickley confirmed that her staff was recording prisoners receiving “out of cell time” when they had not actually been allowed to come out of their cells.\n\nPlaintiff attorneys showed Stickley records that indicated prisoners at SMU-1 didn’t receive access to showers and recreation for days at a time. She could not explain records that indicated prisoners had gone for four days without being served dinner.\n\nCross-examination\n\nStickley said some inmates are housed at SMU-1 for their own protection in what is called “protective custody.”\n\nStickley told the court programming was often canceled because Centurion did not have enough staff.\n\nWhy it matters\n\nStickley’s testimony that the prisons were falsely reporting out-of-cell time was a damning admission that casts doubt on the validity of all other prisoner movement records presented by the Department.\n\nWho testified: Deputy Warden Anthony Coleman\n\nColeman is the Deputy Warden of the Rast Unit at the Lewis Prison, which houses high custody level prisoners. Coleman was called as a witness by the plaintiffs.\n\nWhat did they say?\n\nColeman confirmed that some prisoners are transitioned back and forth so much between mental health watch and maximum custody that they are known as “frequent flyers.”\n\nColeman told the court that there is no Department of Corrections policy that prevents severely mentally ill people from being held in maximum custody.\n\nPlaintiff attorneys asked Coleman to confirm records of people who were reclassified to lower custody levels, but kept in maximum custody. Coleman said this happens due to a lack of lower-custody beds at the unit. He said sometimes people spend days or even weeks waiting on a lower custody bed to open up for them to move into.\n\nColeman reviewed records that showed the prison was recording prisoners as refusing recreation, but not getting their signature as proof of the refusal. Instead, only one correctional officer, instead of the two that are required, signed the refusal for the prisoner.\n\nPlaintiff attorneys showed Coleman documentation indicating prisoners did not receive dinner for several days in a row.\n\nCross-examination\n\nColeman said he is unable to do anything about the lack of lower custody level beds which keeps some prisoners in higher custody levels.\n\nColeman told the court he believed the problem was poor documentation, not prison employees failing to do their jobs.\n\nWhy it matters\n\nColeman could not explain discrepancies in log sheets and reports he was provided from the Rast unit, calling into question the integrity of the Department’s documentation process.\n\n— Jimmy Jenkins\n\nNov. 10: Medical expert describes 'shockingly poor' care\n\nWho testified: Dr. Todd Wilcox\n\nWilcox formerly worked in health care in the Maricopa County jails. He has been the Salt Lake County Jail medical director for the past 26 years, and provides expert testimony in correctional health care litigation. Wilcox is a witness for the plaintiffs. His testimony began Tuesday and lasted through Wednesday.\n\nWhat did they say?\n\nWilcox testified about a report he submitted to the court that gave specific case study examples of what he called “shockingly poor” health care.\n\nHe based his findings on interviews with people incarcerated in state prisons and a review of medical records.\n\nWilcox told the court about a 30-year-old incarcerated man who experienced significant delays in care. After alerting health care staff to a lump on his testicle, the man’s diagnosis and treatment were delayed for months. Wilcox said health care staff failed to recognize the tumor, lost the patient's records, and misinterpreted test results. After surgery to remove a tumor, and a cancer diagnosis, the patient was not sent back to the hospital for a follow-up examination. The cancer spread to the man’s stomach and eventually killed him.\n\nWilcox told the court the death was \"shockingly preventable\" because \"testicular cancer is one of the most successfully treated cancers that is out there. If done in a timely fashion, the death rate is extraordinarily low.\"\n\nAccording to Wilcox’s review of records, he found the prison health care system was not learning from its mistakes: “There should have been substantial discipline — there should have been an intervention.”\n\n\"The errors made were catastrophic. These are egregious errors. And the response was not directed in any way to implement change that would prevent it from happening again.\"\n\nWilcox said the Arizona prison health care electronic records system is extremely challenging to use and the clinical data he reviewed was “scattered” and difficult to navigate.\n\nAccording to his review, Wilcox said nurses have been empowered to make decisions about access to care in the prison health care system, which is contrary to the way the system should work. He said nurses lack the training and licensure to be making such decisions: “The nurse ends up being the final decision maker for requesting a provider visit — that is inappropriate. It creates barriers. And it’s outside the legal scope of a nurse’s practice.”\n\n“Can you imagine in the community, if you schedule an appointment with your doctor, and you’re met in the lobby by the nurse who does an assessment on you and sends you home? And you’re not allowed to see your doctor? That just doesn’t exist in the scope of health care anywhere.”\n\nWilcox described another patient who requested treatment for severe pain for weeks and had to call for an emergency medical response three times before he was finally given adequate care. The patient lost sensation to the right side of his body, lost control of his bladder, and couldn’t walk. When he was eventually seen by an outside provider, the patient was taken to emergency surgery for a significant neurological injury. The man required two months of recovery in the prison infirmary.\n\nThe standout quote\n\n“The system is terrible. If you have higher end medical needs, you are at serious risk for harm and, in some instances, death.”\n\nCross-examination\n\nDefendant attorneys stressed that Wilcox’s experience with correctional health care is predominantly working in jails, not prisons.\n\nAttorneys for the state said the department and its health care provider are requesting proposals for a new records management system for prison health care that would improve upon the current system, which plaintiff witnesses like Wilcox have criticized.\n\nDefendant attorneys questioned the randomness of the medical patients Wilcox interviewed and focused on in his report.\n\nWilcox was questioned about whether he had interviewed enough patients to determine whether the problems he identified were truly systemic.\n\nWhy it matters\n\nWilcox said the cases he evaluated exemplified the harm caused to the plaintiffs by significant delays in the provision of care. He told the court he believed understaffing was a factor in the poor standard of care.\n\n— Jimmy Jenkins\n\nNov. 8: Incarcerated people say correctional officers encouraged them to commit self-harm\n\nWho testified: Jason Johnson\n\nJohnson is a witness for the plaintiffs incarcerated at the Eyman prison. He is classified as seriously mentally ill and diagnosed with depression.\n\nWhat did they say?\n\n“Some days I get really low and it’s hard to pick myself back up.”\n\nJohnson said he was in a mental health unit where he was getting adequate treatment, but was then transferred to a higher custody prison for disciplinary reasons: “I don’t think it's fair – you shouldn’t be taken away from something that was working. I need all the mental health therapy I can get. I’m trying to keep from coming back to prison.”\n\nJohnson said programming, recreation and showers are frequently canceled due to \"staffing shortages.\" He said he is forced to bathe in his sink in his cell.\n\nWhen therapy is provided, Johnson said it is usually only offered at the front of a cell, with no privacy: “You don’t want to talk about your feelings or your family. You don’t want to put vulnerable information out there because other prisoners start calling you a sissy and it makes you uncomfortable.”\n\nJohnson told the court about a process known as \"Kickstarting\" in which officers and sometimes even mental health staff \"push their buttons\" and \"take advantage of their triggers.\"\n\nHe testified officers mistreat \"very low functioning\" people held in isolation, call prisoners names, pepper spray them, and twist prisoners’ arms until they scream.\n\nJohnson said the prison frequently \"runs out of trash bags\" for two to three days, so he is forced to try to flush uneaten food and garbage down the toilet to prevent mice and roaches from overrunning his cell.\n\nJohnson works as a porter cleaning other prisoners' cells. He said he is constantly cleaning pools of blood and feces from isolation units. He said many severely mentally ill prisoners become so filthy they are taken away by officers and their clothing is cut off their bodies.\n\nJohnson said he has only been outside for recreation once in the past five months.\n\nThe standout quote\n\n\"I heard officers encouraging self-harming behaviors. I have seen officers taunt inmates into self-harm. They will get into an argument with an inmate, then empty a whole can of pepper spray on them, go into the cell and rough them up more.\"\n\nCross-examination\n\nWhen defendant attorneys showed Johnson documents indicating he had been out more frequently, Johnson testified under oath, repeatedly, that his signature had been forged and the documents were falsified.\n\nWhy it matters\n\nJohnson accused the state of falsifying movement logs and he testified that placing him in a more restrictive housing situation was harmful to his mental health.\n\nWho testified: Dustin Brislan\n\nBrislan is a named plaintiff and testified from the Tucson prison.\n\nWhat did they say?\n\nBrislan provided the names of more than 10 officers he accused of taunting him and encouraging him to self-harm, a tactic known in the prisons as “kickstarting.”\n\n\"Kickstarting is where an officer or mental health staff push your buttons - they know your triggers - and get you to react. It happened many times.\"\n\nBrislan said he would often cut himself with rust from the isolation cells while on constant suicide watch, while correctional officers were watching and encouraging him to do so. He said the officer would watch him and not act to stop him.\n\n\"The officers actually encourage me to cut myself. They say they want to see how bad I can get. They heard stories about me and wanted to see how seriously I could hurt myself. They know exactly how serious I am. There's a lot of them that do it.\"\n\nLike previous testimony from incarcerated people with severe mental illness, Brislan told the court officers used force against him while on constant suicide watch. He said they used several cans of pepper spray which he called \"foggers.\"\n\nBrislan described the use of pepper spray on him while on suicide watch in isolation units: \"It turns the whole room orange. It gets on your skin and it feels like a bad sunburn for hours.\"\n\nBrislan told the court he was testifying as a named plaintiff despite a fear of retaliation.\n\nThe standout quote\n\n\"I am a voice for other people who can't defend themselves. I feel that I need to speak up for those who don’t know their rights. I feel obligated as a human being to do this.\"\n\nCross-examination\n\nBrislan told attorneys for the state he is now, after years of substandard care, finally getting weekly individual and group therapy: \"But I want to know - why did it take so long? I'm so mentally bad right now - I'm drowning.\"\n\nHe said while the current therapy he’s receiving is the best he’s ever experienced, prison staff has repeatedly threatened to take away his mental health treatment if he testified against the state.\n\n“I'm at the edge of a pit right now - it's a place I've been before. And they're threatening to take my therapy away again because I'm testifying. I'm terrified.\"\n\nWhy it matters\n\nBrislan is another example of an incarcerated person who said they have struggled for years to get the proper mental health care to keep them from harming themselves. Brislan gave specific names of prison staff who he said encouraged him to harm himself, which would run completely against the stated goals of the Department of Corrections.\n\nWho testified: Martin Horn\n\nHorn is a former jail and prison administrator who now works as a litigation consultant. He was a witness for the plaintiffs.\n\nWhat did they say?\n\nHorn submitted declarations to the court about the security classification system in Arizona prisons. He said he based his work on prison tours, prisoner interviews, and reviewing videos and documents.\n\n“There were an awful lot of people in restrictive housing in Arizona prisons. The policies and procedures governing the system are difficult to follow, complex and convoluted.”\n\nHorn said the conditions he observed were “harsh and severe and inconsistent with what the profession believes is the appropriate standard of care.”\n\nHorn told the court the Arizona Department of Corrections doesn’t know how long prisoners spend in the most restrictive custody levels, which posed a problem: “If you can’t measure it, you can't manage it.”\n\nHorn testified there are no policies keeping seriously mentally ill people out of the highest custody level, maximum custody, even though isolation poses a specific risk to that population.\n\nHorn said Arizona prisons calculate custody levels based on many factors including crimes committed, previous history, escape history, disciplinary records and the severity of the sentence. The prisons then come up with a score for a prisoner, and the higher the score, the higher the custody level they are assigned.\n\nBut Horn said many prisoners' custody levels are “overridden” using factors that were already considered, which he said leads to “overclassification.”\n\nHorn’s review found that while prisoners’ custody levels are periodically reviewed, the prisoners are often not told the results, nor given a chance to appeal decisions, keeping them at high custody levels for long periods of time.\n\n“If they don’t tell you you have a right to appeal, you’re probably not going to appeal.”\n\nHorn found a Department practice of keeping prisoners sentenced to life in maximum custody for their first two years of incarceration was “an unnecessary waste of resources for no good reason.”\n\nHorn reviewed cases of prisoners who had been held in maximum custody for nine and 10 years without any disciplinary infractions.\n\nHorn found some prison units had recorded periods of time where 80% or more of the maximum custody population had “refused” outside recreation, which led him to believe the prison staff was improperly recording the refusals.\n\nHorn reviewed videos of maximum custody prisoners on suicide watch being pepper-sprayed by correctional officers, which he said was “painful to watch.”\n\n“This is a situation where a counselor or mental health professional could have been called before the chemical spray was applied. As with any use of force, I think it should be the last resort.”\n\nThe standout quote\n\n“Prisons are very expensive public resources. They have a profound impact on the people who live there and the rest of society. We have to pay attention to how we use those resources - especially in Arizona, where we are suffering from a staffing shortage.”\n\nWhy it matters\n\nWhile Horn touched on many of the same issues as previous experts who have testified, plaintiff attorneys said his experience as a correctional expert was essential to understanding the flaws of the custody system in Arizona prisons.\n\nHorn’s testimony was cut off for the day, and his cross examination will continue on Tuesday.\n\n— Jimmy Jenkins\n\nNov. 5: Deputy warden says no limits for isolation in prison\n\nDr. Stefanie Platt\n\nPlatt is a witness for the plaintiffs and a psychologist. Platt worked as Centurion’s Regional Director of Mental Health for Arizona.\n\nWhat did they say?\n\nPlatt said current mental health staffing levels are not enough to meet court-ordered performance benchmarks, nor enough to provide adequate levels of care.\n\nPlatt worked as a high-level administrator for Centurion and for Corizon, the former healthcare provider for Arizona prisons. She said there was never a time during her employment for either company when the contracted mental health positions were fully staffed.\n\nPlatt said there was a discussion in late 2020 about hiring additional staff to specifically deal with rising numbers of self-harm incidents in the prison, but Centurion never hired the extra staff.\n\nShe gave several examples where correctional officers reacted inappropriately to mentally ill patients. Platt said they should be given special training to deal with that population. She said correctional officers working constant suicide watch don't receive any special training.\n\nPlatt talked about the role of behavioral health techs, a position that is tasked with a wide variety of duties, and how they have few requirements for education or training. She said the techs do things like walk the units conducting wellness checks and run therapy groups.\n\nPlatt said she was part of a mortality review committee that looks at deaths and suicides in prisons to see what went wrong. She said that while the committee makes recommendations, there is no way to follow up and check to see if they are implemented.\n\nThe quote\n\n“Mental health staff at the vast majority of the prisons expressed concerns about the volume of their workload. Their morale was generally low. People said they felt overworked and undervalued.\"\n\nCross-examination\n\nDefendant attorneys brought up a number of improvements Platt was able to implement during her employment, including the creation of a suicide prevention committee and the introduction of a training program to teach de-escalation tactics.\n\nDefendant attorneys said Centurion was providing a new recruitment incentive to deal with understaffing.\n\nDefendant attorneys said additional training is in fact offered to officers who work with mentally ill prisoners\n\nWhy it matters\n\nPlatt’s testimony continued the narrative that all aspects of the Arizona prison health care system are understaffed, and prisoners are being harmed as a result.\n\nDeputy Warden Travis Scott\n\nScott is a Deputy Warden at the Browning Unit, a maximum custody unit with around 700 people on average, at the Eyman prison. He oversees many incarcerated people held in the highest level security classifications.\n\nWhat did they say?\n\nScott testified over the course of several days. He spoke about his experience running a unit that has been the topic of previous testimony regarding the use of isolation and solitary confinement.\n\nScott told the court there are no formal limits on the amount of time people spend in isolation and restrictive custody settings, and there are no precautions taken or exceptions made when placing a mentally ill person into maximum custody.\n\nHe said there are several different types of custody levels and steps within those levels that incarcerated people are assigned based on multiple factors. He said there are instances where prisoners are unable to lower their custody level even if they are displaying good behavior.\n\nScott said his team conducts a step review process for every person in maximum custody every week, reviewing prisoner behavior and disciplinary records, but said no one takes notes.\n\nScott said the DOC does not track how long people spend on average in maximum custody, or how long they are on each step.\n\nScott confirmed that one prisoner had been in max custody for 10 years even though he had no disciplinary infractions during that time.\n\nScott confirmed several instances when his staff had failed to perform temperature checks of cells, take prisoners to recreation, and had not allowed them to shower. He said every time a prisoner leaves their cell, they must be strip-searched.\n\nThe quote\n\nScott told the court there were instances when one night-shift officer was assigned to six control rooms at one time, leaving hundreds of inmates completely unmonitored.\n\nCross-examination\n\nScott told defendant attorneys that in many instances prisoners placed in restrictive housing have committed severe assaults on staff or other prisoners.\n\nDefendant attorneys had Scott clarify the differences between enhanced security and restrictive housing, which he said are both used for safety purposes.\n\nScott said it was important for prisoners to have out-of-cell time and access to programming: “It helps decrease tension among the inmates. It makes the prison a safer place to work. It makes the inmates less agitated and keeps them occupied.\"\n\nWhy does it matter?\n\nScott oversees a prison that houses many of the prisoners in Arizona living in the most severely restricted conditions, which plaintiff attorneys say causes them harm.\n\nScott testified to critical understaffing in the prisons, which he said impacted the ability to provide mentally ill prisoners with programming.\n\n— Jimmy Jenkins\n\nNov. 4: Who testified on Day 4 of the trial\n\nDr. Craig Haney\n\nHaney is a witness for the plaintiffs. He is a professor of psychology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who studies the impact of solitary confinement and isolation in prisons. Haney was a lead researcher on the Stanford Prison Experiment.\n\nWhat did they say?\n\nHaney called Arizona’s extensive use of solitary confinement and isolation “very harsh” and “among the most severe in the country.”\n\nHaney said mentally ill patients are especially at risk when subjected to isolation.\n\nHaney told the court that human beings are “wired to connect. Our connections with others provide us with a sense of identity; a sense of self.\"\n\n“Isolated confinement is painful and it causes suffering. It can be damaging, irreversible and life-threatening because it can lead to self-harm and suicide.” He said that more than half of the suicides he reviewed from 2015 to 2021 took place in isolation housing units.\n\nHaney testified about recent tours of Arizona prisons and described isolation units at the Lewis and Eyman prisons with no windows and solid steel doors that prevent prisoners from communicating. He said prisoners live in these cells \"more or less around the clock.\" He documented that prisoners living in isolation at the Eyman prison had made \"peanut butter traps\" to catch roaches and rats in their cells.\n\nHaney described cages that prisoners are locked in while wearing restraints during sessions with mental health counselors at Eyman prison. He said prisoners often decline counseling sessions because they don't want to be locked in the cage.\n\nHaney said prisoners refer to the brief mental health care encounters they receive as “drive-bys.” They told him counselors will often quickly pass their cell and ask for a thumbs up instead of spending time evaluating them.\n\nHe said he spoke to juveniles committed to the Department of Corrections. They told him they had not been allowed to go outside for recreation for three weeks: \"The Arizona Department of Corrections' isolations practices create a very substantial risk of harm to juveniles ... One told me he couldn't sleep, another told me all he does is sleep. This is taking enormous risks with a young person's psychological well-being.\"\n\nHaney testified that most prisoners held in isolation units are not given much recreation time. When they are, it's usually in a small concrete block pen.\n\nHaney said Arizona should adopt limits on the amount of time prisoners can be held in isolation. He found that many incarcerated people had been held in isolation for months or even years.\n\nHaney said prisoners who are seriously mentally ill, juveniles or pregnant should be completely excluded from isolation practices except in only emergency situations.\n\nThe quote\n\n\"Prisoners in isolation sometimes tell me they are not sure if they exist anymore because they haven’t had any contact with others.\"\n\nCross-examination\n\nDefendant attorneys accused Haney of conflating custody classification levels and detention status levels in his discussion of conditions in the prisons.\n\nWhen attorneys asked Haney about the Stanford Prison Experiment, he said the study would not be done today because it would be deemed unethical.\n\nDefendant attorneys claimed the number of prisoners held in maximum custody has declined in recent years and faulted Haney for not reviewing that data.\n\nDefendant attorneys said prisoners in isolation can watch TV, use tablets and purchase commissary items, and they disputed the amount of out-of-cell time prisoners are given.\n\nWhy it matters\n\nHaney’s testimony highlighted one of the main plaintiff complaints, which is that Arizona uses isolation extensively on incarcerated people, causing specific harm to seriously mentally ill patients.\n\nRahim Muhammad\n\nMuhammad is a witness for the plaintiffs and is currently incarcerated at the Tucson prison. He has been diagnosed with PTSD and schizophrenia.\n\nWhat did they say?\n\nWhen asked how has living in a maximum custody unit impacted his mental health, Muhammad replied: “I'm all screwed up.” He told the court the conditions he lived in were “appalling and inhumane. I feel less than.”\n\nMuhammad told the court he has been at the highest, most restrictive custody level since 2014, despite good behavior. He said in some prisons he was only allowed to have recreation time once a week and allowed to shower twice a week.\n\nMuhammad has spent most of his time in prison in isolation, which he says has had a negative impact on his mental health: \"If I can't interact and socialize with anyone, I can't keep the voices in my head away.\"\n\nMuhammad told the court he's spent more than $200 requesting mental health treatment, because Arizona prisons charge incarcerated people $4 to submit a \"health needs request\" to receive health care.\n\nTestifying to the brutality of his treatment in isolation cells, Muhammad says he was pepper-sprayed more than 40 times. He accused COs of beating him, holding him down with a knee on his throat, making profane comments to him and saying things about the size of his genitalia.\n\nPlaintiff attorneys showed the court a video where correctional officers threatened to pepper spray Muhammad if he continued to self-harm while he was on constant mental health watch: “Muhammad if you bang your head again I'm going to spray you.” The video showed the COs pepper spraying him. Muhammad said he remembered none of what transpired in that video, telling the court he was \"blacked out\" and \"very distraught.\"\n\nPlaintiff attorneys presented another video of a different incident where correctional officers shot Muhammad with pepper balls at very close range through the food slot of his constant watch cell after ordering him to stop harming himself. In the video, Muhammad tells the officers that voices in his head tell him he has to hurt himself to prevent someone from raping his daughter. The officer responds: “You are choosing to bang your head against the wall. We will keep shooting you. We will gas you every day. These are behavioral choices you are making.\"\n\nThe quote\n\n\"I hear voices that tell me to hurt myself and hurt others. I have aggression issues. I see things. I can’t sleep, sometimes I sleep too much.”\n\nCross-examination\n\nDefense attorneys said since Muhammad has been at the Tucson prison for the past two months, he has had access to programming, recreation and counseling sessions.\n\nMuhammad told defense attorneys he is now on medication that allows him to be more stable, but that he “had to fight to get back on it.”\n\nWhy it matters\n\nMuhammad’s history of denial of care and the prison's repeated use of force against him reinforces the plaintiff’s accusations that extensive use of isolation has detrimental impacts on seriously mentally ill patients.\n\n— Jimmy Jenkins\n\nNov. 3: Who testified on Day 3 of the trial\n\nDr. Pablo Stewart\n\nStewart is a witness for the plaintiffs. He is a psychiatrist and correctional psychiatry expert.\n\nWhat did they say?\n\nStewart said mental health staffing numbers are “grossly inadequate” at several Arizona prisons and told the court a shortage of correctional officers is also impacting health care.\n\nHe said that many patients who had died by suicide had experienced very short mental health encounters before their death and said that a significant number of suicides occur in isolated housing units.\n\n\"I was saddened but not surprised by the descriptions and photographs of the conditions at Eyman. Memorably, this included the graffiti within the entrance to the suicide watch unit, that read, 'Don’t go suicidal. This place sucks. Please help me.'\"\n\nStewart said he observed people on suicide watch. One such patient, despite being on constant watch, was able to remove 10 surgical staples used to close a self-inflicted wound and swallow them, causing his colostomy bag to rupture.\n\nStewart reviewed videos of an incarcerated person at the Eyman prison with serious mental illness. In his review, he said that staff used pepper spray or pepper balls on them for a period of 15 days in December 2020.\n\nStewart said he reviewed emails between prison administrators showing employees of Centurion, Arizona's prison health care contractor, approved this behavior and encouraged a prisoner to commit acts of self-harm.\n\nOn a tour of the Eyman prison, Stewart discovered a cell for seriously mentally ill patients covered with blood. \"The people living in the adjacent cells reported that the previous evening, the man in that cell cut both of his arms and perhaps his legs, and hit an artery.\"\n\nStewart reviewed a case where a corrections officer told a prisoner experiencing psychosis that his self-harming behavior was a choice, and the officer threatened to tase the patient if he continued banging his head against the wall.\n\nEchoing Tuesday’s testimony from Laura Redmond, an incarcerated woman, Stewart found there were no translators available for deaf patients, nor for Spanish-speaking patients.\n\nThe quote\n\n“It's hard for me to adequately express how significantly mentally ill the patients I encountered are.”\n\nCross-examination\n\nDefendant attorneys accused Stewart of selection bias and said previous court findings have characterized his work as speculation, containing errors. They also accused Stewart of not providing patients with a non-confidentiality warning before speaking with them, as required.\n\nDefendant attorneys said some staffing vacancies noted by Stewart are being filled by part-time workers and overtime work.\n\nWhy it matters\n\nStewart’s testimony centered on a recurring theme at the trial: Arizona’s prison health care system is understaffed.\n\nInterviews Stewart conducted with prisoners and case files he reviewed of incarcerated patients supported the plaintiffs’ claims that people in Arizona prisons are subjected to substandard levels of mental health care.\n\nStewart testified about the negative impacts associated with Arizona’s use of solitary confinement on seriously mentally ill prisoners.\n\nEyman Deputy Warden Travis Scott's testimony was cut off again and is scheduled to resume on Thursday.\n\n— Jimmy Jenkins\n\nNov. 2: Who testified on Day 2 of the trial\n\nRonald Slavin\n\nSlavin is a witness for the plaintiffs and is incarcerated at the Eyman prison. He is classified as seriously mentally ill, diagnosed with psychosis, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and major depression.\n\nWhat did they say?\n\nSlavin told the court he started hearing voices when he was hit in the head by a car at age 6 and has suffered from auditory hallucinations his whole life.\n\nSlavin said he has access to counseling for just a half-hour, once a month, and has no access to mental health programming or group therapy. His repeated requests to transfer to a special unit for people with serious mental illness have been denied.\n\nSlavin’s prison counselor suggested he “listen to a podcast” to deal with his serious mental illness.\n\nSlavin told the court he wasn’t getting enough help to address his serious mental health issues.\n\nThe quote\n\n“I don’t mind listening to a counselor. I don’t mind taking meds. But to a certain extent, other treatment is needed.”\n\nCross-examination\n\nSlavin said he has been provided medication but he continues to hear voices and still struggles with other mental health issues.\n\nWhen defendant attorneys accused Slavin of refusing treatment, he said it was because the counselors kept repeating the same ineffective advice over and over again.\n\nWhy it matters\n\nSlavin’s attorneys say the repeated denials to be transferred to a unit for prisoners with serious mental illness, as well as the substandard care he testified to, bolster their claims.\n\nLaura Redmond\n\nRedmond is a witness for the plaintiffs and is incarcerated at the Perryville women’s prison. Classified as seriously mentally ill and has been diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.\n\nRedmond is deaf, and her primary language is American Sign Language.\n\nWhat did they say?\n\nRedmond said she became deaf at 15 months old and is “profoundly deaf” in both ears.\n\nShe said her medical care is poor because she generally does not have access to a sign language interpreter during healthcare appointments in the prisons. This has also prevented her from getting a cochlear implant.\n\nRedmond said she suffers from behavior issues and negative thinking and has a hard time sleeping: “I cry a lot”.\n\nRedmond testified remotely from the Perryville prison via teleconference, but the video call dropped several times.\n\nThe quote\n\n“I don’t understand what they’re saying to me. I’m always frustrated and I am not able to ask questions.”\n\nCross-examination\n\nDefendant cited several instances in Redmond's medical record where it had been recorded that a language interpreter was provided. Redmond disputed some of the records and said she didn’t remember being provided with an interpreter in the other instances.\n\nRedmond said some of her counseling sessions had been longer than the few minutes that she previously testified to.\n\nDefendant attorneys said that the doctors found she might not be a good candidate for a cochlear implant because she has been deaf since childhood.\n\nWhy it matters\n\nPlaintiff attorneys say Redmond was deprived of her right to be an active participant in her medical and mental health care.\n\nThey say the lack of interpretation services during her healthcare encounters affected her ability to receive constitutionally adequate care.\n\nDeputy Warden Travis Scott's testimony was cut off at the end of the day and will resume Wednesday.\n\n— Jimmy Jenkins\n\nNov. 1: Who testified on Day 1 of the trial\n\nKendall Johnson\n\nJohnson is a witness for the plaintiffs and is incarcerated in the Perryville Women’s Prison.\n\nWhat did they say?\n\nJohnson said she entered prison at age 19 in 2004 as a healthy young woman. In 2017, she started to experience numbness in her legs and feet. She repeatedly requested medical treatment for several years as her symptoms progressed.\n\nShe experienced several falls that resulted in broken bones and eventually lost the ability to write and walk. In 2020, she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.\n\nJohnson wrote health needs requests begging for proper treatment, but she didn’t get it until May 2021. She uses a wheelchair, is nearly immobile and has trouble speaking. Now Johnson is confined to a special needs medical unit at the prison.\n\nThe quote\n\n“I tried to get help but it was like hitting my head against the wall.”\n\nCross-examination\n\nJohnson said she is finally receiving medication that has helped her symptoms, but the treatment came too late.\n\nWhy it matters\n\nJohnson’s story and allegations illustrate the continued failures plaintiffs have accused the state of, including delayed care, lack of specialty care referrals and medical neglect.\n\nRobert Joy\n\nJoy is a witness for the plaintiffs and an independent health care consultant. He previously conducted a staffing analysis of California prisons, and he created a staffing model for health care workers in Arizona prisons.\n\nWhat did they say?\n\nJoy testified about the model he created, which calls for many more health care workers in Arizona prisons than are employed by Centurion. “Based on my analysis, the 10 state-run prisons are understaffed.”\n\nHe described using data from the Department of Corrections, Department of Justice and other sources to estimate the actual health care needs of people in Arizona prisons.\n\nJoy’s model divided Arizona prisoners into cohorts depending on medical need, then extrapolated those numbers out to make an estimate for the entire state prison population.\n\nHe told the court the state prison population has greater mental and physical health needs than in private prisons. He also found the proportion of patients designated seriously mentally ill in Arizona prisons is significantly lower than in other states.\n\nJoy focused on factors specific to “justice-involved” populations to make estimations.\n\nHe found 18-20% of the prison population is held in isolation, a significantly higher portion than other prison systems.

They called his work “inflated data” and “junk science.”\n\nWhy it matters\n\nSeveral court experts have previously testified about how low staffing levels in Arizona prisons were leading to improper and delayed care. Joy’s findings and testimony bolster those claims.\n\nThe findings suggested Arizona is not accurately defining the true number of seriously mentally ill patients in state prisons.\n\nJoy’s work indicates the current contract likely underestimates the true need for mental and physical health care services.\n\nArizona’s use of isolation makes providing health care even more difficult.\n\n— Jimmy Jenkins", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2024/02/04/the-best-things-to-do-in-des-moines-this-winter-restaurants-bars-entertainment-shopping/72399154007/", "title": "The best things to do in Des Moines this winter", "text": "Welcome to Des Moines.

There is a lot of unknown between now and then.\n\nBut if the show is to go on this summer, the process has to start. Now.\n\nAnd so, while auditions at the downtown theater were canceled this weekend due to new regulations that no more than 10 people can gather at one time, selecting a cast is underway.\n\nOnline.\n\nYou don't have to be there\n\nTo fill a cast of between 20 and 30, the Paramount has set up an audition protocol online. Those hoping to be in the theater's biggest fundraiser of the year can submit singing, dancing and speaking auditions.\n\nAll from the safety of wherever they happen to be.\n\nParamount Executive Director George Levesque said the decision to go online came after Gov. Greg Abbott last week reduced public gatherings statewide.\n\nThe audition process could've worked with 10 or less, but why risk staff being exposed to dozens of people coming into the theater, Levesque said.\n\n\"Could we do 10 people in a room? Yes. But let's play the game and be helpful,\" he said. \"And we could do it online.\"\n\nBesides, the theater already was dark. The Paramount canceled its Cabaret fundraiser, last weekend's Children's Performing Arts Series show and, already, the April classic movie \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.\"\n\nIt's unimaginable not to have a summer musical. It's an Abilene tradition, for one thing. \"Chicago\" will be the theater's 28th show.\n\nLevesque said $7,000 already had been paid to Samuel French for the rights to stage \"Chicago.\" While he knows other theaters are in same situation of facing the unknown and he believes the company will be accommodating to a change of dates, the best plan is for the musical to be staged as planned.\n\nThe financial stakes are high. Last year, \"Newsies\" drew 2,700 to three performances. That, along with underwriting, provided a net of $50,000, Levesque said. That was a record.\n\n\"It supports most everything we do.\" he said.\n\nLevesque said May 1, or so, is the go-no-go date for the June performance.\n\n\"We have to be fully compliant, so it might not (happen),\" Levesque said.\n\nSome good news is that if the show goes on, even later than planned, the work put in now won't be wasted, he said.\n\nWith a cast picked, rehearsals will be ready roll.\n\nHopefully beginning in early May.\n\nHere's how it's done\n\nAuditions will be accepted through April 6. Previously, in-person auditions were scheduled March 29-30, with callbacks March 31.\n\nMany will remember the 2002 movie, with Renée Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Richard Gere in the lead roles. It won six 2003 Academy Awards, including Best Picture — the first musical to do so since \"Oliver!\" in 1968.\n\nWhile \"Newsies\" was for all ages, \"Chicago\" is PG-13.\n\nMore of an adult show, this year, Levesque said.\n\nThose hoping to land a role in the show should go to paramountabilene.com.\n\nProminently displayed on the home page — after all, there is nothing else going on — is a link for \"Auditions - 'Chicago' The musical.\"\n\nClick that and you arrive at the starting point for this online adventure:\n\n\"DOZENS OF US GETTING TOGETHER- SINGING, DANCING, ACTING…SOUNDS FUN! BUT, IT AIN’T GONNA HAPPEN AT THIS POINT. THAT’S WHY WE’RE MOVING CHICAGO AUDITIONS ONLINE TO DIGITAL SUBMISSIONS. SING AND DANCE FROM THE COMFORT OF YOUR OWN HOME! HECK, WE FIGURE YOU MIGHT BE ALREADY. PLEASE FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW.\"\n\nThat introduction is in all caps.\n\nListed are the roles. The two lead characters, Roxy Hart and Velma Kelley, are women.\n\nBelow are instructions on how to submit. An audition form must be submitted by all.\n\nVocalists are asked to sing \"All the Jazz reprise.\" But you can submit more: \"If you would like to show us more of your razzle dazzle, you may also sing another song with your own backup track.\"\n\nDancers have two options, one for more experienced dancers and the other for movers — someone who can act but is less experienced as a dancer.\n\nDancers are encouraged to \"do as many pirouettes in the combination that you can control. In addition to your dance call, please also demonstrate some leaps and jumps, and tell us about any tricks, tumbling, or partnering experience you would like to share.\"\n\nWho's who at the helm\n\n\"Chicago\" will be directed by Jeff Smith, a former Abilenian now living in New York City.\n\nHe was seen on stage here last year as Jets leader Riff when Abilene Opera Association presented \"West Side Story.\" Smith also has danced with Abilene Ballet Theatre.\n\nSmith takes over for Paramount artistic director Barry Smoot, who is recovering from a health scare, Levesque said.\n\nMarc Sanders is overseeing music while Lily Balogh, dance instructor at Abilene Christian University, is handling choreography. ACU has added a dance track to its theater program, and that decision already has had an impact on productions there and in town.\n\nIt's her videos that those auditioning for \"Chicago\" will try to imitate.\n\n\"The dances were fabulous and the show was wildly successful,\" Levesque said of \"Newsies.\" \"We thought, 'Let's do another dance show.'\n\n\"And 'Chicago' is the opposite of 'Newsies,' in that it is female driven.\"\n\nYet, because \"Newsies\" was a male-driven show with a cast double that of \"Chicago,\" Levesque said casting of males should be easier with guys who have more experience auditioning.\n\n\"They all had to dance like crazy,\" he said. \"They had a great experience and I would think some want to showcase that again.\"\n\nRichard Transki again is doing the costumes, Gary Varner scene design and Grayson Allred lighting and projection.\n\nLevesque is concerned how the coronavirus has forced college students to change their plans for the summer.\n\nBut going forward with the show may give actors and actresses who are eager to get back on the stage something to shoot for as they deal with a pandemic and all that jazz.\n\nGreg Jaklewicz is editor of the Abilene Reporter-News.

Through AI, they're calling Congress to change laws", "text": "Gun violence is a uniquely American problem.\n\nThe death rate in 2021 was seven times that of Canada's and 340 times higher than the rate within the United Kingdom. The United States is the only peer nation where gun violence is the leading cause of death for children.\n\nOur children spend part of their school lives learning how to hide during active shooter drills. Generation Z in particular – dubbed \"the lockdown generation\" – has learned to be wary of movie theaters, concerts, nightclubs and places of worship due to the tragedies we have seen occur in these spaces. Now, Generation Alpha is getting passed the same traumas.\n\nUnfortunately, the reality is that Congress continuously fails to protect us from this horror. They just keep looking away. A campaign released Wednesday is asking whether they will ignore the voices of victims.\n\nCongress has ignored US gun violence\n\nLast year, Congress ignored 656 mass shootings and more than 43,000-gun violence deaths.\n\nCongress has ignored the more than 360,000 students who have experienced gun violence at school since the mass shooting at Colorado's Columbine High School in 1999, according to data collected by The Washington Post.\n\nCongress has also ignored that more than half of 2021 deaths involving gunfire were suicides. Another sizable chunk – 43% – were homicides.\n\nMore than 80% of all murders in the United States in 2021 involved a gun.\n\nNo legislation was passed to help make those number go down. Sure, there was bipartisan legislation signed into law in 2022 – the first major gun safety legislation in almost three decades – but it was relatively weak, mainly incentivizing states to pass their own laws and expanding on the existing legislation that keeps domestic abusers from owning firearms.\n\nI watched my teacher get shot in 1993.I thought lawmakers would never let it happen again.\n\nGun control activists hope Congress can't ignore voices of the victims\n\nWednesday is the six-year anniversary of a gunman killing 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. It is the deadliest shooting at a high school in U.S. history, surpassing the 13 killed at Columbine's massacre.\n\nMarch For Our Lives, the gun control advocacy group created in the wake of the Florida tragedy, is recognizing the anniversary by letting the victims of gun violence speak to members of Congress directly, through artificial intelligence. The group rolled out the project Wednesday morning on Capitol Hill.\n\n“It’s been six years, and you’ve done nothing – not a thing to stop all of the shootings that have continued to happen since,” says the voice of Joaquin Oliver. “The thing is, I died that day in Parkland. My body was destroyed by a weapon of war. I’m back today because my parents used AI to recreate my voice to call you. Other victims like me will be calling, too.”\n\nOliver is one of six voices recreated for The Shotline, a website that uses these AI-generated monologues to call elected officials and demand gun control legislation. The voices were created using audio and video clips from the family members of the victims – the people who have repeatedly asked Congress for action, to no avail.\n\nThe project is spearheaded by Manny Oliver, Joaquin’s father and the co-founder of Change the Ref alongside his wife, Patricia.\n\n'Thoughts and prayers must always be followed by action'\n\nHearing each of the victims' voices is unsettling, but it’s supposed to be. What is more unsettling is that we have reached a point where recreating the voices of the dead might be one of the only ways to capture the attention of members of Congress.\n\n“They're not acting,” Giselle Webster, whose son Jaycee is one of the voices, says of Congress. \"They'll tell you, 'Oh, you're in my thoughts and prayers.' Now, I'll tell you: Thoughts and prayers, they do work, but the thoughts and prayers must always be followed by action.\"\n\n'We did nothing':Trump is a coward. At NRA gun show, he admitted as much.\n\nOther voices include Ethan Song, a 15-year-old killed by an unsecured gun at a friend’s house in 2018; Mike Baughan, a man who died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in 2014; Akilah Dasilva, a 23-year-old who was killed in a mass shooting at a Waffle House in 2018; and Uziyah Garcia, a 10-year-old fourth grader killed in the 2022 school shooting in Uvalde, Texas.\n\nMarch For Our Lives wants background checks, ending gun marketing to minors just like alcohol\n\nMarch For Our Lives is asking Congress to pass universal background checks, a ban on assault weapons and legislation like \"Ethan's Law\" (named after Song), which would set national requirements for safe firearm storage.\n\nThe advocacy group is also supporting the Protecting Kids from Gun Marketing Act, introduced by Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., that would require the Federal Trade Commission to regulate gun marketing toward minors, just like alcohol and tobacco are regulated.\n\nThese voices provide a reminder that the victims of gun violence are more than statistics. They are real people – in many cases, young people – whose lives were cut short because of Congress' failure to act after other mass shootings.\n\nWebster, whose son Jaycee was almost 21 when he was fatally shot in 2017, says she wants Congress to know her child's point of view: \"You've heard about this shooting. You've heard about this and that. That's who I am. You would not listen to my parents, to friends, family, students. Now you're going to listen to me.\"\n\nIt's unthinkable that anyone could ignore the pleas of those directly affected by gun violence. It is what has gotten us to this point, where recreating the victims' voices might be one of the only ways to actually get lawmakers to pay attention to the pain caused by a lack of gun laws in this country.\n\nAt the very least, hearing these voices should remind Congress that these families and advocates will not give up until better gun laws are passed.\n\nFollow USA TODAY elections columnist Sara Pequeño on X, formerly Twitter, @sara__pequeno and Facebook facebook.com/PequenoWrites", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/14"}]}

The largest of the blazes, the Smokehouse Creek Fire, had consumed 1 million acres, an area larger than the state of Rhode Island, and was just 3% contained by Thursday.\n\nThe Smokehouse blaze caused a brief shutdown of a nuclear plant earlier in the week. The 687 Reamer Fire fed into it after consuming an additional 2,000 acres of land.\n\n“This is now the largest fire in recorded Texas history,” Erin O’Connor, lead public information officer for Texas A&M Forest Service, said Thursday. The fire's acreage indicates land within the burn zone, she said.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued a disaster declaration for 60 counties in Texas, and on Wednesday, he directed the Texas Division of Emergency Management to increase its readiness level in response to the fires.\n\nMultiple blazes continued to rage Thursday across Texas and past state lines into Oklahoma. The Windy Deuce fire had burned at least 142,000 acres and was 50% contained, according to the National Wildfire Coordinating Group. The Grape Vine Creek Fire was almost two-thirds contained after it tore through 30,000 acres, and the Magenta Fire had burned through an additional 3,300 acres.\n\nOfficials have confirmed two deaths in the Texas fires this week. Cindy Owen was driving in Hemphill County on Tuesday afternoon when she encountered fire or smoke, said Sgt. Chris Ray of the Texas Department of Public Safety. She got out of her truck, and flames overtook her.\n\nA passerby found Owen and called first responders, who took her to a burn unit in Oklahoma. She died Thursday morning, Ray said.\n\nThe other victim, an 83-year-old woman, was identified by family members as Joyce Blankenship, a former substitute teacher. Her grandson, Lee Quesada, said deputies told his uncle Wednesday they had found Blankenship’s remains in her burned home.\n\nThe number of structures that have been damaged or destroyed isn’t yet known though teams are investigating, O'Connor said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, in Texas on Thursday to visit the U.S.-Mexico border, said he directed federal officials to do “everything possible” to assist fire-affected communities, including sending firefighters and equipment. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has guaranteed Texas and Oklahoma will be reimbursed for their emergency costs, the president said.\n\n“When disasters strike, there’s no red states or blue states where I come from,” Biden said. “Just communities and families looking for help. So we’re standing with everyone affected by these wildfires and we’re going to continue to help you respond and recover.”\n\nReduced winds and future rain could help slow the fires\n\nOn Thursday, fire activity was minimal, in part because the winds had died down, O'Connor said, although they may pick up this weekend. Some precipitation is forecast this week, which could slow the fire, she said. \"Our firefighters should be able to make good progress and increase containment over the next couple of days.\"\n\nThe weather service reported 1 to 4 inches of snow in parts of the Panhandle on Thursday, but reports of moisture in the area over the fire ranged from a trace to maybe a quarter of an inch, said Douglas Weber, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Amarillo.\n\nIt remains to be seen how much that will help before the very warm, dry and windy conditions return on Friday. The weather service also issued fire weather watches for the weekend in parts of New Mexico, Colorado and Kansas due to high winds and low humidity.\n\nDangerous conditions could return this weekend, AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jon Porter said, as gusty winds, low humidity and high temperatures are forecast in the Southern Plains.\n\n“Firefighters are going to welcome all of that help from the atmosphere today, with the higher levels of moisture and reduced winds as compared to earlier in the week. That period of help is very brief,” Porter said. “Grass and brush can dry up very quickly, that’s why we’re so concerned about the risks for fires to increase once again.”\n\nAccording to a report last year by the Texas State Climatologist, wildfire risk in the state is projected to increase because of increased rates of drying and increased fuel load: Intense rains create the conditions for larger than usual scrub grass and brush growth, then droughts dry the area out, which makes the land more liable to burn.\n\nIn the Texas Panhandle, where the Smokehouse Creek Fire and others are burning, the land is flat, grassy and brush-filled, giving any fires that do start ample fuel to burn.\n\nNearby counties evacuate after heat fuels fires\n\nLocal officials ordered the evacuation of Hemphill County on Tuesday afternoon in response to the fire. Less than an hour later, the sheriff's office announced that a major highway evacuation route was closed and advised that residents shelter in place in the town of Canadian.\n\nThe Texas A&M Forest Service said a \"moderate to high fire potential for wildfires\" detected on Tuesday would relax later in the week but would increase on the state's plains amid strong winds forecast over the weekend.\n\nStrong winds in a dry environment, fueled by record-high temperatures for the time of year, allowed the fire to rapidly spread after it sparked on Monday. Temperatures early in the week in the northern part of the state reached as high as the mid-80s, abnormal for this time of year. Then came extremely high winds.\n\nThe weather service forecast on Monday noted gusts up to 60 mph. “As if that wasn't enough, we've also had record warm temperatures this morning and afternoon, with the opportunity to break another warm temperature record overnight,\" the weather service said.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, the fires closed the Pantex nuclear plant northeast of Amarillo, causing officials at the plant to halt operations that evening. The plant resumed normal operations on Wednesday.\n\nHow unusual is a Texas wildfire in February?\n\nLarge fires in the Texas Panhandle are not unusual, O’Connor said. “It’s not unheard of to have these large fires in this part of the state,” she said.\n\nFire activity typically shows up during two annual seasons, but climate change has broken up that cycle as more fires pop up throughout the year, according to the Western Fire Chiefs Association.\n\nThe winter fire season, sometimes called the dormant fire season, runs from February through April and sees the most fires spread out of the year. Those fires can blossom as cold fronts bring high winds into the state putting winter-dry grasses and vegetation at risk.\n\nThe summer wildfire season runs August through October, when high heat and dry conditions can spark conflagrations. These fires are especially bad in years with wet falls and winters followed by summer droughts, which create large amounts of fuel.\n\nThat was the case of the Bastrop Fire in 2011, the most destructive in the Lone Star state’s history. It killed two people, burned more than 32,000 acres and destroyed more than 1,500 homes.\n\nBefore the Smokehouse Creek Fire took the title, the largest fire in Texas state history was the East Amarillo Complex fire. The fire ignited in Hutchinson County on March 12, 2006, and blazed through more than 907,000 acres, according to the Texas A&M Forest Service.\n\nIt also caused 13 fatalities, making it the deadliest in the state's history.\n\nHistorically, slightly more than 1% of the state’s land has burned each decade since 1984. Climate models project an increase as soil and vegetation become drier by 2100.\n\nConditions were ripe for Smokehouse Creek fire to spread\n\nThe Smokehouse Creek fire had all the ingredients to become a megablaze from the very beginning.\n\nThree things make for very large fires: fine fuels, such as the tall grass growing in the area where this fire started, wind to drive the flames and open terrain with nothing to stop the fire, said Stephen Pyne, an emeritus professor at Arizona State University and a wildfire historian.\n\nAll three of those were at work in the Smokehouse fire, Pyne said: flat terrain, strong gusty winds and grasslands. It had also been dry and hot, which helped dry out the grasses and other “fuels” and made it easier for them to burn.\n\nThat’s how the fire was able to travel more than 30 miles in a day and grow to 1 million acres in size in a little more than 48 hours.\n\n“It’s a big fire and it’s going to do damage until the wind stops,” he said. “There’s nothing really they’ll be able to do to control it.”\n\nSmall town hit by fire remembers destruction of 2014 wildfire\n\nThe small town of Fritch hunkered down as wildfires approached this week, nearly a decade after another wildfire unleashed destruction on the small community.\n\nAs the Windy Deuce fire crept closer, officials ordered evacuations in the southern part of the town. The Moore County Sheriff's Office said it was assisting residents to evacuate.\n\nFritch Mayor Tom Ray said around 50 homes had already been destroyed in the blaze.\n\n\"Today your Fritch Volunteer Fire Department mourns for our community and those around it,\" fire officials posted on Facebook. \"We are tired, we are devastated but we will not falter. We will not quit.\"\n\nThe fire wrought destruction on the city's infrastructure, causing hundreds to lose power this week.\n\nThe power outages also brought down the city's water system. Officials announced a boil water notice on Wednesday morning until further notice. The city set up a local church as a bottled water distribution center in response.\n\nThe tragedy recalled May of 2014, when another wildfire that scorched the North Texas area devastated Fritch. The flames forced more than 2,000 people to evacuate and damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes. One person in the town died of a heart attack amid the disaster.\n\nThe fire ignited in the midst of a years long drought throughout the state that began in 2010 and took a heavy toll on Texas' agriculture-dependent economy. It also devastated small communities throughout the Panhandle and scorched thousands of acres.\n\n\"We have seen tragedy today and we have seen miracles,\" local deputies posted on Facebook on Tuesday. \"Today was a historic event we hope never happens again. The panhandle needs prayers.\"\n\nHow much is climate change driving big wildfires?\n\nClimate change’s strongest impact on wildfires occurs in moisture-limited environments that are heavily forested and heavily vegetated.\n\nThat’s not the case in the Texas wildfires, UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain said. Yet it’s likely climate change is still playing a role, he said Thursday in a live-streamed video on his Weather West YouTube channel.\n\nThough it’s not uncommon to see wildfires in the Southern Plains in winter because of the dry grasslands and wind storms, what is unusual is just how hot temperatures got in the region in the days leading up to the fires, Swain said. Some parts of the plains – including in the Texas panhandle – saw record warm temperatures for February.\n\nOn Monday, Childress, Texas, hit 90 degrees, beating the record high for that date set in 1986 of 86 degrees. Lubbock saw a high of 87, beating a record for the day set in 1918 of 85 degrees. The area was also record hot in December and January, which would have dried out vegetation even more, making it more susceptible to a fire like this.\n\n“Why was it as hot as it was leading up to these fires? It certainly wouldn’t have been that hot without climate change,” Swain said.\n\nContributing: Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/severe/2023/06/03/heavy-rain-brings-beneficial-moisture-severe-risk-to-high-plains/70283097007/", "title": "Heavy rain brings beneficial moisture, severe risk to high plains", "text": "Gov. Greg Abbott on Friday deployed state emergency resources to the Panhandle after a series of storms, over the course of nearly three weeks, have caused severe flooding and significant damage to some areas.\n\nSevere weather and additional rainfall is expected to continue throughout the region for the next week or so, bringing further relief to the region's improving drought conditions, but also the risk for additional flooding.\n\n\"With Northwest Texas experiencing significant flooding, the State of Texas is swiftly deploying flood response resources to help local emergency officials keep Texans safe,\" Abbott said in a news release. \"Texans are urged to regularly monitor weather and driving conditions and to forgo travel in impacted areas over the next several days as flash flood threats continue. Please continue to heed the guidance of local and emergency officials to protect yourselves and your loved ones. Turn around, don't drown. I thank all of our emergency personnel who continue to protect our communities during these storms.\"\n\nWell-above average rainfall in May and so far in June has boosted area lakes, with Lake Alan Henry rising from 70 percent to more than 90 percent full and Lake Meredith up to 39 percent from 29 percent a month ago. But it's also brought widespread flooding on area roadways and prompted evacuations around the rising Canadian River in the Panhandle.\n\nAmarillo area faces flooding problems as rainfall continues\n\nFrom the Mexico border to the Texas-Oklahoma Panhandle, residents braced themselves as severe weather moved through the region Friday. The area saw a brief respite Saturday, with fewer storms across the High Plains. But storm chances were expected to pick back up Sunday going into the week, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nIn addition to observed tornadoes near Seminole and Fort Stockton, much of the region saw widespread heavy rainfall, some areas of flash flooding, hail and winds of up to 80 mph.\n\nAfter reaching the area in the early afternoon, the storms moved eastward past the South Plains and Caprock by sunset, while heavy rainfall was expected to continue in the Rolling Plains through midnight.\n\nLubbock Preston Smith International Airport recorded 0.57 of an inch on Friday, according to the weather service. That brought the city to 6.97 inches for the year - just above the year-to-date average of 6.71. Other notable rainfall totals for Friday include 1.28 inches at Abernathy, 2.87 inches at Andrews and 1.11 inches at Plains. Amarillo saw 7.36 inches in May alone - about 5 inches above average.\n\nMuch of the region is already waterlogged and under flood disasters after the region has accumulated between 300% to 600% more rain than typical this time of year, the forecaster said, adding that Friday's event brought an additional 3 to 4 inches of rain per hour.\n\nEarlier this week, Potter County Judge Nancy Tanner declared a local state of disaster for northern and northwestern Potter County, which has received record-breaking rainfall since May 18.\n\nAdditionally, the Potter County Sheriff's Office issued a warning that urged residents to not float the Canadian River, which is seeing swift water speeds, a \"very strong flow\" and a \"very dangerous\" undercurrent. The sheriff's office also noted that the water spreads closer to the lake and becomes a \"marsh type area with extreme quick sand.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/03/01/texas-fires-map-smokehouse-creek/72801875007/", "title": "Texas wildfire map: Locations of Smokehouse Creek Fire, other blazes", "text": "Wildfires continued to burn across the Texas Panhandle Thursday, forcing widespread evacuations as the Smokehouse Creek Fire has grown to become the largest in the state's history.\n\nAs of midday Thursday, there were 132 fires burning across Texas spanning over 1.2 million acres, according to the Texas A&M Forest Service.

For the latest news on the blaze, view our live updates file for Thursday, Feb. 29.\n\nThe second-largest wildfire in Texas history raged across the state's panhandle along with several other major blazes Wednesday, prompting evacuations, destroying homes and triggering a temporary shutdown of the nation's primary nuclear weapons facility.\n\nAn 83-year-old grandmother from the small town of Stinnett was the lone confirmed fatality. However, authorities have yet to make a thorough search for victims and warned the damage to some communities is extensive.\n\nThe fires began Monday but spread quickly the following day as strong winds, dry conditions and record-setting unseasonably high temperatures fueled rapid growth. By Wednesday, the largest blaze, the Smokehouse Creek Fire, stretched across 850,000 acres – about 1,300 square miles – through several counties and into neighboring Oklahoma, according to the Texas A&M Forest Service.\n\nThe Smokehouse Creek Fire, which is slightly bigger than the state of Rhode Island, is among the largest wildfires the state has ever seen, only behind the 2006 Amarillo East Complex fires that claimed 12 lives and burned more than 900,000 acres.\n\nTo the south, the Windy Deuce Fire burned 142,000 acres of land, and 30% of the fire has been contained as of Wednesday evening, according to the National Wildfire Coordinating Group. Another blaze, the Grape Vine Creek Fire, northeast of Amarillo, Texas, burned 30,000 acres and was 60% contained.\n\nAuthorities have not said what might have caused the fires that ripped through sparsely populated counties set amid vast, high plains.\n\nHemphill County Emergency Management Coordinator Bill Kendall said about 40 homes were burned around the perimeter of Canadian, a rural town northeast of Amarillo, Texas, but no buildings were lost inside the community. Kendell said the charred terrain looked “like a moonscape.\"\n\nHe also said he saw “hundreds of cattle just dead, laying in the fields.”\n\nTresea Rankin filmed her home burning in Canadian. “Thirty-eight years of memories, that’s what you were thinking,” Rankin said. “Two of my kids were married there ... But you know, it’s OK, the memories won’t go away.”\n\nWhite House press secretary Karen Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that President Joe Biden is receiving regular updates on the fires.\n\n\"We are grateful for the brave firefighters and first responders who are working to protect people and save lives,\" Jean-Pierre said. \"And we urge everyone in the affected area to remain vigilant and heed the warnings of local officials, especially those who have been ordered to evacuate.\"\n\nThe administration remains in contact with state and local officials and stands ready to provide further support as needed, she said. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has issued two fire management assistance grants to Texas, and one to Oklahoma.\n\nThe intense blazes in Texas were among several wild weather events happening across the country, including tornadoes in Illinois and a swath of record-high temperatures in the eastern half of the nation.\n\nTemperatures dropped in the region on Wednesday and a light mix of rain and snow was expected overnight, the National Weather Service said.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality has required the City of Fritch's public water system to notify all customers to boil their water before using it because of a \"loss in electricity that caused reduced distribution system pressure,\" according to a post on Facebook by the city.\n\n∎ The wildfires have left thousands of people without power. According to a database maintained by USA TODAY, more than 18,000 utility customers in Texas were without power Wednesday afternoon.\n\n∎ Several main roads and highways in the Texas Panhandle, which were blocked off Tuesday as the wildfires were quickly expanding, remain closed.\n\n∎ Sid Miller, commissioner of the Texas Department of Agriculture, said in a statement that he's \"deeply concerned\" about the wildfires' impact on the state's agricultural industry. \"We stand in solidarity with our farmers and ranchers facing loss and destruction,\" Miller said. \"Our thoughts are with them during this challenging time, and we're committed to supporting their recovery efforts every step of the way.\"\n\nOne death confirmed in Texas fires\n\nAuthorities confirmed one death amid a dayslong blaze that burned through the panhandle. The woman who died was identified by family members as Joyce Blankenship, a former substitute teacher.\n\nHer grandson, Lee Quesada, said he had posted in a community forum asking if anyone could try to locate her. Quesada said deputies told his uncle on Wednesday they had found Blankenship’s remains in her burned home.\n\nQuesada said she’d surprise him at times with funny stories \"about her more ornery days.\"\n\n\"Just talking to her was a joy,\" he said, adding that \"Joy\" was a nickname of hers.\n\n'Some homes were completely lost'\n\nHutchinson County Emergency Management spokesperson Deidra Thomas answered questions from residents during a Facebook livestream on Wednesday and said several homes in Fritch, a small city some 35 miles north of Amarillo, have been completely destroyed and the area remains unsafe.\n\n\"I don't think a lot of folks that live in the Fritch area probably are going to be prepared for what they're going to see as they pull into town,\" she said. \"Some homes were completely lost...\"\n\nThomas said the main road leading into Fritch was backed up with residents who were not allowed into the city because in many areas, especially across the south, fires were still active.\n\n\"They can't even see house numbers,\" she said of first responders, adding that emergency officials are focused on damage control and assessment. \"We have not really had a chance to assess all the damage and figure out where to start.\"\n\nMultiple towns, cities remain under evacuation orders\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott issued a disaster declaration for 60 counties to enable critical resources to be deployed to areas impacted by the wildfires. The Smokehouse Creek fire is the largest of the blazes that ripped across the region, but it is among 13 fires that started on Monday.\n\nWhile some residents were told they could return to their homes, several towns remain under mandatory evacuations. The Smokehouse Creek Fire forced evacuations in the cities of Hemphill County, which sits about a hundred miles northeast of Amarillo. Several school districts throughout the country canceled classes for Wednesday.\n\nPantex Plant reopens after temporary shutdown\n\nThe Windy Deuce fire triggered the Pantex Plant − the nation's primary nuclear weapons assembly and disassembly facility about 17 miles northeast of Amarillo − to shut down and evacuate Tuesday evening. The plant said in a post on X that fire barriers were being built \"to protect plant facilities.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the facility announced it will reopen for normal operations.\n\nThe plant performs research and development in high explosives and serves as an interim storage site for plutonium pits removed from dismantled weapons, according to the Department of Energy. The roughly 16,000-acre site, which includes a huge buffer zone, is jointly operated by a contractor and Sandia National Laboratory on land owned by the energy department and Texas Tech University, according to Texas Health and Human Services.\n\nTexas wildfires force evacuations, respiratory warnings\n\nMandatory evacuations are in effect in more than a half dozen Texas towns, the weather service said. The city of Canadian had been asked to shelter in place and several agencies were sending crews to help protect structures against the advancing flames, according to one of the coordination center updates. By Tuesday evening, fire crews were able to place a control line around Canadian to try to protect the town, but officials also warned that the fire had shown the ability to send burning embers over long distances.\n\nThough the fire was 20 to 25 miles north of Amarillo, Texas, the weather service said, strong north winds are blowing a blanket of smoke into Amarillo, creating hazardous conditions for those with respiratory conditions.\n\nTexas has seen record-high temperatures this week and parts of the panhandle are \"abnormally dry,\" according to the National Drought Monitor. Sixty-three counties in the state have burn bans in place, according to the fire service.\n\nWildfire smoke map: Track fires and red flag warnings across the US\n\nLarge fires also are burning in Nebraska and Oklahoma. Evacuations were in effect in Northwestern Oklahoma, where one Texas wildfire doubled in size and crossed into the state on Tuesday, reported The Oklahoman, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nOther wildfires also had been reported in the state over the past few days.\n\nContributing: Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/weather/2023/08/29/retired-i-named-hurricanes/70708016007/", "title": "'I' named Hurricanes are often retired: Will Idalia be the latest?", "text": "As Hurricane Idalia barrels across the Gulf of Mexico, the west coast of Florida is bracing for impact with widespread evacuations.\n\nIt could be the next hurricane to join 2022's Ian and 2017's Irma in the \"terrible I's.\" Since 1954, more hurricane names starting with the letter I have been retired due to their widespread destruction than any other letter of the alphabet.\n\nHurricane name lists are repeated every six years, but the World Metrological Organization retires a name if \"a storm is so deadly or costly that the future use of its name on a different storm would be inappropriate for obvious reasons of sensitivity,\" according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nHere are all 14 hurricanes starting with the letter I that have been retired:\n\nHurricane Ian\n\nHurricane Ida\n\nHurricane Iota\n\nThe Category 4 Hurricane had only just cooled off from a Category 5 hurricane when it made landfall in Nicaragua on Nov. 17, 2020.\n\nDamage estimates are $1.4 billion, according to NOAA.\n\nNOAA also estimated 67 direct deaths and 17 indirect deaths from the hurricane.\n\nIota was the strongest hurricane ever recorded so late in the year.\n\nHurricane Irma\n\nHurricane Ingrid\n\nHurricane Ingrid made landfall as a Category 1 storm in northeastern Mexico on Sept. 16, 2013.\n\nInsured property damage from Ingrid was estimated to be $230 million, according to NOAA.\n\n32 deaths were reported as a result of Ingrid, many from heavy rains and mudslides.\n\nThe same day, Tropical Storm Manuel hit Mexico's Pacific coast.\n\nHurricane Irene\n\nHurricane Irene made landfall in North Carolina as a Category 1 storm on August 27, 2011, according to NOAA.\n\nThe next day, it made landfall again near New York City, sending rare tropical storm conditions through the Northeast and New England.\n\n44 people died in Hurricane Irene.\n\nIt caused an estimated $6.5 billion in damages.\n\nHurricane Igor\n\nHurricane Igor blew by Bermuda as a Category 1 hurricane before hitting Newfoundland on September 21, 2010.\n\nEarly estimates put the damage in Newfoundland at $200 million.

This includes the 3.7 inches included for the month of May and the 1.41 inches that occurred early Thursday morning, accounting for a portion of June's precipitation.\n\nThe total amount of precipitation for the month of May in Amarillo is 7.36 inches; the current record for highest May rainfall is 9.81 inches set in 1951. For the year, Amarillo has seen a total of 9.24 inches. The total average amount of annual precipitation for Amarillo is 19.71 inches. In total, Amarillo had the 6th highest rainfall for the month of May on record.\n\nNWS senior forecaster Douglas Weber said that with the sudden influx of rainfall that we are experiencing in the area, this has caused some major flooding, including areas of Dalhart, Borger and Guymon, Oklahoma, where they have experienced record breaking rainfall.\n\nWeber stated that playa lakes surrounding the Panhandle area are at or exceeding water capacity, and they are beginning to flood due to excess water, as seen in Amarillo with the McDonald Lake located at 45th and Coulter, which is experiencing flooding due to excess runoff from the rainfall.\n\nIn addition to this, the National Weather Service measured the Canadian River to be at 10.3 feet of water just 19 miles north of Amarillo near Hwy. 287. The NWS states that the river is close to reaching its 42-year-record height of 11.88 ft., established in August of 1981. In addition to record heights, the river has also widened to flood many properties in the area, resulting in individual and livestock having to be relocated.\n\nMore:'PLEASE DO NOT': Potter County Sheriff urges locals to not float river in hazardous floods\n\nWith the flooding that the area is already experiencing, Weber says there is even more rainfall to come throughout the week, with little to no stopping.\n\n\"We have thunderstorms pretty much every day this week. One model is showing us (having) a possible 48-hour reprieve in about five or six days from now, followed by another system that comes in. This is definitely a unique pattern; it is definitely something we haven't seen in quite some time. It is too soon to say is it is record breaking, but I have been here for seven years and it is a unique pattern to have received this much rain in a constant period,\" Weber said.\n\nThe meteorologist compares the systems to a similar time period in 2019, where the area saw more than average rainfall. He said this year, we are seeing more rainfall more consistently than the influx we saw in 2019, resulting in the flooding we are seeing throughout the area.\n\nIn a rough estimate created by the NWS for the upcoming week, the Amarillo area is expected to see 1.5 to 3 inches of additional rainfall over the next seven days. In the area from Canadian down to Amarillo to Clarendon and over to Childress, total rainfall is estimated to reach upwards of 3 to 5 inches in the upcoming week.\n\n\"With constant raining every day and with very little breaks, the soil is not getting a chance to dry out so that it can absorb future rainfall amounts,\" Weber said. \"So, it is beginning to almost treat any rainfall that occurs not completely like concrete but not too far off of what it is like for rain to hit concrete, resulting in the waters running to flow into the drainage areas, which we are now beginning to see overflow as well.\"\n\nAs more rainfall occurs, Weber urges individuals to take caution while driving, especially at night where visibility is lowered and rainfall is forecasted to occur.\n\n\"With more rainfall happening especially at night, it is very easy to not know how deep the water is. ... So water that may look a couple of inches, especially in a lower car, you face more risk of entering a flooded area and putting yourself at risk or causing damage to your vehicle. So if you are unsure, turn around don't drown,\" he said.\n\nNWS has issued a flood watch now until June 6 at 7 p.m.; this watch is due to the rise of water levels in our area, including lakes, rivers, creeks, streams, low-lying and flood prone locations and poor drainage areas. The flood watch is currently in effect for portions of the panhandle of Oklahoma, including Cimarron and Texas counties, as well as portions of the Texas Panhandle including Armstrong, Carson, Dallam, Deaf Smith, Hansford, Hartley, Hutchinson, Moore, Oldham, Palo Duro Canyon, Potter, Randall and Sherman counties.\n\nAccording to media reports, the Amarillo Emergency Communications Center received more than a dozen water-stalled vehicle reports overnight Wednesday. And the American Red Cross told media that multiple homes were damaged after flooding in Hereford.\n\nMore:Amarillo: Wastewater spills contained at Hollywood Road Treatment Facility, Osage Street\n\nAll trails were closed Thursday at Palo Duro Canyon Park, which said the hill driving down into the lower portion of the park was blocked on one side by a boulder. A portion of Park Road 5 was closed from the Lighthouse parking lot to Cactus Picnic Area. According to the Canyon Fire Department, the city had received 4.77 inches of rain since Wednesday evening, making many low water crossings in and around Canyon impassable and bar ditches overflow onto roadways. And the Randall County Sheriff's Office said the US Department of Fish and Wildlife was releiving some of the pressure on the Buffalo Lake dam by releasing some of the water down Tierra Blanca Creek, with the water being non-potable to the point of no contact.\n\nThe NWS also warns all individuals to stay away form the Canadian River area; with the fluctuating of water levels, there is a high risk for flooding. The NWS advises individuals to stay off the water as well and advises against any water activities including kayaking, tubing, swimming, and/or boating.\n\n\"All it takes is about 6 inches of rushing water to knock you off your feet and 12 to 18 inches to sweep your car away,\" Weber added, \"so stay on top of the forecast each day, understand the areas with poor drainage and avoid those areas. Understand that with the morning or late afternoon commutes to pay extra attention to the rainfall.\"\n\nRandall and Potter counties, city of Canyon declare local disasters\n\nRandall County Judge Christy Dyer signed a Declaration of Local Disaster related to severe weather and prolonged flooding on Thursday, June 1, the county said in a Thursday afternoon update.\n\n\"The continued rainfall across the panhandle has led to flooding along Tierra Blanca Creek as well as the area inside SW Loop 335 along 77th Avenue,\" a news release states. \"Numerous County roads are currently closed, and swift running water crossing roadways will cause more roads in Randall County to be closed as this event continues.\"\n\nThe release said Judge Dyer, in cooperation with each respective elected body, has ordered Lake Tanglewood, Timbercreek Canyon, The Palisades and River Falls closed to the public for any type of recreational activities under the authority of the declaration. In addition, Buffalo Lake National Wildlife Refuge has been temporarily closed to the public by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. Palo Duro Canyon State Park is currently open, but the county said officials are closely monitoring the situation.\n\n“Protecting the safety of residents as they travel through areas of concern are a priority for Randall County,” said Judge Dyer.\n\n\"The Amarillo Office of Emergency Management is working with the Red Cross to establish shelter locations for citizens affected by the flooding,\" the release said. \"Plans are currently in the works to establish a shelter in Canyon and one in Amarillo.\"\n\nResidents are encouraged to stay home after dark, and officials urge all residents to turn around and not to drive through flooded areas, to prevent accidents and ensure public safety.\n\nIn addition, Canyon Mayor Gary Hinders signed a Declaration of Local Disaster related to severe weather and prolonged flooding on Thursday. The declaration of a local disaster related to severe weather and prolonged flooding cited \"widespread and severe property damage and dangerous conditions.\" Weather conditions pose the threat of continued flooding and carry the imminent potential of endangering lives and damaging property on a large scale. The declaration also mentioned violators could face a fine or jail time.\n\nAs with other areas in the Texas Panhandle, the city of Canyon has experienced continued rainfall leading to city road closures due to swift, running water at high water levels on the road.\n\n“The Canyon area has been impacted by floods in levels we have not seen in many years,” Hinders said in a news release. “The State of Emergency allows us to both protect our citizens and potentially provide assistance to them as we have upcoming weather events predicted by the National Weather Service.”\n\nEarlier in the week, Potter County Fire Rescue said Potter County issued its own Declaration of Local State of Disaster for the northern and northwestern parts of the county, signed by County Judge Nancy Tanner, in response to the ongoing flood emergency. \"Whereas, from May 18, 2023, at the latest, and continuing through the date of this Declaration, portions of northwestern and northern Potter County, Texas, specifically including, but not limited to, the Valle De Oro community and its surrounding area, have suffered, and continue to suffer, widespread and severe damage, loss of property, and the imminent threat of damage, injury, and loss of life and property resulting from flooding,\" the declaration says, it notes flooding has resulted in severe damage to residential property and public and private infrastructure, and has rendered a number of residences and properties inaccessible by roads or motor vehicles, including motor vehicles utilized by first responders.\n\nThe disaster declaration includes, but is not limited to, the Valle de Oro community, its surrounding area and all areas of the Canadian River basin up to the point at which the river flows into Lake Meredith and includes a mandatory evacuation.\n\nThe Potter County action activated emergency plans, \"including authorization for the furnishing of aid and assistance to the affected area and all people located in the affected area.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/12/15/weather-tornadoes-storms-central-us-wednesday/8909238002/", "title": "Weather brings tornadoes, storms to Central US on Wednesday", "text": "Damaging winds are likely to bring down trees and power lines, making widespread power outages possible.\n\nSome 36 million people were under high wind warnings as of midday Wednesday.\n\nThere is also the chance for severe thunderstorms and tornadoes later Wednesday and Wednesday night.\n\nA wild weather day was underway Wednesday across the central U.S., with howling winds, severe storms, tornadoes and even wildfires slamming the region.\n\nDamaging winds have brought down trees and power lines, making widespread power outages possible, the National Weather Service warned.

Power outages will also be possible due to very strong winds.\n\nSevere storms for the South next week\n\nThe threat for severe storms is also increasing across the southern Plains and Gulf Coast region including tornadoes, large hail, and damaging winds.\n\n“While tornadoes in December are relatively uncommon when compared to the springtime, they are often more likely across portions of the Southeast and Lower Mississippi Valley, where there is often a secondary peak in the fall and winter,” Matthew Elliott, a meteorologist at the Storm Prediction Center, told CNN.\n\nCNN Weather\n\nThe severe storm potential begins Monday night across Oklahoma and northern Texas, gradually spreading into Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi on Tuesday.\n\nSevere storms will likely continue Tuesday overnight across the Gulf Coast region. Nocturnal tornadoes are more dangerous because many people are asleep and unaware they need to be seeking a safe location.\n\nWhile the greater tornado threat exists during the day, there is still the possibility for a few rotating storms through the evening hours.\n\nBy Wednesday, the greatest threat exists for an area from New Orleans to Panama City, Florida.\n\n“The details regarding the areas most at risk from tornadoes will become clearer as the event approaches and smaller-scale trends become more evident,” Elliott said.\n\nBecause the forecast can change it is important to pay attention to developments in the coming days.", "authors": ["Allison Chinchar"], "publish_date": "2022/12/10"}]}

There just isn’t enough water in California to satisfy what’s been allotted on paper.\n\nFor years, debate has raged in California about the best way to fix the water rights system for life in the modern era. Many of the senior water rights held in the state were set before 1914 when the permit system was established and when mining was big business.\n\n“It’s an old water system that many perceive isn’t set up to deal with current climatic and hydraulic conditions,” Nathan Metcalf, a water rights attorney for California law firm Hanson Bridgett, told CNN. “It’s just not really set up to deal with climate change and the changing needs for water both from an environmental standpoint, and then there’s also the rub between agriculture and municipal.”\n\nRecognizing the dour effect of climate change on the state’s hydrology, Democrats in California’s Senate have proposed using $7.5 billion in state and federal funds to “build a climate-resilient water system.”\n\nOf those funds, $1.5 billion would be used to buy land with senior water rights from holders willing to sell them voluntarily in prioritized waters. The Democrats argue “fundamental changes” to the state’s water system are “needed to realign demand, supply, and the flexibility of the system.”\n\nThe proposal, which has yet to work its way through the legislature, would look to “retire water use incrementally from multiple water uses in a basin and across wide geographies” which would help provide clean drinking water while also improving fish habitats and wildlife refuge conditions.\n\n“The problem with trying to regulate the senior water rights is that it’s a property interest, so you always run the risk of a takings claim by taking that property,” Metcalf said.\n\nA takings claim could be brought by property owners against the government if it seizes private property for public use. Owners could also make a takings claim if regulations go too far in restricting their use of the land.\n\nBut Metcalf said there could be situations where it’s mutually beneficial for a property owner to cede his or her water rights.\n\n“If it’s economically advantageous for both the farmer and the state to purchase those water rights to put to another use, I think that’s a possibility,” Metcalf said. “I could also see certain agricultural sectors being opposed to that because you never know when or how you’re going to use that water right in the future.”\n\nMetcalf said the government could simply buy senior water rights, which might be an easier option than trying to regulate those rights, which often leads to years of litigation.\n\nA novel approach\n\nIn Northern California, the State Water Board is trying something it has never tried before: a voluntary water sharing agreement for water rights holders in the Upper Russian River watershed in Mendocino and Sonoma Counties.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Climate change is drying up biggest reservoir in US 02:32 - Source: CNN\n\nFor months, rights holders met once a week to come up with an agreement in anticipation of another supply shortage. It’s an effort to avoid curtailments spurred by the severe drought conditions last year, which led to water demand outstripping supply.\n\n“Conditions deteriorated so quickly, there weren’t really alternative options. We had to move forward with the curtailment process. We developed an emergency regulation,” said Sam Boland-Brien, a supervising engineer with the State Water Board. “That resulted in all kinds of surface water users … in the upper part of this watershed having to stop diversions.”\n\nShasta Lake, California's largest water reservoir, has been running well below full capacity this year. George Rose/Getty Images\n\nIn fact, water levels got so low, “there was this really concrete risk that Lake Mendocino up near Ukiah was going to run empty,” Boland-Brien said, adding the storms rolling through in October last year kept the lake from running dry before the end of winter.\n\nComing too close to running out of water was the catalyst to find a better way to share water, he said.\n\nThe State Water Board said more than half of the total eligible water rights holders have signed up for the program, including municipalities along the river which hold the oldest rights in the watershed dating back to the late 1800s as well as local water districts and some larger institutional wineries.\n\nThe more rights holders involved, the better. By enrolling in the program, rights holders committed to a water use reduction of up to 20% to 30% for senior holders. Due to the oppressive drought, cities are also enforcing water conservation. Those water savings are incorporated into what can be shared with other rights holders in the community as well, Boland-Brien noted.\n\nAll the agreements create a pool of water available for more junior rights holders who would have otherwise had their water curtailed. Participants can also do further transfers or exchanges among each other, creating an added level of flexibility.\n\n“What the program achieves is, it smooths out that ‘all or nothing’ aspect of the appropriative system,” Boland-Brien explained. He said a better-managed, voluntary system is more likely to get buy-in from rights holders than state regulatory actions alone.\n\n“Those who still have water rights, produce a little bit,” Boland-Brien said. “They reduced their usage … so those that [have more junior rights] can make it through the irrigation season on a reduced amount.”\n\nAn emergency curtailment regulation remains in place as a backstop for those rights holders who did not join in the program. As water levels continue to drop, curtailments will kick in based on seniority.\n\nThe program went into effect July 1 and will expire at the end of the year, but there’s hope that it could be expanded into the future.\n\n“The idea is that this would continue in future years and so each year there would be a slightly different mix of water supplies and people signed up so that even if you’re a junior some years, you could still benefit from the flexibility,” Boland-Brien said.\n\nA court rules in favor of deviating from the law\n\nThe Upper Russian River program is in line with what Mike Young, a professor at the University of Adelaide and a specialist in water policy reform, says is needed to equitably handle water rights in drought-stricken areas, except, he argues, every rights holder needs to be included in any water-sharing program.\n\n“Everybody has a percentage share of whatever is available and that goes up and down,” Young said to CNN. “Have boards that make decisions in the interest of everybody, and everybody has an incentive to make the system work. The board makes the final decision, and the profits are allocated to shareholders … You run a water accounting system that looks like your bank account.”\n\nIn Nevada, a fight over Diamond Valley’s groundwater rights ended up at the Nevada Supreme Court, which set a precedent when it ruled 4-3 the state engineer can deviate from Nevada’s water laws, which are based on water rights seniority, to regulate Diamond Valley’s water under a new groundwater management plan approved by those water users when supplies are depleting.\n\nAbout four years ago, Young spent time with farmers in Diamond Valley, an area in Eureka County which relies heavily on groundwater; too heavily, Young said. According to the court’s ruling, “the Diamond Valley Hydrologic Basin is over-appropriated and over-pumped, such that groundwater withdrawals from the Basin exceed its perennial yield.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Snow levels in California have experts worried about water supply 02:34 - Source: CNN\n\n“The thing about rivers and groundwater resources is they don’t lie,” Young said, adding in one day, he helped the farmers draft the new groundwater management plan.\n\n“Someone’s got to write the rule book down and the problem is that America doesn’t have a decent rulebook for playing the game called water use,” Young said. He argues developing water accounting systems where the resource is scarce should be basic.\n\n“Every irrigator in the west should have a water account that says how much water they may take from the system,” Young said. “Taking water that is not in your account is seen by everyone as bad as going next door and harvesting their crop.”", "authors": ["Stephanie Elam"], "publish_date": "2022/07/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/28/us/why-grass-lawns-are-bad-for-drought-water-crisis-climate/index.html", "title": "Why the Great American Lawn is terrible for the West's water crisis ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAs California plunges even deeper into its multiyear megadrought after an alarmingly dry winter, officials are eyeing what experts say is one of the leading culprits in the crisis: water-guzzling grass lawns.\n\nResidents and businesses in the counties around Los Angeles were told this week that they would need to limit outdoor water use to one day a week starting June 1. It’s the first time water officials have implemented such a strict rule.\n\n“This is a crisis. This is unprecedented,” said Adel Hagekhalil, general manager of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. “We have never done anything like this before and because we haven’t seen this situation happen like this before.”\n\nThe Great American Lawn has historically been a status symbol and portrayed as a place of leisure and comfort. But they require exorbitant amounts of water to maintain – water that is rapidly running out.\n\nGrass was the single largest irrigated “crop” in America, surpassing corn and wheat, a frequently cited study from NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration found. It noted that by the early 2000s, turf grass – mostly in front lawns – spanned about 63,000 square miles, an area larger than the state of Georgia.\n\nKeeping all that front lawn grass alive requires up to 75% of just one household’s water consumption, according to that study, which is a luxury that California is unable to afford as the climate change-driven drought pushes reservoirs to historic lows.\n\nIn Southern California – dotted with wealthy celebrity mansions and pristine green yards – having conventional grass lawns simply won’t work anymore as the consequences of climate change intensify, said John Fleck, director of the Water Resources Program at the University of New Mexico.\n\n“You want to have some space in your backyard for your kids to play, so a little patch of grass is not terrible,” Fleck told CNN. “It’s just the big expanse of lawn – that’s really not being used other than ‘because it looks pretty’ – that has got to go. That’s what we can’t have anymore.\n\n“We just can’t afford the water for it,” he said.\n\nWater hogs\n\nBurton Agnes Hall in Worcestershire, circa 1880. The obsession with a well-manicured lawn began in England and was adopted in the US -- even in places where grass isn't meant to thrive. Print Collector/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nAmerica’s obsession with grass can be traced back to 17th century England, Fleck said, where meticulously manicured lawns became a “symbol of status and wealth” because of the high cost to maintain them.\n\n“That idea of lawns as a demonstration of status really became embedded in gardening culture in this country with British colonialism, so it sort of traveled west with us and took all that labor in,” Fleck said.\n\nIn the US, grass lawns expanded and thrived on the East Coast, “where it rains all the time, and you don’t need to add a lot of supplemental irrigation water,” Fleck said. And as Americans marched west, they took with them “the landscape they were familiar and comfortable with.”\n\n“The big problem is we have brought grasses to this climate in the Southwest that come from wetter places,” Fleck said. “The classic example is called Kentucky bluegrass.”\n\nKentucky bluegrass, which is native to Europe and Asia but grows particularly well in parts of the Eastern US, requires much more water than the West can offer.\n\nHomes and a golf course in the Summerlin community of Las Vegas.

Fallon/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe water doesn’t last long in the arid Southwest. The hot, dry air evaporates water quickly, which in turn increases the amount needed to saturate a lawn. This effect grows even larger on hot summer days – warmer air can absorb more – which is also when ample water has been hardest to come by.\n\nIn California, the amount of water needed to sustain a grass lawn varies; the state his home to nearly a dozen subclimates that range from wet and cool to hot and dry.\n\nSo a 1,500-square-foot lawn in Crescent City on the northern coast might need 22,000 gallons of water a year, according to the California Department of Water Resources.\n\nBut farther south, the requirement increases dramatically. The same-size lawn in Los Angeles would need 43,000 gallons a year. An hour east of that in Palm Springs, it jumps to 63,000 gallons a year.\n\nNow consider the fact that the average lawn size in California is more like 5,500 square feet, according to HomeAdvisor, and you can see how lawn maintenance in the West could start to make up a significant portion of a household’s water budget.\n\nAround half of urban residential water consumption in California is used for outdoor landscaping, primarily because of its low humidity and scorching hot summers, according to the Department of Water Resources. An average Californian’s indoor water consumption is around 51 gallons a day – or 19,000 gallons per year – according to the agency.\n\nLawn mowers, weed whackers, fertilizer\n\nGrass has a hard time accessing and absorbing water when it's fertilized. Jeff Gritchen/MediaNews Group/Orange County Register/Getty\n\nBesides the intensive water use, gas-powered lawn mowers emit pollutants that can cause cancer and planet-warming gases, which in turn contributes to the climate crisis and the region’s drought.\n\nAccording to the Environmental Protection Agency, gas-powered lawn and gardening equipment released more than 22 million tons of carbon emissions in 2018. Each year, the agency estimates that over 17 million gallons of gasoline are spilled just refueling the equipment.\n\nGrass also has a harder time accessing and absorbing water when it’s fertilized, which means more frequent watering is needed. Fertilizers enhance the growth of the plant, which increases its density both above-ground and below. The roots can become compacted, which ultimately reduces the soil’s ability to hold water.\n\nScientists have linked the use of fertilizers to an increase in evapotranspiration, the process by which water moves from the ground to the air. In the West, the lack of precipitation and an increase in evaporative demand — also known as the “thirst of the atmosphere” — are the two major drivers of the region’s water crisis. Warmer temperatures increase the amount of water the atmosphere can absorb, which then dries out the landscape.\n\nWhat you can do different\n\nGrass-less yards in Boulder City, Nevada. Patrick T. Fallon/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFleck, who lives in a lawn-less suburban home in Albuquerque, said if he did have a grass lawn, it would likely require the same amount of water that a “thrifty indoor water user” consumes in one day.\n\n“If you’re going to have outdoor landscaping, the biggest bang for your ‘water buck’ is trees, not lawns,” he said. “With trees, you get a cooling effect in the urban heat island, you save air conditioning energy from the shade, and in an urban area that struggles with air quality like Southern California does, trees help clean the air.”\n\nSome cities are already addressing excessive water use by offering buyouts for homeowners to replace their grass lawns with alternative such as native plants or xeriscaping.\n\nOne of San Diego’s key water conservation programs pays homeowners to tear out yards full of Kentucky bluegrass and other turf grasses – $4 per square foot – and replace them with far more water-efficient desert plants. Since launching the program, the city says it has successfully replaced 42 million square feet of turf lawns.\n\nA home in the historic Las Palmas neighborhood in Palm Springs, with a combination of grass and xeriscaping in the front yard.

The Colorado River, which provides water for much of Nevada, has been dwindling at an alarming rate. The state’s latest conservation effort would save about 10% of the region’s annual allotment of water from the Colorado River basin.\n\n“Native landscaping makes sense and can be really beautiful,” Fleck said. “One of my favorite Western cities is Tucson, and it has adopted this native landscaping aesthetic and it’s just a gorgeous town, and it just uses a lot less water to do that.”\n\nFleck said he expects “the brown lawn to be a badge of honor” soon.\n\n“It’s like – I am making my contribution to the well-being of our community in this time of crisis by not watering my lawn,” he said. “And I expect that to become the status symbol.”", "authors": ["Rachel Ramirez"], "publish_date": "2022/04/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/16/us/colorado-river-water-lake-powell-flaming-gorge-climate/index.html", "title": "The upstream water used to keep Lake Powell afloat is running out ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nUpstream reservoirs in the Colorado River Basin might not have enough water to keep Lake Powell above a critical threshold indefinitely, federal officials have warned in recent weeks, as the West’s ongoing megadrought saps water from across the West.\n\nThe Flaming Gorge reservoir on the Green River, which this year is releasing a huge amount of water downstream to help Lake Powell, may only have enough water left for two more similar emergency releases, US Bureau of Reclamation officials told CNN, though they have yet to fully model the situation.\n\nFederal officials took emergency steps in May to use water from upstream reservoirs to boost Lake Powell’s level and buy the surrounding communities more time to plan for the likelihood the reservoir will soon fall too low for the Glen Canyon Dam to generate hydropower.\n\nThe dam is a key source of energy in the region, generating power for as many as 5.8 million homes and businesses in seven states, and is at high risk of being forced offline should the lake’s level drop below 3,490 feet above sea level.\n\nLake Powell’s water level was at around 3,529 feet as of Thursday, or 24% full.\n\nWater managers have worked hard to prevent Powell from falling below its critical threshold. Their first step was to release more water from upstream reservoirs in the Colorado River Basin, like Flaming Gorge. The second was to hold back water in Lake Powell itself instead of sending it downstream to Lake Mead, which is the largest reservoir in the country.\n\nBut using water from Flaming Gorge to keep Lake Powell afloat was just “a buffer,” according to Jim Prairie, the agency’s Upper Colorado Basin research and modeling group chief, and couldn’t be a long-term solution. Prairie noted in August, based on its water level at the time, Flaming Gorge would only be able to handle two more similar emergency releases.\n\nVisitors watch the sunrise over Lake Powell, the country's second-largest reservoir. Powell was around 24% full this week. Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images\n\n“What this [process] is doing is just buffering us for a year, and we probably have an opportunity to do that maybe two more times, and then there will be no more capacity,” Prairie said. “So something else will have to fill that 500,000 acre-feet, some other mechanism.”\n\nWater deliveries from Flaming Gorge to Lake Powell are being made in varying amounts each month to fulfill a 500,000 acre-feet total by the end of April 2023, according to the bureau. Because of the release, the level in Flaming Gorge is expected to drop by roughly 9 feet, though it will help increase Lake Powell’s elevation by around 16 feet.\n\nPrairie said the bigger challenge is to find long-term solutions to the basin’s crisis.\n\n“And that’s really the challenge that’s being put forward to all the [Colorado River] Basin states,” he added. “How can we collaborate and work together to find these ways to be able to provide that additional needs at these reservoirs if we want to maintain them?”\n\nEric Kuhn, a retired former manager of the Colorado River Water Conservation District, told CNN that this is not a surprise at all.\n\n“There’s really only one upstream reservoir — Flaming Gorge — that has any significant capacity,” Kuhn said. “And they’ve used it two years in a row to the tune of about 700,000 acre feet.”\n\nNotably, Prairie’s outlook for Flaming Gorge does not take into account future weather in the West. For instance, a wetter-than-average winter this year, which would supplement all the reservoirs in the Colorado River Basin, could negate the need for emergency releases.\n\nBut Kuhn said that wouldn’t be all good news for Lake Powell.\n\n“Refilling these reservoirs that have been drained comes first, that’s where the water goes first,” Kuhn said. “If you rob Peter to pay Paul, the next time we have a decent runoff, a lot of water is gonna go to recovery storage in these upstream reservoirs which will reduce the inflow to Powell, so it reduces the rate of recovery of Powell in a slightly above average, wetter year.”\n\nJustin Mankin, co-lead of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Drought Task Force, previously told CNN managing water in the Colorado River Basin through all of its reservoirs is “kind of like the central bank of an economy, drawing money from local banks to kind of keep the economy afloat.”\n\n“Lake Powell is the central bank of the Colorado River Basin,” Mankin said. “Maybe that’s workable for a little while, but just like a household, the longer it’s in debt, the harder it gets. And it’s really the same thing with these reservoirs.”\n\nThe Flaming Gorge Dam on the Green River in the Colorado River Basin. Robert Gauthier/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images\n\nWithout the emergency steps it took this year, including the Flaming Gorge releases, the bureau estimated there was about a 25% chance the Glen Canyon Dam could have stopped producing hydropower by January.\n\n“Everyone relies on the collective storage of the watershed,” Jack Schmidt, director of the Center for Colorado River Studies at Utah State University, told CNN. “The primary issue is the total storage in the entire system in relation.”\n\nSchmidt said it is important to remember all the reservoirs are connected. The total capacity of all federal reservoirs in the Colorado River Basin is about 58 million acre feet, 50 million of which is Lake Powell and Lake Mead combined.\n\n“If one adds all of the water in all of the reservoirs, then the system is now at 34% of capacity,” Schmidt said.\n\nThe decisions made for Lake Powell will always affect its downstream neighbor, Lake Mead. Because of Lake Mead’s low level, the federal government in August announced additional water cuts for the Southwest, which will start in January 2023.\n\nThe Colorado River Basin provides water and electricity for more than 40 million people living across seven Western states and Mexico, including households, farms, ranches and native communities.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that the Blue Mesa and Navajo Lake reservoirs released supplemental water downstream to Lake Powell this year.

On Thursday, people of Jackson were advised to shower with their mouths closed.\n\nBut the water crisis did not come as a surprise to the city’s longtime residents. Jackson has seen a long string of challenges, including sharp economic declines, demographic changes and a shrinking population since the 1990s that have culminated in a city set up to fail its residents.\n\nMississippi state Rep. Ronnie Crudup Jr., a Jackson Resident, told CNN that by Tuesday, his family had running water, but it was discolored and unsafe to drink.\n\n“This is something that has been occurring for years, but sometimes it takes these catastrophes to make sure that this disaster comes to light,” he said.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about Mississippi’s capital city, and why this crisis has hit at a particularly devastating point in its history.\n\nUnlike other Sunbelt cities, Jackson’s population has steeply declined\n\nWhile other cities in the South have seen their populations swell over the past decade, Jackson is one of just a few major cities in the region that have experienced a sharp population decline, dipping more than 10% in the past decade. Jackson has just over 150,000 residents, down from nearly 200,000 in 1990.\n\nA report published by the Mississippi Urban Research Center about Jackson’s failing water systems says that the city’s population decline has led to increased infrastructure issues and rising costs associated with them. The problem, the report states, was “associated with reduced quality of infrastructure that can further exacerbate population loss and, depending on the location, increase cost burdens on minority and low-income communities.”\n\nThe city has undergone drastic demographic changes\n\nJackson’s population decline has led to dramatic demographic changes, driven almost entirely by White flight. The city was 56% Black in 1990, but by 2020, more than 80% of the city’s residents were Black. In 1997, the city elected its first Black mayor, but by 2000, the city’s White population was rapidly dwindling, down by 16% from the decade before.\n\nThe shift in demographics has not translated to economic growth for the city’s Black population. The city’s two Black business districts, as well as the downtown district, both closed by the 2000s, and many of the city’s social services have dwindled.\n\nAccording to the Mississippi Urban Institute’s report, Black residents have had to bear the brunt of the city’s water crisis.\n\n“There is still the need to equalize the delivery of water services in the older, underserved areas of Jackson, which are predominantly occupied by Black and low-income residents,” the report says, adding that the aging water lines in these areas were the ones “most likely to fail, causing inordinately high maintenance cost.”\n\nHousehold income has shrunk, while nearby suburbs have boomed\n\nJackson’s median household income has shrunk as its demographics have shifted. Mississippi is the poorest state in the nation, with 18.7% of residents living below the poverty line – but in Jackson, that figure is higher still at 24.5%.\n\nMuch of the city’s White flight has been to the nearby counties of Madison and Rankin, home to wealthy suburbs that surround Jackson. Madison County’s population has doubled since 1990, and according to a December 2021 CNN analysis was the only county in Jackson’s metropolitan area with a greater percentage of White people in 2019 than 1990.\n\nJackson’s population is aging, becoming more vulnerable to the effects of the city’s failures\n\nAnother effect of Jackson’s demographic changes is the size of its older population. As the overall population decreases in the city, and fewer new residents take root in the state’s capital city, the share of Jackson’s population that is made up of people over 60 years old has slowly crept upward. The effects of unclean, unusable drinking water could be especially pronounced for the city’s older residents, who may have compounding health issues, and may not be able to wait in long lines for bottled supplies or easily leave their homes.\n\nWhile Jackson’s mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba told CNN on Wednesday that he is hopeful water services can be restored this week, he has also stated that it will take up to $2 billion to repair the city’s aging water infrastructure, which has been slowly failing for years. While running water may be restored, Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves said at a press conference this week that there was no timetable for when they’ll be able to provide clean, drinkable water to the city’s taps, leaving residents in further limbo as the crisis continues.\n\n“We are hopeful that we will be able to increase the quantity of the water which will ultimately get the tanks more full and ultimately lead to a scenario in which we can do the proper testing and actually produce clean water,” the governor said. “But we’re not there yet.”\n\nCNN’s Nicquel Terry Ellis also contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Priya Krishnakumar Christopher Hickey", "Priya Krishnakumar", "Christopher Hickey"], "publish_date": "2022/09/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/12/weather/california-megaflood-study/index.html", "title": "A disastrous megaflood is coming to California, experts say, and it ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nMany Californians fear the “Big One,” but it might not be what you think.\n\nIt’s not an earthquake.

And experts say it would be unlike anything anyone alive today has ever experienced.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN reporter shows impact drought has had on California river 02:37 - Source: CNN\n\nDaniel Swain, a climate scientist with UCLA and a researcher involved in the study, describes a megaflood as, “a very severe flood event across a broad region that has the potential to bring catastrophic impacts to society in the areas affected.” He said a megaflood is similar to the 1,000-year flash flood events seen this summer in the St. Louis area and Kentucky, but across a much wider area, such as the entire state of California.\n\nThese massive floods, which experts say would turn California’s lowlands into a “vast inland sea,” might have previously happened once in a lifetime in the state. But experts say climate change is increasing the likelihood of these catastrophic disasters, causing them to occur more like every 25 to 50 years.\n\nClimate change supercharges heavy rain events, making flash floods occur more regularly, as has been noted several times this summer in Eastern Kentucky, St. Louis, and even in California’s Death Valley National Park.\n\nCalifornia is prone to these floods from atmospheric rivers naturally, and major floods from them have happened before – but climate change is upping the ante, and millions of people could be impacted.\n\nThe study said atmospheric rivers could become consecutive for weeks on end, like seen in this animation. Xingying Huang, one of the authors of the study, made this loop, which illustrates the water vapor transportation and potential precipitation accumulation at selected time slices during the 30-day scenario.\n\nThe area with the most destruction would be the Central Valley of California, including Sacramento, Fresno and Bakersfield, the study’s authors project. The Central Valley, roughly the size of Vermont and Massachusetts combined, produces a quarter of the nation’s food supply, according to the US Geological Survey.\n\nA flood with the size to fill this valley has the potential to be the most expensive geophysical disaster to date, costing upwards of $1 trillion in losses and devastating the state’s lowland areas, including Los Angeles and Orange counties, according to the study.\n\nThat would be more 5 times the cost of Hurricane Katrina, the current costliest disaster in US history.\n\n“Such a flood event in modern California would likely exceed the damages from a large magnitude earthquake by a considerable margin,” the study showed.\n\nIn this photo provided by the National Park Service, Mud Canyon Road is closed due to flash flooding in Death Valley, California. National Park Service/AP\n\nThis study is the first phase of a three-part series studying the effects of a future megaflood event in California. The next two phases are expected to be released in two to three years.\n\n“Ultimately, one of our goals is not just to understand these events scientifically, but it’s also to help California prepare for them,” Swain said. “It’s a question of when rather than if (the megaflood) occurs.”\n\nIt’s happened before. It will happen again, but worse, warns scientists\n\nOver 150 years ago, a strong series of atmospheric rivers drenched the Golden State, causing one of the most exceptional floods in history following a dry spell that had left the West parched for decades.\n\nCommunities were demolished in minutes.\n\nThis 1861 photograph shows flooding in Sacramento. Sacramento Public Library\n\nIt was the winter of 1861-1862 and a historic megaflood transformed the San Joaquin and Sacramento valleys into a “temporary but vast inland sea,” according to the study. Some areas had up to 30 feet of water for weeks, obliterating infrastructure, farmland, and towns.\n\nSacramento, the new state capital at the time, was under ten feet of debris-filled water for months.\n\nThe catastrophe began in December 1861, when nearly 15 feet of snow fell in the Sierra Nevada. Repetitive atmospheric rivers dropped warm rain for 43 days thereafter, dumping water down the mountainous slopes and into the valleys.\n\nFour thousand people lost their lives, one-third of the state’s property was destroyed, a quarter of California’s cattle population drowned or starved, and one in eight homes were a complete loss by floodwaters.\n\nIn addition, one-fourth of California’s economy was obliterated, resulting in a state-wide bankruptcy.\n\nSwain warns a megaflood like this will happen again, but worse and more frequent.\n\nDowntown Sacramento today, which was raised 10-15 feet after the historic floods.

Now, the state’s population is over 39 million.\n\n“When this (flood) occurs again, the consequences would be wildly different than they were back in the 1860s,” Swain said.\n\nClimate change increases the amount of rain the atmosphere can hold and causes more water in the air to fall as rain, which can lead to immediate flooding. Both are and will continue to occur in California.\n\nThe new study shows a rapid increase in the likelihood of week-long, recurring strong-to-extreme atmospheric rivers during the cool season. An atmospheric river is a long, narrow region of heavy moisture in the atmosphere that can transport moisture thousands of miles, like a fire hose in the sky. They usually bring beneficial rainfall to drought-prone regions like California but could quickly become hazardous with a warming climate.\n\nHistorically these winter atmospheric rivers dump feet of snow in the Sierra Nevada, but as climate warms, more of the snow will fall as rain. Instead of melting slowly over time, it all runs off, piles up, and floods immediately.\n\nCalifornia's Central Valley, which produces one-fourth of the nation's food, will be ravaged by a megaflood.

Lingering burn scars from wildfires can create a steep, slick surface for water and debris to flow off. With wildfires becoming larger and burning more area thanks to climate change, more areas are susceptible to these debris flows.\n\nAlthough models show this megaflood is inevitable, experts say there are ways to mitigate excessive loss.\n\n“I think the extent of (megaflood) losses can be significantly reduced by doing certain sorts of things to revamp our flood management and our water management systems and our disaster preparedness,” Swain said.\n\nHuang, a project scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research and a researcher involved in the study, said everyone can make a small effort in combating climate change.\n\n“If we work together to decrease future emissions, we can also reduce the risk of extreme events,” Huang said.", "authors": ["Payton Major Judson Jones Brandon Miller", "Payton Major", "Judson Jones", "Brandon Miller"], "publish_date": "2022/08/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/30/us/california-water-shortage-report-drought-climate/index.html", "title": "More than 70 water agencies in California could face water ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nNearly 20% of California’s urban water agencies reported they could see significant water shortages in the coming months as the state braces for a potential fourth consecutive year of drought.\n\nAfter surveying urban water agencies representing roughly 90% of the state’s population, the California Department of Water Resources early this week released its first annual water supply and demand report that assesses how the state is faring with water supply amid unrelenting drought conditions.\n\nThe assessment, which includes annual data through July 1, found that while a vast majority – 82% – of urban water suppliers who submitted reports say they have enough water to meet projected demand in the coming year, around 18% – 73 out of the 414 water suppliers – reported they will soon face potential shortages.\n\nThis is the first year that California water suppliers are required to submit water shortage reports as climate change strains supply across the state. Water resources officials say that this initial assessment will “serve as a baseline to evaluate if urban water suppliers are accurately assessing their annual water supply and demand.”\n\nAs the critical winter months near, more than 99% of California remains in a drought, according to the US Drought Monitor. Warmer-than-usual temperatures, lack of storms and low snowpack have spurred the region’s historic drought, with the past three years being the driest such period on record for California.\n\nAnd with limited signs of relief in drought conditions, these reported potential water shortages from agencies may only worsen in the coming months. Experts have said that the state needs a well-above-average water year or several wet years in a row to quench the relentless drought and ultimately replenish reservoirs.\n\n“These annual assessments submitted by local agencies are intended to help state and local water suppliers better prepare for current and future droughts,” the water resources department said in a statement.\n\nMost of the agencies that reported potential water shortages are in California’s most populated hydrologic areas, such as Los Angeles, Orange County, San Diego and the San Francisco Bay Area. The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California in particular reported a potential shortage of 43%, but does not take into account the emergency conservation orders in place, like banning outdoor watering, and water that was in storage.\n\nRebecca Kimitch, a spokesperson for the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, told CNN the agency anticipates the acute water shortage to continue into the first part of 2023 and “possibly beyond,” adding that water restrictions will not likely be lifted until California receives much-needed precipitation and more allocations from the state water project.\n\nIn the same region, Las Virgenes Municipal Water District – which serves the affluent haven of Calabasas, home to many A-listers like Kevin Hart and Kim and Kourtney Kardashian – reported potentially facing a 63% water shortage. The agency recently doubled down on water restriction violations for customers by adding water restrictors to the pipes for repeat offenders to sharply reduce a home’s water supply.\n\nThree agencies – Ventura County Waterworks in the Simi Valley and Moorpark Districts and the City of Menlo Park – reported that even after they implement all water conservation efforts or increase supplies that are laid out in their current plans, they still expect to see shortages in the new year.\n\nMeanwhile, 21 urban water suppliers, including the Modesto Irrigation District and the City of Compton Water Department, failed to submit their assessment reports. In a statement, Department of Water Resources officials called the agencies “delinquent suppliers,” reminding them of the importance to “proactively assess supplies and demands in order to be prepared in case of future shortage events.”\n\nOnly water agencies that serve more than 3,000 connections or supply over 3,000 acre-feet of municipal drinking water each year are required to submit assessments. The final report, which the water resources department submitted to the State Water Resources Control Board on Monday, includes assessments conducted by 414 of the 435 local urban water suppliers required to submit. It doesn’t include small water suppliers that have historically faced more water challenges during a drought.\n\nThe department’s report comes about three months after the federal government announced that the drying Colorado River, a key water source for many in the Western states including California, will operate in a Tier 2 shortage condition for the first time starting January 2023. California will not yet have cuts made to the water they receive from the Colorado River, but Kimitch said the dire situation on the river basin might increase the need for more conservation.\n\n“The rest of Southern California will also likely see calls for increased conservation in the coming months, as the region’s other source of imported water, the Colorado River, faces growing constraints,” she said.\n\nKimitch also said the initial call for conservation will likely be voluntary, but unless water supply outlook does not improve, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California may need to implement mandatory water cuts for its entire service area.\n\n“Given the worsening conditions on the river, [the district] does not anticipate having a full Colorado River aqueduct in 2023 or beyond,” Kimitch added. “So our entire service area must take measures to protect our limited Colorado River supplies.”\n\nThe report covers annual data through July 1 and then projects water availability through June 30, 2023.

In Arizona – amid a decades-long megadrought – some communities are facing the very real possibility of losing access to the precious water that remains.\n\nOutside the city limits of Scottsdale, where the asphalt ends and the dirt road begins, is the Rio Verde Foothills community. Hundreds of homes here get water trucked in from Scottsdale, but those deliveries will end on January 1, 2023.\n\nThat’s because last summer, for the first time ever, drought conditions forced the federal government to declare a tier 1 water shortage in the Colorado River, reducing how much Arizona can use.\n\nMeredith Deangelis lives in the community, and the thought of losing access to water keeps her up at night.\n\n“Every time I brush my teeth, I think, ‘Oh my gosh, I can’t imagine that I’m not going to have water to brush my teeth,’” Deangelis told CNN.\n\nScottsdale’s water department told CNN in an email that “Scottsdale has continued to be a good neighbor in allowing Rio Verde to temporarily use its water supply.” The department said that due to the current water shortage, by law it “must dedicate its limited water supply to its residents.”\n\nDeangelis and her neighbors are hoping to find another water source to purchase for their homes, but in order to do that they must get certain approvals from their county, which has not happened yet.\n\n“To think, I have this beautiful home and I’m not going to be able to live here because water is not going to be approved and provided to my home is just incredibly unnerving and stressful,” Deangelis said.\n\nA dry irrigation canal that runs through land farmed by Tempe Farming Company, in Casa Grande, Arizona.

Darryl Webb/AP\n\nOn the western border of Arizona, acres of farmland are luring big-city investment firms to rural Cibola. The land there comes with water rights to the Colorado River, a prized possession in a drought-ravaged state.\n\nGreenstone, a Phoenix-based investment firm, bought nearly 500 acres with the intent to sell the land’s water allotment to Queen Creek, a growing Phoenix suburb about 200 miles away.\n\nHolly Irwin, a district supervisor in La Paz County, home to Cibola, is fighting the plan.\n\n“We are what I call the ‘sacrificial lamb’ for the bigger areas,” Irwin told CNN. “In my opinion, look somewhere else – we need to be able to sustain ourselves.”\n\nThe scarcity of water in the state is pitting small towns against fast-growing metropolitan communities.\n\nQueen Creek’s utility director, Paul Gardner, says the community has a 100-year supply of groundwater, but he’s planning for the decades beyond that to make sure the community will always have a sustainable water source.\n\n“We are looking at every possible volume of water that can be acquired and transferred legally in the state,” Gardner said.\n\nGrady Gammage, an attorney representing the Greenstone investment firm, told CNN that the water can be transferred to wherever the owner chooses.\n\n“It doesn’t somehow default to communities on the river if it isn’t transferred,” Gammage said in an email. “The Cities along the river currently use less than half of their existing municipal entitlement. They can likely triple their population under their existing allocations before they would need to acquire additional water.”\n\nBut Irwin argues if this one water transfer is allowed, it will open the door to many other large investment firms buying up the land and water rights in her community.\n\n“My main concern with all of this is the precedent that is setting, that is what’s so scary,” Irwin told CNN. “This water needs to remain here it was meant to remain here for future development.”\n\nBoth communities say these water rights are key to their sustainability. The federal Bureau of Reclamation will make the final decision on whether to approve the water transfer. The agency did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts and Rep. Ro Khanna, a Democrat from California, recently introduced a bill aimed at preventing large corporations from profiting off water rights.\n\n“Water is a human right and Wall Street shouldn’t be allowed to use this vital resource to make profits at the expense of hardworking Americans,” Warren said in a statement.\n\nArizona’s population growth and extreme drought have increased demand for water in limited supply.\n\nKathleen Ferris, a senior research fellow with the Kyl Center for Water Policy in Arizona, says water scarcity in the state has resulted in the “haves” and the “have nots,” and likened the coming water battles to the days of the Wild West.\n\n“Once you have your water rights, you defend it,” Ferris said. “That’s the way it works.”\n\nAs the climate crisis continues unchecked, so, too, will the water wars in the nation’s driest states.", "authors": ["René Marsh"], "publish_date": "2022/03/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/03/us/las-vegas-new-mexico-water-crisis-climate/index.html", "title": "This city has around 20 days of fresh water left.

Then, an unusually wet monsoon season brought significant summer rainfall – something that would typically be celebrated in the drought-stricken West, but instead has led to disaster-upon-disaster as rainfall washed the charred debris into the region’s water system.\n\nNow, one of the city’s two reservoirs is filled with contaminated water that the current filtration system cannot handle. It’s also a health risk – when carbon reacts with high levels of chlorine used to treat water, it can become carcinogenic.\n\n“We need to get the carbon out of the water before we add disinfection,” Las Vegas Utilities Director Maria Gilvarry told residents at a recent forum.\n\nWith time running out to secure a new clean source, city officials plan to spend this weekend testing and pre-treating the water from a nearby lake, hoping it can provide enough to keep the taps running clear.\n\n“Our fingers are crossed on that,” Las Vegas Mayor Louie Trujillo told CNN, adding the tests “will determine the quality of water we’re going to be sending to one of our reservoirs.”\n\nIt could take multiple days to complete the tests and pretreatment to get it right; Gilvarry told CNN the key is finding the right level of chemicals that will make the water drinkable, but not too much to create carcinogenic byproducts in the supply.\n\nA water treatment plant employee holds up a contaminated water sample from the Gallinas River in early August. Brittany Peterson/AP\n\nIf the quality of the new water source is good enough to run through the city’s water infrastructure, that will buy it a few more months of water, which officials are hoping is enough time to install another treatment system capable of processing the sediment-heavy water in their second, currently unusable reservoir. If not, city and state officials may have to implement a boil order or take other actions to ensure clean water; but it’s too early to tell what those actions may be, Gilvarry said.\n\nIt’s a particularly frustrating situation, given just how good this year’s monsoon season was.\n\n“After the biggest fire in the state’s history, we had the best monsoon season in probably 14 years,” Trujillo told CNN. “Unfortunately, we weren’t able to use any of that water that was coming down our river because it was too heavily polluted for the treatment facility that we currently have.”\n\nGiant trees, tiny particles\n\nThe West’s megafires do more than burn trees and shrubs. A massive, hot fire also completely changes the composition of the soil, making it less stable, more prone to erosion and therefore more likely to wash into the water system.\n\nIn the case of Las Vegas, the huge burn scar from Calf Canyon/Hermits Peak Fire combined with hard monsoon rainfall resulted in thousands of acres of ash and debris falling into the Gallinas River watershed.\n\nWhen the erosion happened, it posed dual threats to the city’s water supply. One was that trees and rocks could fall into the river and damage water infrastructure. The other was that ashy sludge could contaminate the water itself.\n\nThe US Army Corps of Engineers constructed debris catchment nets that have prevented damage to water infrastructure itself, said Army Corps Capt. Robert Zebrowski, and they “fortunately haven’t had a giant flow of trees.”\n\nThe Calf Canyon/Hermits Peak Fire burned hundreds of thousands of acres near Las Vegas, New Mexico, earlier this summer. Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nBut the smaller particles have been much harder to control.\n\nThe Army Corps installed wattles – mesh nets filled with hay – along the watershed to try to catch the ashy sludge before too much got into the water system. It has succeeded in slowing the contamination but isn’t a solution to the problem, Zebrowski said.\n\n“There’s no way to stop all ash from getting in everywhere,” Zebrowski added.\n\nGilvarry said that even if they can secure a clean backup source, there will be some amount of sediment in the drinking water for the next decade, simply because the fire burned such a large swath of the land surrounding Las Vegas.\n\nLiving with less\n\nAs Las Vegas counts down the days that it still has potable water, residents have been living with less and less.\n\n“It’s pretty critical at this point, we’re doing all we can,” Trujillo said, adding citizens have been asked to reduce their water usage down to 44 gallons of water a day per person, conserving as much water as possible.\n\nThis collective conservation has bought Las Vegas more time. Gilvarry told CNN that it has allowed city officials to stretch out their untainted reservoir – approximately a week longer than earlier estimates.\n\nBradner Reservoir, which supplies drinking water for the city of Las Vegas, New Mexico.

Trujillo is hoping the immediate crisis can help spur a longer-term solution.\n\n“The silver lining for me is the most permanent solution to this is to replace our water treatment facility and improve some of our infrastructure,” he said. “That’s still a ways away, but it’s within grasp now.”", "authors": ["Ella Nilsen"], "publish_date": "2022/09/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/15/us/california-water-usage-increase-drought-climate/index.html", "title": "California is in a water crisis, yet usage is way up. Officials are ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nCalifornia is facing a crisis. Not only are its reservoirs already at critically low levels due to unrelenting drought, residents and businesses across the state are also using more water now than they have in seven years, despite Gov. Gavin Newsom’s efforts to encourage just the opposite.\n\nNewsom has pleaded with residents and businesses to reduce their water consumption by 15%. But in March, urban water usage was up by 19% compared to March 2020, the year the current drought began. It was the highest March water consumption since 2015, the State Water Resources Control Board reported earlier this week.\n\nPart of the problem is that the urgency of the crisis isn’t breaking through to Californians. The messaging around water conservation varies across different authorities and jurisdictions, so people don’t have a clear idea of what applies to whom. And they certainly don’t have a tangible grasp on how much a 15% reduction is with respect to their own usage.\n\nKelsey Hinton, the communications director of Community Water Center, a group advocating for affordable access to clean water, said that urban communities — which typically get water from the state’s reservoirs — don’t seem to understand the severity of the drought in the way that rural communities do, where water could literally stop flowing out of the tap the moment their groundwater reserves are depleted.\n\n“In our work every day, people feel how serious this is, and know that we need to be working toward real solutions to address ongoing drought,” Hinton told CNN. “But then living in Sacramento, you don’t see the same urgency here because we’re not reliant on groundwater and scarce resources in the same way that these communities are.”\n\nBut advocates say government officials are also focusing on the wrong approach. They say voluntary residential water cuts are not the solution, and that restrictions should be mandated for businesses and industries that use the vast majority of the state’s water.\n\n“Corporate water abuse has to be addressed or no other measures will matter,” said Jessica Gable, a spokesperson for Food & Water Watch.\n\n“The perception in California right now is it’s no secret any longer that drought is linked with climate change,” Gable told CNN. “But there has been no effort to curtail the industries that are using the most water, which are coincidentally the industries that are also sending out the most emissions that are fueling the climate crisis.”\n\nOnus misplaced\n\nMost of March’s spike in water usage came from water jurisdictions in Southern California. Usage in the South Coast hydrologic region, which includes Los Angeles and San Diego County, was up 27% over March 2020, for example, according to data provided by the state’s water board. Only the North Coast region saved water in March, cutting about 4.3% of its use.\n\nEdward Ortiz, spokesperson for the State Water Resources Control Board, said March was a huge setback for the governor’s water goals.\n\n“This is a concerning development in our response to the drought as a state,” Ortiz told CNN. “Making water conservation a way of life is one way Californians can respond to these conditions. Saving water should be a practice whatever the weather.”\n\nHe said Californians “need to redouble efforts to conserve water inside and outside of our homes and businesses.”\n\nLast month, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California announced its most severe water restrictions for residents and businesses in the counties around Los Angeles, with a goal of slashing water use by at least 35%. Beginning June 1, outdoor water usage will be limited to one day a week.\n\nSprinklers water fields in Kern County. Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nBut community advocates say residents wonder whether big water users are also faced with the same pressure and painful decisions to conserve – namely, agriculture that requires a large amount of water (things like almonds, alfalfa, avocado and tomatoes) or fracking, where tens of millions of gallons of water can be used to frack a single fossil fuel well.\n\nGable said that while every little bit matters, the repeated pleas for individuals to save water can “seem out of touch at best and possibly negligent,” given that the industries that could drastically cut back on the excessive amount of water allocated to them are rarely held accountable.\n\nAmanda Starbuck, research director with Food & Water Watch, said cutting back on residential water use is like telling people recycling could save the planet. While it’s a meaningful action, she said it’s not going to make a dent in the crisis at large.\n\n“It’s also kind of a little bit demeaning to blame residential use for these crises,” Starbuck told CNN. “It’s just a small sliver of the overall consumption. It’s a much bigger problem, and we really need to start bringing in these big industries that are guzzling water during this time of drought.”\n\nA spokesperson for Newsom’s office told CNN that local water agencies have set new targets since March that should lead to lower usage — including the outdoor watering restriction — and more decisions are coming in front of the state board this month.\n\n“We are hopeful these actions will significantly contribute to the state’s overall water reduction goals as outdoor watering is one of the biggest single users of water,” the spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nThe spokesperson also pointed to additional funding for water resiliency the governor announced in his budget proposal on Friday. That funding is part of $47 billion slated to tackle the impacts of the climate crisis in the state.\n\n“With the infusion of additional funding, we will be able to more effectively reach Californians about the need to conserve along with the biggest water saving actions they can take, and support local water districts in responding to the drought emergency,” the spokesperson said.\n\nOther sources are running dry\n\nWhile much of the water conversation is focused on urban usage, Hinton said rural communities live with day-to-day anxiety that the water will stop flowing.\n\n“The bigger story, at least for us, is when we are in the middle of drought like this, it’s not just shorter showers and stopping outdoor water use for our families,” Hinton told CNN. “Our families are worried that their water is just going to stop running all together.”\n\nThese are communities that don’t rely on reservoirs — where much of the focus has been for reaching critically low levels — but instead use private groundwater wells.\n\nThe big concern is that during extremely dry conditions, the state’s groundwater levels sink while more is pulled up for agriculture and other uses.\n\n“The urgency is there with the families we work with, because they know what’s happened before,” she said. “We have folks who have had wells dry up since the last drought and have still not been able to afford to deepen them or get connected to a long-term solution.”\n\nBlistering heat waves, worsening drought and destructive wildfires have plagued the West in recent years. As these vivid images of climate crisis play out, Hinton believes the state needs to prioritize the water needs of individuals over industry.\n\n“Climate change has made drought a reality for us forever, and now, this is something that we have to deal with as a state,” Hinton said. “And the more that we can accept that and be proactive, the less we’re going to be constantly reacting to these situations of entire communities going dry or of urban areas having to cut water to this amount because we’ve already overused what was available to us.”", "authors": ["Rachel Ramirez"], "publish_date": "2022/05/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/08/us/jackson-flint-water-crisis-trust/index.html", "title": "For Jackson and Flint, the water may be back but the trust is gone ...", "text": "Jackson, Mississippi, and Flint, Michigan CNN —\n\nSix-year-old Charles Wilson V is scared to drink out of the water fountain at his school.\n\n“I will die,” he says matter-of-factly when asked the reason why.\n\nIt’s a fear his father agrees with.

It’s imperative that we correct this long-standing issue,” he told CNN while in Jackson this week.\n\nHe also wants to look forward. “We didn’t get into this situation overnight,” he said of Jackson, adding there was no quick fix. “But we’re working around the clock as quickly as possible to provide some stability to the system.”\n\nPassersby are still warned to keep away from the Flint River, years after the city's water crisis came to light. CNN\n\nHe pointed to the new Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and hoped investment would rebuild trust as well as pipes and pumps.\n\nMaura Allaire, an assistant professor of Water Economics and Policy at the University of California, Irvine, said the new federal money was much needed but would not be able to cover the full investment gap.\n\nAnd more people are at risk than the residents of Flint and Jackson, she said.\n\n“The good news is that the vast majority of water systems do deliver safe drinking water, so the majority of the US population does receive reliable water supply,” she said.\n\n“The problem is about 7% or 8% of water utilities each and every year fall behind and do not meet national EPA standards and this equates to 21 million Americans not receiving water that is up to standard.”\n\nAnd if water – essential to life – becomes tainted, the effects spread far and fast.\n\n“It makes us sick, my kids sick,” said Mirambi Ford, a mother of five, in Jackson. “My little one-year-old, I don’t even know what to do because he can’t even talk. So, all he does is cry and there’s nothing I can do.”\n\nFord was raised in Jackson, has family all around and wants to stay. But that may not be possible.\n\n“I’ll never give up on my kids,” she said. “I’m trying my best not to give up on Jackson, but it seems to the point where it’s getting unbearable.”\n\nCharles Wilson has no intention of giving up on his child either. When he was a baby Wilson says he paced the halls thinking of ways to protect his namesake. He is determined to help this son live his best life even if government officials have failed them.\n\n“What if it was your child, your family who had no safe water?” he wants to ask of the leaders.\n\nBut it’s his child and he will look out for him.\n\nWith the schools back open in Jackson, he sends his boy off to learn. With bottled water in his book bag.", "authors": ["Sara Sidner Meridith Edwards", "Sara Sidner", "Meridith Edwards"], "publish_date": "2022/09/08"}]}

The Fitbit Charge 5 can give you the extra boost of motivation you need, especially heading into the new year. Our favorite fitness tracker has a long battery life of up to seven days, a touchscreen that automatically adjusts to lighting conditions, and is waterproof.

Instant Pot Duo\n\nThis baby can make pretty much anything you can dream of—soups, stews, full chickens, meat loaf, even yogurt. The super popular cooking device can help you get into the habit of cooking every night instead of ordering takeout. If the Instant Pot was running for election in 2022, it would be a guaranteed victory.\n\nGet the Instant Pot Duo from Amazon for $119\n\n3. Imperfect Foods subscription\n\nIt seems like 2022 is going to be a year when sustainability and reducing waste becomes more prevalent in everyone’s lives. Might as well join in on saving the planet with saving some veggies first. Imperfect Foods delivers, you guessed it, imperfect, e.g., “ugly” fruits and veggies to your doorstep that would otherwise be tossed in a landfill. Twisted carrots, slightly bruised apples, and funky-shaped potatoes are all types of produce you can get in your delivery. Do they look a bit strange? Yes. But do they taste any different? Absolutely not. One of our writers tested the subscription service this year and not only loved that she was “saving” produce from being wasted but she also realized she was eating better.\n\nSee Imperfect Foods for pricing and delivery options\n\n4. iMovR Standing Desk\n\nI don’t know about you, but when I sit at my desk for too long, my legs get cramped, shoulders tense up, and I generally start to feel like an office slug. However, when we tested the best standing desks, it was a true workday game changer. Instead of hunching over my computer all day, I felt like I had space to breathe and room to stretch while up at my standing desk. We liked the iMovR Lander Desk for its ample space for your laptop and knick knacks, as well as easy-to-use buttons to control the height of the desk. Investing in a standing desk this year might just make you feel like you got a brand new job.\n\nGet the iMovR Electric Adjustable Standing Desk from iMovR for $1,498\n\n5.

Along with thousands of other happy and healthy people, our Executive Editor, Megan McCarthy, is a big fan of the weight loss app. She loves that it's very easy and straightforward to use and that, not only did she lose weight, she also improved her relationship with food and her body along the way.\n\nSign up for a Noom trial\n\n6. Philips Air Fryer XXL\n\nAir fryers used to be something that made people wrinkle their brow in confusion, but it seems like the past few years they’ve been popping up on kitchen counters across the country. If you just can’t seem to cut deep-fried foods out of your diet, air frying them is the next best thing. Our favorite air fryer does a great job of providing the perfect crispiness to French fries and fried chicken, without the mess (or calories) of submerging them in hot oil. At this point, anything that can make fries even one percent healthier is a true miracle.\n\nGet the Philips Air Fryer XXL from Amazon for $199.95\n\n7. lululemon Reversible Yoga Mat\n\nYoga mats are useful for two types of people: Those who won’t stop saying how yoga changed their life... and everyone else. For the hardcore yogi and the total beginner, yoga provides a low-impact way to stretch and strengthen the body. Whether you’re toting our favorite yoga mat to a strenuous heat yoga class or simply turning on some YouTube yoga in the living room, this mat will ensure zero slippage and adequate cushioning.\n\nGet the Reversible Mat from lululemon for $78\n\n8. Magic Bullet Blender\n\nGetting healthy is the marriage of two activities, exercising and eating right. However, nothing makes eating right more fun than making smoothies. It’s basically like drinking milkshakes in disguise, filled with fruits and veggies instead of ice cream. Our favorite smoothie blender can whip up an easy morning breakfast or a post-workout treat in seconds. Added bonus: It won't take up too much cabinet space either.\n\nGet the Magic Bullet Personal Blender from Amazon for $26.88\n\n9. 90 Degree by Reflex Power Flex Leggings\n\nI don’t understand the hype around super-pricey leggings.

You can snag these leggings by 90 Degree online for a few dollars more. Whether I’m heading to a spin class, doing yoga at home, or crossing the finish line at the Boston Marathon, you can bet I’m wearing my 90 Degree leggings.\n\nGet 90 Degree by Reflex Women's Power Flex Leggings from Amazon for $26.99\n\n10. Home Chef meal kit delivery\n\nThe hardest thing about cooking (and therefore eating healthy) is the preparation. You have to make sure you have the right ingredients, find time to go to the grocery store, avoid people you know while inside the grocery store (just me?), then lug all of your bags back inside your home. No wonder so many people give up and just go for takeout. Enter, Home Chef. The best meal kit subscription we’ve ever tested will have your meals fully stocked with ingredients and ready to hit the table in about half an hour. With gluten-free, vegetarian, and even vegan options, you can ensure you’ll have a healthy home-cooked dinner, without any of the hassle.\n\nShop Home Chef starting at $8.99/serving\n\n11.

Plus, you can work out pretty much every part of your body by using them. Resistance bands are great for someone getting back into a workout routine, too—no scary machines to decipher, just colorful bands to play with.\n\nGet the Fit Simplify Resistance Loop Exercise Bands from Amazon for $11.95\n\n12. LuxFit Foam Roller\n\nPre-workout? Foam-roll. Post-workout? Foam-roll. Just aimlessly watching TV? Foam-roll. Starting a new fitness routine comes with plenty of aches and pains. Instead of shelling out cash for a one-time massage, investing in our favorite foam roller is the answer. It’s (kind of) like having a masseuse constantly available in the living room, which is pretty much everyone’s dream, anyway.\n\nGet the LuxFit Foam Roller from Amazon for $35.06\n\n13. Mpow Flame Wireless Bluetooth Headphones\n\nThere’s something terrible about being on cardio equipment at the gym and being forced to listen to the soft rock that’s piped in. That, plus the grunting of other people as they lift weights, is enough to make you give up your New Year's Resolution entirely. Do yourself a favor and pick up these waterproof headphones that cost just $20 that our executive editor prefers to AirPods. Just let these live in your gym bag and never again will you have to listen to the cacophony around you—or your dreaded inner monologue—during another workout.\n\nGet the Mpow Flame Wireless Bluetooth Headphones from Walmart for $22.99\n\n14. The Mirror\n\nThe only thing better than a workout class? Not having to leave home to go to one. Our e-commerce editor tested and loved The Mirror, which doubles as both a projector/TV screen of on-demand fitness classes and (yes) a mirror. During the workout, fitness instructors appear on The Mirror, coaching you through exercises that are effective and also don’t take up too much floor space. Once the workout is done, all you do is turn it off and you have a beautiful piece of home decor hanging on your wall. What’s not to love? Well, now that you ask... the price. The Mirror is a serious investment, but one worth making if you want to take your love of studio classes to the next level and bring them into your home.\n\nGet The Mirror for $1,495 and $39 per month for a subscription\n\n15. Brita Stainless Steel Filtering Water Bottle\n\nI’m not exaggerating when I say that there is an entire drawer in my kitchen devoted to water bottles. Excessive? Yes. But I truly feel somewhat naked when I am without one. My go-to favorite that has been by my side for a decade is my Nalgene. It has survived high school sports, college athletics, and is now banging around the inside of my bag while I bring it to every fitness class Boston has to offer. (Now that I think about it, it has been to an insane amount of places and I should probably clean out my water bottle more often.)\n\nIn our testing, the Brita Stainless Steel Filtering Bottle came out on top as our favorite water bottle. The wide mouth ensures ice cubes will fit in and the premium insulation means the water will stay cold for up to 24 hours straight.\n\nGet the Brita Stainless Steel Filtering Water Bottle from Amazon for $24.99\n\n16. FWOD Nation Speed Jump Rope\n\nIntimidated by cardio? Just pretend you’re on the playground again. The Survival and Cross jump rope is far from the tattered skipping ropes you used in elementary school, though. Originally designed for boxing gyms, this adjustable rope allows for people of any height—even over six feet tall—to tailor the length to their needs.\n\nGet the WOD Nation Speed Jump Rope from Amazon for $17.99\n\n17. Vegetti Spiralizer\n\nI recently hopped on the “zoodles” bandwagon and I’m never getting off. Yes, it does take a bit of tricking your brain, telling it that you’re eating mounds of pasta when in reality you’re just eating mounds of zucchini (or whatever vegetable you spiralized). The best spiralizer we’ve ever tested is small, simple to wash, and stores easily in your kitchen when not in use. It takes just minutes to go from whole vegetable to veggie noodles, steaming or sautéing in a pan. More veggie noodles 2022! End rant.\n\nGet the Vegetti Spiralizer from Amazon for $9.99\n\n18. Garmin Forerunner 245\n\nI will be the first to admit this, but I am a full-blown slave to my Garmin watch. This watch was my little buddy on all of my marathon training runs, beeping every mile to tell me my pace and let me know how many miles I’ve gone, based on its GPS tracking. It’s a great tool for measuring your progress on each workout and over a training cycle. Buyer beware: I become a different person when I strap mine on my wrist, absolutely obsessed with my pace and if I can set a personal best (because of course, this watch keeps track of all of your best times, too).\n\nGet the Garmin Forerunner 245 Music from Amazon for $274.99\n\n19. Figs Compression Socks\n\nThe best part about working out? Recovering after. The best tool you can have on your side (aside from a foam roller, see above): compression socks. These snug, stretchy socks gently apply pressure to the feet and calves to help improve blood circulation. So whether you’re just watching TV or running errands after the gym, pop on a pair of the best compression socks we’ve ever tested, and let them help ease your post-workout soreness.\n\nGet Compression Socks from Figs for $28\n\n20. Blender Bottle\n\nYou don’t need to have a gigantic container of whey powder sitting on top of your fridge to be the proud owner of a Blender Bottle. It's ideal for mixing up protein and supplement shakes, but the whisk-like ball works well for powdered hydration drinks, too. Regardless of your pre- or post-workout drink of choice, the leak-proof bottle is great for on-the-go sipping.\n\nGet the Blender Bottle Classic Shaker Bottle from Amazon for $9.97\n\nMake 2022 the year of good decisions.

Watch out for these red flags | CNN ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe strong labor market has given us near record low unemployment, higher wages – and an unfortunate uptick in the number of reports of job seekers getting scammed.\n\n“We are definitely seeing job scams,” said Rhonda Perkins, attorney and chief of staff of the Federal Trade Commission’s division of marketing practices. In 2021, the agency received more than twice the number of job scam reports than in 2020, Perkins said. And in the first quarter of this year, there’s been more than 16,000 complaints filed.\n\nJob scams have been around for a while and the tactics scammers use can vary. Some will try to gain access to your personal information, while others might solicit payments from you or hire you for an illegal task, such as reshipping luxury goods that were bought using stolen credit cards.\n\nSo if you’re looking for a job, here are some of the red flags experts say to look for when reviewing potential opportunities:\n\nThe job post is flashy, but offers few details\n\nIn a job seekers’ market, employers are trying to stand out. But if a job posting is all about making money quickly or other big promises – proceed with caution.\n\n“If a job ad is using too-good-to-be-true terms like: ‘quick money,’ or ‘unlimited earnings potential,’ or ‘laptop for free’ and has very few skill requirements … and a lot of caps and images to distract you, it just doesn’t come across professionally,” said Sara Sutton, CEO and founder of FlexJobs.\n\nIf you are unsure of the legitimacy of a post, check to see if you can find the opening posted directly on the company’s website.\n\nYou have questions, but they don’t have the answers\n\nGetting a call from a recruiter is flattering, but make sure they are who they say they are – especially if it’s for a job you didn’t apply for.\n\n“Pay attention to the questions they are asking you,” said Sutton. “If the recruiter is offering you a job very quickly without verifying your work experience or asking for references and moving very, very quickly – those are also red flags.”\n\nIf the job description was overly vague, be sure to ask for more details about the position, duty expectations and experience requirements.\n\n“They will definitely run from you when you start asking more questions,” said Sinem Buber, lead economist at ZipRecruiter. “If they start giving you inconsistent answers or not answering your questions properly, you know that’s not a real job.”\n\nSutton added that scammers can fraudulently use a company’s name and recommended to check the recruiter’s email is legit. For instance, if the domain is “company-inc.com” versus “company.com,” she advised looking online to see what the company uses.\n\nThey ask for personal information\n\nJob applications tend to include questions like your name, address, contact information and work experience, but it shouldn’t go much deeper than that.\n\n“If they are asking you to provide personal information upfront during the interview stages, like your Social Security number for a background check … no legitimate company asks for a background check or Social Security number during the interview stage. That happens after you are hired,” said Buber.\n\nBefore giving out any personal information, Perkins recommended doing some online research. “Look up the name of the company, the person who claims to be hiring you, plus the word ‘scam,’ ‘review,’ or ‘complaint’… and don’t trust reviews on the company’s website. Those could be fake.”\n\nThey ask for payment\n\nThe only conversation you should be having with a potential employer about money should be about compensation. If they ask you to pay any fees for things like special services, training or software or equipment, that should be a major red flag.\n\n“Don’t pay for the promise of a job, don’t make an upfront payment to get a job – only scammers will ask you to do that,” said Perkins.\n\nThere’s also a fake check scam that can involve a bogus company sending you too large a check for you to buy something like computer equipment and then asks you to repay the excess funds via a wire transfer service, cryptocurrency or gift cards.\n\nThese forms of sending money are hard for law enforcement to trace and people to get their money back, Perkins explained.\n\n“Under the law, banks are required to make the money available quickly, so when you deposit a check and it looks like it’s cleared that doesn’t mean it’s a good check,” said Perkins. “The bank will find out later it’s a bad check.”", "authors": ["Kathryn Vasel"], "publish_date": "2022/06/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2023/05/05/teachers-appreciation-week-2023-ideas-companies-donate/70179499007/", "title": "Teacher Appreciation Week 2023: Food deals, discounts for educators", "text": "With the end of the school year approaching, teachers are being recognized with specials at retailers and restaurants across the U.S. for Teacher Appreciation Week.\n\nFormer first lady Eleanor Roosevelt began the effort to create Teacher Appreciation Week and National Teachers Day when she urged Congress in 1953 of the need for a day recognizing teachers, according to School Specialty.

Ninth Ave.\n\nLooking for wood-fired pizza? Look no further than Tuscan Oven, opened by Ted and Deanna Lamarche in 2004. This unique pizza restaurant features a 2-ton, 500-degree, hardwood-fired oven made of brick, pumice and clay to bake up some authentic Southern Italian-style pizza.\n\nYou can expect a pie that is thin but has a nice, chewy crust around the edge, some zesty marinara and fresh homemade dough.\n\nSky's Pizza Pie\n\n5559 N. Davis Highway A\n\nIf you don't know about Sky's Pizza Pie then this is probably your first time in Pensacola, your plane has just landed and you haven't been approached by one of the restaurant's fanatical fans.\n\nEver since the restaurant was semi-rebranded in 2013, Sky's has had a near cult-like following because it's about as close as you can get to New York-style pizza here in the Panhandle. We'll let the pizza speak for itself.\n\nEast Hill Pizza\n\n2030 N. 12th Ave.\n\nEast Hill Pizza is one of the newer kids on the block as it was formally known as Chubby's Pizza until TJ and Darlyne Zoltak purchased the restaurant in 2018. Since then, EHP has quickly become a local favorite.\n\nThe restaurant underwent a big renovation in 2018, but the husband-wife duo decided to stick with what made Chubby's great: Its recipes. You can choose from four specialty pizzas — each named after a road in East Hill — build your own or go for something a little different with wings, stromboli, pizza bowls and more.\n\nGraffiti Pizza\n\n210 Palafox Place\n\nGraffiti Pizza is another relatively new pizza place that opened in June 2018. The concept was inspired to celebrate local artists and displays various artwork throughout the location. And the pizza is just as good as the artwork.\n\nGraffiti offers made-to-order specialty pizzas that you can also order by the slice in addition to full pies. Almost like a mash-up of Tuscan Oven and Sky's, you can expect a thin slice with a chewy crust cut into a 20-inch slice.\n\nNew Yorker Deli\n\n3001 E. Cervantes St.\n\nNew Yorker Deli could be nominated for Pensacola's most driven-past-but-not-eaten-at restaurant. But if you know, you know.\n\nDespite what its name might imply, you're not going to find New York thin crust-style pizza here, oh no. Made with a handmade sauce and hand-tossed dough, these hefty pies will sail you straight into flavor town with specialties like Italian, Athenian, meat lovers, white sauce or even a cauliflower-crust pizza.\n\nO'zone Pizza Pub\n\n1010 N. 12th Ave.\n\nElbow Room, O'Zone and more:8 of Pensacola's most unique restaurants that ooze atmosphere\n\nO'zone is one of Pensacola's original pizza spots, partly because of the pizza and partly because of its truly unique locale — the basement level of the historic Sacred Heart Hospital.\n\nThe pizza is Roman-style and the dough is somewhere between thin and hand-tossed, and the specialty pizzas are all great combinations. The Ponderosa Stomp melds cheddar cheese blend, barbecue sauce, roasted chicken, bacon, green peppers and red onions drizzled in honey, and you can kick it up a notch by ordering it with jalapenos and cream cheese. Meanwhile, the Italian Flag — another fan-favorite — features pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, red onions, and roasted red peppers topped with basil pesto drizzle. So good.\n\nFounaris Brothers\n\n6911 Pensacola Blvd.\n\nWhen you think about where to go for a slice of pizza, a Greek restaurant probably isn't at the top of your list, but Founaris Bros.

Or you can make your own from a selection of regular, premium and ultra premium toppings.\n\nHurricane Pizza\n\n6705 Pine Forest Road, Suite 500\n\nHurricane Pizza is the latest pizza restaurant to open up in Pensacola and is the culmination of years of combined experience the two owners accrued while working at Pizza Hut together.\n\nThe idea behind Hurricane Pizza is to create a quality product at an affordable price and, most importantly, to instill the idea that pizza should be a \"fun food.\"\n\nOne of their top-sellers, the Mexicali Hurricane, for example, starts with a bean base, onions, tomatoes, cheddar, lettuce and a side of salsa. Another signature pizza, the Pineapple Express, constantly surprises guests with its use of cashews as a topping, along with pineapple, ham and bacon.\n\nMixing food and fun:October has 13 foodie events in Pensacola you won't want to miss\n\nPizzaluté Woodfired Pizza & Tap Bar\n\n13160 Sorrento Road\n\nOn the other side of Escambia County is Pizzaluté. If you thought the Tuscan Oven was the only place in town with an imported oven, then you'd be wrong.\n\nThe dome brick oven shipped straight from Naples, Italy, is used to serve up three Neapolitan pizza styles included the Margherita, the marinara and the focaccia bread. The menu is small, but it's by design, according to owner Stefano Hugh, who believes in keeping things simple but high quality.\n\nMellow Mushroom\n\n5175 Bayou Blvd.\n\nMellow is a state of mind, a culture, a way of being, and Mellow Mushroom's mission is to provide delicious food in a fun and creative environment.

Given that the kitchen is mobile, the offerings aren’t quite as expansive as you would find in a full kitchen, but there is still a lot to enjoy. The pizzas are 12 inches each and have something for everyone — pepperoni, veggie, barbecue and more, plus you can build your own. You can also grab pizza by the slice if you’re looking for a quick lunch option.\n\nGeorgio’s Pizza\n\n3000 E. Cervantes St.\n\nGeorgio’s has served the Pensacola community with hand-tossed pizza smothered in homemade sauce for over 25 years — a feat you don’t accidentally achieve. One look at one of the pizzas, and you’ll see why Georgio's is an institution. The pies are thick but not quite deep dish thick. The menu is more inventive than traditional. Sure, there is a house special, cheese and pepperoni. But there is also chicken alfredo, a B.L.T and a colosseum special that includes all house toppings plus bacon, tomatoes and spinach.\n\nLost Pizza Co.\n\n550 E. Nine Mile Road\n\nLost Pizza Co. is a Mississippi-based pizza franchise scattered throughout the South. The company proudly uses all of the freshest ingredients, from cheese to meat and veggies. The dough and sauces are all handmade, too. Menus change from location to location, but one of the most popular offerings is the Hot Chick, which is a house-made ranch base topped with grilled chicken breast tossed in buffalo sauce and onions.\n\nVillage Inn closes:Village Inn restaurant on Nine Mile to close, popular restaurant is rumored replacement\n\nElbow Room\n\n2213 W. Cervantes St.\n\nThe Elbow Room is just as much about the experience as it is the pizza. Speaking of pizza, the pub offers a pretty customizable experience. There are no signature pizzas with fancy names. You get cheese pizza and a pretty extensive list of toppings you can add on for an extra price, and premium toppings for an extra premium price. Regular toppings include things like pepperoni, ham, sausage, olives, roasted garlic, cashews, broccoli, etc. Premium includes goat cheese, anchovies, vegan cheese, tofu, genoa and more.\n\nAngelena’s\n\n101 E.

There are only five varieties to choose from, but each is high quality.\n\nThe standouts are the Diavola, which features salami, Calabrian chili and 196 black garlic honey; the Fun Guy, which has local mushrooms, gorgonzola and bacon marmalade; and the Prosciutto Di Pharma, which has garlic butter, Parmesan and arugula. Grab a pizza and a bottle of wine every Tuesday for just $25.\n\nPaul’s Pizza Company\n\n13700 Perdido Key Dr.\n\nPaul’s Pizza Company is a newer restaurant that opened during the pandemic as a pickup and delivery spot in Perdido Key. The owners launched it in response to the few options available in the area. It’s since become a popular hotspot that offers dine-in seating, too. Pizza lovers in the Perdido area should expect a thin-crust, New York-style pie. You can customize your own pie or choose from any of the signature options, like the taco pizza, spicy Sicilian or the ‘MEAT’eor.\n\nA Little Madness Brewing Company\n\n9838 N. Davis Highway\n\nA Little Madness Brewing Company is a brewery with a pizza kitchen.

Phil Scott's weekly news conference.\n\nOver 30 \"presumptively positive\" cases have been reported by Manchester Medical Center, said Health Commissioner Mark Levine, after the center's urgent care conducted a series of antigen tests to regional residents.\n\nThose that test positive on antigen tests, which differ from PCR tests, are \"not considered to be a lab-confirmed test\" said Levine. Antigen tests tend to not be included in Vermont's number of cases, and those that were either confirmed positive or \"false negatives\" would need to be tested by the Health Department.\n\nLevine stated that the Health Department has already set up a pop-up site in Londonderry for July 15, and he encouraged those that tested positive, as well as others in the region to attend it.\n\nIn regards to the outbreak, Mike Smith, secretary of the state's Agency of Human Services, cautioned Vermonters against failing to quarantine after traveling to \"hotspots\" outside of the state's designated safe areas. He further went on to recommend residents should not attend social events or gatherings following those trips where they know they are \"bound to have close contacts\" with other people.\n\n\"It is a pattern that I'm starting to get a little concerned about,\" said Smith.\n\n\"We all need to do our part. Risky behavior can lead to outbreaks.\"\n\nBoth Levine and Smith were hesitant to call it \"the Manchester outbreak\", citing that where people were getting tested did not reflect where they had contracted the virus.\n\n_________\n\nGov.

Prior to the pandemic, the state saw a loss of 1.5 farms per month.\n\n\"This has been a direct result of what happened when the markets went away for our dairy farmers,\" Tebbetts said.\n\nApplications are available via the Agency's website, and must be completed by Oct. 1.\n\n--------------\n\nThe Health Care Stabilization Grant Program is additionally set to launch this Friday, intended to give $275 million of financial assistance to Vermont health care providers.\n\nApplications must be completed by August 15, and will be evaluated and distributed based on \"demonstrated need\", as opposed to a first come, first serve basis.\n\nThe program is intended to cover a wide variety of providers, organizations and small-scale practices including health centers, dentists, mental health and substance abuse treatment providers, physical therapists, and emergency medical service providers.\n\n\"We want to continue to meet the needs of providers during and after this time of crisis,\" said Mike Smith, secretary of the state's Agency of Human Services. \"If providers are not certain if they are eligible, we want them to apply anyway.\"\n\nCash grants for the first round of this program will cover expenses between March 1 and June 15.

He said the guidelines are restrictive, but they must be followed to ensure patrons' safety.\n\n\"I want to be clear: these are important businesses for Burlington,\" Weinberger said. \"They've been an important part of Burlington's economic successes, they're a part of the vibrancy of Burlington.

Testing is being performed on employees and community wide testing is expected to be announced soon. Levine would not identify the business but said it was not of the type where consumers would be coming in and out.\n\nWindham County family cluster: one family in Windham County has multiple cases. Testing is being performed today in Brattleboro.

The demographic with the largest growth in positive cases is people aged 18 to 44.\n\nLevine said the spikes in these states have been widely attributed to “a breakdown in the willingness of the public to adhere to the simple precepts of avoiding mass gatherings, hence an inability to physically distance; and to wear facial coverings.”\n\nResidents must still follow these guidelines despite the hot weather and Vermont’s success so far in lowering the number of new cases per day, Levine said. Guidelines also recommend regular hand-washing and staying home when sick.\n\n“We can’t lose track of the fact that the virus hasn’t gone anywhere,” Levine said.\n\n_____________\n\nAn inmate who was being brought into the Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility in South Burlington has tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nAgency of Human Services Secretary Mike Smith said officials believe the inmate had contact with some staff members and some other inmates before the test came back positive on Saturday.

All inmates and staff in the South Burlington prison will be tested.\n\nAnother inmate last week tested positive after being brought into the Marble Valley Regional Correctional Facility in Rutland. Smith said that testing over the weekend turned up no other positive cases at the facility. A second mass-test of the Rutland facility will be conducted next week.\n\nIn late May and early June, the Department of Corrections had tested all staff and inmates in its facilities and reported no new positive cases. An outbreak in March at the Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans Town was the only recorded spread of the virus in a Vermont prison.\n\n___________\n\nThe number of cases associated with an outbreak of COVID-19 in Winooski and Burlington has risen to 110, Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine said Monday.\n\nLevine said he believes health officials have been successful in identifying those who could have been affected to try to suppress the outbreak, but the outbreak will not be over until there is no new activity that can be connected back to those involved.\n\n“It’s so common to use the forest fire analogies these days, so I would use the term ‘smoldering,’” Levine said. He added, “We’re doing what we can to contain it, and we’re doing a great job actually, but the bottom line is, to say that it’s fully contained. It’s not quite there yet.”\n\nLevine gave the following breakdown of the cases associated with the Winooski outbreak:\n\nThe median age of those affected is 24.\n\n65% of the cases were adults, and 35% were children.\n\n30% of the 110 cases reported having COVID-19 symptoms.\n\n126 people have been contacted by contact tracers. 19 of those contacts have gone on to be positive cases.\n\n____________\n\nThe VNA & Hospice of the Southwest Region (VNAHSR) is re-opening its outpatient therapy clinic in Manchester, the health group reported Monday.\n\nAppointments physical and occupational therapy will be staggered to minimize coronavirus exposure to patients and staff, according to a news release.\n\nPatients who seek appointments are encouraged to contact their health providers, or call the clinic directly at (802) 362-6509.\n\n============\n\nSunday, June 21, 2020\n\nA dozen new cases of COVID-19 were reported Sunday by the Vermont Department of Health, bringing the total cases in Vermont to 1,159.

A month later, after 35 deaths, Scott ordered flags to be lowered on the eighteenth of every month until the end of the year.\n\nFifty-six people in Vermont have died from the disease; the most recent death was reported on June 18.\n\n____________\n\n============\n\nWednesday, June 17, 2020\n\nNo new cases have been reported in Vermont, which currently has 1,129 cases, according to the Vermont Department of Health's dashboard Wednesday.\n\nSo far, about 915 people have recovered from the virus and 53,663 people have been tested.\n\nOne person is in the hospital for COVID-19 and four are hospitalized under investigation.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\n_________\n\nThe Farmers To Families nutrition assistance program has been extended through August, Vermont's congressional delegation announced Wednesday.\n\nA pair of Vermont-based organizations, Willing Hands and the Abbey Group, secured contracts to continue the food box-delivery program for two more months, according to news release from Sen. Patrick Leahy, Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Peter Welch.\n\nThe program will bring an additional $8.5 million in aid from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to Vermont and the Upper Valley with New Hampshire, much of which will go toward buying produce and dairy from local farms, the news release stated.\n\nDetails on how to sign up to receive food boxes can be found on the Vermont Department of Emergency Management’s website: https://vem.vermont.gov.\n\n_________\n\nThe recent decline in new cases of COVID-19 after an oubreak in Winooski and Burlington's Old North End earlier this month is a positive sign, Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger said during a press briefing Wednesday afternoon.\n\nParticularly for Burlington, Weinberger noted, the low number of new cases in the past week bodes well that an influx of college students moving in on June 1 didn't lead to an additional surge in cases.\n\n“If they were bringing the virus with them and infecting others I think we’d be seeing that now reflected in these numbers,\" Weinberger said.\n\nDr. Stephen Leffler, president of the UVM Medical Center, said he was \"sure there were asymptomatic people that came\" to Burlington during that time period but Vermont's efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus — unlike other states —probably limited the impact.\n\n\"Vermont’s still really doing it right,\" Leffler said. \"People are in general all masking, we’re social distancing well. We’re being smart about how we open up our businesses.\n\n“There’s pretty good evidence now that shows each of us wearing a mask helps us prevent spread to someone else,\" he said. \"It’s a relatively small sacrifice that each of us can make and we can keep transmission down.\"\n\n_________\n\nAlso during Wednesday's briefing, Weinberger explained Burlington's plans to allocate resources to \"racial equity and police transformation” effforts.\n\nOn top of an immediate commitment of $300,000 to the city's Fund for Racial Equity and Police Transformation, paid for via cuts to the police department, Weinberger said he's confident similar savings could expand that amount closer to $1 million during the next fiscal year.\n\nAdditionally, the city has another $300,000 in small business relief and rental assistance that it will look into spending \"through the lens of racial justice,\" he said.\n\nAnd the city will explore using an anticipated $1 million in federal funds marked for community investment next year to serve anti-racism efforts, Weinberger said.\n\n“I think there’s some real opportunity looking at all these funds about how to make progress with racial justice,\" the mayor said.\n\n_________\n\nTuesday, June 16, 2020\n\nThe Working Lands Enterprise Board, affiliated with the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food & Markets, has announced that 16 businesses will receive over $250,000 in COVID-19 Response Business Development Grants in agriculture and forestry. The awards will focus on business response, shifting marketing strategies, or other activities that may improve business recovery.\n\nOne grant recipient, The Royal Butcher of Braintree, intends to respond to the surge in demand for slaughter and meat processing. Current bottlenecks in processing will require urgent need to meet the local demand for this butcher’s services.\n\n“These dollars will allow us to expand our business while helping farmers who need our services during the pandemic,” Justin Sauerwein of The Royal Butcher said in a news release. The Royal Butcher, established in 2003, is a USDA inspected slaughterhouse and meat processor, attending to the needs of local livestock and dairy farms.\n\n_________\n\nThe New England Foundation for the Arts announced the launch of the New England Arts Resilience Fund, part of the nationwide United States Regional Arts Resilience Fund, an initiative of the U.S. Regional Arts Organizations and The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.\n\nThe New England Arts Resilience Fund is also supported by federal CARES Act funding from the National Endowment for the Arts. The Fund was created in response to the impact of COVID-19 on the nation’s arts infrastructure and will support New England nonprofit arts and cultural organizations with recovery and planning capital for a post-pandemic future.\n\nThe New England Arts Resilience Fund will provide approximately 50 non-matching grants, generally in the range of $10,000-$75,000, with potential for a small number of grants up to $100,000. The fund prioritizes organizations, communities, populations and art forms that have historically had less access to major financial resources for sustainability and seeks in particular to support organizations that are led by and deeply engage communities of color.\n\n_________\n\nTravelers looking to make a trip to Canada or Mexico will have to wait at least another month after the Department of Homeland Security extended border closures with both countries due to the coronavirus pandemic, USA Today reported.\n\nThe borders, including Vermont's border with Quebec, will remain closed to nonessential travel until July 21.\n\n\"Based on the success of the existing restrictions and the emergence of additional global COVID-19 hotspots, the Department will continue to limit non-essential travel at our land ports of entry with Canada and Mexico,\" Chad Wolf, acting Secretary of Homeland Security, said in a statement. \"This extension protects Americans while keeping essential trade and travel flowing as we reopen the American economy.\"\n\n“This is a decision that will protect people on both sides of the border as we continue to fight COVID-19,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said.\n\n_________\n\nVermont State Treasurer Beth Pearce announced the launch of the Municipal Emergency Statewide Education Property Tax Borrowing Program to assist municipalities as they manage their finances and cash-flow needs during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBased on eligibility, the program will cover interest incurred for short-term borrowing meant to manage the effects of statewide education property-tax delays as a direct result of COVID-19. Eligible “short-term borrowing costs” do not include principal payments, fees, or any interest on borrowings not directly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMunicipalities can learn more, and apply, by visiting https://www.vermonttreasurer.gov/content/local-government.\n\n_________\n\nThree additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont, bringing the pandemic total to 1,130, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, about 914 people have recovered from the virus, the data showed, and 52,890 people have been tested.\n\nTwo people are in the hospital for COVID-19, and 10 are hospitalized under investigation — the same numbers as Sunday.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\nMonday, June 15, 2020\n\nGov. Phil Scott extended a state of emergency through July 15. That action does not roll back opening-up procedures, Scott said — but provides a mechanism by which guidelines can be updated (relaxed or tightened, as needed) in an orderly, methodical way.\n\n_________\n\nOutdoor camping facilities may operate at 100% capacity, beginning today, the governor announced. Campground use had been capped at 50% capacity.\n\nQuarantine guidelines from out-of-state campers will remain in place.\n\n_________\n\nOne additional positive case of COVID-19 was reported in Vermont on Sunday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,128, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, about 912 people have recovered from the virus, the data shows, and 52,557 people have been tested, the data showed.\n\nTwo people are in the hospital for COVID-19, and 14 are hospitalized under investigation — the same numbers as Sunday.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\n________\n\nDespite uptick in cases due to a cluster in Winooski in early June, Vermont seems to be back on a reliable path toward containing and tracking the coronavirus (# of cases dipped to just three over the weekend), according to Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine.\n\nStatewide, effective ways of managing outbreaks can take place even as restrictions are relaxed, he said.\n\nSerology tests (that test blood for the presence of, or exposure to, coronavirus) would be of limited utility in Vermont, where the population that has been exposed remains very low by national standards (Levine's best guess is 5%).\n\nLess invasive and more comfortable tests (front-of-nose; saliva) are in development, and will, until a vaccine is developed, make it easier for people to seek out testing, Levine added.. Tests with “real-time” results might conceivably be required for entrance to large sports or entertainment venues.\n\nThe “Sara Alert” app used by the Health Department is a tool for communication between Vermonters and the Department of Health – and is not a “tracking app” that reports the user’s location, Levine said. The state has no plans to implement detailed case-tracking software.\n\n_________\n\nUpcoming governor's news conference topics this week:\n\nWednesday: Long-term health facilities.\n\nFriday: Health guidance on K-12 school re-openings.\n\n============\n\nSunday, June 14, 2020\n\nTwo additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont on Saturday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,127, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, 909 people have recovered from the virus and 50,982 people have been tested, the data showed.

Phil Scott and members of his cabinet announced a proposed $90 million in economic relief on Friday — phase two of a relief package he has proposed to restart the economy following the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFunds from the first phase are being considered by the Vermont Legislature currently. Scott had proposed $250 million in relief for businesses impacted by the pandemic, but expressed frustration at seeing the Legislature reducing the amount he asked for in his proposal. The Vermont House of Representatives announced Friday that it had fast-tracked a $93 million coronavirus relief package to Scott's desk for his signature.\n\n\"They're only including about a third of the money we recommended,\" Scott said during a news conference Friday. He added, \"While this pandemic has impacted everyone in the state, this crippled small businesses — the folks who provide the jobs that families rely on and generate the revenue we need for the services we provide in state government.\"\n\nThe second phase money, which will also be reviewed by the Legislature, provides assistance for long-term economic recovery, housing and community recovery, broadband expansion, and modernizing Vermont's regulatory programs.\n\nThe money being put toward relief from the pandemic was granted to the state through the federal CARES Act.\n\n__________\n\nNine additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont on Friday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,119, Vermont Department of Health data showed.\n\nAt the same time, 907 people have recovered from the virus, while 48,634 people have been tested, the data showed.

Dare I say it may be even better than ever. 130 E. Main St, Ramsey; 201-934-0030, cafepanachenj.com.\n\nOsteria Crescendo, Westwood\n\nI'm hardly the only one who thinks Robbie Felice, chef-owner of this modern Italian restaurant, is a whiz. The James Beard Foundation nominated him for a Rising Star Chef award, but then COVID-19 happened. But Felice doesn't need awards to prove his cooking chops. He's as passionate about what he does as LeBron James is about basketball. You won't find chicken parm, penne alla vodka, calamari in marinara sauce or garlic bread at Osteria Crescendo or for that matter at his other terrific restaurant, Viaggio in Wayne (yes, it should have been on your list too). Because you wouldn't find those Italian-American dishes in Italy. You want authentic Italian food cooked beautifully? Now you know where to go. 36 Jefferson Ave., Westwood; 201-722-1900, osteriacrescendo.com. (Viaggio is at 1055 Hamburg Turnpike, Wayne; 973-706-7277, viaggioristorante.com.)\n\nChinese restaurant:This restaurant may serve the best Chinese food in North Jersey\n\nPasta Ramen, secret location\n\nA secret restaurant in a secret location by a secret chef. It's by invite only. I scored an invite. And? I can't say much (shhhh!), except what I tried. Ever have silky tofu slathered in a house-made spreadable salumi? What about fresh-made sesame ramen coated with cheesy white carbonara, a crispy wild tuna meatball crowned with buttery uni and a gleaming edible gold leaf, or featherweight ricotta cavatelli bathed in a tender pork ragu with threads of pickled ginger? Follow on Instagram and get on the list!\n\nBodegon, Cliffside Park\n\nNot even a year old, this Spanish restaurant is turning out some stellar Galicia-based dishes. The croqueta de jambon is a must. Ditto the poached Galician octopus, the seared cremini mushrooms on toast and the yellowtail ceviche. Just about everything is delicious. And it's a party many nights, especially after a couple of coffee(!) Negronis. 631 Anderson Ave., Cliffside Park; 856-521-9135, bodegonnj.com.\n\nNew chef:Cafe Panache in Ramsey has a new chef, a protege of beloved founder Kevin Kohler\n\nFaubourg, Montclair\n\nTwo years ago, two French restaurant veterans (Daniel Boulud alums) opened what may be the best contemporary French restaurant in North Jersey, if not the entire Garden State. If you, Thrillist, had ever tried their thin-as-a-cracker tarte flambee, their light-as-a-summer-breeze gougere, or their out-of-this-world coq au vin, it wouldn't have been MIA on your list. 544 Bloomfield Ave., Montclair; 973-542-7700, faubourgmontclair.com.\n\nRestaurant Lorena's, Maplewood\n\nI'm thrilled that this upscale French restaurant now has a liquor license. Its salmon tartare and mushroom crepe, two of the most delicious appetizers anywhere, deserve to be enjoyed with a cool glass of white wine. For the heavenly rigatoni with short ribs, get a glass of red. 160 Maplewood Ave, Maplewood, 973-763-4460, restaurantlorena.com.\n\nCommon Lot, Millburn\n\nThe chef-owner Ehren Ryan is from Australia. His food is from all over the world. In a good way. Ryan's eats is not only beautiful but supremely creative and deliciously flavorful. From sashimi to naan to New Zealand venison and Nova Scotia halibut, you can happily take a trip around the world dining here. 27 Main St., Millburn; 973-467-0494, commonlot.com.\n\nJockey Hollow Bar & Kitchen, Morristown\n\nCome for the wine (owner Chris Cannon is a wine fanatic). Stay for the eats (Joe Mooney, formerly with venerated Mistral in Princeton, heads the kitchen now). 110 South St., Morristown; 973-644-3180, jockeyhollowbarandkitchen.com.\n\nRestaurant Serenade, Chatham\n\nChef-owner James Laird is a wizard. Without using cream and very little butter, he manages to make his haute dishes taste rich, creamy and downright delicious. For proof, just try any one of his cream-free soups. You're going to be scratching your head for some time. 6 Roosevelt Ave., Chatham; 973-701-0303, restaurantserenade.com.\n\nWhite Birch, Flanders\n\nChef/owner Sam Freund has a huge garden to help him cook some of the finest, most delicious American dishes that he changes according to the season. But what's always on the menu: a heavenly onion tart with Gruyere cheese and pine nuts that you'd be nuts to pass up. 380 Route 206, Flanders; 908-955-0443, whitebirchrestaurant.com.\n\nLT Bar & Grill, Hackensack\n\nFrench chef Laurent Tourondel is not out to change what you eat. He just wants to give you what you want — but he wants to make it even more delicious. So his burger, for example, is a grilled patty of four different cuts of meat, topped with earthy white cheddar cheese, sweet caramelized onions, meaty sautéed mushrooms, and from-the-farm bread-and-butter pickles. The final touch: a generous smear of pungent peppercorn sauce. And if it's sushi you want, it's there too. And, no matter what, don't pass up dessert: Tourondel is a dessert virtuoso. 390 Hackensack Ave., Hackensack, 551-287-6333, ltbarandgrill.com.\n\nThe River Palm Terrace, Edgewater\n\nAsk most any chef in North Jersey where they like to eat, and invariably they'll answer River Palm. The steaks, dry-aged and butchered in house, are great. The sushi, perhaps even better. Even the darn Idaho baked potato is a wonder here. 1416 River Road, Edgewater, 201-224-2013, riverpalm.com/edgewater.\n\nReview:Closter's Brasserie Mémère sates the hunger for authentic French dishes in NJ\n\nCorto, Jersey City\n\nGood luck getting a table here. Chef Matt Moschella, a self-taught cook who grew up in Morris County, uses as few ingredients as possible to make his delectable, nationally acclaimed, Italian dishes. (Bon Appetit called his food \"fantastic.\") The pastas are all delicious. The \"Angry Chicken\" a must. And dessert? Don't be a fool. These guys know what they're doing; get it.\n\nAndre's Lakeside Dining, Sparta\n\nYou're likely missing a heart if you aren't swept away sitting at a well spaced table on Andre's lush green yard, a stone's throw from serene Seneca Lake. The crystal chandeliers that hang from trees can quicken your heartbeat as well. The menu at this French spot with Asian touches changes as often as Food & Wine magazine comes out. For $95, chef-owner Andre' de Waal wows with a six-course meal that will have you wondering when you can return for a repeat. If you're not up to a pants-busting dinner and need help, my advice: get any of de Waal's pastas. Housemade, al dente and just superb. And bring a bottle of wine. Andre's is BYOB. 112 Tomahawk Trail, Sparta; 973-726-6000, andreslakeside.com/eat.\n\nTurtle + the Wolf, Montclair\n\nThis acclaimed 6-year-old restaurant went through a tough time during the pandemic, shutting down indoor dining for more than a year and pivoting to curbside service. However, in-person dining has resumed — and that's wonderful news for North Jersey food lovers. Montclair native Lauren Hirschberg, chef-owner, is famous for his transcendent liver mousse pate, fried chicken meal and his ethereal pot de creme. Hirschberg recently launched a beer-garden style BBQ restaurant Pineapple Express Barbecue in the stunning old station house of Montclair's Lackawanna Station that promises to be delicious too. 622 Valley Road, Montclair; 973-783-9800 turtleandthewolf.com.\n\nIn addition\n\nYes, Thrillist, New Jersey is full of great \"suburban\" restaurants outside of NYC. Here are a few more in the running you overlooked:\n\nBrasserie Memere, Closter. A darling French brasserie that isn't afraid to serve out-of-fashion French food: escargots, frog's legs and cheese-laden onion soup. Chef-owner Thomas Cizsak trusted that diners in New Jersey would appreciate quality classic French dishes. He was right. 107 Vervalen St., at, Closter Plaza, Closter; 201-660-8822, brasserie-memere.com.\n\nCheng Du 23, Wayne. You can get your Chinese-American grub here, but why bother. You're in an authentic Sichuan restaurant, so go\n\nSichuan: extraordinarily delicious soup dumplings: Ants Climbing a Tree, scrumptious glass noodles dish with teeny specks of ground pork (\"ants\"); dan dan noodles; and whole branzino smothered in bean paste and chili sauce. Strong tea for refreshment or BYOB. 6 Willowbrook Blvd, Wayne, 973-812-2800, chengdu23.com.\n\nPorter, Weehawken. Newcomer with great cocktails, nice apps, and scrumptious desserts. 1100 Ave. at Port Imperial, Weehawken, 201-430-8415, porterportimperial.com.\n\nOceanos Oyster Bar & Grill, Fair Lawn. This may be the best seafood restaurant in North Jersey. 2-27 Saddle River Road, Fair Lawn; 201-796-0546, hoceanosrestaurant.com.\n\nShan Shan Noodles, Parsippany. Far from fancy but, oh my, those hand-pulled noodles. 333 Route 46, Parsippany; 973-287-7399, shanshannoodles.com.\n\nElements, Princeton. A true dining destination. Dine here and get your socks knocked off, beginning with the \"pre-meal\" smoked quail egg brought tableside, inside a baby bird's nest. 66 Witherspoon St., Princeton; 609-924-0078, elementsprinceton.com.\n\nMistral, Princeton. Can't afford Elements? Dine downstairs at sister restaurant Mistral. Your socks may not be blown away but your palate's going to do a little dance and your stomach is going to feel full and happy. 66 Witherspoon St., Princeton; 609-688-8808, mistralprinceton.com.\n\nGayeon, Fort Lee. Upscale Korean food in a stunning modern dining-room with a big, long bar — I'm all for that. The Bossom is a DIY kind of dish — wrap a sesame leaf around a thin slice of braised pork belly, octopus kimchi and tender radish, and pop it in one fell swoop into your mouth. Good stuff. Good too are the cold buckwheat noodle soup and the warm bibimbap with perfectly crunchy caramelized rice. And desserts, usually overlooked in Asian restaurants, are terrific here, especially black sesame ice cream. 2020 Hudson St., Fort Lee; 201-944-2056, gayeonrestaurant.com.\n\nVarka, Ramsey. This longtime fine-dine Greek seafood spot is not inexpensive but fresh quality seafood never is. Splurge; it's worth it. 30 N.

There is a buzz about Baiz that can’t be faked, a feeling of community grounded in food, where Middle Eastern, Arabic and North African cultures come together. Al-Hana, the diminutive restaurant squeezed into a corner of Baiz, remains one of the city’s best spots to sample Arabic cuisine, a bustling place to catch a bite while taking a break from shopping for groceries. Breads are tender and steaming, topped with seasoned beef, spinach and cheese or a simple sprinkling of za’atar. Familiar mezze like baba ghannouj and hummus have an atypical richness (along with a proper helping of olive oil). Rotisserie-seared shawarma is juicy and gorgeously seasoned, piled atop rice or wrapped up with garlicky toum and pickled vegetables. Al-Hana might lack the polished efficiency of its contemporaries, but its pure flavor and energy cannot be denied.\n\nDetails: 523 N. 20th St., Phoenix.

If there’s one thing my readers seem to feel they lack, it’s meat-and-potatoes fare with a little Old-World charm. It’s here, but it can be a little hard to find, and All Pierogi kitchen is a standout. A no-frills Ukrainian mom-and-pop joint run by friendly folks, this is the go-to spot for pierogi, cabbage rolls and sausage. It’s distressing how many restaurants around town prepare this kind of food with the grace and dexterity of a drunken elephant, but that only makes it easier to appreciate a place that gets it right. Pierogi, whether boiled or pan-fried, are tender and flavorful; meat fillings have just the right texture and consistency; and sauces taste fresh and well-seasoned. Add a little soup, some vegetable salads, reasonable prices and you have some of the best Old-World cuisine in town.\n\nDetails: 1245 W. Baseline Road, Mesa. MAP IT! 480-262-3349, allpierogi.com.\n\nAlzohour\n\nA meal at Alzohour is a long, lingering affair and that’s as much a matter of necessity as it is of design. Zhor Saad practically runs the restaurant by herself, which means dinner is outstanding, but it’s going to take a while. Unceremoniously tucked into a market and clothing store, Alzohour is a place where diners can drown in the sultry scent of Moroccan fare that’s equal parts bold and lusty. Arabic classics of variable quality round out the offerings, but the meat of the menu is in dishes like a silky, perfumed lamb tagine, meat dripping off the bone, heavy with saffron and spice. Couscous billows with steam, saturated with vegetables and topped with tender meats. Bastilla — a nutty ground chicken pie wrapped in crisp phyllo and dusted with cinnamon and sugar — is a mind-bending blend of savory and sweet. On the purely sweet end of the spectrum, Saad’s kunafeh is next level, almost custardy with a deep golden, crisp crust and a heavy dose of pistachio. Not all will appreciate the market-chic environment, but none of that matters when your host prepares everything with a warm heart and you’re lost in a saffron-scented cloud.\n\nDetails: 7814 N. 27th Ave., Phoenix.

When the Calabrian native tired of trying to please the white tablecloth crowd, he opened Andreoli, a casual neighborhood grocery with a few tables that serves some of the best traditional Italian fare in town. This culinary curmudgeon with an uncompromising vision is as likely to be in the front of house sipping espresso and watching soccer as he is to be in the back of house running the kitchen. His work is a devastating combination of simplicity, technique and killer ingredients that exposes the purveyors of oafish red sauce concoctions and pretentious, overworked modern Italian for the charlatans they are. Grab a loaf of craggy bread, order a perfect pasta or grilled seafood from the white board, snag some sticky cornetti marmelatta or crisp, layered sfogliatelle from the pastry case and consider yourself lucky that such a skilled Italian traditionalist calls Scottsdale home.\n\nDetails: 8880 E. Via Linda, Scottsdale.

Sparingly decorated and showing its age, this strip-mall stalwart makes its impact on the plate; and a dual-menu system makes it the ideal place to ease neophytes into more traditional fare. The black-rimmed American menu features juicy pot stickers, crisp orange beef and sizzling pepper beef. But drift over to the red-rimmed traditional menu and the skies open. Meltaway duck is wrapped in a crisp taro crust; West Lake soup suspends gossamer threads of egg in a silky broth; braised tofu bubbles in a clay pot with sweet shrimp. And whole fish pulled live from the tank is buried in scallions and ginger and splashed with a bit of soy and shaoxing. Keep exploring, and when you’re ready for the stuffed duck feet, they’ll be waiting for you.\n\nDetails: 9880 S. Rural Road, Tempe. MAP IT! 480-705-7486. Search \"Asian Hong Kong\" on Facebook.\n\nAtlas Bistro\n\nTodd Sawyer’s restaurant is a chameleon. Quiet and unassuming, hidden in a strip mall on the fringes of the Old Town spotlight, it changes its colors through the years as chefs come and go. It’s also one of the most reliably excellent restaurants in the Valley — a BYOB, to boot — that has never been better than it is under the auspices of chef Cory Oppold. The stark antithesis of flashy downtown Scottsdale just a few blocks to the north, Atlas Bistro piggybacks on AZ Wine Company, an intimate room with minimal decor and sound-deadening walls. While the setting is modest, the plates are filled with pyrotechnics, showy but thoughtful multi-component affairs that nimbly merge disparate flavors and techniques to compelling effect. Think slivers of tender beef tongue pastrami with a honey mustard emulsion; kombu-marinated black cod with yerba mate béarnaise; or a goat cheese mousse spiked with Jidori chicken skin crisps and poached cranberries. Wine geeks love the capable bottle service and, as a bonus, Oppold’s vegetarian creations are some of the best in town.\n\nDetails: 2515 N. Scottsdale Road, Scottsdale.

The Osmic family first opened Balkan Bakery a decade ago, and while a short list of common baked goods and sweets are solid offerings, it’s the Bosnian specialties that make Balkan Bakery a destination. Aldijana prepares the cevapi, seasoning and stuffing the little sausages in preparation for the grill, where they take on a crisp char. Her brother, Jasenko, handles the stuffed breads, stretching a thin layer of dough over the prep table, stuffing and rolling it into a tube and, with a quick flick of his wrist, curling it into a tight swirl the size of a lunch plate. Stuffed with meat (burek), cheese (sirnica) or spinach (zeljanica), it’s divine, contrasting a light, crisp shell with a steaming, tender, layered interior.\n\nDetails: 1107 E. Bell Road, Phoenix. MAP IT! 602-996-4598, facebook.com/BalkanBakery.\n\nBar Pesce\n\nBeginnings don’t come much humbler than a counter at the Steven Paul Salon, but Cullen Campbell’s evolution from goofy genius behind one of the Valley’s all-time zaniest guerilla operations into one of its most vibrant, alluring and sure-handed chefs is a testament to his culinary acumen. At Bar Pesce — the recently refreshed moniker for what used to be Crudo — Italy may be the inspiration, but this born-and-bred Southerner is after something a little more lusty, weaving crudi, composed cheese plates and succulent meats from smoke and olive oil and acid. Uni is dressed with shaved shallot and avocado, while bottarga and i’itoi onions give sweet raw yellowtail a salty, spicy sting. Burrata is amped up with an unctuous pancetta vinaigrette; and ricotta is simply paired with walnuts and desert honey. Meltaway semolina gnocchi drown in a succulent lamb neck sugo, while lamb belly gently braises in milk and mirepoix. Even when Campbell’s flavors are light, they’re distilled down to a knee-buckling, vivid intensity. And the modest prices on the prix fixe aren’t a mistake — not only is this one of the best restaurants in town, it’s also one of the best bargains.\n\nDetails: 3603 E. Indian School Road, Phoenix. MAP IT! 602-358-8666, barpesce.com.\n\nBarrio Cafe\n\nSilvana Salcido Esparza was hardly a timid wallflower to begin with, but she set off a technicolor bomb of sass, graffiti and regional Mexican flavor on 16th Street when she opened Barrio Café in 2002. Not to knock Sonora, but Mexico is a big country and most of its cuisine is still brutally underrepresented in Phoenix. Barrio Café gives the central and southern Mexican states a local voice. Cochinita pibil — pork steamed in achiote and sour orange — sneaks up from Yucatan. Puebla’s symbol of national pride, chiles en nogada, are stuffed with a chunky, fruit-laced picadillo and drenched in almond cream. The moles of Oaxaca — from a dark and smoky mole negro to the herbal, pungent pipian verde — are gorgeously complex. The kitchen throws caution to the wind, more concerned with dropping flavor bomb after flavor bomb than dotting the I’s and crossing the T’s. Fun-loving, sometimes irreverent servers are the antithesis of the standard-issue scripted corporate dullards.\n\nDetails: 2814 N. 16th St., Phoenix. MAP IT! 602-636-0240, barriocafe.com.\n\nBarrio Cafe Gran Reserva\n\nIf Barrio Café is where Silvana Salcido Esparza slings unbridled, brash flavor, Gran Reserva is where she takes that burst of energy and focuses it to pinpoint intensity. Tucked into a tiny wedge of a dining room with a wraparound view of Grand Avenue, Gran Reserva is Barrio Café’s elegant cousin, draped in white tablecloths and colorful trompe l’oeil. An a la carte menu rehashes many of Barrio Café’s greatest hits, but Gran Reserva’s mission is revealed in the menu de degustación, where Mexican fare reaches levels of refinement not seen elsewhere in the Valley. Sous vide duck meets sultry cranberry mole; suckling pig confit is treated with chile de arbol demiglace; and a cap of lime foam and queso Oaxaqueño sits half melted, wrapped in fragrant hoja santa with a touch of chile and peanut oil. The best part? At less than $50, the degustación menu is priced for the people, and a bevy of vegan dishes make Gran Reserva a viable option for anyone.\n\nDetails: 1301 W. Grand Ave., Phoenix. MAP IT! 602-252-2777, barriocafe.com.\n\nBinkley's\n\nKevin Binkley is a titan of the Phoenix food scene who climbed to the top of the mountain and decided he hated the view. He achieved the dream of a local restaurant group with enough concepts to make some coin but not so many that he had to sacrifice his integrity. But Binkley shut it all down for one reason: He isn’t a restaurateur and he desperately missed the kitchen. Now, the celebrated chef with obsessive focus and puckish tendencies has turned a Phoenix bungalow into his personal culinary playground — and everyone is invited. Fine dining has never been so welcoming, like a private dinner party that starts with a series of modernist amuses on the veranda; moves into the bar for snacks like grilled soppressata chips and confit duck wings; and ends in the dining room with coddled goose eggs, sweet pea agnolotti and whole roasted lamb. There is no fourth wall here (literally). Roll up your sleeves, step into the open kitchen and lend a hand. There’s plenty of joy to go around.\n\nDetails: 2320 E. Osborn Road, Phoenix.

But its sneaky, under the radar bar bites deserve their fair share of attention, too. Bob Tam’s menu — an irreverent foil for Ross Simon’s encyclopedic cocktail list — isn’t meant to be taken too seriously, but Tam’s puckish Asian fusion creations reveal his deep understanding of the underlying cuisines. The Angry Panda wraps crisp peanuts, chiles and dried anchovies in cool lettuce leaves with fresh herbs. Seoul fried chicken gets a sweet and spicy lift from watermelon kimchi with a dab of sesame ranch. Chinese buns are filled with deeply caramelized chunks of pork belly, a throwback to Tam’s days at San Francisco’s Betelnut. The Dragon Dumpling Burger is a juicy beef and pork concoction that channels the spirit of xiaolongbao into a burger slathered with mayo and Sichuan pickles, complete with dipping sauce. Best part? It all goes well with booze.\n\nDetails: Luhrs Building, 1 W. Jefferson St., Phoenix. MAP IT! 602-340-1924, bitterandtwistedaz.com.\n\nBourbon Steak\n\nSteakhouses in Phoenix — and the steaks that comprise their menus — tend to shy away from the ritzier end of the spectrum, but if you want to drop some serious coin on some jaw-dropping beef, Bourbon Steak is the place to be. Under the auspices of celebrity chef Michael Mina and executive chef Sara Garrant, the flagship restaurant at Fairmont Scottsdale Princess sports a contemporary elegance and refinement. If you’re looking for a dry-aged tomahawk rib eye, they’ve got you covered. But the offerings also drift into esoterica, such as a butter-poached Snake River Farms rib eye cap that’s so tender and sweet it’s almost like a different animal altogether. If you really want to go big, the roster is deep with domestic and imported premium beef that runs up to $45 per ounce. Excellent sauces abound and sides show a penchant for Asian flavors, like mushrooms plied with white soy and mirin; or a dynamite short rib fried rice with kimchi and chunks of sweet Chinese sausage. It has the luxury prices to match, but, put simply, Bourbon Steak is operating at a higher plane than the rest of the pack.\n\nDetails: Fairmont Scottsdale Princess, 7575 E. Princess Drive.

But the Pua family came to the rescue in 2015 and still stands tall as the lone ambassador for Malaysian cuisine. Thankfully, it’s a charming, casual little spot with an extensive menu filled with dishes unobtainable anywhere else in town. Batter-dipped chicken wings are fried to a shattering crisp and served with two spicy-sweet sambals — the “mama” and the “papa.” Roti canai pairs thick, oily flatbread with a rich coconut-based curry sauce for dipping and slurping. Laksa — the iconic Malaysian soup that takes many forms — is done here as a rich and fragrant coconut and lemongrass broth with noodles, seafood and bean sprouts. Sweet, steamed Hainan chicken is paired with rich, oil-splashed rice. And char kway teow — a universal crowd-pleaser — is a warm and steaming stir-fry of thick rice noodles in a sweet and comforting soy-based sauce.\n\nDetails: 1845 E. Broadway Road, Tempe. MAP IT! 480-268-7331, bpstreetcafe.com.\n\nThe Breadfruit & Rum Bar\n\nThe expectations we bring to the table are often unfair. Jamaican food is hole-in-the-wall, mom-and-pop fare, a quarter of fiery jerk chicken or slippery stewed oxtails ladled into a to-go container with rice, beans and plantains, right? But island cuisine can bring an air of refinement just like any other, and here’s the proof. Jamaican-born rum savant Dwayne Allen takes a deep dive into his spirit of choice, slinging educational flights and stellar cocktails in the dark and cozy Rum Bar. Meanwhile, the immensely talented Danielle Leoni has adopted the flavor and fire of her husband’s homeland, leading a kitchen that puts Jamaican fare in a context rarely seen in the States. Scallops seared in cast iron get a splash of Appleton rum for a sweet, rich glaze, while vinegary sauteed shrimp explode with cayenne and habanero. Pan-fried escovitch fish is buried under a pile of sultry vegetables. And Leoni’s house jerk — whatever it seasons — pulls no punches, an uncompromising blend of vinegar, spices, chiles and herbs that is as flavorful as it is incendiary.\n\nDetails: 108 E. Pierce St., Phoenix. MAP IT! 602-267-1266, thebreadfruit.com.\n\nBri\n\nYoung, upstart chefs who launch shoestring operations where they can experiment and play are vital to any serious dining scene. Vince Mellody is playing that part at one of the Valley’s more quirky and delicious recent openings. Housed in a decidedly chill Coronado bungalow without a hint of pretention or ego, Bri (rhymes with pie) slings an ever-changing collection of small, creative plates, most of them forged in a South African-style grill over live coals. The room is comfortable and Mellody’s food is on point. But Bri’s greatest asset, perhaps, is a menu that’s almost pointedly out of lockstep with its contemporaries. Frico caldo, Italian pan-fried cheese and potato cakes, sport a gorgeous lacy crisp and a dollop of tomato relish. Tender, charred pork ribs are laced with fermented black beans and crisped shallots, while slow-roasted duck breast gets a topping of crisp chile sauce. A pureed Persian salad called bademjan employs eggplant to devastating effect, charred jet-black to lend a little bitterness and a ton of depth.\n\nDetails: 2221 N. Seventh St., Phoenix.

Truth is, Buddyz makes a better deep dish than most of the joints back home, and I include the big, beloved goons like Lou Malnati’s, Giordano’s and Gino’s East. All of which is to say that somebody has to sing the praises of this place. A recent expansion effort has brought Buddyz out of the pastures of Queen Creek, which is a good thing; it was flying under the radar for too long and there’s nobody who doesn’t need this in their life. A thick, crunchy crust gets a none-too-subtle (but not overwhelming) puddle of melty cheese and a crown of bright, chunky tomato sauce, seasoned just so and spruced up with the requisite punch of dried herbs. Equal parts dinner and architecture, it’s a gooey, hedonistic mess. Deep dish isn’t pizza? It’s a casserole, you say? Call it whatever you want, tough guy. Now shut up, eat it and then tell me to my face that it didn’t taste good.\n\nDetails: 18423 E. San Tan Blvd., Queen Creek. MAP IT! 480-822-1225.

Sun Johnson, who was born and raised in Korea, teamed up with Nick Rocha to open a Korean restaurant that’s a rarity in the Valley. Why? It doesn’t act as though Korean cuisine is exclusively about grilled meat. Forget the tabletop grill. Ga Hyang doesn’t have them — it doesn’t need them. Start with duk boki, a mix of chewy rice cakes and tender fish cakes, swimming in a bath of pure onion and chile fire. Follow with haemul pajeon, a thick, crisp pancake stuffed with sweet scallions and seafood of all manner. When it’s a furnace outside, take refuge in mul naeng myun, slippery noodles with beef brisket and slivers of crisp, fresh fruit in a mustard-spiked beef broth that is literally iced over. Or warm yourself with a pure, milky sul long tang, slow-simmered from beef bones. The best thing here comes free of charge. Johnson’s banchan — the collection of pickled, marinated and fermented little dishes that accompany the meal — run circles around every other Korean restaurant in town. Nobody even comes close.\n\nDetails: 4362 W. Olive Ave., Glendale. MAP IT! 623-937-8550.

That’s no less true of the original Carolina’s near downtown Phoenix, where some dishes are better than others. But what Carolina’s does right is very, very right, and a diverse crowd that seems to represent the entire city comes down every day to take part in it. If we’re being honest, Carolina’s is a decrepit hole in the wall with little more than folding tables and chairs and a couple of soda machines. But what comes out of the kitchen is nothing less than the soul of Phoenix. Carolina’s was making giant flour tortillas decades before California decided it was cool, and they’re still some of the best — made to order and hot enough to burn your tongue. They make some fabulous, soupy burros, wrapped around stewed green or red chile, though the less iconic Oaxaca Special — with beans, cheese and chorizo — may be my favorite. Better yet, go ahead and get a machaca chimichanga. Here, it’s light and crisp, almost like pastry, and they might be the best argument for the form around.\n\nDetails: 1202 E. Mohave St., Phoenix.

Shouldn’t we have gotten over this by now? I say a lusty celebration of all things fragrant and funky is the cure, and Casa Filipina is where we’re going to throw the party. The poster child for laid-back international fare, Casa Filipina is a cozy mom-and-pop shop that joins a bakery and restaurant. The former fills multiple cases with wild and colorful sweets; the latter fills a menu with homestyle classics of Filipino cuisine. The uninitiated can ease into things with papery-crisp, cigar-shaped lumpia — Filipino spring rolls — or tortang talong, a gentle, comforting omelet stuffed with eggplant and pork. Speaking of pork, swineophiles will lose their minds over the crisp pata, a massive pork hock fried to a golden crisp; or the lechon kawali — chunks of crispy pork with a liver-enriched, sweet-and-sour sauce. When you’re ready, the funky, peanutty intensity of the kare kare or the dinuguan — a gorgeously thick, black vinegar and pork blood-enriched stew — will be waiting for you.\n\nDetails: 3531 W.

Cantonese, Sichuan, Hunan, sure, but who had even heard of Dongbei, nestled up to Korea in the far northeast reaches of the country? For many, Sunny Zhao and Lulu Zhou’s dumpling-dispensing destination was the first glimpse into a world of Chinese cuisine that stretched far beyond Americanized versions of midcentury standbys. Out with the rice, in with the wheat, formed into nubby chilled noodles dressed with tingling oil, baked into bread stuffed with leeks and rolled into the wrappers for Chou’s signature beef pies. The size of a hamburger patty with the juice of a soup dumpling and a sizzling, crunchy crust, they’re not to be missed. The winter gets cold in northwestern China, and Chou’s packs the kind of hearty soups and stews meant to insulate you from the cold and generate some heat. Not that we need more heat in Phoenix, but it’s a fascinating subset of Chinese cuisine to explore.\n\nDetails: 910 N. Alma School Road, Chandler, 480-821-2888. MAP IT! Also, 1250 E.

Sure, this is casual fare served from behind a fish counter, but its diminutive footprint belies the oversize impact it’s having on the local scene. Jon Heflin and Hogan Jamison truck in stellar seafood from San Diego three times a week, and the few staples they can’t catch or trade themselves are flown in from excellent sources. What isn’t sold in the case or distributed to local restaurants goes to chef Juan Zamora, who has crafted a compact but robust list of bowls, salads and sandwiches with everyday character and a hint of refinement. Cool mounds of cubed fish are joined by shishito peppers, slivered watermelon radish or pickled beech mushrooms. A delicately composed tostada or bruschetta might light up the specials board. Wednesday’s green chile tuna melt with fresh confit tuna and kimchi chimichurri has developed a fan club. There’s a reason the line is out the door and you can’t swing a stick in the place without hitting at least three chefs who are grabbing lunch on the way to work.\n\nDetails: 8015 E.

Formerly the right-hand man of Binkley’s culinary operation, Gauthier recently took over Carefree’s Café Bink and converted it into Confluence, a new spot that has the Valley’s fine-dining geeks all atwitter. In appearance, this is still a casual restaurant, little changed from the Café Bink days. But while the plates show Binkley’s influence on Gauthier’s work, this wild, creative fare is worlds apart from the bistro classics that previously anchored the space. A roasted peach dusted with cocoa and drizzled with honey plays against a creamy, funky Epoisses cheese fondue. A gloriously salty pork broth with simmered cockscomb works its way into the fibers of a slab of smoked pork belly, lightened with shiso and edamame. Fish dishes are tight. Golden pan-seared red snapper contrasts earthy lentils with sweet grapes and a light broth set ablaze with Calabrian chile. Halibut sits in a lush corn crema with little nibbles of Spanish chorizo and crispy garlic chips. Just a few months old, Confluence is doing some seriously exciting things and may be the sleeper hit of 2018.\n\nDetails: 36889 N. Tom Darlington Drive, Carefree.

Having parted ways with Helio Basin Brewing Co., Stanger teamed up with Sean Traynor to open a neighborhood restaurant/watering hole in suddenly red-hot south Tempe. The joint is no-frills, casual and a little raucous with a young drinking crowd. Cocktails, appropriately light and summery in the early going, have made for a nifty collection of refreshing concoctions. Stanger’s food, meanwhile, already is equal parts sharp and fascinating. Corn dumplings that resemble hush puppies sit in a thin, onion-rich Parmesan cream that’s good enough to be served on its own as a chilled soup. Forget the veggie burgers — Stanger builds a “burger” from celeriac and roasted vegetables that’s more satisfying than most meat substitutes. Medallions of beef swim in a Cheddar-scented beef jus; and the Belgian hare, with root vegetable pipian and a bit of apricot, is dynamite. Whatever you do, don’t skip the pie.\n\nDetails: 1006 E. Warner Road, Tempe. MAP IT! 480-629-4270, cottonandcopperaz.com.\n\nCrepe Bar\n\nJeff Kraus is a madman in the best possible way. It took a bit of a culinary kook to open a restaurant based around creative crepes in south Tempe long before south Tempe suddenly became cool. And thank heavens Kraus has no fear, because six years later, Crepe Bar still thrives, its namesake serving as a foundation to pitch a technicolor panoply of Kraus’ wild concoctions. His crepes might sport pork belly in a sweet espresso-maple glaze, drizzled with chile aioli under a soft, runny egg. They might be rolled and crisped like dosa, to be shattered and dipped in hummus with crispy chickpeas. They could be turned into chips to make crepe chilaquiles or smothered with jerk sausage and Fontina. They could be plied with lemon curd and hibiscus jelly, maple butter with bruleed bananas and pecans; or formed from buckwheat with Sonoran honey. Not to knock tradition, but creations like these are an expression of pure culinary joy — the intersection of a wild imagination and obsessive attention to detail with the humble crepe as the hook.\n\nDetails: 7520 S. Rural Road, Tempe.

There is also the fact that Rich Hinojosa’s creations — whatever you wish to call them — are flat-out delicious. In Crujiente’s case, consider the taco a template, where tortillas serve as the flavorful foundation for meticulously crafted small plates that draw from Hinojosa’s heritage, his fine-dining pedigree and a wide palette of international flavors. A gorgeous slip of Texas wagyu is dressed with puckery pickled shimeji mushrooms, cilantro mojo and a dab of karashi mustard. A steaming wedge of crisp tempura-fried avocado pairs with black beans and pickled onions and chiles. Fish, tender and juicy or deftly fried, is perfectly seasoned and dressed. And the tacos Crujientes, piled into a craggy, crisp shell, exemplify the Mexican-American crossover dishes of Hinojosa’s San Antonio upbringing.\n\nDetails: 3961 E. Camelback Road, Phoenix.

What can I say? David Najor serves a flipping-good dog at the Tempe original (the downtown Phoenix location is independently owned). This is a decadent coney we’re talking about: A gently spiced, natural-casing dog with a killer snap — made for Najor by a Michigan sausage maker — drowning in meaty sauce, onions and a squirt of yellow mustard. Fries are spot-on, too, freshly cut and fried with a little crisp and a steaming, tender core. The burgers are just as good. Tiny golf-ball-size wads of meat are smashed on the griddle and cooked to a juicy, sizzling crisp, then layered with cheese and stacked tall. They’ll happily make them larger or smaller, but three to five of these skinny patties is the sweet spot, in my book. Grab a Faygo and a bag of chips and you’re good to go. Sure, it’s just burgers and dogs. But burgers and dogs are rarely so correct.\n\nDetails: 930 W. Broadway Road, Tempe.

A boutique hotel is in the works for the corner where Don & Charlie’s now stands, and pending city approval, Don Carson stands poised to enjoy a well-deserved retirement. But at the very least, this Chicago-style tavern with enough sports memorabilia to fill a museum will have one final sendoff during spring training. This is the kind of fare that appeals to the baseball crowd: chopped liver with crunchy bagel chips; scampi “Chicago style” (that’s shrimp DeJonghe for those in the know); baby back ribs sauced and charred to a smoky crisp; and a meat locker full of steaks, including a killer prime rib eye with a deep, blackened crust. This is well-prepared, easy-to-enjoy food served in a comfy old Barcalounger of a restaurant, and she’ll be dearly missed.\n\nDetails: 7501 E. Camelback Road, Scottsdale.

Justin Park’s food is meant to be consumed with alcohol, plain and simple, and it’s riotously fun. Tteok kochi — chewy little rice cake nubbins basted with gochujang, broiled to a sticky crisp and dusted with crushed peanuts — is the ultimate bar snack, as far as I’m concerned. The fire chicken is a rare spicy dish that lives up to its name, swimming in a screaming hot chile gravy beneath a blanket of melted mozzarella. Crispy chunks of fried chicken abound, whether doused in a sweet and spicy Korean red sauce, served with slivered onions and a creamy dressing or offered as padak — topped with a mountain of shredded scallions and a sweet soy-mustard dip. And the seafood pancake is an unusual take thereon, loose and eggy on the top with a delicately crisped bottom. Come for the food, stay for the booze and karaoke, then order a second round of snacks.\n\nDetails: 1954 S. Dobson Road, Mesa.

On recent visits to the Phoenix icon’s namesake steakhouse, I’ve had immolated chops, sauteed spinach that’s mostly unseasoned cream and salads composed of limp, wilting spring mix. And yet I find myself unable to leave Durant’s off my list. Not because I’m afraid to slay a sacred cow — there are enough popular omissions here to jam my inbox with angry reader emails for months — but because goldarnit, I just can’t help but love the place. Durant’s is as much a museum as it is a restaurant, a rare relic of a bygone era filled with red leather banquettes, patterned velvet walls and worn wooden bars. Meanwhile, servers are there when you need them, gone when you don’t, and they hit that perfect note of graceful deference with just a faint, sardonic wink. Restaurants like Durant’s simply don’t exist anymore, except when they do, apparently. I can’t look past what a rare and special place it is, no matter how badly the kitchen overcooks my steak. No, the food isn’t especially good. But I’ll be there, if they’ll still have me, sitting at the bar with a shrimp cocktail and a very large martini.\n\nDetails: 2611 N. Central Ave., Phoenix.

Sonoran hot dogs abound, particularly late at night, when the air starts to cool and the temporary street stands set up shop. One crucial quality separates good from the great: toasting. The worst Sonoran dog with a freshly griddled bun will be better than most of those with a steamed bun, but El Caprichoso doesn’t force us to choose. This is the quintessential Arizona street dog — a cheap, low-quality sausage wrapped in crisp bacon with a grocery list of Mexican toppings and a sweet bun griddled to a deep, gorgeous gold. A folding table, a pop-up tent, some fluorescent light and 100-degree temps at 2 a.m. and you have an Arizona rite of passage.\n\nDetails: 2826 N. 35th Ave., Phoenix.

Serving breakfast and lunch to a pickup-truck crowd, Rosa Avitia’s Mexican diner is a casual charmer. There’s something unassuming and honest in her minimal chilaquiles, stale tortillas toasted in oil, doused with fresh salsa and topped with melted mozzarella cheese and a dusting of cotija. A dead-simple birria pairs tender goat with thick corn tortillas, a basic broth that only comes alive when doctored to your taste. But the killer app, so to speak, is the machaca. At so many restaurants, it’s rehydrated sludge with the flavor of acrid pot roast. Here, it’s simple dried beef, pounded and cooked with just a splash of liquid, still dense and chewy — almost jerky-like — and perfect with eggs. The cebada, an horchata-like drink made with barley, is still too sweet, but it’s more flavorful and less overly sweet than most. Served in a giant red plastic cup, it somehow makes the whole meal feel correct.\n\nDetails: 2140 W. Buckeye Road, Phoenix.

It’s been more than a year since Eugenia Theodosopoulos closed the Tempe location of Essence Bakery Café, and if fans of the original are still a little raw, it isn’t hard to see why. She is an enormously skilled baker who brought her French training to the desert and — this is no easy task — learned to adapt her techniques to our environment. Her delicate macarons are what set the Pinterest crowd on fire. But there are stellar baked goods aplenty, like perfect croissants, crisp baguettes, fruit Danish and seasonal specials like buche de noel. More substantial fare is also a delight. Theodosopoulos makes an excellent turnover studded with crumbled sausage and Gruyere and — to nobody’s surprise — a killer quiche. Come lunchtime, a béchamel-drenched croque monsieur with a bit of jalapeño buzz or a silky chicken pot pie are both winners. And she sneaks in a little bit of her heritage in the form of a gloriously light spanakopita.\n\nDetails: 3830 W. Indian School Road, Phoenix.

This is the kind of place that restaurateurs will tell you isn’t supposed to succeed on the left half of the map. And yet there it is: A tiny independent serving straight-up traditional Italian classics, made with exceptional care and steadfastly refusing to drift into red sauce territory to please the masses. Fabio Ceschetti’s decision to abandon Scottsdale in favor of Peoria has paid him in spades, and it wasn’t a complex equation. This is the soul of casual Italian dining, serving wood-fired pizza and paste fatte in casa, such as lasagna plied with meaty ragu and smooth besciamella or airy gnocchi simply dressed in a silky, Gorgonzola-laced cream. Pizzas are spot-on, a gentle balance of chew and crisp and deeply developed flavor, topped with just a few perfect ingredients. Small, family-run spots that do so little but do it so well are the backbone of Italy’s restaurant culture, and the perfect antidote to a barrage of chains that overpromise and underdeliver.\n\nDetails: 8275 W.

There are endless reasons to love FnB, a quirky, cozy space that embodies its proprietors’ penchant for marching to their own beat. There’s Charleen Badman’s preternatural ability to coax vegetables into revealing their truest nature; her talent for sizzling premium proteins on the grill; and Pavle Milic’s zeal for Arizona wines and spirits. But perhaps more than all of that, their work has put a bold stamp on the Valley’s emergence as a maturing, sophisticated culinary scene that can run with the big boys without feeling the need to mimic them. Potted smoked trout rillettes join rustic bread and a rainbow of pickled vegetables. Creamy Peruvian aji amarilllo is wrapped in a crisp spring roll shell. And the Gilfeather rutabaga is a witty play on a classic baked potato, plied with ginger creme fraiche and chives. The way Badman ropes in diverse international influences while expressing Arizona’s underappreciated agricultural bounty is unparalleled. If one restaurant best exemplifies the blossoming of our cuisine over the past decade, it’s FnB.\n\nDetails: 7125 E. Fifth Ave., Scottsdale.

He followed his daughter to New York, and it seemed that his charming destination for classic Italian fare might be lost forever. But in 2012, he returned to Old Town and opened up a time portal on Scottsdale Road, leading straight into a bygone era of white tablecloths, soft music, servers who know when not to talk and Italian fare that sports a little class while satisfying on a deep, visceral level. Photos of Marlon Brando and Sophia Loren line the walls; a pungent swipe of fresh garlic lines the bruschetta; and a crisp, perfectly seasoned crust lines the exterior of the orecchie elefante, Fazzuoli’s take on a juicy, thick-cut veal chop Milanese. Franco’s gently tiptoes the line between Italian and American, embracing some of the New World’s meatier, saucier habits without drifting into full-blown red sauce territory. This is classic cuisine done right, a bit of old-school elegance and a nod to the days when we used the word “continental” without some of the era’s clunky heft. And if anything starts to feel a touch too rich, a taste of Fazzuoli’s sweet, airy merenghata will take care of that... subito.\n\nDetails: 4327 N. Scottsdale Road, Scottsdale.

It’s even more unfortunate the one dish that has achieved widespread attention — fry bread— isn’t rooted in indigenous people’s centuries of history and culture. Rather, fry bread was a food of necessity prepared with government rations during a time when that same government was evicting them from the land that had sustained their culture. Still, here’s a dish that has become an emblem — both good and bad. The Fry Bread House, recognized by the James Beard Foundation as one of America’s Classics, makes by far the most delicious version I’ve tried in Phoenix. The first taste of Fry Bread House’s steaming, resilient bread with a gorgeous golden crisp is an “Aha!” moment, whether it’s piled with beans and meaty chile or dusted with cinnamon or powdered sugar and drizzled with honey.\n\nDetails: 4545 N.

When Gallo Blanco left the Clarendon Hotel, chef Doug Robson promised the white rooster would rise again. It took a few years, but the new Gallo Blanco is worth the wait. Robson’s casual, stylish spot in the Garfield district is leading a new wave of contemporary Arizona Mexican fare that’s smartly conceived, crisply executed, made with top-notch ingredients and a bargain for the price. Thick tortillas cradle taco fillings that get a quick sizzle in a wok. Salads composed with pristine produce boast a textural pop that gives them uncommon appeal. Quick-cured fish dishes like coctel de mariscos and ceviche de pescado are light and vibrant. And drippy, hedonistic affairs like the egg-soaked naco torta or the envuelto — pork al pastor suspended in gooey, griddled cheese — are completely irresistible. Toss in JT Taber’s breezy cocktails and it’s hard to want for more in a casual Mexican restaurant. If this is the wave of the future, we’re in for a good ride.\n\nDetails: 928 E. Pierce St., Phoenix.

Just as Asian fusion was newly reborn as a subtler, more sophisticated version of its schlocky ‘90s self, Chamberlin and his chefs, Rene Andrade and Roberto Centeno, are doing the same with the Southwest fare of yore, making it lighter, fresher and more thoughtful. A couple of months into its run, Ghost Ranch is making a mark. A stylish New Mexico-inspired room designed by Gennaro Garcia proves an airy and colorful home to dishes that reference the history of Southwest cuisine while bucking its more dated conventions. Pumpkin soup is smooth and lush, its richness derived from caramelization rather than abundance of cream. Enchiladas are fried to a crisp and lightly dressed rather than smothered in an earthy, smoky sauce made with Chimayo chiles. The chile relleno is roasted rather than fried, stuffed with intense mushroom duxelles and topped with a nest of crispy leeks. And in a true nod to the times, one of the strongest dishes on the menu is the plato vegano, a gorgeous and hearty collection of roasted vegetables with a splash of coconut milk and a chipotle cashew cream.\n\nDetails: 1006 E.

But the soft-spoken Kantak is so much more than a salad slinger. The Gladly, his sophomore effort, is on point, a casual and stylish American restaurant that isn’t afraid to have fun. Sassy, hearty and just a little wonky enough with the fundamentals to satisfy, The Gladly slings a mean chicken liver pate with pistachio and sage mustard. Plus, a gorgeous duck meatloaf enriched with foie gets a smoked cherry demi-glace. Larded scallops are plied with a cola gastrique; and coffee-rubbed short ribs are eye-opening in more than one sense of the term. What’s more, Donald Hawk’s raw bar — offering straight-up chilled seafood alongside creations like his signature ahi crudo with brown-butter vinaigrette and raising relish — is the icing on an already formidable cake.\n\nDetails: 2201 E.

Glai Baan is the best Thai restaurant in Phoenix. Cat Bunnag’s achingly charming little bungalow took a while to find its footing (though accurate at the time, I wish I could have that review back). But in 2018, it’s consistently spitting fire. With the ease of a seaside beach house and the warmth of a neighborhood bar, Glai Baan is a time-slowing destination that combines a mellow room with explosive dishes. That doesn’t always mean chile heat (nor should it). Coconut-marinated pork skewers are tender and sweet; deep-fried son-in-law eggs are dressed with a tart, punchy sauce; and mackerel fried rice is a steamy, comforting affair with a distinctive fermented richness. But when the fire arrives, it’s on. Funky salted crab papaya salad is dense with bird chiles. Kapro gai kai dao perks up minced chicken and a lacy egg with basil and no shortage of chiles. And a complex panang curry has some heat, but not at the expense of layer after fragrant layer of fresh, intense flavor. We were long overdue for a place like this.\n\nDetails: 2333 E.

Right up until that part of me was stuffed in a sack and tossed in a river by the part of me that can’t recall having more juicy, succulent, perfectly grilled meats anywhere else in town. I surrender. Yes, Green Corner looks like an antiseptic neighborhood counter-service joint, but just try to keep me away from the kifta kabob, scented with sumac and cinnamon, tender and meaty and dripping with sizzling lamb fat. You’ve seen this menu a hundred times before, and standards like baba ghannoug, hummus and kibbeh are all solid, if less than stellar. But anything off the phalanx of rotisseries or the kitchen’s grill is something to target, whether it be charred shawarma, plump chicken thighs or lamb chops seared on the grill. The truth is, most of the Valley’s widely revered Middle Eastern restaurants don’t season and cook their meats nearly as well as Green Corner.\n\nDetails: 1038 W. Southern Ave., Mesa, 480-835-2313.

Here, you’ll find a mix of classic maki and nigiri built on a solid foundation of excellent seafood and rice alongside Hashimoto’s more brash, contemporary creations. Among them: the Hana Egg, a soft-boiled, tempura-fried egg paired with a zippy mentaiko sauce; and grilled lamb marinated with miso and pomegranate juice. This is a family that can bring the wow factor if you want it. But the unsung heroes of the menu are Hana’s classic Japanese comfort dishes, whose charms are rooted in culinary tradition. Chicken karaage is perfectly seasoned, crisp and juicy. Bento boxes feature popular items like teriyaki and tonkatsu, but they’re anchored with simple simmered vegetables. Chilled soba noodles come with ethereal tempura and an icy, crystal-clear tsuyu dip; and ramen is firm to the tooth and bathed in lush, flavorful broths. The gleaming raw fish and colorful oyster shooters may win Instagram, but while plenty of neighborhood sushi joints can feed your eyes, few can feed your soul like Hana.\n\nDetails: 5524 N.

The new, contemporary resort is less the swingin’ hot spot of its ‘60s heyday and more a luxe oasis that’s built as a picture frame for nearby Camelback Mountain. At Hearth ’61, chefs Charles Wylie, Richard Garcia and Alfred Muro walk the tightrope of producing inventive cuisine while adhering to the constraints of being the resort’s primary restaurant, and the restaurant is finding its stride. A swanky and lively room complete with a water feature is the proper home for a spicy, rough-hewn ahi tartare dressed with crisp, fresh vegetables or roasted prawns with andouille-flecked polenta. Soups like a squash puree or a lobster bisque have a silky feel and bold intensity; and a side of ancient grain risotto is a nutty delight. Hefty short rib agnolotti splashed with horseradish cream are like an Italian-Polish crossover dish; and simple roasted meats are beautifully prepared. But I’m still stuck on the swordfish steak, a juicy specimen set ablaze by an herbal, green harissa.\n\nDetails: Mountain Shadows Resort, 5445 E. Lincoln Drive, Paradise Valley.

The cure for this epidemic of meaty myopia rests in places like Hodori. An ancient stalwart of the Valley’s Korean restaurant scene, Hodori continues to stand tall as one of its best and most welcoming. Kimchi jun with a gentle sourness and prominent burn sizzles; and bosam — steamed pork with spicy fermented accompaniments and cabbage to wrap — is a decadent platter that could feed a few dozen. Soups and stews are the thing, whether they include delicate tofu swimming in a sea of soondubu fire or milky dogani tang, an ox knee and brisket elixir with a gentle, restorative countenance. And don’t worry. If you insist on meatifying, the kitchen does a very respectable job with standards like juicy chok kalbi and daeji bulgogi in a fire-laced marinade.\n\nDetails: 1116 S.

A Western-trained chef who spent a year working in Japan, Hebert has developed a very personal style of ramen that might get under the skin of the tonkotsu fanboys, but it’s hard to see that as a bad thing. It isn’t that he hasn’t done his homework. He’s a student of the cuisine who made his name blending French and Japanese flavors and techniques in upscale environs. But like so many shops in Japan that are playing with convention, Hebert’s humble ramen bar uses the framework as a means of self-expression. What he’s expressing is one of the best bowls of noodles in town. The goma is the signature item, a sesame-spiked pork broth with a nutty countenance. But the gently smoky shoyu and the chile-spiked seafood ramen are also personal favorites. Spiked with some unconventional ingredients and possessed of non-traditional tweaks, they’re solidly grounded in careful technique.\n\nDetails: 15689 N. Hayden Road, Scottsdale.

Some do it better than others and a few are quite good, but the rote collection of pho, bun and broken rice dishes has achieved the formulaic predictability of a fast-food chain. At Mekong Plaza, the sit-down restaurants in the front may be more popular, but the food court in the back is where you’ll find the action. Hue Gourmet features the flavors of central Vietnam, and if your experience with Vietnamese food is limited to your neighborhood pho joint, this will be a game-changer. Chewy, thick tapioca noodles and chunks of crab comprise the viscous, briny banh canh cua. Mi quang marries turmeric-spiced noodles with shrimp, pork, vegetables and crisp sesame crackers. Banh beo, glutinous rice coins, are dotted with dried shrimp and served with a lip-puckering sauce. The bun bo hue is the genuine article — a fiery, funky lemongrass soup thick with beef and pork, rather than the doctored pho you’ll find elsewhere in town. And speaking of pho, don’t bother: They don’t make it, and you won’t miss it.\n\nDetails: Mekong Plaza, 66 S. Dobson Road, Mesa.

Yeah, Chelsea’s Kitchen makes the Arcadia moms swoon; Buck & Rider’s parking lot is jam-packed at all hours with silver and black SUVs; and La Grande Orange has practically achieved historical landmark status at this point. But I love Ingo’s sun-dappled patio and circular dining bar. I love those tart, mustardy deviled eggs and shattered potato chips with yogurt and searing hot sauce. I love the crispy fried sandwiches, both chicken and fish. I love the barbecue and bacon-laden Paris Texas burger. I love the Farmer’s Daughter burger, with tart sauerkraut and funky fol epi. And I love that I can eat one of those burgers and not feel like I just consumed half a cow. The thing is, Lynn is a student of careful design and he runs a tight ship. When you’re talking about a neighborhood burger stand, that makes it just a little special.\n\nDetails: 4502 N. 40th St., Phoenix.

Though I’m a hopeless fanboy, by all public accounts, Jean-Georges Vongerichten has barely set foot in Arizona since J&G opened. But to overlook it on that basis would be a grand disservice to Jacques Qualin, who has taken the international super chef’s vision and made J&G Steakhouse his own. Yes, the steaks are excellent, and if you’re the saucy type, they’re accompanied by the best in town. But to my mind, that’s the least interesting part of the menu. I geek out on piping-hot Dungeness crab fritters with cool Asian pear and a sweet sauce laden with black pepper. I swoon over chilled crab and avocado with a smooth and creamy cocktail sauce tarted up with brandy. I marvel at ruby-red, sweet-and-sour beet risotto with a puckery lemon foam. I salivate over seared beef cheeks with a buttery habanero hot sauce. And I chill with baked Alaska, like a creamy bruleed hedgehog, cool pineapple sorbet waiting within. I have a Vongerichten trading card pinned up in my cubicle. But to me, this is Qualin’s restaurant.\n\nDetails: The Phoenician, 6000 E. Camelback Road, Phoenix.

That’s the kind of stridently unpretentious hole-in-the-wall barbecue dive that fulfills all our romantic storybook notions of what American smoked meat should be. James Lewis didn’t even have a restaurant to call home until 2017, before which he sold barbecue from a guerilla street operation parked under a bridge. But now with a south Phoenix storefront of his own, it’s far easier to sample his ruby ribs with tender chew, juicy and succulent smoked chicken and a barky, chaotic tangle of pulled pork that’s the best I’ve tried in the Valley. His understated, Zen-like sauce is a supplement, not a distraction, and a killer cup of peppery stewed greens headlines unusually good sides. The secret? The ebullient Lewis will insist it’s what the “JL” in JL Smokehouse stands for: “Just Love.”\n\nDetails: 1712 E. Broadway Road, Phoenix.

The atmosphere is essentially nonexistent and the line can be long and slow. But none of that matters when you’re presented with a smooth, elastic round of yam fufu, bathed in a spiced tomato soup brimming with goat meat. This is west African cuisine — hewing closest to Ghanaian — built on seasoned starches, meats and thick, sultry stews. The chicken stew is deep and ruddy with the rich sweetness of reduced tomatoes, while the bean stew is round and robust with beans that have perfect bite. Jollof rice arrives with tender chicken and slippery sweet plantains. Waakye — Ghana’s take on rice and beans — goes equally well with stewed goat or a mound of seasoned spinach. And the peanut soup defies the sweet conventions to which Americans are accustomed, striking a deliciously deep, earthy note.\n\nDetails: 325 W. Elliot Road, Tempe.

Under the direction of chef Ryan Swanson, Kai is as good as ever, and maybe better. From the room to the service to the plates, here’s a rare restaurant that exudes refinement at every turn, weaving a palette of indigenous ingredients into a striking collection of dishes. A soup of pureed squash takes on the sultry scent of mesquite-charred hahl with hits of sweet i’itoi onion and tart red berry dust. A mélange of pickled veggies join cactus shoots, planted in rye soil and bathed in saguaro mist, creating a wild to behold and wilder to eat vegetable forest. And meaty buffalo tenderloin joins asparagus-scented cholla buds and tepary beans, sweetened by saguaro syrup. Kai has one foot in the past, but it’s looking to the future. Here’s hoping fine dining of this caliber continues to have one.\n\nDetails: Sheraton Grand at Wild Horse Pass, 5594 W. Wild Horse Pass Blvd., Gila River Reservation.

Iridescent exterior paint job aside, Las 15 Salsas looks like any old neighborhood taco joint, conjuring visions of greasy gorditas and immolated carne asada. What it contains, however, is an explosive menu of regional Mexican specialties, from crisp, bean-smeared tlayudas to thick, steaming molotes. The heart and soul of the menu is an assortment of moles — all five of them. Hernandez serves the familiar rich and ruddy mole coloradito and the popular chocolate-spiked mole negro, bursting with the complexity of burned chiles. But she also slings a vibrant, herb-dense mole verde; a smooth and lightly sweet mole Amarillo; and the even harder to find mole estofado, which plays like a Mexican-Mediterranean mashup. Bring some friends and try them all. Object lessons don’t get much more delicious than this.\n\nDetails: 722 W. Hatcher Road, Phoenix.

Maybe we got a little carried away with the notion that our pizza needed a seal of approval from overseas. But it speaks to Justin Piazza’s care and attention to detail that his pizzerias are one of only two restaurant groups in the Valley to get the official benediction from Napoli. What Piazza prepares, both in his Glendale and downtown Phoenix locations, is a faithful rendition of the classic — flour, water, olive oil and salt crafted into a chewy, flavorful dough with a blistered cornicone and a paucity of quality toppings. None of which is to downplay the antipasti, paste and more heavily laden pizzas, but the menu’s raison d’être is anything with the initials “D.O.C.” at the end.\n\nDetails: 5803 W.

Our local fare is represented by a range of Mexican restaurants, some more closely resembling the traditional fare of northern Mexico and some — like La Piñata — more heavily influenced by American conventions. This joyously colorful retro AZ-Mex stalwart is where you go for ladlefuls of tingling chile sauce, gobs of sour cream and oodles of melty yellow cheese, a breed of naturally occurring fusion fare all its own. Cheese crisps are a model for the genre, but even more decadent is the Mary Lou — a stoner mashup of a dish that folds an entire cheese crisp around a core of molten red or green chile. Enchiladas are soft and tender, filled with flavorful meats and completely smothered in a ruddy, spicy bog of chile sauce. Crunchy tacos and flautas are piled with chopped tomato and icy crisp shredded lettuce. Even though I’m an unadorned chimichanga evangelist, here’s the place where letting them smother that crisp shell in a bucket of sauce feels like the only way to go.\n\nDetails: 5521 N. Seventh Ave., Phoenix. MAP IT! 602-279-1763, lapinatarestaurantaz.com.\n\nLamp Wood Oven Pizzeria\n\nChris Bianco inspired a generation of Arizona pizza makers and, simply put, Matt Pilato is one of the best. In a town bursting at the seams with wood-fired pizza, Pilato has focused an obsessive attention to detail on local conventions to create a signature style that’s descended from Bianco, but entirely his own. Oft overlooked due to its distance from the city’s core, Lamp serves a pizza that’s modestly topped, roundly flavored and crisper than most. Pizza menus that stretch into double-digit offerings tend to get diluted, but every one of Pilato’s 28 creations is well-balanced and carefully thought-out. The Scientist offsets a plethora of salumi with dense, meaty Castelvetrano olives. The Gepetto takes a sweet and pungent route, pairing Pilato’s boozy house sausage with caramelized onions and blue cheese. And though it’s one of Phoenix’s prime specimens, the pizza isn’t even the best thing on the menu. That title belongs to the mignulata, a type of Sicilian bread that sports a tender, layered core stuffed with pungent onions, sausage and pecorino enveloped in a crackling crisp crust.\n\nDetails: 8900 E.

Jones had been around the block, cheffing his way through a series of Valley gigs before hitting his stride with a lunch-counter version of The Larder + The Delta. Now, finally with his own space and kitchen, he’s turning up the heat. His modern Southern fare with a little local flair and a dash of Chicago soul is electric, and now it’s unchained. The Low Country perlou has gotten a king-size upgrade, its Carolina Gold rice now piled with clams, mussels and colossal prawns. A Two Wash Ranch chicken strikes a pose, one talon in the air, resting on a panzanella built on cucumber, Arizona melon, cornbread and plenty of sweetened vinegar. But perhaps nothing exemplifies Jones’ work more than his hoppin’ John. Some call it sacrilege, but pulling out the pork to put the focus on the sizzling rice, red peas and herbs is like seeing the flavors through a microscope for the first time. The Larder + The Delta was already one of the Valley’s most exciting spots. Now we get to see what Jones can really do.\n\nDetails: Portland on The Park, 200 W. Portland St., Phoenix.

This is as informal as it gets. Grab a ticket, mark off a few selections, poke your head into the kitchen and try to flag down somebody to take your order. Wedge yourself into a tiny table, and in a matter of moments you’ll be feasting on pani puri, diminutive spheroid crisps ready to be stuffed with potato and chickpeas and a splash of tamarind chutney. Papri — small, thin wafers — are smothered with yogurt, a mix of fragrant chutneys and sev, a flurry of tiny, crisp noodles. The bada paav — a fried potato burger, for lack of a more elegant description — is hearty, playfully spiced and served up on a no-frills sesame burger bun. And a panoply of sultry curries and stewed vegetables stand at the ready for sipping and dipping. Plates are small and the prices are smaller, making it easy for those unfamiliar with chaat to dive in and explore.\n\nDetails: 1813 E. Baseline Road, Tempe.

Though the Valley was awash in barbecue joints before Scott Holmes hit the scene, a couple of exceptions aside, they ranged from serviceable to shameful. But even the standouts couldn’t touch the product Little Miss BBQ put out from day one: A trayful of succulent smoked meat that turns dedicated carnivores into blubbering fools willing to stand in line for hours in 115-degree heat. Holmes has achieved a quantum leap in Valley barbecue, and now, everybody else — some respectably so — is playing catch-up. It has become an arms race, folks, but Holmes still holds the ultimate doomsday device: A peppery smoked brisket that oozes fat with a gentle nudge, flakes into silky bliss on the roof of your mouth and packs a smoky wallop. Taking nothing away from Holmes’ ribs, house-made sausage and killer grits and beans, the fatty brisket is the dish that pushed Phoenix barbeque to the next level.\n\nDetails: 4301 E.

It’s easy to quip that Phoenix is still green, an immature city without a strong sense of history and time. Then you descend the narrow staircase for a special dinner in the timber-supported basement at The Hermosa Inn where Megargee (reputedly) sold bootleg hooch and hosted illicit gambling, and it’s a stark reminder that the history is here if you’re willing to look. Lon’s at The Hermosa is bursting with rustic charm, not to mention the beauty of one of the best dining terraces in town, and Jeremy Pacheco is so perfect for the place he came to work here twice — returning after a stint in Las Vegas because he couldn’t stay away. This is contemporary dining, but there’s a lingering hint of cowboy cuisine in Pacheco’s menu, from a smoky tortilla soup with pulled chicken to a confit duck crepe with spiced mole to gorgeous pecan-roasted lamb. If Mangalitsa is on the menu, don’t miss it. Pacheco knows his swine.\n\nDetails: Hermosa Inn, 5532 N. Palo Cristi Road, Paradise Valley.

Peruvian is such a fascinating cuisine, blending Spanish, Japanese, African, Italian, Chinese and indigenous influences into a complex jigsaw puzzle where you can still see the seams but the pieces fit perfectly. The Valley’s Peruvian restaurants all have their specialties, but I find myself returning to Los Andes for dishes like fiery ceviche plied with sweet potato and onions and spiked with pisco. Causa — cool mashed potatoes tarted up with lime and yellow chiles and layered with shrimp or chicken salad — has a light, fresh pop. And skewers of grilled beef heart bring the smoky, meaty spice. Lomo saltado, always a crowd-pleaser, is a hearty stir-fry of beef and potatoes. Graham makes my favorite aji de gallina in town — a bizarre and utterly comforting dish of chile-spiked stewed chicken in a creamy morass of potatoes, Parmesan and ground walnuts.\n\nDetails: 6025 N. 27th Ave., Phoenix.

Really, this is all I want in a Puerto Rican restaurant. Now with a little room to maneuver (their previous space could seat eight if everybody held their breath), it’s a little easier to bring a crowd and work your way through a list of Puerto Rican classics, still charmingly unpretentious, served in baskets and Styrofoam trays. Pasteles — pork-laced tamales steamed in banana leaves — have a smooth texture and herbal fragrance. For mains, starch lays down the baseline in the form of rice and pigeon peas or beans with squash; and they pair with luscious meats like roasted pork with a citrus marinade or gloriously tender baked chicken. Plantains are abundant: As crisp tostones, sweetly caramelized amarillos or substituting as bread for the jibarito, which is a steak sandwich laden with cheese, vegetables and garlicky mayo. And the Mofongo is outstanding, a mash of plantains, pork and enough garlic to make you think they buy it by the truckload.\n\nDetails: 1916 W. Baseline Road, Mesa. MAP IT! 480-223-8217, facebook.com/milliescafeaz.\n\nMora Italian\n\nMaybe the most wildly anticipated opening in recent memory, Mora Italian — predictably — has come to rest somewhere between the life-changing culinary experience Scott Conant’s fans were expecting and the overrated faceplant the celebrity schadenfreude crowd was hoping for. Which is to say, this is an exciting place that’s sometimes more solid than sensational, but it can hit some screaming highs when it’s firing on all cylinders. Mora is busy and loud and where you want to be when you want to be seen, managing to stand out even on a strip as brash and brazen as Seventh Street’s new restaurant row. Antipasti like a crisp fritto misto or creamy carbonara suppli hit the mark. But the polenta bosciaola — pairing rich polenta with an intense brew of seasonal mushrooms — is a flat-out stunner. Pastas like the black campanelle — a smart and spicy spin on clam pasta — and meltaway lobster gnudi are strong, and grilled meats and fish can hit similar highs. But the best dish on the menu may still be Conant’s signature pasta al pomodoro, as simple and perfect as they come.\n\nDetails: 5651 N. Seventh St., Phoenix. MAP IT! 602-795-9943, moraitalian.com.\n\nMowry & Cotton\n\nIt’s tough to stifle a chuckle when the “casual” restaurant at one of the swankiest resorts in town cites Arizona’s dusty, Wild West history as the inspiration for a spare-no-expense space that’s gorgeously appointed in crisp leather and smooth sanded wood. But while Tandy Peterson’s menu displays a sneaky level of refinement commensurate with The Phoenician’s usual luxury, it’s applied to dishes that evoke a kind of rustic sass. Mowry & Cotton’s stunning oven is a far cry from a campfire, but char and smoke permeate her creations. Robust, earthy flatbreads take atypical toppings like mushrooms with apricots and horseradish. Smoked yogurt and mustard greens dress barbecued beets; and crisp roasted potatoes are plied with fiery chorizo and hot sauce. A whole bass turned inside out and roasted to a juicy crisp makes for delectable do-it-yourself tacos. And grilled pheasant — deeply lacquered with an anchovy wash and buried beneath broccolini, almonds, citrus and cherries — is a remarkable dish.\n\nDetails: The Phoenician, 6000 E.

Hartman slings what might be the best brisket in town not made by a guy named Holmes. He does it with a Southern Pride smoker, which usually raises the floor and lowers the ceiling. I say “usually” because Hartman plays an instrument designed for volume like a virtuoso, coaxing a surprising level of subtlety out of meat that’s more gently seasoned than some of the widely popular styles — everyday rather than occasion barbecue, if you will. Of course, brisket isn’t the be-all and end-all. His ribs, pulled pork and hot links join some solid sides to make for one of the most consistently excellent barbecue options in town. Sauces are numerous and thoughtfully concocted, but they’re best used sparingly. The place is called “Naked” for a reason.\n\nDetails: 2340 W. Bell Road, Phoenix, 602-439-4227. MAP IT!

Among the best of the newcomers is Nishikawa Ramen, which recently opened a second Valley location. Nishikawa serves solid gyoza and surprisingly excellent takoyaki, crisp and creamy with a nice nugget of octopus in the center. But the ramen is the thing here, and pork broth is Nishikawa’s medium. It’s a creamy and rich tonkotsu with a luscious, clean scent, and it serves as the base for six bowls, all of which are quite good. The straight tonkotsu with skinny Hakata-style noodles is lush, with tender pork chashu and a bump of pungent fish powder. Nishikawa’s miso ramen substitutes a more substantial kinky noodle along with the requisite corn, while the curry ramen is a nice change of pace. The signature bowl, however, is Nishikawa’s best. Laced with black garlic oil and fried onion, the Nishikawa Black lends a nice allium pungency and sweetness to an already exquisite broth.\n\nDetails: 1901 E. Ray Road, Chandler.

In a rare victory for quality and care, Raducha is now rightly recognized as one of the Valley’s most important bread makers, and his “modern wood-fired deli,” Noble Eatery, carries that ethos through to the lunch counter. Tender ciabatta is stuffed with fresh mozzarella and slivered finocchiona. Robust toast is smeared with creamy ricotta and topped with roasted mushrooms. The wheaty crust of a diminutive pizza is topped with potatoes and a whiff of rosemary. The tuna salad, gently dressed with olive oil and premium vinegar, is still a showstopper. At a time when most “feel-good” eating is factory-farmed bird food, we need more of this breed of rugged culinary honesty.\n\nDetails: 4525 N. 24th St., Phoenix.

Nobuo Fukuda serves dazzling food that’s smart and precise. But the way he has so naturally married the techniques and ethos of his native Japan to the soul and flavors of Arizona is what makes his work unique. In a historic building subtly adorned with Japanese accents, his contemporary izakaya gracefully marries East and West, pairing tako with tomato and mozzarella, hamachi with grapefruit and avocado, tuna with roasted beets, and saikyo miso with foie gras. Moreover, Fukuda goes as humble as crisp tonkatsu sandwiched between slices of shokupan at lunch, and as refined as a delicate chawanmushi duo — cold and hot — served by appointment at the four-seat counter as part of his omakase. If you glimpse beneath the surface, Nobuo at Teeter House is as much about Arizona as it is about Japan. Seeing desert flavors and products focused through a Japanese lens is nothing short of revelatory.\n\nDetails: Heritage Square, 622 E. Adams St., Phoenix.

Noca was defined by Wexler’s obsessive food-geek palate. Nocawich is no different, slinging a short list of sandwiches and salads composed from stellar ingredients like Biellese salumi, Snake River Farms beef, Russ & Daughters lox and H&H bagels. The Italian Stallion layers killer giardiniera with slivers of fine salumi; and the Clubber Lang, with house roast beef and spicy provolone, conveys all the punch of its namesake. Wexler’s patty melt is a refined take on the genre made with Gruyere and a slick bordelaise; and his “What the cluck?” is probably the best fried chicken sandwich in town, with seasoned fries carefully engineered to a precise crunch. A breakfast burrito spiked with chimichurri crema and crispy potatoes is a game changer. Deep in Arizona State University territory with a menu almost entirely priced in the $8 to $12 range, it’s priced for a student’s budget. Let’s hope they appreciate what a gem they have there.\n\nDetails: 777 S. College Ave., Tempe. MAP IT! 480-758-5322, nocawich.com.\n\nOcotillo\n\nThis place fascinates on a number of levels. Approaching Ocotillo is like entering the quad of a culinary campus — a smartly designed compound that combines restaurant, event space, coffee shop, public park and biergarten all into one. It’s a study in urban oasis, connecting space, food and community. But from a culinary standpoint, Ocotillo is remarkable in the way it takes the spirit of the tiny restaurants that have shaped contemporary Arizona cuisine and finds a way to deliver that upstart ethos on a large scale. Snappy vegetable dishes like smoked beets with ricotta and pistachios or a whole head of cauliflower roasted to a deep, nutty brown with an aleppo vinaigrette and fresh herbs showcase fine produce. Robust pasta dishes like pappardelle in a rich ragu join meaty mains like mesquite grilled chicken, loaded with local honey, dates, citrus and chiles. This is the desert expressed on a plate in a restaurant that isn’t a sneaky, in-the-know hot spot. Put another way, Ocotillo is proof of concept that this new wave of Arizona cuisine needn’t be reserved for the fooderati.\n\nDetails: 3243 N. Third St., Phoenix.

Of course, communities need community gathering spots, and Old Town Sarajevo is one of Phoenix’s most prominent, serving Bosnian cuisine since 2001. A casual café gives way to a country village-themed dining room with a short list of hearty fare. Meaty cabbage rolls are splashed with a tomato-laced broth; bean soup is thick and earthy; and pastries stuffed with meat, spinach or cheese are tender and comforting. The pljeskavica, a monstrous spiced meat patty, is mighty fine. But the stars are the cevapi, juicy little veal sausages stuffed into a steaming bread called lepinja with a cloudlike crumb and a crisp, oily crust. The cevapi are as comforting as they are succulent — served with chopped raw onion, kajmak (a close cousin of sour cream called) and ajvar, a sweet and slightly pungent spread made with roasted eggplant and red peppers. The best way to end the meal? Turkish coffee and good conversation.\n\nDetails: 3411 W. Northern Ave., Phoenix.

Ho hum, another little hipster coffee shop with nice-looking pastries and a smattering of breakfast and lunch dishes. But a few bites deep, Ollie Vaughn’s starts to separate itself from the pack. Flaky, buttery almond croissants, lemon poppy-seed cake with a sharply sour glaze and a light, creamy tomato quiche emerge from the pastry case. Ricotta pancakes are gorgeous, light and tender, with fresh fruit compote and real maple syrup. Stellar biscuits can be smothered with sausage gravy or stuffed with eggs, meat and cheese for a build-your-own breakfast sandwich. Green chile pork, in stripped-down fashion, eschews the soupy standard and shoots instead for an understated burn. Hash browns that have a smooth, creamy core with a shattering, golden crisp — above and beneath — are the Olympian ideal of the form. Lunch excels as well, with a “Cuban” sandwich that features the green chile pork and an almost pungent tuna salad with the sweet-spicy punch of jalapeño marmalade. And to nobody’s surprise, Ollie’s coffee game is strong.\n\nDetails: 1526 E. McDowell Road, Phoenix.

But the true depth and breadth of this pillar of the Chinese culinary pantheon is poorly understood in the West, and better revealed at Original Cuisine than anywhere else in the Valley. A new wave of contemporary Sichuan cuisine — rooted in tradition but pushing creative boundaries — has washed over California and finally reached Arizona, where it rests in a well-tended whitewashed box of a restaurant in Mesa’s Asian market district. You can get the saline sting of fuqi feipian; the chile-laced tingle of Chongqing chicken; and a ginger- and garlic-packed mapo dofu, to be sure. But you can also get tender meatballs and slivers of winter melon in a simple, silky broth; moan-inducing slices of slippery pork belly dipped in a pungent sauce; and pickled Sichuan “kimchi” that’s gently tart and almost effervescent. The menu isn’t quite the murderer’s row that it was when the restaurant first launched, but this is still next-level Sichuan fare in a town that desperately needed it.\n\nDetails: 1853 W. Broadway Road, Mesa.

Now, with the new Gallo Blanco’s simplified menu, Otro stands in starker contrast. They’re both rooted in the same earth, but like the difference between Gallo’s corn tortillas and Otro’s flour tortillas, they explore some of the same themes in different ways. Both have killer breakfasts and sharp salads in common, but Otro maintains the more contemporary taco style, plying succulent pork belly with a sweet glaze and tomatillo relish; or chicken with mushrooms, poblanos and aji amarillo. Mains cast a wider net, letting Robson explore his Vietnamese heritage a bit with fresh spring rolls or caldo de pollo — chicken pho in disguise on a Mexican menu. Spanish and New Mexican influences play stronger as well. And if you’ve been skipping the burgers because who gets burgers at a Mexican restaurant, you’ve been making a huge mistake. They’re some of the best in town.\n\nDetails: 6035 N. Seventh St., Phoenix.

It would be easy to say a chef like Urciuoli belongs in the kitchen of a fine-dining restaurant, but he’s after something bigger. Pa’La is culinary populism at work, a declaration of war on the notion that premium ingredients and refined presentations should be reserved for the well-heeled. At Pa’La, a spartan counter-service joint in a blue-collar neighborhood, Urciuoli serves simple tapas composed of perfect ingredients. The Italian native pairs imported mozzarella and burrata with roasted vegetables. He bakes bread to order and fills it with roasted wood-grilled skate wing and sizzled Spanish sausage. And he tops his Ramon Navarro bowl — a blend of ancient grains, beans, nuts and seeds dressed with premium oils and vinegars — with whatever smoky, charred seafood strikes his fancy that day. Put these dishes on fine china instead of paper plates, add a ritzy room and service staff, and he could charge quadruple the price. But that would be missing the point, wouldn’t it?\n\nDetails: 2107 N. 24th St., Phoenix.

Restaurateur Aric Mei — also involved in the forthcoming Los Olivos Farm project — has become something of an urban farming evangelist. So nearly a decade into its run, The Parlor has gone from neighborhood Italian restaurant to a working lab where Mei tries to practice what he preaches. On the surface, this is any old casual, contemporary Italian joint, slinging pizza, pasta and salads. But something as simple as lightly sweet caponata bruschetta sings, supported by excellent produce and careful balance. Salads based on mixed greens, usually a throwaway, are atypically bright and crisp. Pastas with substantial bite are generously dressed with rich ragus. And the pizzas, a light and chewy variety, are smartly dressed. Sausage is fine, but sausage with grilled radicchio and sage is compelling. A pizza puttanesca laden with tender, spicy seafood is a delight. And when summer rolls around, the sweet pop of roasted corn and chiles with a touch of spicy crema is impossible to resist.\n\nDetails: 1916 E. Camelback Road, Phoenix.

Husband-and-wife team Walleye Lai and Tina Truong started by selling exotic fruit from the back of a van before moving the operation to Winglee Market, a partnership with a California poultry farm that specializes in breeds of chickens popular with Asian chefs. These stellar birds make the Truongs’ lightly seasoned chicken pho some of the best in town. But there’s a lot more to Pho Winglee, the market’s next-door companion restaurant. Fried chicken wings are piping hot, paper-crisp and encased in a salty-sweet fish sauce lacquer. Grilled meats served with broken rice are tender and juicy. Rice vermicelli is topped with perfect spring rolls; shrimp paste wrapped in lacy crisp tofu skin and sweet, smoky slivers of pork. Pho Winglee isn’t substantially different from other Vietnamese spots that dot the landscape. But it’s fresher, crisper and more flavorful than the rest.\n\nDetails: 111 S. Dobson Road, Mesa.

It’s tempting to tell the whippersnappers to remember their history. Sure, it’s everywhere now, but this kind of pizza didn’t exist in this town before Bianco. I want to respect differences of opinion, while digging into one of Bianco’s pies, but I find it hard to accept that the anti-hype is anything but pure contrarianism. This is outstanding pizza with a depth of flavor built on heritage grains and a crisp and craggy character forged in the wood oven, simply topped with vibrant ingredients expressed at their peak. What’s more, at the Town & Country location, the pasta may be even better. Bianco is as much an ethos as a name, one that reveres local agriculture, seeks to extract the most from every ingredient and is constantly seeking honesty, both from the dishes themselves and the people who make them. It’s all right there on the plate.\n\nDetails: Heritage Square, 623 E. Adams St., Phoenix, 602-258-8300. MAP IT!

But it has evolved into something more — a local restaurant group that has harnessed popular Italian fare and elevated its integrity without sacrificing its broad appeal. Restaurateur Stefano Fabbri runs a boisterous, contemporary establishment. His collection of wood-fired pizzas and fresh pastas is a delectable, never-ending work in progress that pushes diners just a little bit further with each successive year. VPN-certified (that’s food geek speak for “hardcore traditional”) Neapolitan pizzas, such as the margherita and bufala verace, do a fine job of conveying the style’s chewy countenance, bubbling cornicone and straightforward adornment. But less conventional items like the charred, paper-thin, Rimini-style pizzas and the cheese-stuffed focaccia di Recco can steal the show from the main event, and Pomo slings a mean lasagna to boot.\n\nDetails: 8977 N.

More to the point, Dustin Christofolo is helping purge the antiquated notions of desert cuisine from our systems, replacing them with something gorgeously delicate and refined, and grown — to a large extent — right on the property’s farm. The charming farmhouse and some of the most serene, romantic outdoor dining around would make this a popular destination even if the kitchen were in shambles. Thankfully, it’s quite the opposite. Christofolo shares creations that border on ethereal, such as uni removed from its usual umami bomb context and offset instead by light, pickled kohlrabi, grapefruit and meringue. His beef carpaccio, on crisp bread spoons with tempura-fried herbs and a light blue cheese aioli, borders on precious. Even a tangle of sausage-studded cappellacci is lightened with cauliflower, spigarello and a whiff of tarragon. The rest of the world may see the surrounding country as a harsh, if beautiful, wasteland. But here is food that gives a stage to the fruits of the desert more rarely seen and appreciated.\n\nDetails: The Farm at South Mountain, 6106 S. 32nd St., Phoenix.

She opened this Scottsdale institution nearly 25 years ago, but unlike so many moldering relics of the era that now feel clumsy and dated, Rancho Pinot is as fresh and relevant as any newcomer to the scene. Filled with California- and Italian-influenced classics you can ease into like a worn leather chair, the menu’s focus on pure flavor, unfussy presentations and classic comforts is at once timeless and squarely on trend. A round of house-pulled burrata is a rich and creamy morsel, whether paired with a stone fruit relish or swimming in a roasted tomato broth. Grilled quail are succulent and sweet; and delicate gnocchi are nestled into a rich lamb ragu. But Nonni’s Sunday chicken, simply braised with mushrooms and white wine and paired with crisp polenta, exemplifies Rancho Pinot’s appeal. Restaurants new and old struggle to show this kind of grace and maturity in their food, but Robertson, as always, makes it look easy.\n\nDetails: 6208 N. Scottsdale Road, Scottsdale.

Fortunately, it’s an enviable one. Reathrey Sekong is the kind of charming and tasty spot that food geeks dream of opening. Mother-and-son team Lakhana and Yuth In serve a list of Khmer specialties even more colorful and vibrant than the surroundings, which is saying something given the room’s neon paint job. Pleah, a Cambodian salad made here with marinated raw beef, is a light and pungent affair, cool and plied with fresh herbs. Soups are superb, in particular a lemongrass-scented number with coconut and a touch of tangy tamarind to lend a bracing sourness. The Phnom Penh noodle soup, fortified with pork liver and intestines, is offally good (sorry). For those less inclined toward organ eatery, the lok lak beef is tender stir-fried beef in a French-influenced sauce. But my favorite might be the humble cha kreung, simple chicken stir-fried with a seasoning paste pounded so fresh you can pick out the individual flavors of lemongrass, ginger, galangal, lime leaf, turmeric, shallot, garlic, chiles... every single component.\n\nDetails: 1312 E.

Alejandro Bonilla’s family is indigenous to the region, and he shares them from a modest, cozy storefront joint in west Mesa. Restaurant Huauchinangos slings some of the usual fare you’ll find at any local Mexican restaurant, but what makes Huauchinangos distinctive is dishes like the molotes, 3-inch masa torpedoes stuffed with potato and chorizo, fried to a golden crisp and drenched with tomatillo salsa. The quesadillas are folded over fillings like chicken tinga or mushrooms and cheese, then fried to a delicate crisp, tender to the touch and molten at their core. Bonilla’s “huauchitlacoyos” — a portmanteau of Huauchinango and tlacoyos — are piled with cactus and smoky salsa mora and excellent paired with salty, seared cesina. And chicken is usually a winner, whether it’s Bonilla’s family recipe for mole, a swirling mix of spices, chiles and nuts; or served con cacahuate — smothered with a sauce made of crispy chopped peanuts with the intense, fruity sting of dried chiltepin chiles.\n\nDetails: 1620 E.

Thankfully, at Roka Akor, that’s not a bad thing. This swanky joint with a Scottsdale nightlife vibe is in a part of town where it could have easily coasted on image alone. But there is compelling work being done here with ultra-superior ingredients, including some of the city’s best nigiri sushi, a compact list made with slabs of premium fish, delicate rice and real wasabi. Creative sashimi are also strong, like butterfish tataki wrapped around crisp white asparagus with a touch of herb and yuzu. The miso-marinated black cod is a refined take on the izakaya staple. And I’m more than a little enamored of their slabs of tender sweet potato with a hefty dose of binchotan-induced char and a ginger-laced glaze. But you most likely came for the steaks, and they’re excellent, whether a charred rib eye with a soy vinaigrette, juicy skirt steaks with an herbal shiso chimichurri or imported Japanese beef that inhabits “if you have to ask” territory. Heck, even the beef and kimchi gyoza are sharp, a compelling take on a dish that’s usually a throwaway, even when it isn’t frozen.\n\nDetails: 7299 N. Scottsdale Road, Scottsdale.

In a charming, refurbished space built from the bones of a historic Chinese market, Bianco has teamed with Nadia Holguin and Armando Hernandez of Tacos Chiwas to open what could be best described as an Italian-influenced Chihuahuan diner. In practice, that means flaky cabeza empanadas with an earthy garbanzo bean dip; cheesy entomatadas bathed in the essence of summer tomatoes; chile colorado with the desert’s smoky, fiery sting; and “quesadillas” that look like pizzas, taste like Mexico and resemble precisely no other quesadilla you’ve ever tasted. Best part? Killer ingredients at Denny’s prices. Holguin is the backbone here, and with the sourcing and support provided by Bianco and Hernandez, this is the kind of simple, bold new Arizona cuisine that’s getting Mexican chefs out of the depths of the kitchen and into the spotlight, where they belong.\n\nDetails: 1505 E.

The menu’s structure is four-course prix fixe that gets a top-to-bottom refresh almost monthly, a collection of refined dishes that change with the seasons and Levine’s whims. A bit of American brashness meets European sensibilities while drawing in flavors from around the world. Scallop ceviche enriched with uni panna cotta bathes in a smoky, dashi rich broth. A gorgeous grilled langoustine tops Thai-inspired sausage with the gentle sourness of fermented rice. Risotto prepared with phytoplankton is a deep-green chlorophyll bomb.

The visits amounted to a duel in optics, if not specifics.\n\nBiden called on Trump to join him in asking Congress to pass wide-ranging border security legislation negotiated by a team of Democratic and Republican senators, which the House GOP rejected at Trump’s urging.\n\n“Instead of playing politics with the issue, why don’t we just get together and get it done?” Biden said from Brownsville, in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley.\n\nTrump, speaking roughly the same time 325 miles away in Eagle Pass, showed no interest in working with Biden, or the Democrats for that matter. He hurled insults at his successor, charging that Biden is solely responsible for the immigration crisis and unable to deal with it effectively.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n\"This is a Joe Biden invasion,\" Trump said from Shelby Park, which sits on the Rio Grande and has become the epicenter of the national immigration debate. \"This is a Biden invasion over the past three years. ... He's a terrible president, worst president our country's ever had probably, the most incompetent president we've ever had.\"\n\nThe competing stops by Biden and Trump come just eight months before the November election and as polls show Americans are deeply concerned about the situation along the border.\n\nA Gallup Poll released this week showed that, for the first time since the last decade, Americans now believe immigration to be the most important issue facing the United States. A separate survey earlier in February by the Pew Research Center survey showed 80% of Americans believe the government is doing a bad job dealing with the large number of migrants at the border.\n\nYet another poll in February by the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas showed that a majority of Texans want to see more border enforcement and support Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's border security initiatives, such as building border barriers and installing razor wire along the Rio Grande.\n\n'We can't afford not to do this'\n\nIn Brownsville, Biden's motorcade drove a road alongside a 20-foot-high border fence, just inside the U.S.-Mexico border. The entourage drove through a gate in the fence and down a bumpy dirt road, along which parked cars were flying Trump flags.\n\nBiden walked along a section of the border and later met with federal immigration agents, who gave him a lengthy briefing on efforts to deter illegal crossings. Brownsville was once the nation’s busiest corridor for illegal crossings, but in recent months has seen a sharp drop in the number of people entering illegally into the United States.\n\nIn his remarks at the Brownsville Border Patrol Station, Biden said officials desperately need more resources to secure the border. The legislation killed by House Republicans included funding to hire additional border patrol agents and buy additional security inspection technology and equipment.\n\n\"We can't afford not to do this,\" Biden said.\n\nBefore Biden's arrival, several hundred mostly Biden supporters lined up on Boca Chica Boulevard outside the city’s airport, waving blue Biden flags and chanting “Four more years!” More residents parked along the boulevard, stretching for about half a mile, waving U.S. flags and hoping to catch a glimpse of the president.\n\nElia Zamora-Hernandez, 71, drove 30 miles from Harlingen to show her support. Donning a Biden cap and waving a Biden flag, she said Republicans are not cooperating enough with Biden to allow him to do his job.\n\n“The border has been a problem for years, years, years,” Zamora-Hernandez said. “This is not something he created.”\n\nFarther down the boulevard, groups organized by La Union del Pueblo Entero, a migrants' and workers’ rights group, chanted, “Biden, escucha – ¡estamos en la lucha!” (Biden, listen – we’re struggling!) and “¡Si se puede!” (Yes we can!)\n\nVictor Cavazos, a director at The Sidewalk School, a nonprofit that helps asylum-seekers in Reynosa, Mexico, said he was baffled that Biden chose not to meet with leaders of nongovernmental organizations while in Texas.\n\n“He’s missing a big piece of the puzzle,” he said. “We know what the needs are on the ground.”\n\nUnease in Eagle Pass:As border battle brews between Texas and U.S., tiny Eagle Pass braces for its next conflict\n\nTrump travels to Eagle Pass\n\nIn Eagle Pass, Trump was joined by Abbott and Texas National Guard soldiers, who showed off the razor wire they erected along a 29-mile stretch of border upon Abbott’s orders – and in defiance of a U.S. Supreme Court order.\n\nSpeaking without notes, Trump veered from praising himself to criticizing immigration policies in Democratic-controlled California to lauding Abbott for taking a hardline approach to the border. He reprised his 2016 campaign theme that \"murderers\" and \"rapists\" were coming into the United States from Mexico.\n\n\"These are the people that are coming into our country and they're coming from jails and they're coming from prisons and they're coming from mental institutions and they're coming from insane asylums,\" Trump said. \"And they're terrorists and being let into our country.\"\n\nTrump also made reference to Laken Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student who was found murdered in a wooded area at the University of Georgia in Athens last week. The man charged with the killing of the student was a migrant from Venezuela who entered the U.S. illegally.\n\nBefore Trump's arrival, city police cordoned off the streets leading down to Shelby Park. On Main Street, the four corners of the intersection with Commercial Street were filled with a mix of Trump and Biden supporters amid a collection of stores such as Claudia’s Perfuma Fina and the Cowboy Corral, which sells western wear.\n\n“We’ve seen two surges under two administrations, and it was better under Trump,” said Freddy Arellano, a junior at nearby Sul Ross University, who sported a Make America Great Again ball cap. “Under Biden it’s unbearable.”\n\nAt the opposite corner, Steve Fischer, who is the chief public defender for the region, called Trump’s visit and Abbott’s policies at the border “a big joke” and \"political theatrics.”\n\nJose Hernandez, who served in the Army and wore a Vietnam veterans cap, was in the middle – figuratively and literally.\n\n“I’m 50-50 on Biden and Trump,” he said. “Whoever can fix it.”\n\nHernandez said he voted for Biden in 2020, but the president has not yet earned his support for a second term.\n\nDomingo Garcia, president of the League of United Latin American Citizens, welcomed Biden’s and Trump’s visits.\n\n“They’re a little late,’’ Garcia said. “But at least they’re finally paying attention t a humanitarian crisis that has been festering for years.’’\n\nGarcia said immigration and border issues are going to be key campaign issues in November, and Latino voters will be an important voting bloc.\n\n“I think that shows that they both know how important immigration is as an issue and that the road to the White House goes through the Latino communities,’’ he said.\n\nTragedy at the border:Mexican family's death at border looms over ongoing Justice Department standoff with Texas\n\nWill Trump, Biden's visits to the border shift the conversation?\n\nNo one in the White House, in Congress or on the campaign trail has figured out how to address the pace and swell of modern migration, as people arrive at the U.S. border in record numbers.\n\nBiden has called on Mexico and its regional partners to stem the flow of migrants north. Biden has created new legal pathways to encourage migrants not to cross the border unlawfully. And he’s funneled resources to struggling nations to address the root causes of why people leave.\n\nTrump has proposed more barriers at the border, from razor wire to fences, and mass deportations. Republicans in Congress have proposed sharply restricting access to the U.S. asylum system.\n\nBut the flows northward continue at a pace that has been mind-rattling for many Americans. A once-impenetrable jungle connecting North and South America has become a human highway. The Darien Gap between Colombia and Panama is now being trod through by half a million people annually – nearly all of them headed for the U.S. border.\n\n“Nobody has figured out how to deal with this in a short-term way with the existing tools they have,” said Adam Isacson, director for defense oversight at the Washington Office on Latin America. “The most they’ve been able to do is to come up with a small tweak to policies that can push the numbers down for a few months – and then the numbers recover.”\n\nThe push-and-pull factors of immigration have proved more powerful than the limited opportunities for legal pathways at the U.S. border and the deterrents of 30-foot fences and razor wire.\n\nThere are more than 9 million job openings in the United States, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics – a magnet for workers. Meanwhile, countries throughout the hemisphere are still suffering the economic fallout of the pandemic.\n\n“You have the United States in a moment of relative domestic stability with more job openings than workers,” Isacson said. “Throughout the region, you have economies that haven’t crawled out of the crater COVID left. You have repressive governments, climate change and gangs running rampant. You also have a broken U.S. asylum system where you can claim fear and be here for four or five years.”\n\nThe number of migrants arriving at the U.S. border dipped in the first year of the Trump administration before climbing again in 2018 and more than doubling in 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic, when travel was restricted across the western hemisphere, depressed migration in 2020 and apprehensions at the U.S. border plummeted.\n\nBut as the pandemic waned and regional economies remained in distress, people began heading to the U.S. border in record numbers.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection reported 1.7 million migrant encounters at the Southwest border in fiscal 2021, 2.4 million in fiscal 2022 and an additional 2.5 million in fiscal 2023.\n\nThe images of tens of thousands of families crossing the Rio Grande in Texas, or waiting to be received by Border Patrol at the border fence in Arizona or California, have captivated American voters and stoked real worries about the federal government’s ability to quickly vet so many people and the ability of American cities to welcome them.\n\nAbbott has bused more than 100,000 migrants from the Texas border to cities including New York, Chicago and Denver – effectively exporting humanitarian crises to American backyards.\n\nEven before Biden and Trump arrived, a border battle was being waged in a federal court in Texas.\n\nU.S. District Judge David Alan Ezra on Thursday preliminarily prevented Texas from enforcing a law that would make it a state crime to cross the Texas-Mexico border. In his order granting an injunction, Ezra said “states may not exercise immigration enforcement power except as authorized by the federal government.”\n\nTexas’ Senate Bill 4, previously scheduled to take effect March 5, would have allowed state law enforcement officers to arrest, detain and deport individuals suspected of illegally crossing the Texas-Mexico border.\n\n“Surges in immigration do not constitute an ‘invasion’ within the meaning of the Constitution, nor is Texas engaging in war by enforcing SB4,” Ezra said in the order.\n\n“To allow Texas to permanently supersede federal directives on the basis of an invasion would amount to nullification of federal law and authority – a notion that is antithetical to the Constitution and has been unequivocally rejected by federal courts since the Civil War,” he said.\n\nContributing: Deborah Berry, Swapna Venugopal and The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2023/09/26/trump-biden-michigan-visit-uaw-strike-compete-union-support/70962960007/", "title": "Copycat Joe? Trump plans visit with Michigan UAW workers, Biden ...", "text": "President Joe Biden must be embarrassed he didn’t think of this first.\n\nThe self-declared most pro-union president in history got beat in planning a visit with striking UAW workers in Michigan.\n\nAnd Biden didn’t get beat by a fellow Democrat – rather, by former Republican President Donald Trump.\n\nDays before Biden announced he’d “stand in solidarity” on the picket line with union workers (likely a first for a sitting president), Trump had already said he was coming to talk to some of the same union members.\n\nBiden tried to make it look like he came up with the idea first, with plans to sweep into Michigan Tuesday in a hastily planned trip – one day ahead of Trump’s scheduled appearance Wednesday.\n\nTough choice for Biden:With UAW strike looming, Biden must choose between his union allies and US economy\n\nTrump summed up the situation like this on Truth Social: “Crooked Joe Biden had no intention of going to visit the United Autoworkers, until I announced that I would be heading to Michigan to be with them. ... If the UAW ‘leadership’ doesn’t ENDORSE me, and if I don’t win the Election, the Autoworkers are ‘toast,’ with our great truckers to follow.”\n\nAs of yet, the UAW has withheld its endorsement of Biden in his bid for reelection. Union leaders are going to make the president grovel for their support.\n\nUAW President Shawn Fain did extend an invite to Biden last week to join workers on the picket line, despite recent criticism of the president's lackluster support. And Fain has no love for Trump.\n\nMichigan is a key 2024 battleground\n\nSomewhat laughably, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre claimed Monday that Biden’s decision to come to Michigan wasn’t spurred by Trump’s visit.\n\n“This decision to visit the picket line was based on his own desire,” she said at a news briefing. “This is what the president wanted – to stand with autoworkers. That’s what you’re going to see the president do tomorrow.”\n\nThe strike began Sept. 15, so Biden could have planned this much earlier.\n\nRegardless, the jockeying going on here is about more than just the autoworkers’ strike.\n\nIt’s about the 2024 election. Trump is by far the leading GOP contender, and he knows how important winning Michigan would be come November next year. He scheduled his prime-time speech Wednesday specifically to compete with the second scheduled Republican presidential primary debate. In Trump’s mind, he’s already the anointed one.\n\nNikki Haley already beat Biden in polls.Now she needs to win the next Republican debate.\n\nMichigan is a big reason that Trump won the election in 2016, and he earned support in the state by appealing to working-class voters with his “America first” message about keeping jobs in the United States. He even got a fairly large share of the union vote.\n\nIn 2020, that union support swung back to Biden. Yet Biden’s extreme unpopularity and mishandling of the economy changes the outlook for 2024.\n\nMore bad news for Biden\n\nThe Detroit-area visits this week from Biden and Trump come amid more troublesome polls for the president.\n\nA new Washington Post/ABC News survey shows Trump with a nearly 10-point lead over Biden (51% to 42%).\n\nShutdown looms:Government shutdown talks return as US debt reaches $33 trillion. When will Congress care?\n\nAnd then the latest NBC News poll shows Republicans hold a 21-point advantage over Democrats on their handling of the economy (49% to 28%) – the strongest lead the poll has shown in decades.\n\nIn trying to maintain his union ties, Biden may end up regretting hanging out on the picket line. If the strike goes on for a long time – and it looks like union leadership is prepared to do this – then it could have very negative ripple effects on the economy.\n\nVoters are already feeling the pain of high inflation. And as the polls indicate, Biden will be blamed for any other hits to the economy.\n\nTrump’s message to union members is likely to revolve around what he would do to protect their jobs – something they are very concerned about in the Biden administration’s climate-driven push for electric vehicles. EVs don’t require as many workers, and Trump will boast his support for the gas-powered engine and less governmental interference in the industry.\n\nThe fact Trump trumped union-backer Biden on this visit to Michigan highlights the challenges ahead for the president. Trump, for all his faults, has good instincts, and Biden is going to struggle mightily to keep up.\n\nIngrid Jacques is a columnist at USA TODAY.

This has never happened before,\" said Erik Loomis, a labor historian at the University of Rhode Island. \"For all of the history between the Democrats and unions, FDR certainly wasn't going to show up on a picket line. Harry Truman wasn't going to. JFK wasn't going to.\"\n\nOn Wednesday night, Trump - the former president and frontrunner to win the 2024 Republican nomination - will hold a rally with current and former union members in Clinton Township, Mich. He will try to speak past UAW's leadership, led by president Shawn Fain, who has warned his members about Trump and his \"billionaire class.\"\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nUnlike Biden, Trump won't be walking a picket line. He's instead warned of a new enemy of the working class - electric vehicles, embraced by the Biden administration and a source of consternation among auto workers. Trump argues electric vehicles will be built primarily in China and decimate the U.S. auto industry.\n\n\"His approach is to appeal directly to working-class people who feel vulnerable to new technologies and who are vulnerable in the modern economy,\" said Ken Kollman, political science professor at the University of Michigan. \"He plays on their fears. The idea is I can speak directly to these people and not through their union representatives.\"\n\nThe voters who could decide Michigan and other Midwest states\n\nWorking-class voters who lack college degrees could decide whether Biden again wins Michigan and its 16 electoral votes in 2024 or whether Trump, if he's the Republican nominee, moves it back to the Republican column.\n\nTrump broke Democrats' Midwest blue wall in 2016, winning Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, by deepening Republican support with white, non-college educated voters and making inroads with a key Democratic constituency: union voters.\n\nRep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., saw it coming, warning her fellow Democrats weeks before the 2016 election that Trump's anti-trade message was resonating with auto workers and could cost Hillary Clinton her state.\n\n\"I said it because I was in those union halls,\" said Dingell, whose district is blocks away from a Ford plant where the United Auto Workers have been on strike since Sept. 15. \"We will not make that mistake again.\"\n\nIn 2020, Biden reclaimed Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania for Democrats in part by improving on Clinton's performance with union voters. Biden received votes from about six in 10 union members, according to the Associated Press' Vote Cast, a sizeable difference but not an overwhelming margin despite Biden having the endorsements of UAW and other labor unions in the 2020 election.\n\nTrump's efforts to win Michigan back would be boosted if he can again chip into Democrats' historic advantage with union voters.\n\n\"There's a potential opening because the education divide has made union households more open to competition from Republicans than it had been historically,\" said Matt Grossman, director of the Institute for Public Policy and Social Research at Michigan State University.\n\nBut Grossman said Trump's appeal to union workers in 2024 is problematic because his rhetoric doesn't match the policy agenda of unions at a time when organized labor is enjoying its most popularity in decades. Sixty-seven percent of Americans approve of unions, a Gallup poll found in August, up from 56% in 2016.\n\n\"Trump is perfectly willing to say, 'Biden screwed over the UAW.' But he doesn't seem like he's saying the other part, which is 'I'm going to be fully supportive,'\" Grossman said.\n\nWhy Biden decided to make history by joining picket line\n\nBiden's picket-line appearance is not without risk. He has decades of close ties with organized labor and said he wants to be known as the \"most pro-union president\" in U.S history. Yet Biden also wants to avoid national economic repercussions that could result from a prolonged strike due to lost wages for UAW workers and auto suppliers and the auto industry's financial losses.\n\nAfter announcing plans to ratchet up the strike to 38 additional sites across 20 states, Fain publicly invited Biden to join workers on the picket line.\n\nFain's invitation added to mounting pressure for Biden to visit UAW strikers after Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries and progressive independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont each made trips to striking sites.\n\n\"What we need to do is to clearly be the working-class party,\" said Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., who had urged the president to make the trip.\n\nBiden committed last Friday after Trump already announced his visit days before.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Trump's visit did not influence Biden's decision to join the picket line. \"Absolutely not,\" she said Monday, adding that Biden wants to \"stand with auto workers.\"\n\nAt the request of UAW leadership, Biden has stayed out of negotiations between the union auto companies yet made clear he's on the side of UAW workers, arguing they deserve a \"fair share\" from \"record corporate profits\" of the automakers.\n\nUAW wants 40% pay raises for auto workers, a four-day work week, the elimination of a multi-tiered wage system and the restoration of a pension plan. Even though Biden will join UAW workers in Michigan, Jean-Pierre would not say whether he wants the auto companies to agree to the union's preferred terms.\n\n\"He believes that corporate profits should lead to a record UAW contract,\" she said. \"They're going to negotiate what that looks like for them.\"\n\nMore:UAW files complaint against Sen. Tim Scott alleging that he violated federal labor law\n\nTrump's war on electric vehicles\n\nFain said the union has made \"some real progress\" with Ford Motor Co. - including eliminating a wage tier and reinstating cost-of-living pay increases - but General Motors and Stellantis \"need some pushing.\"\n\nLargely ignoring the union's demands, Trump has seized on anxieties about the proliferation of electric vehicles, which Biden has supported through incentives as part of his climate agenda. Trump has warned electric vehicles, which generally require fewer workers to build than traditional cars, has put their careers at risk.\n\n\"All those cars are going to be made in China. Every one of them. You can forget it, Michigan,\" Trump said last month. \"You can't listen to these union guys who get paid a lot of money and they get wined and dined in Washington. They know that electric cars are no good in terms of our workers.\"\n\nBiden has made clear that he wants \"good-pay union jobs\" at electric-vehicle plants of the future as he pushes a goal to make zero-emissions vehicles account for half of all automobiles sold in the U.S. by 2030\n\nFain has said repeatedly the UAW supports Biden's push for electric vehicles. But the union was furious after the Department of Energy in June awarded a $9.2 billion grant to Ford and a South Korean battery maker that lacked assurances UAW sought for workers.\n\nUAW is holding off on 2024 presidential endorsements after backing Biden in 2020. Fain told CBS' Face the Nation that the union's endorsement must be \"earned\" and that, \"We expect action, not words.\"\n\nStill,UAW applauded $15.5 billion in federal grants and loans announced in August to help retrofit and retool existing automotive facilities so they can build electric vehicles and batteries.The Biden administration is prioritizing projectsthat retain collective-bargaining agreements with auto workers.\n\nThe Biden campaign and Democratic allies say they're confident Trump's trip won't have the impact the former president wants because of Trump's \"anti-worker\" record in the White House - including passing tax cuts for corporations and high-income earners in 2017.\n\nThey also point to Trump's past criticism of the financial bailout under President Barack Obama that saved the auto industry during the Great Recession.\n\nMarick Masters, a business professor at Wayne State University and director of the school's Labor@Wayne program, said Trump's crusade against electric vehicles is intended to go \"over the heads of the union leadership directly to the rank and file where he does have a base of support.\"\n\nBut he questioned whether Trump's message - that electric vehicles pose an \"existential threat\" to the auto industry - will bring back enough voters he lost in 2020 to replicate Trump's 2016 election formula.\n\n\"Unless this strike were to backfire on the UAW and really have a negative impact,\" Masters added. \"Then I think the blame is going to be put on parties that contributed to what they consider to be the demise of the industry.\"\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X, formerly known as Twitter, @joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/03/01/the-excerpt-podcast-biden-trump-dueling-visits-center-border-fight/72802904007/", "title": "The Excerpt podcast: Biden, Trump dueling visits center border fight", "text": "On Friday's episode of The Excerpt podcast: President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump made competing visits to the border Thursday.

I'm Taylor Wilson, and today is Friday, March 1st, 2024. This is The Excerpt. Today, a look at Biden and Trump's separate trips to the border. Plus there's a grim death toll in Gaza and what new voting laws might mean in North Carolina. President Joe Biden and Former President Donald Trump made separate clashing visits at the US Mexico border yesterday. Biden called on Trump to join him and asking Congress to pass wide-ranging border security legislation negotiated by a team of Democratic and Republican senators, which the house GOP rejected at Trump's urging. I understand my predecessor's in Eagle Pass today. So here's what I would say to Mr. Trump. Instead of playing politics issue, instead of telling members of Congress to block this legislation, join me or I'll join you in telling the Congress to pass this bipartisan border security bill. We can do it together. Those comments were made in Brownsville, Texas, across the border from Matamoros, Mexico. Trump speaking at around the same time, 325 miles away in Eagle Pass, Texas, pointed to what he called a historically secure border under his administration. Three years ago, we had the most secure border in history. Brandon was saying it, the general was saying it. We had the most secure border and people weren't coming because they knew they weren't going to get in. Trump also hurled insults at Biden and said he's responsible for an immigration crisis and unable to deal with it effectively. The competing stops come around eight months before Biden and Trump are expected to square off in the November election. And a Gallup poll released this week showed that for the first time since the last decade, Americans now believe immigration to be the most important issue facing the US.More than 100 Palestinians were killed and another 700 injured when Israeli troops opened fire on people waiting for food in Gaza City. That pushes the Palestinian death toll above 30,000 since the war began according to the Gaza Health Ministry yesterday. Israeli authorities released aerial footage of crowds, swarming, arriving aid trucks, and put blame on the crush of the crowd and Palestinian truck drivers. The incident comes as the UN says, a quarter of Gaza's 2.3 million people could face starvation and that 80% of the territory has been forced to flee their homes. Israel's assault on Gaza was prompted by an October Hamas led attack on Israeli border communities that killed some 1200 people while hundreds more were taken hostage. Taylor Wilson:Joe Biden:Taylor Wilson:Donald Trump:Taylor Wilson:\n\nThe Massachusetts Air National Guard member charged with sharing hundreds of classified documents on social media is expected to plead guilty on Monday. Jack Teixeira has been charged with six counts of willful retention of defense records for allegedly sharing classified documents through the social media platform, Discord. The leak's exposed embarrassing secrets and analysis from across the US intelligence community involving Russia's war in Ukraine and North Korea's race to develop nuclear weapons. Teixeira initially pleaded not guilty, but a filing yesterday in US district court from prosecutors in coordination with defense lawyers, asked for a Monday hearing for him to change his plea. The filing did not say which charges he would admit.

They both took walks along parts of the border in Texas. And they took turns blaming each other in an extraordinary clash over surging migration eight months before the 2024 presidential election.\n\nPerhaps most memorably, Biden challenged Trump to get behind border legislation the former president helped kill.\n\nHere are five takeaways from the visits:\n\nBiden to Republicans: 'Show a little spine'\n\nAs expected, Biden used his visit to Brownsville, Texas, to blame congressional Republicans for inaction on the border after they blocked legislation in the Senate that would have created some of the most aggressive border restrictions in a generation.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nRepublicans took their cues from Trump, who urged the defeat of the bill, denying Biden a major political win in an election year.\n\n\"Both houses supported this legislation until someone came along and said, 'Don't do that, it will benefit the incumbent,'\" Biden said, referring to Trump. \"That's a hell of a way to do business in America for such a serious problem.\"\n\nThe bill would establish a new “border emergency authority,” allowing the president to temporarily prohibit individuals from seeking asylum in the U.S. when daily border crossings exceed a daily average of 4,000 in any one-week period.\n\nAmong other provisions, the bill would also fund 100 new inspection machines to detect fentanyl at the border, 1,500 Border Patrol Agents and customs officers and 4.300 new asylum officers to speed up the review of asylum claims.\n\nBiden called on congressional Republicans to \"show a little spine\" and reconsider the legislation. \"Those senators who oppose it need to set politics aside and pass it on merit, not on whether it's going to benefit one party or benefit the other party,\" Biden said.\n\nA striking split screen\n\nThe visits made for a striking split screen for a likely election rematch between Biden and Trump, who visited Eagle Pass, Texas.\n\nWhile Biden talked about bipartisanship, Trump stuck to his hardline immigration pitch that helped fuel his entry into national politics. Trump has promised the mass deportation of undocumented immigrants if he returns to the White House\n\n\"This is a Joe Biden invasion,\" Trump said, flanked by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Brandon Judd, the president of the National Border Patrol Council union. \"It's allowing thousands of people to come in from China, Iran, Yemen to Congo, Syria, and a lot of other nations − many nations are not very friendly to us.\"\n\nTrump said the U.S. is being overrun by \"Biden migrant crime,\" pointing above all to the death of Laken Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student whose body was found on a wooded trail at the University of Georgia. Republicans seized on the tragedy after a 26-year-old migrant from Venezuela was charged with her kidnapping and death.\n\n\"Biden will never say Laken Riley's name,\" Trump said. \"But we will say it and we will remember.\"\n\nAbbott blamed Biden for record-setting border crossings while hailing four Trump-era immigration policies: the end of \"catch and release;\" Title 42; the remain-in-Mexico policy; and border-wall spending.\n\n\"All Joe Biden had to do to secure the border was to keep in place what President Trump put in place in the first place,\" Abbott said. \"But instead, what Joe Biden did, he signed executive orders eliminating all of the effective policies that President Trump put in place.\"\n\nBiden's dare to Trump\n\nBiden, speaking from inside a Border Patrol station, only once mentioned Trump by name in his prepared remarks. It came as he called on the former president to get behind the border bill.\n\n\"I understand my predecessor is in Eagle Pass today,\" Biden said. \"Here's what I would say to Mr. Trump. Instead of playing politics with the issue, instead of telling members of Congress to block this legislation, join me or I'll join you in telling the Congress to pass this bipartisan border security bill. We can do it together.\"\n\nBiden's visit marked his most public display yet of his new get-tough strategy on immigration.\n\nAhead of the presidential election, Biden has embraced stronger rhetoric on the border, seeking authority to \"shut down\" the border when it is overwhelmed and acknowledging the border is not secure.\n\nBy killing the border bill, Republicans gave Biden an opening to go from defense to offense against Trump on the border − an issue Republicans have historically used to attack Democrats.\n\n\"You know, and I know,\" Biden said, still referring to Trump, \"it's the toughest, most efficient, most effective border security bill this country's ever seen.\"\n\nNo executive action announced\n\nBiden did not announce any executive action as he continues to mull whether to address the border unilaterally.\n\n\"The fact of the matter is that the only enduring solution is legislation,\" Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told reporters during the trip. \"Actions taken outside of legislation are often met with litigation challenges in court.\"\n\nBiden has been exploring executive action under Section 212(f) of the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act to achieve similar restrictions as the legislation on asylum-seekers trying to enter the U.S. illegally. But Biden has not made a decision or even determined whether he has the legal authority to restrict asylum-seekers.\n\nEven before any executive action is taken, progressive Democrats are pushing back, underscoring the delicate line Biden must walk as he navigates the border crisis in an election year.\n\nThe House Congressional Hispanic Caucus has said its members oppose unilateral attempts by the White House to overhaul the asylum system.\n\nWhy Brownsville?\n\nBy choosing Brownsville for his border visit, Biden did not go to the busiest stretch of the border.\n\nThat would have been Tucson, Arizona, which had 250,611 apprehensions in the area between October 2023 and January.\n\nThe Rio Grand Valley, where Brownsville is situated, had 76,436 apprehensions over the same period, making it a less active crossing site than the Eagle Pass area as well.\n\n\"He's not even going to the right place,\" Judd told The Daily Mail ahead of the visit. \"He's going to Brownsville, Texas. The Rio Grande Valley has been very slow for the past, 11, 12 months.\"\n\nBiden met with Border Patrol agents and local officials during his visit and walked with them on a gravel road looking over the border.\n\nMayorkas said Brownsville provided Biden an important glimpse into the border situation, crediting \"enhanced efforts\" by the Mexican government for the decline in migrant crossings the city is experiencing. Mayorkas said it resulted from conversations Biden and other administration officials had with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador in December.\n\nIn contrast, he said Tucson has seen an increase in border apprehensions because of patrolling difficulties in Sonora, a Mexican state directly south of Arizona.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/07/26/bidens-covid-test-trumps-return-dc-5-things-know-tuesday/10109143002/", "title": "Biden's COVID test, Trump's return to DC: 5 things to know Tuesday", "text": "Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nBiden may be able to exit isolation if he tests negative for COVID-19\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Monday that he's \"feeling better every day\" after testing positive for COVID-19 last week, and the White House planned a summit on Tuesday to discuss developing new vaccines that could more effectively guard against contagious variants. Biden noted \"everything's on the button\" with the medical tests he's been receiving each evening. Dr. Kevin O'Connor, physician to the president, said in a letter Monday that Biden's symptoms have \"almost completely resolved.\" At this point, Biden is only reporting some residual nasal congestion and minimal hoarseness, O'Connor said. Tuesday — Biden's fifth day of isolation in the White House — will be an important moment on his road to continued recovery. Dr. Ashish Jha, coordinator of the White House response to COVID-19, said Biden will be able to come out of isolation if he tests negative for the virus Tuesday using a rapid antigen test, while continuing to wear a well-fitting mask for the next several days.\n\nPrefer to listen?

Trump will address the organization's two-day America First Agenda Summit as some advisers urge him to spend more time talking about his vision for the future as he prepares to announce an expected 2024 White House campaign. Trump spokesman Taylor Budowich said the former president's remarks \"will highlight the policy failures of Democrats, while laying out an America First vision for public safety.\" Whether Trump sticks to policy remains to be seen. In rallies across the country, Trump has tended to spend most of his time attacking President Joe Biden, promoting his administration's record, and continuing to make unfounded claims of voter fraud in his 2020 loss to Biden.\n\nAlex Jones trial begins after judge ruled he defamed Sandy Hook parents\n\nOpening statements and the first witnesses are expected Tuesday for a trial that will determine how much money conspiracy theorist and Infowars host Alex Jones must pay to the family of a child killed in the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. In multiple Infowars segments beginning shortly after the shooting and continuing after the first lawsuits were filed by Sandy Hook parents, Jones called the school shooting a hoax and a false flag operation staged by the government as part of a wider \"gun grabbing\" strategy. Jones also accused the victims' parents of complicity in the staged attack, calling them liars or actors taking part in a fraud on the nation.\n\nHeat wave to persist in south-central U.S. and build in Northwest\n\nDaily record highs are expected to be broken Tuesday from Northern California to the metro areas of Seattle and Portland, Oregon. The temperatures in Portland could top 100 degrees, making it likely the hottest day of a week-long heat wave for the Pacific Northwest region that rarely sees such scorching weather. Forecasters issued an excessive heat warning for parts of Oregon and Washington state. Temperatures could hit the 90s in Seattle and 110 in eastern parts of Oregon and Washington. But the severity of the heat this week will not come close to the historic, deadly heat wave of June 2021, according to AccuWeather. As the Northwest heats up, the Northeast appears ready to cool down. From Maine to Washington, D.C., severe storms were lined up over the busy urban corridor Monday. As the front pushes southeastward into Tuesday, the Northeast will finally be able to enjoy calm, seasonable weather, AccuWeather said.\n\nStaying cool during hot weather:As heat wave impacts millions, here's how to stay safe\n\n$810 million jackpot is third largest in Mega Millions lottery history\n\nTuesday's Mega Millions drawing has climbed to a seriously lofty level, even in these inflationary times: $810 million, with a cash option of $470.1 million. That's the third-highest Mega Millions jackpot ever, according to the Mega Millions website. However, the Associated Press also notes that federal taxes will slice 37% off that cash prize as well.

Biden, he said, spent decades as a senator and vice president sending U.S. jobs overseas.\n\n\"If Biden wins, China wins,\" Trump said at Bemidji Regional Airport.\n\nA few hours earlier, Biden toured the Jerry Alander Carpenter Training Center in Hermantown, a suburb of Duluth, and called again for a $15 per hour minimum wage. He vowed to strengthen “buy American” requirements for federal contracting.\n\nBiden has proposed to spend $400 billion during his first term to buy American products. He proposed to spend $2 trillion on infrastructure, and to retrofit 4 million buildings and 2 million homes to make them more energy efficient, which he said would create millions of jobs.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nBiden said he would pay for his plan by repealing the Trump tax cut for individuals earning more than $400,000 per year and raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%. In contrast, Trump proposed to reduce the capital-gains tax rate on investments to 15%, which Biden said would be lower than the rate on working wages.\n\n“It’s time to reward hard work in America, not wealth,” Biden said.\n\nThe candidates' visits coincided with the first day of Minnesota's early voting period – either in person or absentee – for the Nov. 3 election. Trump is vying to win a state Democrats have carried reliably since 1972 and therefore isn't routinely mentioned among crucial swing states like neighboring Wisconsin, Michigan or Florida.\n\nTrump has won support across the northeast region of the state, despite the Iron Range being a traditional Democratic stronghold of unions for mining, steelworkers and shipping.\n\nPolls suggest a comfortable Biden lead in Minnesota, by an average of 8.8 percentage points through Sept. 18, according to tracking site FiveThirtyEight.com. While Trump won support in the Iron Range in 2016, the bulk of the state's population is more urban and favors Democrats. But the Trump campaign says its internal polling portrays a tighter race.\n\nAt his rally in Bemidji, Trump cast doubts on the polls showing him behind.\n\n\"I don't think so,\" he said. \"There's no way I'm 9 points down.\"\n\nIn a play for urban voters, the Trump campaign unveiled a local television ad Friday for Minnesota and Michigan that criticizes Biden for proposing to raise the number of refugees welcomed to the country from Syria, Somalia and Yemen. Minnesota had about 43,000 residents who were born in Somalia by 2018, according to census estimates, which occasionally sparks tensions in the Twin Cities.\n\nTrump warned supporters at his rally that Biden would flood Minnesota and the rest of the country with refugees from “some of the most dangerous places in the world, including Yemen, Syria and Somalia.”\n\n\"I'm your wall between the American dream and chaos,\" he said.\n\nAnother urban issue for the Twin Cities deals with racial-justice protests. Minnesota has been the epicenter of nationwide racial justice protests, after the death May 25 of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody. But political experts said the issue hasn't appeared to influence presidential politics in the state.\n\nCynthia Rugeley, an associate professor of political science at the University of Minnesota Duluth, said she sees no evidence that Floyd's death or the protests are shifting the presidential race in the state.\n\n\"I’m not sure it has changed any minds,\" she said. \"It does seem to have hardened people’s opinions on the issues.”\n\nTrump has called himself the law-and-order candidate, supporting police amid concerns about public safety. But Biden has accused Trump of stoking racial division rather than seeking to heal wounds from protests ranging from Portland, Oregon, to Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nDuring Trump's previous visits to Minnesota, the president promoted his tariffs on Chinese steel to bolster local mining, his renegotiation of the trade deal with Canada for dairy farmers and funding for the Soo Locks shipping channel that is critical to trade on the Great Lakes.\n\nWhen Vice President Mike Pence campaigned in Duluth on Aug. 28, six mayors from traditional Democratic strongholds endorsed the GOP ticket and said \"lifelong politicians like Joe Biden are out of touch with the working class.\" Three more Iron Range mayors endorsed the ticket Friday, saying the Obama administration when Biden was vice president was soft on China as mines shut down.\n\nBiden has focused on his support among steelworkers and other unions, with a proposal to spur domestic manufacturing through federal spending. He released a statement Wednesday supporting the Iron Range and promoting endorsements by unions including the United Steelworkers and AFL-CIO.\n\nHe said steel shipments were down 25% last year under Trump's administration, idling mining operations and putting thousands of people out of work, while China produced the largest monthly volume of crude steel on record in July.\n\nBiden acknowledged a chip on his shoulder at having the affluent look down him without an Ivy League degree. But he promoted the region’s union workers who built things with their hands rather than deriving income from investing in the stock market.\n\n“I believe this campaign is between Scranton and Park Avenue,” Biden said, repeated a theme from his town hall Thursday on CNN. “Like a lot of you, I spent a lot of my life with guys like Donald Trump looking down on me.”\n\nMinnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a former Democratic primary rival of Biden, said her grandfather was a miner whose job was made safer by miners. She said she is sick and tired hearing Trump say he is making the country safer while she has to visit her 92-year-old father in assisted living through glass because he’s suffering from COVID-19.\n\n“I don’t know if I’m ever going to see him again,” Klobuchar said. “That’s not safe.”\n\nBut she said Biden would work to curb the virus and revive the economy.\n\n“We need someone to have our back,” Klobuchar said.\n\nBiden lamented the job losses under the pandemic, as the American death total nears 200,000 and is projected to double by the end of the year.\n\n“I can’t think of any president who has ever acted, in my view, so selfishly for his own reelection instead of his sworn obligation to protect and defend the American people,” Biden said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/09/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/06/politics/trump-desantis-dueling-florida-rallies-2022-2024/index.html", "title": "With competing Florida rallies Sunday, Trump and DeSantis preview ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIn a preview of a potential Republican presidential primary showdown, Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis will hold dueling Florida rallies on Sunday as the two men battle for supremacy of the Sunshine State and the heart of the GOP.\n\nThe former president will welcome supporters in Miami, the third stop in a four-city tour that has effectively made Trump a leading player in his party’s fight for control of Congress. Meanwhile, the Florida governor is headlining his own events in three counties on the state’s opposite coast – Hillsborough, Sarasota and Lee – steering far clear of Trump as he seeks to close out his bid for a second term.\n\nFor the past two years, Trump and DeSantis have coexisted on opposite ends of Florida – Trump plotting his next move from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach and DeSantis building himself into a household name from the state capital in Tallahassee. But as these midterms come to a close and with a decision looming about their political futures, even on a peninsula 450 miles long, it has become increasingly difficult for the two to avoid each other.\n\n“We have two very stubborn, very type-A politicians in Florida that are at the tip of the spear for the GOP,” said one Republican official who asked not to be named. “They both command attention but they both have their own political operations and that’s what you’re seeing. It’s already exhausting to talk about.”\n\nThe long simmering rivalry has spilled into public view during the final weeks leading into Election Day. At a Pennsylvania rally on Saturday, Trump took a direct swipe at DeSantis, and christened a new nickname for the governor, while declaring himself the front-runner in a hypothetical GOP primary.\n\n“There it is, Trump at 71 (percent), Ron DeSanctimonious at 10 percent,” Trump told the crowd as he read alleged poll numbers off a screen.\n\nDeSantis recently endorsed Republican businessman and Colorado Senate candidate Joe O’Dea, as O’Dea vowed in October to “actively campaign” against Trump.\n\n“A BIG MISTAKE!” Trump wrote in response on his Truth Social platform.\n\nTrump followed up by sharing a clip of former Fox News host Megyn Kelly predicting GOP voters would remain firmly in Trump’s camp if DeSantis decided to challenge the former president in a Republican presidential primary. CNN reported Friday that Trump could launch his next presidential bid as soon as this month.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback What Trump told Haberman about potential rival for 2024 GOP nomination 02:51 - Source: CNN\n\nBut planning competing events inside Florida two days before a momentous Election Day is especially illustrative of how fraught the relationship between the former allies has become. Unlike other potential 2024 contenders, DeSantis has not declined to run against Trump in a primary, much to Trump’s ire. DeSantis, meanwhile, believes such a concession would undermine his attempts to keep the focus on his current reelection race instead of what may lie ahead, CNN previously reported. DeSantis and his campaign have declined to publicly discuss his plans for after the midterm, but in a recent debate, he wouldn’t respond when asked if he intends to serve a four-year term if reelected.\n\nIn the first of his three events on Sunday, DeSantis made no mention of Trump or the “Ron DeSanctimonious” nickname, choosing instead to criticize President Joe Biden and the so-called “woke” left.\n\nDeSantis described himself as a fighter who stood up against medical experts and criticism during the pandemic to reopen the state and ban coronavirus vaccine mandates, echoing a sentiment in a campaign ad in which DeSantis suggests he was created by God to fight for Florida.\n\nThe biggest cheers the Florida governor received, however, came when he recounted how he arranged for Florida to send nearly 50 migrants from Texas to Martha’s Vineyard, a stunt that has faced intense scrutiny and legal challenges.\n\nIf they do go head-to-head in a primary, the two candidates may find themselves on similar financial footing. DeSantis has raised $200 million this campaign cycle through his two political committees and has spent just over half, leaving about $90 million in potential seed money for a Super PAC. At the end of October, Trump was sitting on about $117 million between his three active fundraising vehicles, according to federal election data.\n\nTrump’s pre-election travel is motivated at least in part by his desire to launch a third campaign for the White House, CNN reported this week. Indeed, during a visit to Iowa on Thursday, Trump told voters in the first-in-the-nation caucus state to “get ready” for his return as a presidential candidate. Trump stopped in Pennsylvania on Saturday – home to the tight Senate race between his endorsee, Republican Mehmet Oz, and Democrat John Fetterman – and he’ll spend election eve in Ohio, where the former president endorsed Republican J.D. Vance in the Senate race against Democrat Tim Ryan.\n\nBut planning a Florida rally was also widely seen as a shot across the bow at DeSantis. Trump first announced last week his intent to hold a rally for US Sen. Marco Rubio in South Florida, leaving DeSantis noticeably out of his plans. Since then, the roster of guest speakers has grown to include the state’s junior senator, Rick Scott, as well as a dozen other elected officials and candidates from around the state.\n\nThe decision to hold the rally in Miami-Dade County comes as Republicans are optimistic they will carry the one-time Democratic stronghold for the first time in two decades. Investments by Republicans to make inroads in the area’s Hispanic neighborhoods have paid off in recent elections, and the party is seeing a wave of enthusiasm that is turning the state a deeper shade of red. Republicans will hold an advantage in voter registration on Election Day for the first time in Florida’s modern political history.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in support of the campaign of GOP Sen. Marco Rubio at the Miami-Dade County Fair and Exposition on Sunday, Nov. 6, 2022, in Miami. Rebecca Blackwell/AP\n\nAhead of his arrival, Trump was already taking credit for that turnaround.\n\n“President Trump delivered a historic red wave in Florida in the 2018 midterms with his slate of endorsed candidates up and down the ballot and molded the Sunshine State into the MAGA stronghold it is today,” the announcement from Trump’s Save America PAC said. “Thanks to President Trump, Florida is no longer a purple state; it’s an America First Red State.”\n\nWhile DeSantis embarked on his own out-of-state campaign circuit for Republican candidates, including a recent rally in New York for GOP gubernatorial nominee Lee Zeldin, he is spending the final days of the race against Democrat Charlie Crist barnstorming across Florida. His campaign had 13 scheduled events between Friday and Monday. On the final day, DeSantis has a stop planned in Trump’s adopted home county of Palm Beach and in Miami-Dade not far from Trump’s Sunday event.\n\nOn the campaign trail, DeSantis doesn’t talk about Trump, but his remarks are peppered with frequent mentions of President Joe Biden in a preview of what a presidential campaign against the incumbent Democrat might look like.\n\nAt an event Thursday in Central Florida, DeSantis called Biden “King Midas in reverse.”\n\n“Biden touches it and turns into something much worse than (gold),” DeSantis said. “It’s frustrating and a lot of people, the vast majority of Americans, they think that the country has seen its best days. They think that we’re clearly on the wrong track. But you know, I think Florida provides the blueprint that other states can follow.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information Sunday.", "authors": ["Steve Contorno"], "publish_date": "2022/11/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/08/02/trump-in-dc-federal-court-arraignment-historic/70504085007/", "title": "Trump in D.C. federal court: Why this trip is like no other", "text": "WASHINGTON – Donald Trump never thought he would return to Washington like this.\n\nUnder indictment.\n\nThe former president and Republican presidential front-runner lands back in the nation's capital on Thursday – not to go the White House, but to the federal courthouse a dozen blocks away to plead not guilty to charges of conspiracy to steal the 2020 election from President Joe Biden.\n\nA universe of demonstrators, reporters, camera people and a global television audience await Trump's trip to the courthouse that is within a three-block view of the white-domed U.S. Capitol – the building attacked by Trump supporters on Jan. 6, 2021, the trigger for the election-blocking allegations pending against him.\n\n\"Why didn’t they bring this ridiculous case 2.5 years ago?\" Trump said on his Truth Social website. \"They wanted it right in the middle of my campaign, that’s why!\"\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nA different political planet\n\nThe not guilty plea is expected. What people don't know is how this latest arraignment – Trump's third in four months – will affect his 2024 presidential campaign and his attempts to stay out of prison.\n\nSo far, at least, legal problems have helped Trump capture a commanding position in the 2024 Republican presidential race, according to polls that also show a tight prospective general election race with Biden.\n\nGOP primary opponents try to figure out how to deal with an unprecedented election issue, given the number of Republican voters who believe Trump's claims that Biden Democrats are trying to persecute him.\n\nIt's as if the 2024 presidential election will be fought on a different political planet.\n\n\"As unprecedented as Venus' temperature falling to 70 degrees Fahrenheit?\" joked Republican political consultant Liz Mair. \"As unprecedented as Jupiter suddenly developing a rocky surface?\"\n\nThere's more unprecedented to come, maybe for years.\n\nDonald Trump in prison? Not for a while (if ever)\n\nIf prosecutors have their way, Trump will be on trial in three and perhaps four venues next year – while he is seeking to be the first former president to reclaim the White House in more than 130 years, something that Grover Cleveland did back in 1892.\n\nTrump's enemies, and a few of his friends, are even speculating about the prospect of him campaigning from prison – though that seems highly unlikely.\n\nIf Trump is convicted in any of these cases against him, he would likely appeal all the way to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe process could take years.\n\n\"He will absolutely seek a stay of incarceration pending appeal,\" said national security attorney Bradley P. Moss. \"And the government, aware of the political considerations, no doubt will agree to it for that limited purpose.\"\n\nAnd if Trump fails to regain the White House? \"The $64,000 question is what type of arrangement the government will have to set up to incarcerate a former president who, by law, is entitled to Secret Service protection,\" Moss said.\n\nBracing for Trump at the courthouse\n\nA day before Trump's arraignment, the proverbial calm before the political storm reigned outside the E. Barrett Prettyman Courthouse in the heart of Washington, D.C.\n\nWhile television production trucks lined the street at the junction of Pennsylvania Avenue and Constitution Avenue and pointed cameras at the front of the courthouse, the only noise included the usual horn-honking and sirens from district traffic, as well as the voices of television correspondents doing occasional stand-ups.\n\nAlso spotted: Security personnel.\n\nWary of trouble, several Federal Protective Service officers, the law enforcement agency of the Homeland Security Department, patrolled outside the courthouse. Some led a bomb-sniffing police dog around the exterior of the building.\n\nFrom Watergate to Oliver North\n\nAs he is processed and taken to the courtroom for arraignment, Trump will be walking through history.\n\nOpened in 1952, the U.S. courthouse in the center of the federal government has seen more than its share of big cases, from the Watergate scandal that brought down President Richard Nixon to the Microsoft antitrust lawsuit. In 1996, then-first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton showed up to testify before a grand jury about missing Whitewater documents.\n\nMore recent defendants include Trump political adviser Roger Stone – whom he later pardoned – and hundreds of people charged with breaking into the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nTrump doesn't have to run this gauntlet, however; there is also an underground entrance for his motorcade.\n\nTrump the front-runner\n\nTrump enters his third plea while in a commanding position to again win the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nA day before the Jan. 6 indictment, a highly-publicized New York Times/Siena College poll gave Trump a lead of more than 35 percentage points over his nearest competitor, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nA crowded legal schedule\n\nAfter his arraignment, a judge and attorneys will try to map out a trial schedule for the Jan. 6 case – a big addition to Trump's already busy legal agenda.\n\nIn late March, a state grand jury in New York indicted him in connection with an alleged hush money scheme. A trial is scheduled for next March, in the middle of the Republican primary season.\n\nIn June, a federal grand jury in Florida charged the former president with obstruction of justice by trying to hide classified material in his possession. A trial in that case is scheduled for May, by which time the identity of the Republican presidential nominee will be known.\n\nMeanwhile, a state grand jury in Atlanta is considering indicting Trump and others for efforts to overturn Biden's win in Georgia.\n\nTrump is expected to seek delays of all these trials until after the next presidential election, which is Nov. 5, 2024.\n\nDeSantis and other Republican candidates\n\nWhile preparing for criminal trials, Trump will also presumably be campaigning for the presidency.\n\nDeSantis and other Republican challengers, mindful that Trump seemed to benefit politically from his first two indictments, have been loathe to criticize him over legal problems.\n\nWith this third case looming, there are signs that may be changing.\n\nPence calls out Trump\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence, a target of Trump's pressure campaign to overturn the election and a witness in the grand jury case, amped up his criticism after the Jan. 6 indictment.\n\nIt \"serves as an important reminder: anyone who puts himself over the Constitution should never be President of the United States,\" Pence said.\n\nFew people represent the unusual nature of this moment than Mike Pence: A former vice president running against the former president who put him on the ticket in 2016, a vice president who testified in a grand jury investigation of that president - and a vice president who could be a witness at trial.\n\nPence, like other candidates, also said that Trump's legal problems will distract from Republican efforts to make the election about Biden and his policies.\n\n\"Our country is more important than one man,\" Pence said. \"Our constitution is more important than any one man’s career.\"\n\nDeSantis and other candidates have criticized the prosecutors, not the defendants.\n\n\"I will end the weaponization of government,\" DeSantis said after the announcement was read.\n\nSen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., also bemoaned \"weaponization\" and, like other Republicans, contrasted the indictments of Trump with the investigation of presidential son Hunter Biden. He claimed \"two different tracks of justice, one for political opponents and another for the son of the current president.\"\n\nChristie: Trump 'disgraced' the office\n\nLong-shot candidates Chris Christie, Will Hurd, and Asa Hutchinson have said Trump's behavior is probably illegal and certainly disqualifying for the Republican nomination.\n\nChristie, in a post on the X platform, said White House actions after Election Day 2020 \"are a stain on our country’s history\" and the disgrace falls mainly on Trump. \"He swore an oath to the Constitution, violated his oath & brought shame to his presidency,\" Christie said.\n\nAfter the unsealing of this indictment, Hurd repeated a now-familiar mantra: \"Trump's presidential bid is driven by an attempt to stay out of prison and scam his supporters into footing his legal bills.\"\n\nA history of challenges\n\nIt didn't start with Trump: American democracy has always been contested.\n\nBack in 1807, former Vice President Aaron Burr – the man who shot and killed Alexander Hamilton in a duel – was tried for treason on charges that he tried to split off the western part of the United States and create a new country.\n\nBurr was acquitted.\n\nIn the 1860s, the nation convulsed into Civil War over slavery, secession, and so-called state's rights.\n\nThe most frequent Trump comparison is Watergate, efforts by Nixon and allies to cover up \"dirty tricks\" against political opponents that included the break-in of Democratic Party headquarters then located in the Watergate building.\n\nNixon was never tried in that case; successor Gerald Ford pardoned him beforehand.\n\nPolitical scientist Lara Brown, author of a book called “Amateur Hour: Presidential Character and the Question of Leadership,” said \"Trump (and his co-conspirators) engaged in acts far outside the constitutional order. They attacked and sought to alter the legitimate processes for casting, counting, and certifying the popular votes and the electoral votes for president in several states.\"\n\nWhatever a jury decides, she said, \"it is clear that these actions represent some of the most violent assaults on the Constitution and our democratic republic in American history.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/09/03/kenosha-biden-visits-jacob-blakes-family-and-other-takeaways/5702166002/", "title": "Kenosha: Biden visits Jacob Blake's family, and other takeaways", "text": "WASHINGTON – Seeking a contrast with President Donald Trump, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden traveled to Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Thursday to highlight a different dimension of the wave of violent protests that has upended the embattled city over a police shooting of a Black man.\n\nShortly after he and his wife, Jill Biden, arrived in Milwaukee, Biden spoke to Jacob Blake, a Black man who was left paralyzed after a white police officer shot him seven times on Aug. 23, and met with members of his family for 90 minutes.\n\n“He talked about how nothing was going to defeat him, how whether he walked again or not, he wasn’t going to give up,” Biden said of his conversation with Blake during a gathering of community members at a Kenosha church.\n\nThe former vice president struck a more optimistic tone as he sought to allay tensions over violent protests that erupted after police shot Blake, and led to the death of two protesters by a suspected vigilante shooter.\n\n“What I came away with was the overwhelming sense of resilience and optimism that they have about the kind of response they’re getting,\" he said of the Blake family.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nBlake's attorney, Ben Crump, said Biden and his wife's conversation focused on \"changing the disparate treatment of minorities in police interactions, the impact of selecting Kamala Harris as a Black woman as his running mate, and Vice President Biden's plans for change.\"\n\nBiden's visit came two days after the president traveled to Kenosha to promote his own message about the ongoing protests over racial justice and police brutality – a trip that did not include a visit with the Blake family.\n\nThe president said he wouldn't meet with the family because they requested their lawyers be involved, which Trump said was \"inappropriate.\"\n\nTrump has sought to blame Democrats for the civil unrest, painting Kenosha's protests as an example of the \"anti-police and \"anti-American riots\" that would continue if he isn't re-elected.\n\nWhile Biden focused much of his trip on the racial injustice that led to recent upheaval, Trump used his trip to praise members of the National Guard and local law enforcement for quelling the unrest.\n\nThe former vice president assailed Trump for failing to show leadership through a string of crises the country is facing and said he \"legitimized a dark side of human nature” in his response to the 2017 white nationalists rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, where one counterprotester was killed.\n\n“I made a mistake about something. I thought you could defeat hate. It only hides,” he said.\n\nHere are several other key moments from Biden and Trump's trips to Kenosha this week:\n\nMore:'I thought we could defeat hate': Joe Biden meets with Jacob Blake's family in Kenosha visit\n\nMore:Trump claims credit for bringing calm to Kenosha in visit criticized as politicizing unrest\n\nThe governor didn't want Trump or Biden there\n\nBiden's and Trump's visits weren't exactly embraced by local officials. While Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., accompanied Trump on his visit, Wisconsin Democratic Gov. Tony Evers stated he didn't want either the president or Biden visiting the area.\n\n\"Candidates can make their own decisions,\" Evers said in a call with reporters on Thursday. \"I would prefer that no one be here.\"\n\nEvers urged the president to cancel his trip while the city recovered from last week's wave of violence that left a Black man paralyzed after a police shooting, two protesters dead and a trail of destruction.\n\n“I am concerned your presence will only hinder our healing,” Evers wrote in a letter to the president on Sunday. “I am concerned your presence will only delay our work to overcome division and move forward together.”\n\nBut Evers, who has endorsed Biden, said he did not write a letter to the former vice president but made his position clear in a phone call.\n\nKenosha Mayor John Antaramian shared those concerns, telling reporters \"Kenosha needs peace and needs to heal and needs people to allow us to do that.\" The local head of the NAACP said no politicians should visit because tensions were running high.\n\nBut Biden said he spoke to city leaders and the governor’s staff in planning the visit, with a goal of bringing factions of the community together.\n\n“There’s been overwhelming requests that I do come,” Biden said Wednesday. “What we want to do is we’ve got to heal. We got to put things together, bring people together.”\n\nTrump poses in front of burned-out buildings and rubble\n\nUpon his arrival in Wisconsin, the president surveyed the damage caused by protests that sometimes escalated into destructive violence in the days following Blake's shooting, leaving burned-out buildings and smoldering ash in its wake.\n\nTrump has sought to use Kenosha and other cities experiencing ongoing protests, like Portland, Oregon, as examples of his campaign message that the country is under threat of being overtaken by radical left-wing mobs.\n\nWhile Biden has called for racial justice and healing, Trump has blamed Democrats for \"lawlessness\" and widespread demonstrations while labeling himself a law-and-order president.\n\n\"Reckless far-left politicians continue to push the destructive message that our nation and our law enforcement are oppressive or racist,\" he said. \"These are not acts of peaceful protest but really, domestic terror.\"\n\nThe president underscored this message by focusing on members of law enforcement and the National Guard during his visit who brought order back to the city. He highlighted businesses affected by the protests, including a burned-out furniture storefront that had been torched by protesters.\n\nHe said some of the city's businesses may have been spared if Evers welcomed federal assistance and called in the National Guard sooner. But it was Evers who activated the state's National Guard on Aug. 24, a day after Blake was shot. Three days later, the governor asked for help from Arizona, Michigan and Alabama.\n\nBut not all small businesses openly embraced the president. The co-owner of a century-old camera shop that was destroyed during protests told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel he \"politely declined\" to meet with the president. The owner told the newspaper he was surprised to see on TV that Trump instead met with the shop's former owner, who sold it to him in 2011 but still owns the property.\n\nMore:Destroyed Kenosha store's owners refused to be part of Trump 'circus,' president met with building owner instead\n\n\"We’re going to work with you. We’re going to help you,\" Trump told the former owner. \"We’ll help you rebuild. It’s a great area. It’s a great state. This should never happen. A thing like this should never happen. They have to call early.\"\n\nA picture of Trump standing before the rubble shared widely both by both his supporters and his opponents underscored their respective political messages. Republicans pointed to the picture as an example of Trump's leadership and a visual of his \"law-and-order\" presidency, while Democrats used the photo to illuminate the chaos that would continue in Trump's America if he's elected to a second term.\n\nThe picture – depending on the interpretation – symbolizes how both Biden and Trump are staking out two very different visions for how the country moves forward.\n\nBiden focuses on community needs amid campaign stop\n\nIn one of his few campaign events outside Delaware since the coronavirus pandemic, Biden in Kenosha met with more than a dozen community leaders, from activists to lawmakers to a store owner whose business was looted, to discuss Blake’s shooting and the protests and violence that followed.\n\nThroughout the event, which was held at Grace Lutheran Church and lasted more than one hour, Biden sat, listened and took notes.\n\nBiden heard from Tim Thompkins, Kenosha resident and former Marine, who discussed investing in programs to combat racial inequality. Jeff Weidner, former president of Kenosha Local International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF) 414, spoke about the support from the community and resources dropped off to fire departments following the riots. A contrast from the image shown by Trump's photo shoot with rubble caused by the riots.\n\nOne of the most impassioned moments came from Porsche Bennett, an organizer for Black Lives Activists Kenosha.

The uptick in campaigning also follows the Democratic National Convention and the Republican National Convention, where Biden and Trump accepted their respective party's nomination.\n\nWisconsin is a key battleground state, and Thursday was Biden's first visit to the state. Trump carried the state in 2016 over then Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nHowever, Biden is leading nationally in several recent polls, as well as in Wisconsin. According to a Fox News poll released Wednesday, Biden holds an 8 point lead over Trump – 50% to 42% – among likely Wisconsin voters.\n\nAlthough the pandemic still prevents both candidates from fully embracing campaign mode, they are ramping up their stops on the trail. Biden next week will visit Michigan, while Trump on Thursday is speaking in Pennsylvania. Both candidates will also visit Shanksville, Pennsylvania – site of the Flight 93 National Memorial – to the mark anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n\nMichigan and Pennsylvania are key battleground states that both candidates are eyeing in their path to victory and could determine the outcome on Nov. 3.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/09/03"}]}

The SUVs only recently went on sale in the United States and the warning and recall announced by Toyota Motor Sales USA on Thursday applies to all approximately 260 BZ4X SUVs that have been delivered to customers so far.\n\nBZ4X owners should stop driving the vehicles immediately, according to Toyota’s announcement.

Subaru has not announced a similar recall for the Solterra because none of those have been delivered to customers in the United States yet, Subaru spokesperson Jessica Tullman said in an email.\n\nThe BZ4X is Toyota’s first fully battery-powered electric vehicle that is not a modified version of a gasoline-powered model.

But Tesla owners did not have to rush their cars to the nearest dealership to fix the safety issues, which ranged from its “full self-driving” driver assist function rolling through stop signs, to some windshields not properly defrosting.\n\nInstead, Tesla pushed out an updated version of its software – much like how companies like Apple push out the most recent versions of their operating systems to an iPhone. It’s a growing trend in the auto industry. And it’s one that experts say has huge potential upsides but that is not without its own dangers.\n\nA single traditional recall could financially cripple any automaker. Automakers must pay for the parts and labor to make fixes. General Motors, for instance, spent $4.1 billion on recalls in 2015 for issues including faulty ignition switches.\n\nBut Tesla managed its recalls without many of the major expenses associated with traditional recalls. Tesla’s approach benefited consumers too, who typically must take their vehicle to be serviced.\n\nTesla has fixed its most recent safety recalls with over-the-air software updates, which refresh software wirelessly like a smartphone app update, making them less burdensome for the automaker and consumers. The traditional auto industry sees over-the-air updates as a convenient way to address some recalls, but Tesla has been the most aggressive in utilizing them.\n\nCars, especially electric vehicles, increasingly rely on computers to work so software updates are likely to be increasingly relevant to them.\n\n“Cars now are so much more software than hardware. That’s why a chip shortage freezes the industry,” Don Slavik, an attorney focused on motor vehicle product liability, told CNN Business.\n\nSoftware’s quick fixes\n\nIn recalls in which cars need to be taken in for service, many drivers never have their vehicle fixed, leaving unsafe cars and trucks on the roads.\n\nAbout 75% of recalls are remedied, according to Sean Kane, founder of the research organization Safety Research & Strategies.\n\n“The rates drop as cars age, so there’s upside to over-the-air software updates,” Kane said.\n\nIn contrast, many Tesla updates arrive overnight while cars are parked at their owners’ homes. There’s no hassle of taking a vehicle to be serviced and completion rates are high. Tesla reported last year that 100% of its vehicles with an unexpected emergency braking issue had been fixed within two months of notifying owners. An over-the-air software update was available to address the issue. For comparison, a recall due to seat belts not securely attaching to some Model S vehicles, which required owners to visit a Tesla service center, had only been remedied on 59% of vehicles six months later.\n\n“Increasing recall completion rates remains a priority for our members and we continue to explore new approaches for modernizing the process and improving safety and convenience for consumers,” John Bozzella, CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents major automakers outside of Tesla, told CNN Business.\n\nAutomakers Mercedes-Benz and General Motors have issued over-the-air updates in the past and both companies say they will increasingly consider using them in the future where applicable and feasible.\n\nMercedes-Benz last year addressed a recall through an over-the-air update to fix a flaw in its system that could prevent people from calling emergency services through some of its vehicles. Mercedes-Benz spokeswoman Anne McGregor said that the company is encouraged by the potential of the technology.\n\nSome Mercedes models can now receive over-the-air updates. Scott Legato/WireImage/Getty Images\n\nGeneral Motors issued an over-the-air software update in 2020 to limit speeds of the Chevrolet Corvette when the hood isn’t completely closed to prevent it from flipping open and increasing the risk of a crash. It was received by 94% of vehicles 16 months after the recall was initiated.\n\nNext year it’s rolling out a new software platform in its vehicles. GM spokesman Chris Bonelli there will be even more features and frequent updates.\n\nWhen ‘over-the-air’ falls short\n\nBut while the ease of implementing over-the-air recalls makes them attractive, there are drawbacks, too.\n\nThe ease of correcting a car’s software may encourage automakers to ship features that are rough around the edges and may not have received adequate testing, experts say.\n\nLast October Tesla recalled its “full self-driving” software because the automatic emergency braking function was activating unexpectedly, which could increase the risk of rear-end collision. It again recalled its “full self-driving” software in February, as it was programmed to slowly roll through stop signs in some cases.\n\n“We’re getting into the area where humans are used as beta testers and guinea pigs, and it’s not somewhere we want to be,” Michael Brooks, chief counsel at the Center for Auto Safety, told CNN Business.\n\nTesla said in the recalls that it was not aware of any related crashes or injuries, and the company did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nBrooks pointed to Tesla’s safety recall in February of its Boombox feature, which allows people to play sounds of their choosing through the vehicle’s external speaker, which is typically used for its pedestrian warning system. US motor vehicle regulations require hybrid and electric vehicles to emit a low sound at low speeds, because they’re so naturally quiet it can be unsafe for pedestrians and cyclists. Tesla said in its Boombox recall that the feature could interfere with the effectiveness of the pedestrian warning system.\n\n“The fun police made us do it (sigh),” Musk tweeted after the recall.\n\nTesla said it will release an over-the-air software update to disable the Boombox function while the car is in drive, neutral or reverse mode.\n\nMost of Tesla’s 12 recalls in 2021 required a Tesla technician to make a hands-on fix, such as issues with a seatbelt or airbag. Auto recall experts expect software updates to become much more common. They’re especially appealing as an alternative to fixing a hardware or mechanical issue.\n\nMercedes-Benz in 2017 tweaked software on the 2015 and 2016 C63 AMG high performance coupe and sedan to prevent a part from snapping during hard acceleration on wet roads. Chrysler updated software on some Ram pickups in 2018 to prevent them from unintentionally rolling away. Ford in 2018 updated software on its Focus sedan to prevent engine stalls.\n\nKane cautioned that a downside of software fixes is it may lead to automakers making a short-term software fix and pushing underlying issues down the road, including when a vehicle is no longer under warranty.", "authors": ["Matt Mcfarland"], "publish_date": "2022/03/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/13/business/tesla-recall-boombox/index.html", "title": "Musk blames 'fun police' for recall of feature that makes fart and goat ...", "text": "1.

But according to the National Air and Space Museum, 365 days is a rounded number. It actually takes 365.242190 days for the Earth to orbit completely, or 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes and 56 seconds.\n\nIn Graphics:All the details on 2024's bonus day in February\n\nBy adding an extra day every four years, this allows our calendar to stay on track with the Earth's actual orbit and not have our seasons drift, as our equinoxes and summer and winter solstices would no longer align with the seasons.\n\nHow often do leap days occur? Not all are every four years\n\nGiven that leap years are supposed to occur every four years, that would make sense. But it's not that simple, the National Air and Space Museum says. When we add a leap day every four years, we make our calendar longer by 44 minutes, and over time, that also causes seasons to drift.\n\nTo combat this, the rule is that if the year is divisible by 100 but not 400, we skip that leap year.

Why we're adding an extra day to calendar this year\n\nWhat is a leap year?\n\nLeap years happen when we add one day to the end of February in order to align our calendar with the Earth's orbit. Once every four years, we tack a 29th day onto the end of February, which is usually 28 days long, making a leap year 366 days instead of 365.\n\nWe generally refer to 365 as the number of days it takes for the Earth to orbit the sun, but it actually takes 365.242190 days or 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes and 56 seconds, to be exact.\n\nTo compensate for using a rounded number the rest of the time, we add this extra day periodically to keep our calendar in line with our equinoxes and solstices and therefore our seasons.\n\nWhat is a leap year?Breaking down the science, and history, behind the ancient phenomenon\n\nWhen is leap day 2024?\n\nLeap day occurs on Thursday, Feb. 29.\n\nBefore 2024, the last leap year was in 2020.\n\nWhen is the next leap day?\n\nAfter 2024, the next leap year will happen in 2028 and will fall on Tuesday, Feb. 29.\n\nHow often are leap years?\n\nLeap years occur every four years, with an exception.

During a leap year, which occurs every four years, leap day falls on Feb. 29, giving the shortest month of the year one added day.\n\nWhy is leap day every four years?\n\nThe reason there are leap days, and years, is because of the Earth's orbit.\n\nThe amount of days it takes for the Earth to complete a full revolution around the Sun is not a whole number. The 365 days we experience is actually 365.242190 days, according to the National Air and Space Museum.\n\nGetting rid of those 0.242190 days adds up.\n\nThat fraction allows seasons to correctly line up each year. If leap day was left off the calendar, the months during which we normally experience each season would eventually shift. This would impact other aspects of life, such as the growing and harvesting of crops.\n\nWhen added, four 0.242190 days roughly equal one full day, which is why Feb. 29 is added to the calendar of most years that are divisible by four, including 2024.\n\nWhen do we skip leap day?\n\nTo make up for decimals of time, we'll sometimes skip leap years, but it's rare. Prepare for a little bit of math: years divisible by 100 but not 400 are skipped, meaning we skipped leap years in 1700, 1800 and 1900 but not 2000.

Some calendars – such as the Hebrew, Chinese and Buddhist calendars – contained leap months, also known as \"intercalary or interstitial months,\" according to the History Channel.\n\nWhile Julius Caesar is often credited for originating leap days, he got the idea from the Egyptians. By the third-century BCE, Egyptians followed a solar calendar that spanned 365 days with a leap year every four years, National Geographic reports.\n\nIn ancient Rome, their calendar varied and included a 23-day intercalary month called \"Mercedonius.\" But it was not a standalone month. Mercedonius was added to February to account for the difference between the Roman year and solar year, according to the History Channel.\n\nWhen making the Julian calendar, Caesar took inspiration from the Egyptians and decided to add an extra day to the month of February every four years. The Julian calendar officially began on Jan. 1 in 45 BCE.\n\nThis method would continue over several centuries, but not without issue. Caesar's math of 365.25 days was close, but it wasn't the exact 365.242190 days the solar year contains. To be precise, Caesar \"overestimated the solar year by 11 minutes,\" the History Channel reports. This meant the Julian calendar would be short a day every 128 years, according to National Geographic.\n\nBy the 16th century, time had shifted again and not in a good way. Major dates had changed, including Easter. The holiday is supposed to occur on the first Sunday following the first full moon on or after the spring equinox.

Well, almost. Every four years (give or take), our calendars receive an additional day.\n\nKnown as \"leap day,\" Feb. 29 is tacked on and becomes the last day of the shortest month of the year. And beyond giving people an extra day to reach their goals, there is some science as to why we have leap days.\n\nSo, as you're making leap day plans for this year, here's a quick primer on how it came to be.\n\nWhat is leap day?\n\nA leap day takes place during a leap year, which is a year containing \"an inserted period of time,\" according to Britannica.\n\nLeap day falls on Feb. 29. Typically, February is the shortest month of the year, spanning 28 days. However, about once every four years, the month will get another date added to its calendar.\n\nWhy is leap day every four years?\n\nThe reason there are leap days, and years, is because of the Earth's orbit.\n\nThe amount of days it takes for the Earth to complete a full revolution around the Sun is not a whole number. The 365 days we experience is actually 365.2422 days, National Geographic reports.\n\nGetting rid of 0.2422 days adds up.\n\nThe fraction allows the seasons to correctly line up each year. If it was forgotten, the months during which we normally experience each seasons would shift, according to National Geographic. This would impact other aspects of life, such as the growing and harvesting of crops.\n\nThis is why leap years exist. When added, four 0.2422 days roughly equal one full day. Feb. 29 is added to the calendar of most years that are divisible by four, including 2024.\n\nWho made leap day?\n\nThe concept of adding leap days is not new and has been around for millennia, Britannica reports. Some calendars – such as the Hebrew, Chinese and Buddhist calendars – contained leap months, also known as \"intercalary or interstitial months,\" according to the History Channel.\n\nWhile Julius Caesar is often credited for originating leap days, he got the idea from the Egyptians. By the third-century BCE, Egyptians followed a solar calendar that spanned 365 days with a leap year every four years, National Geographic reports.\n\nIn ancient Rome, their calendar varied and included a 23-day intercalary month called \"Mercedonius.\" But it was not a standalone month. Mercedonius was added to February to account for the difference between the Roman year and solar year, according to the History Channel.\n\nWhen making the Julian calendar, Caesar took inspiration from the Egyptians and decided to add an extra day to the month of February every four years. The Julian calendar officially began on Jan. 1 in 45 BCE.\n\nThis method would continue over several centuries, but not without issue. Caesar's math of 365.25 days was close, but it wasn't the exact 365.2422 days the solar year contains. To be precise, Caesar \"overestimated the solar year by 11 minutes,\" the History Channel reports. This meant the Julian calendar would be short a day every 128 years, according to National Geographic.\n\nBy the 16th century, time had shifted again and not in a good way. Major dates had changed, including Easter. The holiday is supposed to occur on the first Sunday following the first full moon on or after the spring equinox. At the time, Easter's date had moved by about 10 days.\n\nTo fix this, Pope Gregory XIII introduced the Gregorian calendar, which kept a leap day every four years but eliminated it during centurial years not divisible by 400, according to the History Channel. This is why 1700, 1800 and 1900 were not leap years, but 2000 was.\n\nDespite its accuracy, the Gregorian calendar is not flawless. Instead of being off by one day every 128 years like the Julian calendar, the Gregorian calendar falls short once every 3,030 years, the History Channel reports.\n\nWhat happens if you are born on leap day?\n\nFeb. 29 is the rarest birthday someone could have. Still, at least 5 million people celebrate their birthday on leap day, according to the History Channel. Your odds of being born on Feb. 29 are one-in-1,461.\n\nMany \"Leaplings\" (or those born on leap day) will celebrate their birthdays on Feb. 28 or March 1 during a typical 365-day year, even though documents will reflect it is on Feb. 29.\n\nHow common is your birthday?Check out the full list, plus uncommon celebrity birthdays.\n\nUpcoming leap days\n\nThis year, 2024, is a leap year.

But not to worry, someone born on Leap Day still gets to celebrate a birthday (see below).\n\nWhen is Leap Day 2024?\n\nLeap Day is Thursday, Feb. 29, 2024.\n\nWhy does Leap Day occur once every four years?\n\nOur calendar is not entirely in sync with our planet's trip around the sun.\n\nA common year has 365 days on the calendar while a leap year boasts that extra day. Their purpose keeps our calendar in sync with the seasons and solar year, or the length of time it takes the earth to complete its orbit around the sun, which is about 365¼ days, according to timeanddate.com.\n\nEvery four years, we have 366 days on the calendar. If we didn't observe leap years, our seasons would be messed up as our equinoxes and summer and winter solstice would no longer align with the seasons.\n\n\"If there were no leap years, the seasons would completely swap every 750 years, i.e. the middle of summer would become the middle of winter − calendar climate change,\" astronomy expert Dr. Stephen Hughes of Queensland University of Technology said in a Feb. 29, 2012 (a Leap Year) article on AsianScientist.com.\n\nIf your birthday is on Feb. 29, which day do you use to celebrate? What date do you use for official documents or ID?\n\nThose born on that day don't always get to celebrate their actual birthday — since that date occurs only every four years. Someone born on Leap Day typically celebrates birthdays on Feb. 28 or March 1. But Feb. 29 is still used for identification and important documents.\n\nHappy birthday! How old would you be if you were born on Leap Day?\n\nHow old are you technically if you were born on Leap Day? If you were born on Leap Day 1924, you would be 100 years old, or 25 in Leap Day years.\n\nThe year must be evenly divisible by 4. If the year can be evenly divided by 100, it is not a leap year unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400, according to mathisfun.com.

While this is true for those who follow the Gregorian calendar, many others celebrate the new year on a different day.\n\nAcross the globe, around 2 billion people celebrate the Lunar New Year, an international holiday observed throughout many Asian countries, but not all. The U.S. has its own unique celebrations.\n\nEach year, the date of Lunar New Year changes. But no matter the date, each culture that celebrates has its own historically rich customs, traditions and beliefs.\n\nWhen is Lunar New Year?\n\nThis year, Lunar New Year falls on Saturday, Feb. 10.\n\nLunar New Year's date changes every year since it follows a lunar calendar, according to Gang Liu, a professor of Chinese studies at Carnegie Mellon University.\n\nMany Western countries – including the U.S. – use the Gregorian calendar, which is based on a system of 365 days (plus a leap day every four years). Lunar New Year is based the moon's 12 phases. Each phase cycle spans approximately 29 days with the full calendar being about 354 days long.\n\nOn the Gregorian calendar, Lunar New Year generally falls during the last ten days of January or the first ten days of February, says Chen Yang, a professor of Chinese culture and philosophy at George Washington University.\n\nWho celebrates Lunar New Year?\n\nLunar New Year is celebrated in many Asian cultures, Xiaoquan Raphael Zhang, the director of the Chinese program at American University, previously told USA TODAY. Among these cultures are Chinese, South Korean, Vietnamese, Singaporean, Malaysian, Filipino and Indonesian.\n\nEach culture has its own name for the New Year. For instance, Lunar New Year in China is called the Spring Festival, or chūnjié. South Korea refers to the Lunar New Year as Seollal. In Vietnam, Lunar New Year is called Tết, which is short for Tết Nguyên Đán.\n\nHow long is Lunar New Year?\n\nWhile the Western New Year lasts just one day, Lunar New Year goes beyond that.\n\nIn China, Lunar New Year spans from the first new moon to the next full moon, or the fifth day of the lunar month, Zhang previously told USA TODAY.\n\nThis begins with the Spring Festival and ends with the Lantern Festival, says Liu. In 2024, Lunar New Year starts Saturday, Feb. 10 and ends Saturday, Feb. 24.\n\nThe number of days of celebration varies depending on the country. In South Korea, Seollal usually lasts for three days. In Vietnam, Tết Nguyên Đán is a week long.\n\nWhat does Lunar New Year signify?\n\nSimilar to the Western New Year, Lunar New Year symbolizes letting go of the past and ringing in the present. Celebrations are focused on removing the bad and the old and welcoming the new and the good, says Yang.\n\nThe Lunar New Year also is an important time for spending time with family to show one's love and gratitude, says Yang. People will pay their respects to their ancestors and older family members.\n\nIts significance is similar to Thanksgiving or Christmas among Western cultures, says Liu. \"It's a reunion time; it's a celebration time.\"\n\nAn integral part of Lunar New Year is that families will come together to practice cultural customs and to prepare and eat feasts. These customs, however, can vary depending on one's community, says Liu.\n\nPeople will clean their homes leading up to the Lunar New Year, says Yang. They also might decorate them with red, which is seen as a color of good fortune in Chinese culture.\n\nOn Lunar New Year Eve, families come together to share a large meal, says Yang. Many will prepare fish as a sign of good luck and abundance in the new year. But the fish is not meant to be finished. \"In Chinese, surplus has the same pronunciation as fish,\" explains Yang.\n\nIn many cultures, younger people will receive red envelopes with money on Lunar New Year. \"You will usually receive red envelopes from your seniors,\" says Liu. Children may also get new clothes in celebration of the new year.\n\nFireworks are another way many people ring in the Lunar New Year.\n\nWhat does the Year of the Dragon represent?\n\nIt's time to say goodbye to the year of the rabbit and say hello to the year of the dragon.\n\nIn the Chinese Zodiac, there are 12 animals. Each has its own attributes and characteristics. These 12 animals coincide with the lunar calendar in a 12-year cycle.\n\nThe order of the Chinese Zodiac is:\n\nRat\n\nOx\n\nTiger\n\nRabbit (in Vietnam, the rabbit is replaced by the cat)\n\nDragon\n\nSnake\n\nHorse\n\nGoat\n\nMonkey\n\nRooster\n\nDog\n\nPig\n\n2023 was represented by the rabbit (or cat in Vietnam). Those born under the Zodiac are often seen as caring, attentive to details and likely to follow rules. 2024 will be the year of the dragon.\n\n\"A dragon in China, as a culture, it's a spirit, it's a symbol,\" says Yang. \"The dragon is a well-known mascot.\" Throughout Chinese history, the dragon has represented good luck, justice, prosperity and strength, he explains.\n\nPeople born in the year of the dragon are seen as charismatic, intelligent, confident, powerful, naturally lucky and gifted, says Yang.\n\nJust Curious for more?

The southeastern province of Sindh and the southwestern province of Balochistan are the two most “affected provinces in terms of human and infrastructural impact,” OCHA wrote in a Tuesday press release.\n\nThe southwestern province of Balochistan is one of the two most heavily affected areas. Hamdan Khan/AP\n\nMore than 504,000 livestock have been killed, nearly all of them in Balochistan, while nearly 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles) of roads and 129 bridges have been damaged, blocking access to flood-affected areas, OCHA writes.\n\nOn Wednesday, the governmental National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) said more international funding was needed for flood relief, rehabilitation, and the reconstruction of damaged infrastructure.\n\nRehman, who was speaking at an NDMA briefing on Wednesday, likened the situation to record flooding in 2010 but said much of Balochistan, south Punjab, and 30 districts of the Sindh region were facing an “unprecedented humanitarian disaster.”\n\n“People are adrift, livestock and crops are damaged,” Rehman said.\n\nMore heavy rain and flooding is expected, and schools in Balochistan and Sindh have been closed in anticipation of a fresh spell of monsoon rain expected towards the end of the week.\n\nChina said Wednesday that it would be providing emergency humanitarian aid to Pakistan, according to a tweet from the Chinese Embassy in Pakistan. The supplies would include 25,000 tents along with $300,000 in emergency cash to aid the flood-hit regions in Pakistan, according to the statement.\n\nPeople wade across a flooded street after heavy monsoon rainfall in Karachi on July 25.

The country was, however, hit with similarly devastating floods in 2010.\n\n“Pakistan is in dire need and the damages are here and we will be in this a very long time,” Ophoff said. “It’s not months but years we are talking about.”\n\nThe 33 million people impacted by the floods and rain represent 15% of the population.\n\nAmong 1,136 people killed since mid-June were 386 children, the National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) said Monday, as the unrelenting rain raised fears of more fatalities to come. Nearly half a million homes have been destroyed, according to NDMA.\n\n“By the time this is over, we could well have one quarter or one third of Pakistan under water,” Pakistan’s climate change minister Sherry Rehman told Turkish news outlet TRT World last week.\n\n‘Water gushed in’\n\nDramatic scenes of disaster have unfolded in Pakistan as floods inundated the country.\n\nIt was raining but not heavily, Ali Jan told Reuters Monday, as he stood surrounded by water in Chadsadda in northern Pakistan. But that quickly changed.\n\n“Suddenly the outer wall of the compound collapsed and water gushed in,” Jan said. “We barely managed to save ourselves. By the time the women were leaving the house, the water had become almost waist-deep. We evacuated the women and the cattle. The rest is there for you to see.

Javed Iqbal/CNN\n\nIn a bid to avert that scenario, they allowed the lake to overflow twice on Sunday in an attempt to divert some of the lake’s waters into less densely populated areas. But this has led to flooding in smaller villages that has affected around 135,000 people, Sindh province’s irrigation minister Jam Khan Shoro told CNN on Wednesday. Shoro said the move was necessary to avoid wider flooding in the district of Dadu, home to around 1.55 million people.\n\nThe lake also overflowed on Tuesday, in what officials said was a natural occurrence and not part of efforts to divert the water.\n\nShoro said officials had on Sunday had tried to warn people in towns near the lake that it would overflow and had urged people to leave the area.\n\n“We are trying our best to provide relief to the people but the scale of the disaster is so high and the number of people affected is also so high,” he said. “It’s nearly impossible for our government to provide everyone with shelter, food, and medicine. It’s difficult.”\n\nShoro added that the army and navy were being enlisted to help the relief efforts and authorities were communicating with elected officials in the villages.\n\nMurad Ali Shah, the chief minister of Sindh, said Wednesday he did not want the lake to overflow but if authorities had not diverted the water, cities up to 100 kilometers (62 miles) from the lake – such as Sehwan, Dadu and Mehar – would have been put in danger.\n\nWhile those areas have been spared, at least for now, villages nearby are bearing the brunt.\n\n“(Our) village is submerged. There is no way to go (to it),” said Noor Mohammad Thebo, who spoke to CNN on a roadside as rapidly flowing water swirled around his ankles.\n\nThebo said 10 to 15 families had been cut off by the rising waters in his village near the lake and that water up to 1.5 meters (five feet) deep now covered its main access road – making any rescue efforts a dangerous affair.\n\n“There are no rescue teams that could help (the trapped families) and there is no way for (the families) to come out,” Thebo said.\n\nCourtesy European Space Agency Courtesy European Space Agency Lake Manchar widens in July as monsoon rains battered Pakistan.\n\nIn Bachal Chana, another nearby village, resident Yar Mohammad said people had been caught completely off guard when overflowing water from Lake Manchar rushed in.\n\n“It destroyed our crops and houses.

Warming of 2C would mean even more intense and frequent of extreme rain events and flooding in southern Brazil, according to the IPCC.\n\nScientists say the world needs to make deep, sustained cuts to greenhouse gases, primarily by transitioning away from fossil fuels, to contain global warming to 1.5C.\n\nBrazil has seen a number of natural disasters in recent months.\n\nAt the beginning of February at least 24 people died after heavy rain battered São Paulo, home to Brazil’s financial center, triggering floods and landslides across the southeastern Brazilian state.\n\nMore than 1,546 families were displaced, according to a statement released by the State Civil Defense, which also said that at least eight children died in the disaster.\n\nAnd at the end of December it was announced that the death toll from floods and heavy rain, which had blighted the Brazilian state of Bahia since November, had risen to 20.\n\nFlooding also caused two dams to burst and the displacement of an estimated 62,800 people, state officials say.", "authors": ["Jack Guy Rodrigo Pedroso Sahar Akbarzai", "Jack Guy", "Rodrigo Pedroso", "Sahar Akbarzai"], "publish_date": "2022/02/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/13/us/brooklyn-shooting-sunset-park-residents/index.html", "title": "Their Brooklyn neighborhood felt like a safe haven in a big city ...", "text": "Brooklyn, New York CNN —\n\nJohn Acevedo woke up to a commotion outside.\n\nNot so strange for a New Yorker, perhaps, but unheard of in his neighborhood of Sunset Park, Brooklyn, far off the tourist path. The 20-year-old could make out the sounds of sirens on the street, helicopters overhead. When he stepped outside his front door, he found himself in the middle of chaos.\n\nAcevedo lives across the street from the 36th Street subway station where, just hours earlier, a gunman opened two smoke grenades and fired at least 33 shots at commuters, striking 10 people.\n\n“It’s really surreal for us,” Acevedo told CNN of his neighborhood in the southwest part of Brooklyn. “This whole neighborhood, it’s a community, crime isn’t what you expect here. I’m speechless.”\n\nIn the aftermath, neighbors held each others’ hands across the fences that separate their homes. Others sat in shock on their stoops. This kind of violence is something the more than 135,000 residents of this tightknit community – about a third of whom are Asian and a third Hispanic, according to US Census data – are used to hearing about in other neighborhoods. Not here, not so close to their haven where they call everyone “family.”\n\nLike Acevedo, Nicholas Sciammarella and his partner, Anthony Valentino, realized something was amiss as the sound of sirens flooded their home during breakfast.\n\nThe couple live a block away from the station, and Valentino went out to see what was happening there.\n\n“I saw two people holding up a man who was all bloodied, blood all over his hands, and he was in shock, walking like a zombie before sitting to the floor,” Valentino said. He stayed, offering water, phone calls and help to those leaving the station.\n\nSciammarella said they also called down their list of neighbors, “checking one by one and making sure everyone is OK.”\n\nNicholas Sciammarella, left, and Anthony Valentino, residents of Sunset Park Courtesy Nicholas Sciammarella\n\nAt the L&E Deli Grocery, just two blocks from the station, manager Elia Tapia, 38, was processing it all. She has lived in Sunset Park for 20 years.\n\n“Never in my life could I have thought this would happen to our home,” she said. “This is a huge surprise for us, this neighborhood is so nice and quiet, nothing happens. We are a family here, we all know and take care of each other.”\n\nAsk a Sunset Park local to describe their neighborhood, and they’ll likely tell you it’s a calm, friendly place, the type of neighborhood to raise a family in. The neighborhood has emerged as part of Brooklyn’s Chinatown, thanks to a growing population of immigrants from China’s Fujian province.\n\nIt’s only a short subway ride from Manhattan but still far enough to feel like a different city altogether. Situated on the waterfront, Sunset Park offers green space and views of New York Harbor, the Statue of Liberty and even New Jersey, on a clear day.\n\nTapia has lost that feeling of safety she had always adored about her neighborhood.\n\n“I used to be able to walk here, late at night, 2 in the morning to the train, but now I could never,” she told CNN. “We can feel the difference (in violence) in the city, but still we could have never expected this to happen to us.”\n\nMembers of the New York Police Department are seen patrolling the streets after the mass shooting.

More than 360 people have been shot this year in 322 shooting incidents, according to figures released by the New York Police Department on Sunday. That’s an 8.4% increase in shooting incidents over this time last year.\n\nGeneral crime on the transit system has spiked even more – 68% over last year, the NYPD reports.\n\nCrime in the 72nd Precinct, which includes Sunset Park, has rapidly risen as well, NYPD data shows.\n\nOverall crime is up more than 103% so far this year through Sunday compared to this time in 2021 and up 70% from 2020, with the highest increases seen in burglary, grand larceny and auto theft. There had been one shooting incident in the precinct this year as of Sunday, the same number as this time last year.\n\nFor Lilea Ng, too, Tuesday felt like her home was under attack, she told CNN. A Chinese American born in Panama, Ng moved to the city 20 years ago, eager to find the American dream.\n\nNow, that dream is turning into a nightmare, she said.\n\nEven before Tuesday’s violence, Ng avoided riding the subway or any public transportation, she said, noting the rising violence towards Asian Americans during the pandemic.\n\n“I’ve never felt this unsafe before,” Ng said. “Even after 9/11 I felt safe. But the feeling I have now, it’s different. I’m never on the subway or any public transportation anymore.”\n\nLeaving New York was never on the table before – but now, the thought lingers in the back of her mind.\n\nLaw enforcement officials lead subway shooting suspect Frank James away from a police station in New York on Wednesday, April 13.

Inside the dimly lit bar, the energy was still comforting – proof that despite the fears, heartache and confusion, this community is in it together.\n\nThat’s how 30-year resident Guillermo Tejeta described it, sitting at the bar with his newborn baby on his lap. Tejeta was driving home after dropping his son at day care when the commotion unfolded around him: Police officers flooded into the street, halting traffic and making space for first responders.\n\n“People were talking about shootings and explosions and I was like, ‘Yeah, whatever,’” Tejeta said. But when he got home, he went online and realized what was happening.\n\n“Only yesterday, my girlfriend’s mother called us, telling us, ‘You guys need to leave New York.’ And I was like, ‘Hell no, I’ve lived my whole life here, I’m not going anywhere.’ But this hit close to home.”\n\nTejeta is often at Minnie’s but especially felt the need to be there Tuesday to talk over what had happened with friends and family, he said.\n\n“This is our train stop. This is what we use to go into work, to go into the city, so it’s scary, really scary,” he added.\n\nHe paused to kiss his baby’s head. “We gotta make you New York strong, OK?”", "authors": ["Alaa Elassar Theresa Waldrop", "Alaa Elassar", "Theresa Waldrop"], "publish_date": "2022/04/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/08/weather/hurricane-kay-forecast-california/index.html", "title": "A hurricane that just made landfall in Mexico is triggering flood ...", "text": "(CNN) Hurricane Kay made landfall in Mexico , along the west coast of the central Baja California Peninsula on Thursday afternoon, triggering flooding concerns not just in that region, but in parts of California and Arizona too.\n\nHurricane conditions were impacting the peninsula Thursday and were expected to last several hours as the storm moved along the coast, according to the National Hurricane Center. Kay had maximum sustained winds of 75 mph at the time of landfall, making it a Category 1 storm. It's expected to weaken throughout Thursday evening, the center said, but added that tropical storm conditions will spread northward.\n\nHeavy rains will drench southern California Friday -- potentially bringing several months to a year's worth of rain to a normally arid landscape. But that's not all: As the storm moves north, strong winds -- far from providing immediate relief from California's climate crisis-driven heat wave -- actually could push already record temperatures higher in some places.\n\nFlooding is also possible starting Friday in parts of southwest Arizona, the hurricane center said.\n\nKay is expected to remain at hurricane strength until it's around 250 miles from San Diego -- something only four other storms have done since 1950, according to the National Weather Service -- before weakening as it moves toward the US West Coast.\n\nBut the storm doesn't need to be strong \"for this to be a major concern for Southern California,\" said Brandt Maxwell, a National Weather Service meteorologist in San Diego.\n\nKay is forecast to track parallel to the Baja California peninsula through Friday, pushing what could be record-breaking amount of moisture into Southern California and Arizona. Then just shy of the US-Mexican border, it will turn westward -- away from the coast -- as it makes the closest pass to Southern California for a hurricane since 1997's Hurricane Nora.\n\nA turn to the west is expected by Saturday night, the hurricane center said.\n\nWinds could gust to more than 60 mph as the system interacts with Southern California's mountainous terrain. And those winds will be coming from the east, which means they will have a warming effect on coastal cities; as air travels down mountains, it is compressed and its temperature rises.\n\nIt will be similar to the Santa Ana wind phenomenon , which typically occurs in the fall and winter. \"We are not calling it Santa Ana winds, but they will have characteristics of them as they pass through canyons and the sloped terrain,\" Maxwell told CNN.\n\nThe warm, dry winds from the east will increase the region's already considerable fire risk . Temperatures could reach 100 degrees Friday in coastal parts of San Diego and Orange counties.\n\n\"This happened in 1984 as a Category 1 Hurricane Marie well southwest of San Diego County forced temperatures to reach 100 in San Diego,\" Maxwell said.\n\nLows could remain in the 80s overnight Thursday and into Friday morning, making sleeping uncomfortable, especially for those without air conditioning.\n\nThen, the relentless heat will \"end abruptly and unusually\" late Friday, weather service in Los Angeles said, as the tropical system's cloud cover and rainfall move in, drastically reducing temperatures but creating new hazards: heavy rainfall and a flash flood threat.\n\nA year's worth of rain to parts of Southern California\n\nEven as the Southwest has been mired in a multi-year megadrought , Kay's rainfall could pose a significant flood danger.\n\n\"A Moderate risk for Excessive Rainfall is in effect for portions of Southern California this weekend,\" the Weather Prediction Center said Thursday evening. \"While Hurricane Kay is not forecast to make landfall in California, associated rainfall will likely still impact the region, with localized regions of heavy rainfall possible.\"\n\nModels suggest moisture over this normally dry area will be well above the 99th percentile for this time of year going into the weekend.\n\nEven though rainfall is desperately needed across parched Southern California, this much rain over a short period can cause creeks and rivers to rise rapidly.\n\n\"It's never a good thing to get too much rain all at once, a trait all too common among slow-moving tropical storms,\" the prediction center said earlier. \"Thus, the flash flood potential is summarily also rapidly increasing.\"\n\nRainfall of 2 to 4 inches, possibly up to around 8 inches, is expected throughout the mountainous terrain of Southern California, especially on the eastern slopes.\n\nA warning of moderate risk of excessive rainfall -- Level 3 of 4 -- is in effect for Friday over portions of Southern California and far southwest Arizona, with a slight risk -- Level 2 of 4 -- in effect by Saturday across more of Southern California, western Arizona and far southern Nevada.\n\nThe National Weather Service forecasts 2 to 4 inches of rain over 36 hours Friday and Saturday at Imperial County Airport in southeastern California; the spot gets 2.38 inches of rain on average each year. If Imperial receives more than 3 inches of rain, it would make this month its wettest September, breaking a record set in 1976.\n\nThe Imperial Valley region is home to one of the nation's most productive farm belts, especially known for producing winter vegetables for US consumers due to its year-round growing season. The area and nearby regions including Yuma, Arizona, have been dealing with long-term drought and are in contentious negotiations about reducing their hefty water supply from the Colorado River.\n\nIn Palm Springs, California, 2 to 4 inches is forecast through the weekend, pushing toward the typical annual rainfall tally of 4.61 inches. Three inches in Palm Springs would put this month in the top three wettest Septembers for the city and make it the wettest since 1976, when it got 4.17 inches; its average September rainfall is 0.24 inches.\n\nYuma could see 1.5 inches of rain through the weekend, which would make this month the wettest September there since 2009.

His parents say they have not heard from him since November 27. His fellow students reported him missing on November 29, and an investigation was launched, according to Grenoble prosecutor Eric Vaillant.\n\nVaillant has said the student “seems to have left Grenoble voluntarily,” adding DeLand was seen in a Decathlon store in the town of Montélimar, about 87 miles from Grenoble, on December 3. Bank records show DeLand last made a purchase at a store on that day, but there have been no records of his whereabouts since then, his family says.\n\nThe student’s father, Kenneth DeLand Sr., spoke with CNN Thursday morning saying he was told by authorities that Interpol is now involved.\n\nInterpol has issued a Yellow Notice for DeLand Jr., saying he went missing on November 27.\n\nYellow Notices are issued to help locate missing persons, often minors, or to help identify persons who are unable to identify themselves, according to Interpol’s website.\n\nCNN asked the Grenoble prosecutor if Interpol’s involvement meant DeLand Jr. had crossed a border but received a “no comment.”\n\nDeLand Jr.’s host mother, who spoke exclusively to CNN on the condition of anonymity out of concerns for her privacy, said that out of all the students she had hosted, DeLand seemed to have the most trouble fitting in.\n\nShe told CNN that when she hadn’t heard from DeLand, she inundated him with messages trying to figure out where he was but he did not reply. Finding out about the December 3 footage was reassuring, she said, because she felt it confirmed her suspicions he may have left and cut off communications voluntarily.\n\nDeLand had mentioned he wanted to go to Marseille before returning to the US, according to the prosecuitor.\n\nDeLand Sr. said his son was scheduled to return to the US on December 17. And though the student liked to go hiking, he would always keep in touch, his father said.\n\n“For him to not reach out, with no correspondence, this is very uncharacteristic of my son,” DeLand Sr. told CNN’s Anderson Cooper Wednesday. “This is what creates all the worry that any parent could ever feel.”\n\n“As time goes by, it makes you worry even more.”\n\nLack of urgency from authorities, father says\n\nDeLand Sr. has challenged the idea that his son left voluntarily.\n\nHe has said DeLand Jr. was traveling with friends from a study abroad program and he never gave any indication during their frequent conversations that he was having trouble making friends. The student’s mother, Carol Laws, has said that when she last spoke to her son, he was “looking forward to coming home for Christmas.”\n\nOn Wednesday night, DeLand Sr. said he felt there wasn’t enough urgency in the way authorities were responding to his son’s case, saying “it just feels like the wind has gone out of the sail as far as what’s being done to find my son.”\n\n“What’s being done?” the father said. “(Are) there still resources? … Are they looking for him? What’s going on?”\n\nThis wasn’t the first time the father expressed similar concerns about the response: DeLand Jr.’s parents previously told CNN it has been difficult trying to get information from authorities both in the US and abroad. Not only is the language barrier difficult but DeLand’s father earlier this week cited a French privacy act that has prevented the release of certain information.\n\nDeLand Sr. said Tuesday he had been reaching out to the authorities at the embassy and authorities in France but didn’t have much luck.\n\n“There’s no reciprocation of information. That privacy act prevents disclosure of information, you can give them information but they cannot give you information,” the father told CNN earlier this week.\n\n“I’ve called the local police departments and the same thing is in effect in the French police departments that are local to that area in which he was last seen,” he added. “So, it’s very limiting.”\n\nTo help find him, Deland’s family has launched a website where people can send tips and information.\n\nAnd in a statement, St. John Fisher University said it is doing all it can to assist in the investigation to find the young man.\n\n“University officials have stayed in close contact with the American Institute for Foreign Study (AIFS) who is working with local law enforcement on the search, as well as Kenneth’s family to offer support to them during this time. Our campus community remains hopeful that Kenneth will be found safe and return home,” the school said.", "authors": ["Melissa Bell Saskya Vandoorne Christina Maxouris", "Melissa Bell", "Saskya Vandoorne", "Christina Maxouris", "Lack Of Urgency Authorities", "Father Says"], "publish_date": "2022/12/14"}]}

Slash the cost of that Hawaiian or European vacation by booking a flight or a hotel room early or during the off-season.\n\nBut the same supply-and-demand principle can work against you. You pay more for electricity during peak hours, for Bruce Springsteen concert tickets, or even a parking spot when there's a sporting event. And, of course, there’s the infamous Uber surge pricing.\n\nThough not new, surge pricing – or dynamic or variable pricing, as it’s typically called in the business world – is fast becoming the norm.\n\nWhat is surge pricing?\n\nMore fast-food joints, restaurant chains and brick-and-mortar retailers are taking advantage of technological advances to tap into real-time trends and swiftly adjust prices, sometimes in seconds.\n\nIt’s a tempting proposition for big businesses that can dramatically increase revenue with slight pricing changes.\n\nWendy’s was the latest to say it will fluctuate prices of chicken nuggets or a classic chocolate Frosty based on demand.\n\nIn a conference call earlier this month, Wendy’s CEO Kirk Tanner said the fast-food chain would experiment with dynamic pricing as early as next year.\n\nWendy's surge pricing\n\n“Beginning as early as 2025, we will begin testing more enhanced features like dynamic pricing and daypart offerings, along with AI-enabled menu changes and suggestive selling,” he said. “As we continue to show the benefit of this technology in our company-operated restaurants, franchisee interest in digital menu boards should increase, further supporting sales and profit growth across the system.”\n\nThe response on social media was mixed.\n\n“If I ate at Wendy’s, I’d sit in the drive thru waiting for the surge pricing period to end,” commented one consumer on the social media platform Threads.\n\nNot everyone is mad at Wendy’s. “Lots of other businesses adjust prices based on demand,” commented another.\n\nAfter the comments from Wendy's CEO caused an online commotion this week, the fast-food chain said it does not plan to hike menu prices during peak demand.\n\nThe initiative would add digital menu boards to certain stores so Wendy's could offer discounts to customers more easily, \"particularly in the slower times of day,\" Wendy's said.\n\n\"We said these menuboards would give us more flexibility to change the display of featured items. This was misconstrued in some media reports as an intent to raise prices when demand is highest,\" the company said.\n\nWhat’s clear: The days of fixed prices that began in 1876 when a Quaker merchant introduced price tags at his department store in Philadelphia may soon be behind us.\n\nResearch and advisory firm Gartner predicts that by 2025, the top 10 global retailers will use dynamic pricing to take advantage of mismatches between supply and demand.\n\nPrices seesaw all the time on the sites of online retailers like Amazon that use algorithms and artificial intelligence to monitor competitors and glean insights into individual shoppers, adjusting prices depending on interest in the product or in the brand, said Timothy Webb, an assistant professor at the University of Delaware’s hospitality and sport business management program.\n\nCoupons and other offers are also routinely dangled in mobile apps to encourage people to make purchases.\n\n“A lot of this stuff is already happening even if you don’t realize that it is happening. If you have the Starbucks app and I have the Starbucks app, we probably have different offers,” Webb said. “We might not be in the drive-thru and they just increased the prices, but we are already paying different prices for the same products.”\n\nBut, he says, Wendy’s fans will likely see moderate, not massive, price swings during periods of peak demand.\n\n“It’s not like $200 or $300 on a flight. This is a hypercompetitive industry. If Wendy’s goes up $2 to $3 on a burger at dinner time, I would be shocked. People have too many options. They will just walk down the street and eat at Burger King instead,” Webb said. “There will just be little price changes here.”\n\nThough consumers have been accustomed to hotels and airlines modulating prices depending on demand since the 1980s, they tend to view sharp pricing increases as predatory.\n\n“Consumers, by and large, understand that companies need to make a profit. But, when a company appears to be sticking it to a consumer in a moment of need, the customer resents it,” said John Dinsmore, a marketing professor at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio, who researches dynamic pricing.\n\nFifty-two percent of consumers surveyed by software company Capterra last year said dynamic pricing in restaurants is the equivalent of price gouging.\n\nA good example is Coca-Cola, Dinsmore said. “Around the turn of the century, they experimented with vending machines that raised the cost of drinks based on the outside temperature. The hotter the weather, the more expensive the soda. Consumers hated it. They understandably felt exploited. It violated consumers’ sense of price fairness. I think you are going to see a similar response to Wendy’s dynamic pricing.”\n\nDynamic pricing aims to influence consumer behavior − and price-sensitive consumers can work the system, Webb said.\n\n“If you are trying to save a couple bucks, it’s worthwhile seeing if you go to Wendy’s at 4, you are going to save a little bit of money,” he said. “There will be opportunities to find deals and pricing that are beneficial to you.”\n\nPeople who study dynamic pricing say it won't work in all facets of American life.\n\n\"Dynamic pricing is here to stay, but I believe only in certain contexts. Surge or dynamic pricing works for Uber because they are often the only option,\" Dinsmore said. \"For consumer staples like food and clothing, I have a hard time seeing it take hold. There are too many options. Consumers will adjust and competitors will undercut prices.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/27"}]}

This year it will go back to $2,000 for qualifying children of all ages.\n\nIn his remarks, Biden vowed to “restore the full Child Tax Credit which gave tens of millions of parents some breathing room and cut child poverty in half, to the lowest level in history.”\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nChild tax credit this year:How much is the Child Tax Credit for 2023?

The deficit’s cut was partly a result of higher tax revenues that Biden touted but also the end of spending related to the pandemic.\n\nBiden also took a jab at former President Donald Trump for increases in the federal deficit under Trump’s administration. “Under the previous administration, the American deficit went up four years in a row,” Biden said, to boos and jeers from Republican lawmakers.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWhat happens if the US hits the debt ceiling?:Here's what to expect if we reach debt limit.\n\nBiden says Republicans want to ‘take the economy hostage’ in debt ceiling talks\n\nBiden accused Republicans of wanting to “take the economy hostage” unless he agrees to their demands for spending cuts during debt ceiling talks.\n\nBiden demanded Republicans show “what their plans are.” House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has not specified what Republicans want axed.\n\n“Some Republicans want Medicare and Social Security to sunset every five years,” Biden said, prompting loud boos from Republicans in Congress.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nMedicare and debt ceiling fight:How Medicare and Social Security benefits factor into the Kevin McCarthy debt ceiling fight\n\nBiden defends Inflation Reduction Act\n\nPresident Biden touted the Inflation Reduction Act which he signed into law, saying he was taking on powerful interest to bring health care costs down.\n\n“You know, we pay more for prescription drugs than any major country on earth,” he said. “Big Pharma has been unfairly charging people hundreds of dollars – and making record profits.”\n\nHaving capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors on Medicare, Biden said it was time to help Americans not on Medicare, including 200,000 young people with Type I diabetes who need insulin to save their lives. “Let’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for every American who needs it,” he said. The law also caps out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors on Medicare at a maximum $2,000 per year.\n\nHe also promised to veto any attempts to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nCredit fees:Biden moves to limit credit fees to $8 for missed payments in latest \"junk fee\" crack down\n\nBiden tangles with GOP lawmakers over Social Security and Medicare\n\nBiden got into an unusual back and forth with Republicans over whether GOP lawmakers want to end the automatic continuation of Social Security and Medicare.\n\nWhen some vocally protested, Biden responded: “Anyone who doubts it, contact my office. I’ll give you a copy of the proposal.”\n\nWhen the protests continued, Biden said he wasn’t arguing that all Republicans back reviewing entitlement programs every five years.\n\n“But it’s being proposed,” he said.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nMedicare debate:How Medicare and Social Security benefits factor into the Kevin McCarthy debt ceiling fight\n\nCheers and boos for Biden\n\nProgressive members of the House, known as “the Squad,” cheered as President Joe Biden pushed for fair taxes and called out low tax rates for billionaires.\n\n“You tell ‘em, Joe,” said Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.\n\nHe also had plenty of jeers from the Republican side of the chamber when he slammed former President Donald Trump’s fiscal record and accused the House GOP of trying to cut Social Security and Medicare. The latter attracted loud boos.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., stood up and yelled, “Liar!” from the back of the chamber.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nTalkative Biden:On average, Biden is most talkative president in six decades of State of Union addresses\n\nBiden repeats call for ‘billionaire’s tax’\n\nBiden used his speech to call again for Congress to pass a so-called “billionaire’s tax,” saying some of the biggest corporations in the country are raking in billions of dollars in profits but paying no federal income taxes.\n\n“That’s simply not fair,” he said.\n\nBiden did not spell out the specifics of his proposal. But in the past, he has called for a 20% levy on households with a net worth of more than $100 million.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nWhat are the tax brackets?:What are the 2022 US federal tax brackets? What are the new 2023 tax brackets? Answers here\n\nBiden calls climate crisis ‘an existential threat’\n\nBiden said “the climate crisis doesn't care if you're in a red or blue state” as he touted his administration’s work to take on what he called “an existential threat.”\n\nHe pointed to the Inflation Reduction Act, which included the largest climate package ever, and investments from his infrastructure law.\n\nHe later went off-script, saying, “We’re still going to need oil and gas for a while.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nUN Secretary-General::'No more baby steps' on climate change\n\nBiden to Congress: Continue insurance subsidies that lowered uninsured rates\n\nBiden celebrated the fact that a record number of Americans have health insurance while calling on Congress to continue expanded insurance subsidies that helped boost that rate.\n\nThose enhanced subsidies for people who purchase insurance on their own, instead of getting coverage from the government or an employer, expire after 2025.\n\n“Let’s finish the job and make the savings permanent,” Biden said as he also called for extending expanded Medicaid coverage to all states.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nBiden takes made in America a step further\n\nBiden touted American manufacturing gains and a campaign promise to move more production to the U.S. from foreign countries. Biden then announced, “new standards to require all construction materials used in federal infrastructure projects to be made in America.”\n\n“American-made lumber, glass, drywall, fiber optic cables,” he said. “And on my watch, American roads, American bridges, and American highways will be made with American products.”\n\nBiden’s message echoes former President Donald Trump’s prior State of the Union addresses where he boasted about initiatives to bring back manufacturing jobs that have been lost over the years.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nInsulin costs:Medicare caps insulin costs at $35 a month. Can Biden get that price for all Americans?\n\nBiden touts legislative victories in infrastructure and manufacturing\n\nBiden championed his series of legislative victories that ranged from tackling the country’s supply chain shortage and sweeping investments in domestic manufacturing and infrastructure.\n\n“We’re gonna make sure the supply chain for America begins in America,” Biden said, touting a bipartisan bill he signed that made investments to boost domestic manufacturing of semiconductors.\n\n“To maintain the strongest economy in the world, we need the best infrastructure in the world,” said Biden, pointing to the bipartisan infrastructure bill. “Folks, we’re just getting started.”\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWhy Bono is at SOTU:Here's why musician, advocate Bono is at Biden's State of the Union address\n\nBiden appeals to middle and working class people on manufacturing\n\nIn an appeal to middle class and working class people, Biden said he ran for president “to make sure the economy works for everyone” so that everyone can have pride in what they do for a living.\n\n“For decades, the middle class was hollowed out,” he said. “Too many good-paying manufacturing jobs moved overseas. Factories at home closed down. Once-thriving cities and towns that many of you represent became shadows of what they used to be.”\n\nBiden then spoke about his administration’s accomplishments in the manufacturing sector.\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nWhat is fentanyl poisoning?:These State of the Union guests lost their son to it\n\nMore:As Biden prepares 2024 reelection run, Dems worry blue-collar voters are slipping away\n\nBiden: ‘COVID no longer controls our lives’\n\nBiden said the nation’s economy is roaring back from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“Two years ago, COVID had shut down our businesses, closed our schools, and robbed us of so much,” he said. “Today, COVID no longer controls our lives.”\n\nBiden said his administration has created 12 million jobs, “more jobs created in two years than any president has ever created in four.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nA full House – literally – for State of the Union\n\nPresident Joe Biden entered a full House chamber Tuesday.\n\nThe capacity crowd included House and Senate members, current and former Supreme Court justices, family and honored guests.\n\nBiden’s first words were met with a standing ovation, as he honored Republican and Democratic leaders – but also as he described the state of the union.\n\nThe applause came from Democrats and Republicans, and the standing ovations were sometimes led by a row of powerful Senate moderates, including Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Kyrsten Sinema, who recently changed her party affiliation to independent.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nBiden: Pelosi is 'greatest speaker’ ever\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi isn’t sitting behind Biden for his address but she got a special call-out from the president anyway.\n\n“I want to give special recognition to someone who I think will be considered the greatest speaker in the history of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi,” Biden said.\n\nPelosi stepped down from Democratic leadership after the midterm elections. Biden also congratulated her successor, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the first Black American to be House minority leader.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nWhat are burn pits?:Why were burn pits used? Toxic fumes, medical risks explained.\n\nBiden begins speech telling McCarthy he looks forward to ‘working together’\n\nBiden began his remarks congratulating Kevin McCarthy, the new Republican House speaker, and saying he looks forward to “working together.”\n\nBiden also congratulated Democratic Leader Hakeem Jefferies, the first African American man to lead a party, and gave shout outs to Senate Leader Chuck Schumer, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\n“The story of America is a story of progress and resilience. Of always moving forward. Of never giving up,” Biden said.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nLabor Secretary Marty Walsh is designated survivor for 2023 State of the Union\n\nSecretary of Labor Marty Walsh is the designated survivor for this year's State of the Union address.\n\nEvery year, a top government official is chosen as the “designated survivor” as a way to maintain the presidential line of succession in case of a catastrophic event where multiple officials in the line are unable to assume office.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nMarty Walsh:Former Boston mayor Marty Walsh stepping down as Biden Labor Secretary for job with NHL union\n\nBono is at the State of the Union\n\nBono, the Irish lead singer of U2, is attending the State of the Union as a guest of first lady Jill Biden.\n\nBono is a longtime social justice advocate who co-founded the nonprofit ONE Campaign to address poverty and preventable diseases and Prouct RED to address HIV and AIDS in Africa.\n\nHe’s sitting next to Paul Pelosi, husband of former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nWhat is fentanyl poisoning?:These State of the Union guests lost their son to it\n\n2 Californians will sit behind Biden\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy may not share a political party. But they do have something in common. Both are from California.\n\nThat gave them at least one thing to talk about as they stood on the rostrum, waiting for Biden’s speech to begin.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nBiden gets a Supreme Court majority for speech, if not policies\n\nAt least for tonight, President Joe Biden landed a majority of the Supreme Court.\n\nFive sitting Supreme Court justices stepped into the House chamber before the president’s remarks: Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justices Elena Kagan, Brett Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett and Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nThat’s a decent turnout for an event some current and former justices have derided as a “political pep rally” and a “childish spectacle.”\n\nWhether the president can cobble together a majority for any of his policies pending at the court – on immigration, student loan debt relief or environmental rules – remains to be seen.\n\n– John Fritze\n\nBiden to get bipartisan escort into House chamber\n\nBiden will be escorted into the House chamber by a bipartisan group of House and Senate officials, including Senate leaders Chuck Schumer, D-NY, and Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nFace masks uncommon as pre-pandemic normality returns\n\nFew lawmakers were wearing face masks as they filed onto the House floor for Biden’s State of the Union speech.\n\nAnd unlike last year, members of Congress were allowed to bring guests, a return to pre-pandemic normality.\n\n“Today, COVID no longer controls our lives,” Biden will declare, according to speech excerpts the White House released in advance.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nState of the economy:A look at economy's strengths, weaknesses as Biden sets to boast of record job growth in State of Union\n\nBiden arrives at Capitol\n\nBiden’s motorcade arrived at the Capitol at 8:40 p.m. ahead of his 9 p.m. State of the Union speech.\n\n“Great shape, getting better,” Biden said when a reporter asked him, “What’s the state of the union?” before he departed the White House.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\n5 big questions for Biden's speech:Is he running? 5 big questions Joe Biden will answer in the State of the Union\n\nPoll: Republicans want GOP leaders to 'stand up’ to Biden\n\nIf Biden doesn’t find a receptive audience to his call for the two parties to work together, Republican voters could be the reason.\n\nMost Republicans (64%) want GOP congressional leaders to “stand up” to Biden on matters important to GOP, even if that makes it harder to address critical problems facing the country, according to recent polling from the Pew Research Center.\n\nAnd more are concerned that GOP lawmakers won’t focus enough on investigating the administration than the share worried that they will focus too much on investigations.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nState of the Union guests:Lawmakers highlight policing, abortion, wrongful imprisonment\n\nBiden approval rating hovering in low 40s ahead of speech\n\nBiden’s second State of the Union address Tuesday comes as he remains under water politically, with more than half of voters disapproving of his job performance, according to most polls.\n\nA Washington Post-ABC poll released this week found 42% of voters approve of Biden’s job performance, while 53% disapprove. That closely matches the FiveThirtyEight average of polls.\n\nBiden’s job performance has stayed below since August 2021 in most polls. Even more troubling for Biden, most Americans can’t identify his achievements. Sixty-two percent of Americans said Biden has accomplished \"not very much\" or “little or nothing,\" in the same Washington Post-ABC News poll, while only 36% said he has accomplished \"a great deal\" or \"a good amount.\"\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nWhat to watch for:The State of the Union is Tuesday: Here's what you can expect from Joe Biden's speech\n\nVice President Kamala Harris chats with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy ahead of speech\n\nVice President Kamala Harris shook hands with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, and the two chatted, as they stood behind the rostrum waiting for Biden to enter the House chamber.\n\nThis will be the first State of the Union with McCarthy as speaker since Republicans took control of the House during the midterm elections.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nBiden heads to the Capitol\n\nBiden left the White House at 8:30 p.m. en route to the Capitol. Vice President Kamala Harris arrived ahead of him along with the majority of his Cabinet.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nPaul Pelosi arrives at State of the Union\n\nPaul Pelosi, the 82-year-old husband of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, arrived at the State of the Union about 8:30 p.m. Tuesday.\n\nThis marks his first visit to a joint session of Congress since a video release of a brutal October attack that left him with head and hand injuries requiring surgery.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nLawmakers arrive for State of the Union\n\nIf handshakes across the aisle are any reliable indication, there was a hint of bipartisanship in the air as lawmakers arrived for President Joe Biden’s first State of the Union before a divided Congress.\n\nThere was also the smell of cigars in the House gallery hallways on the third floor, a sign of the changing guard and new House rules.\n\nSeveral guests and congresswomen were wearing white, as a nod to the suffragettes. That included Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who despite earlier posts did not bring a white balloon into the chamber to troll Biden about what she describes as a delayed response in taking down the Chinese spy balloon.\n\n- Candy Woodall\n\nBiden traveling to Wisconsin and Florida after speech\n\nBiden administration officials will hit the road this week, holding events in at least 20 states to highlight parts of the president’s message.\n\nBiden himself will talk about his economic agenda in Wisconsin Wednesday and will discuss Social Security and Medicare in Florida Thursday.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is heading to Georgia and Minnesota. Multiple other cabinet members are also fanning out across the country.\n\n- Maureen Groppe\n\nHow would Biden’s billionaire tax work?\n\nTonight Biden will resurface his plan to levy more taxes on the ultra-wealthy. But how would that work?\n\nUnder the current tax system, you don’t have to pay taxes on assets like stocks, homes and artwork that can appreciate over time until you sell it. But if you hold onto them until you die, you won’t have to pay any taxes. And on top of that, heirs that inherit your assets won’t have to pay taxes if they sell them.\n\nThe Biden Administration refers to this as a tax loophole, as billionaires benefit the most since they’re more likely than working-class Americans to get compensated via stocks or other assets that appreciate over time or inherit them.\n\nTo end the practice, Biden is proposing “minimum income tax” on American households worth more than $100 million. His plan calls for the wealthiest Americans to pay a tax rate of at least 20% on their full income, including unrealized gains from assets that have increased in value since their purchase.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nTaxing billionaires:Should the wealthy pay taxes on expensive art and wine? Joe Biden thinks so. Here's how it would work\n\nOcasio-Cortez lays out expectations for Biden’s speech, working with Republicans\n\nAhead of Biden’s address, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D.-N.Y., said she’s hoping to “hear a really strong vision” from Biden and explained how Democrats and Republicans could find common ground after the GOP gained control of the House during the midterm elections.\n\nThe New York lawmaker told CNN she hopes to hear “about not just what we've done so far, but also our plans on executing on the enormous bills and successes that we've had in the last one to two years,\" saying “There still is implementation and execution on these plans to address our priorities around climate, taxing the rich and so much more.”\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nBiden's 'finish the job' call in State of the Union echoes FDR\n\nHistorian Michael Beschloss hears echoes of Franklin D. Roosevelt in Biden’s State of the Union address.\n\nBiden will call on Republicans to work with him to “finish the job” of rebuilding the economy and uniting the country, according to excerpts of the speech released by the White House.\n\n“Finish the job” was used as a rationale for FDR's reelection, Beschloss tweeted about the phrase’s historical lineage. It was also a slogan for the World War I effort. And in a famous radio address during World War II, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill vowed to “finish the job.”\n\nAt the start of Biden’s administration, many comparisons – not all of them favorable – were made between the size and scope of Biden’s ambitions, Roosevelt’s programs and the World War II spending that lifted the nation out of the Great Depression.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders: Biden is more interested in 'woke fantasies' than concerns of everyday Americans\n\nIn delivering the Republican response to the State of the Union, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sander plans to attack Biden and the Democrats over a panoply of issues that include inflation, taxes, education and so-called \"culture wars.\"\n\n\"And while you reap the consequences of their failures, the Biden administration seems more interested in woke fantasies than the hard reality Americans face every day,\" Sanders plans to say, according to speech excerpts released by her office.\n\nAnother excerpt: \"Most Americans simply want to live their lives in freedom and peace, but we are under attack in a left-wing culture war we didn’t start and never wanted to fight.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nState of the Union guests:Lawmakers highlight policing, abortion, wrongful imprisonment\n\nHow long does the State of the Union last? What it will take for Biden to set a SOTU record\n\nBiden’s first State of the Union address in 2022 was somewhere between the longest and shortest speeches ever given, according to The American Presidency Project. Will he keep his second address tonight short and sweet, or will he be long-winded?\n\nIf he intendeds to break the record for the shortest speech ever, he’d have it keep it under 28 minutes and 55 seconds. That was the time Richard Nixon took to deliver his address in 1972. To beat the longest address ever, he’d have to outdo his fellow Democrat former President Bill Clinton, who went on for 1 hour, 28 minutes and 40 seconds for his final State of the Union speech in 2000. Clinton also claims the spot for the second longest address, clocking in at 1 hour, 24 minutes and 58 seconds in 1995.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nBiden to promise investment in ‘places and people that have been forgotten’\n\nBiden will spend part of his address promoting his economic plan and assuring Americans that he wants to invest in “places and people that have been forgotten.”\n\nAmid the economic upheaval of the past four decades, too many people have been left behind or treated like they’re invisible, he will say, according to excerpts of the speech released by the White House.\n\n“Maybe that’s you watching at home,” Biden will say. “You remember the jobs that went away. And you wonder whether a path even exists anymore for you and your children to get ahead without moving away. I get it. That’s why we’re building an economy where no one is left behind. Jobs are coming back, pride is coming back because of the choices we made in the last two years. This is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America and make a real difference in your lives.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nBiden to praise recovery from Jan. 6 riot, COVID\n\nPresident Joe Biden will say “the story of America is a story of progress and resilience” in his State of the Union address as he touts a rebounding economy, COVID-19 recovery and democracy that survived the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol attack, according to excerpts of the speech provided by the White House.\n\nBiden will tout 12 million new jobs created under his presidency – many that came back following the pandemic – to claim economic progress. And he will reflect on a period two years ago when businesses and schools closed at the height of the pandemic.\n\n“Today, COVID no longer controls our lives,” Biden plans to say. “And two years ago, our democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil War. Today, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nBiden to ask Republicans to work with him in SOTU speech\n\nPresident Joe Biden will make a plea to Republicans in Congress to work with him. He said after the November elections that Americans sent a divided Congress to Washington because they want them to work together.\n\n“The people sent us a clear message,” Biden will say, according to excerpts released from the White House. “Fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict, gets us nowhere.”\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nWhy Sen. Patty Murray and other lawmakers will be wearing crayons at State of the Union\n\nWashington Sen. Patty Murray and some of her Democratic colleagues will be wearing crayon pins to President Joe Biden's State of the Union address Tuesday to signal their support for greater investments in child care. Such care now costs more than $10,000 a year on average, and roughly half of Americans live in a child care desert. Insufficient child care takes a toll on America's economy, recent research shows, costing taxpayers $122 billion annually.\n\nPartisan gridlock has prevented progress on major child care reforms, such as Murray's Child Care for Working Families Act, which would generally cap child care expenses at 7% of a family's household income. Biden, who alluded to that cap in his last State of the Union, has also struggled to gain traction on his child care proposals.\n\n– Alia Wong\n\nLawmakers to highlight key social issues through guests\n\nTuesday night’s State of the Union address will be the first year since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic where lawmakers are allowed to bring their own guests. As part of tradition, lawmakers tend to invite guests that draw attention to issues important to them.\n\nSeveral Democratic lawmakers have invited guests to champion abortion access such as Roslyn Roger Collins, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Metropolitan New Jersey, who will attend the address alongside Rep. Bob Mendendez, D-N.J., according to Planned Parenthood.\n\nIn the wake of the brutal beating and subsequent death of Tyre Nichols in Memphis, Tennessee, members of the Congressional Black Caucus are bringing guests who have been impacted by police violence. House Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has invited Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, who died at the hands of a New York police officer in 2014.\n\n– Christine Fernando and Ken Tran\n\nRepublican response: Sarah Huckabee Sanders follows in historic footsteps with her State of the Union response\n\nArkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders is the first former White House press secretary to deliver a formal State of the Union response – she is not, however, the first governor of Arkansas to do the honors.\n\nBack in 1985, the Democrats picked a young governor of Arkansas to deliver their response to President Ronald Reagan.\n\nHis name? Bill Clinton ... then-future President Bill Clinton.\n\nSanders will give the Republican rebuttal after Biden's speech.\n\n– David Jackson\n\n5 big questions for the SOTU:Is he running? 5 big questions Joe Biden will answer in the State of the Union\n\nBiden and China: Spy balloon likely to be addressed\n\nThe speech is a chance for Biden to respond to those who have criticized how he handled the suspected Chinese spy balloon that drifted over the United States last week – and to send a public message to China. Republicans have accused Biden of showing weakness by not shooting down the balloon sooner.\n\nTensions have been rising with China, which the U.S. considers its biggest strategic and economic competitor. The nations have clashed over Taiwan, technology, human rights, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and other disputes.\n\nThe Biden administration has been trying to stabilize the relationship, building what it’s called “guardrails” as it normalizes interaction. But one effort to do that – sending Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China – was postponed because of the balloon incident.\n\n– Maureen Groppe and Michael Collins\n\nIntel chair: China balloon flew over nuke sites\n\nBiden to lay out 'forceful approach’ to combatting fentanyl\n\nThe Biden administration will launch a national campaign to educate young people on the dangers of fentanyl, part of the “forceful approach” for going after fentanyl trafficking and reducing overdose deaths.\n\nOther steps include:\n\nUsing new large-scale scanners to improve efforts to stop fentanyl from being brought into the U.S. through the southern border.\n\nWorking with package delivery companies to catch more packages containing fentanyl from being shipped around the country.\n\nWorking with Congress to make permanent a temporary tool that that’s helped federal agents crack down on drugs chemically similar to fentanyl.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\n5 big questions on Biden's speech:Is he running? 5 big questions Joe Biden will answer in the State of the Union\n\nBiden to plug job market as recession looms\n\nPresident Joe Biden is expected to take credit for a booming job market and easing inflation when he speaks to the nation Tuesday night.\n\nBut he’ll likely leave out a litany of trouble spots, including a slumping housing market, a monthslong manufacturing downturn and elevated recession risk this year. Meanwhile, inflation is still high and economists pin at least some of the blame on Biden for showering Americans with cash in early 2021 while the economy was already healing.\n\n– Paul Davidson\n\nState of the economy:A look at economy's strengths, weaknesses as Biden sets to boast of record job growth in State of Union\n\nWho is Sarah Huckabee Sanders? Arkansas governor to giver Republican response to Biden's State of the Union address\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders, one-time White House press secretary for former President Trump and current governor of Arkansas, will deliver the Republican rebuttal to Biden’s State of the Union address tonight.\n\nSanders, the youngest governor in the U.S., hails from a prominent political family. Her father Mike Huckabee was the 44th governor of Arkansas, serving from 1996 to 2007 before launching an unsuccessful presidential bid during the 2008 election. The younger Sanders has since cut out her own place in GOP politics, emerging as one of the more high-profile members of the Trump administration.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nBono, Tyre Nichols’ family members among guests sitting with first lady Jill Biden Tuesday night\n\nThe lead singer for the rock group U2, Bono, and Ukraine’s ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, are among the White House guests attending President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address Tuesday.\n\nGuests are chosen to highlight themes of the president’s speech or because they represent his policy initiatives.\n\nBono is the cofounder of the ONE campaign to fight poverty and preventable diseases, and (RED), which fights HIV/AIDS in Africa. Other guests who will be sitting with first lady Jill Biden during the speech include:\n\nThe mother and stepfather of Tyre Nichols, the 29-year-old Black man who died after being beaten by Memphis police officers.\n\nBrandon Tsay, the man who disarmed the Monterey Park gunman who killed 11 people and injured 10 others during a Lunar New Year celebration.\n\nA Texas woman who almost died because doctors were concerned that intervening when her pregnancy ran into difficulties would violate the state’s abortion ban.\n\nOne of the Massachusetts same-sex couples who sued the state for the right to marry in 2001.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nWhat to expect from tonight's speech:Here's what you can expect from Joe Biden's speech\n\nBiden's speech comes amid job gains\n\nOne accomplishment Biden is sure to bring up tonight is the level of job gains under his presidency. Since he took office the unemployment rate went from 6.3% to 3.4%, per the latest jobs data.\n\nDespite recession fears and massive tech layoffs, U.S. employers added 517,000 new jobs last month, well exceeding economists' expectations of around 180,000 new jobs.\n\nThe blowout jobs report paved the way for the Federal Reserve to pass more rate hikes aimed at lowering inflation, Fed Chairman Powell said in remarks he delivered earlier today. But the rate hikes could push the economy closer to a recession, which the central bank has avoided so far.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nBiden’s student loan forgiveness plan remains stalled\n\nBiden has yet to fulfill his campaign promise of canceling at least $10,000 in student loan debt. Last year he unveiled a plan to make good on his promise.\n\nHowever the plan is being stalled by legal challenges. Six states – Nebraska, Missouri, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas and South Carolina – formed a coalition to fight the proposal. They argue that canceling student loan debt extends beyond the administration’s legal authority.\n\nThe Supreme Court is set to hear arguments for the case later this month. The Biden administration claims it is well within their legal realm to proceed with its plan. It cannot do so unless the Court rules in its favor, however.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nStock market under Biden\n\nSince President Joe Biden took office in January 2021, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 10%. Last year the index fell into a bear market, meaning it dropped 20% below a market peak set last January.\n\nDuring former President Donald Trump's time in office, the Dow gained 56%. That represents an annualized gain of close to 12%, one of the best stock market performances under a Republican president according to data from LPL Financial.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nWhat time is the State of the Union speech tonight?\n\nBiden’s State of the Union speech is Tuesday at 9 p.m. EST.\n\nHow to stream the SOTU\n\nThe speech will be livestreamed by USA TODAY.\n\nWho is the designated survivor tonight?\n\nThe State of the Union address, delivered to a joint session of Congress and a crowd that includes all nine Supreme Court justices, poses a unique scenario in which every key member of the nation’s leadership is in one room.\n\nThat makes it both a momentous affair, and a significant national security risk.

Friday's ruling also struck down a 2010 law that allowed the disabled or residents stationed outside of Delaware to be permanently registered as absentee voters.\n\nThe ruling follows a 2022 decision by the state's Supreme Court that struck down lawmakers' recent efforts to allow anyone registered to vote to cast a ballot by mail and to allow people to register to vote up until Election Day.\n\nREAD MORE: Delaware lawmakers consider options after court tosses out early voting, mail-in ballots\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nCoupled together, the rulings effectively undercut most of lawmakers' major achievements to modernize Delaware's voting regime in recent years. In the last election, 56,000 Delawareans used early voting, according to Department of Elections data.\n\nRoughly 21,000 voters used permanent absentee ballots. Those people include veterans, the disabled and caregivers, Jennings said. She noted that 46 other states allow early voting and 25 others have \"stronger permanent absentee protections than we do.\"\n\n\"That is shameful,\" she said.\n\nVoting reform efforts head back to Supreme Court\n\nLike the 2022 ruling, Friday's ruling found that recent voting law changes by lawmakers ran afoul of provisions in the Delaware Constitution that prescribe how and when elections are to take place.\n\nFriday's ruling was issued by a Superior Court judge so attorneys under Jennings will appeal the ruling to the Delaware Supreme Court.\n\nJennings said her office will seek a court order pausing the Superior Court decision and will request a decision on the appeal in time for voters to have clarity about the administration of September's state primary elections.\n\nFriday's ruling pertains only to the state's general elections. Whether or not the appeal is successful, Jennings said her office will be in discussions with State Election Commissioner Anthony Albence regarding the \"logistics\" of September's primary.\n\nApril's presidential primary not affected\n\nJennings noted that the April 2 presidential primary will not be affected by the recent ruling.\n\nShe said absentee ballots will go out soon to those registered to vote absentee permanently and that the state will host early voting locations ahead of the primary.\n\nEarly voting is scheduled to begin March 20 for that primary.\n\nHere's a list of relevant dates ahead of that election.\n\nAG urges lawmakers to make constitutional changes\n\nWhile Jennings noted her intent to appeal the decision, she called on lawmakers to amend Delaware's constitution to cure the issues the court used to strike down the expansion of the state's voting methods.\n\nThere is currently one constitutional amendment pending General Assembly consideration that would address the expansion of voting by mail struck down in the 2022 court decision.\n\nConstitutional amendments must be approved in two successive General Assemblies and require a two-thirds majority for passage, meaning any effort to approve the first leg of a constitutional amendment this year will require some Republican support in the state's House of Representatives.\n\nOn Monday, Republican lawmakers also said they intend to introduce a constitutional amendment to address early voting. The lawsuits that saw the courts strike down the voting provisions were filed and backed by Republican interests in the state.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have said their dispute with Delaware's recent expansion of voting availability derives from how the law changes conflict with the text of the state's constitution and not the concept itself.\n\nJennings criticized the \"extremists\" that filed the lawsuits leading to the courts' decisions, linking local Republican lawmakers to a wave of right-wing pushback against voting expansion fueled by former President Donald Trump's unfounded efforts to delegitimize the country's election regimes following his 2020 loss to President Joe Biden.\n\nRepublican lawmakers largely supported a proposed constitutional amendment expanding voting availability in 2019, but none voted for the second leg of the constitutional amendment in 2021.\n\nContact Xerxes Wilson at (302) 324-2787 or xwilson@delawareonline.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/12/20/why-new-york-judges-decision-sackers-matters-delaware/8938571002/", "title": "Why a New York judge's decision about the Sackers matters to ...", "text": "While hundreds of Delaware residents died from opioid overdoses, the Sackler family and Purdue Pharma – the company responsible for creating and manufacturing the popular painkiller OxyContin – profited by the billions.\n\nIt's a storyline that many have been reminded of with the recent release of Hulu's \"Dopesick,\" which brought renewed attention to both the people who suffered from addiction, as well as the family behind creating and selling this addictive drug.

The Democrats had publicly declared victory before 10:30 p.m. Tuesday.\n\nThese results also mean that every statewide race in Delaware was won by a female Democrat, including U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester. (Every other Republican candidate, besides Greg Coverdale who ran for state treasurer, was also a woman.)\n\nAt the Democratic Party watch party in downtown Wilmington, Gov. John Carney and other elected officials like Lt. Gov. Bethany Hall-Long praised the representation of women among these races.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n“We call this the woman wave,” Carney said.\n\nIn an interview, Blunt Rochester said she was \"humbled, honored and pumped\" to be among the women who won their elections.\n\n\"Just being on the campaign trail and being with these women who are more than qualified, that have lived and work experience and brought integrity to the process,\" Blunt Rochester said. \"It was easy for me to lead this ticket because they were incredible.\"\n\nHere’s more of what happened in the state auditor, attorney general and treasurer races on Tuesday, and a few key things to know about each one.\n\nDelaware attorney general\n\nIn the attorney general election, Democrat incumbent Kathy Jennings will keep her seat with 53.8% of the votes compared with her Republican opponent Julianne Murray’s 46.2%.\n\nThroughout her term, Jennings has been known to take strong political stances on often contentious issues like reproductive rights. When Seaford attempted to pass an ordinance that critics claimed would limit abortion access after a Planned Parenthood clinic recently opened in the city, Jennings issued a scathing statement and sued Seaford on behalf of the Department of Justice.\n\nAs the top law enforcement officer in the state, Jennings also commented on the conviction of the former state auditor, stating that “abuse of office will not be tolerated in Delaware.”\n\nIn declaring victory late Tuesday night, Jennings returned to some of these top issues like gun reform legislation and reproductive rights. As she highlighted the successes of her previous term, the polarization of national politics shined through, too:\n\n\"Most of all, we fought, during the Trump administration and after, the 'big lie,' and we stood up for people everywhere, and we will always tell you the truth,\" Jennings said.\n\nCONVICTION:State Auditor Kathy McGuiness sentenced for public corruption convictions\n\nThis is the second time that Murray has taken on a Democrat incumbent in a statewide office after losing the governor race to Carney in 2020. The Georgetown attorney’s campaign in the last election cycle came after she sued Carney’s administration earlier that year over its short-term rental ban.\n\nVOTE BY MAIL:Delaware Supreme Court finds vote by mail, same-day registration unconstitutional\n\nIn this year’s attorney general race, Murray pointed to that lawsuit, as well as another one in which she sued to force the General Assembly to resume meeting in person in 2021. More recently, Murray won the state Supreme Court ruling that struck down vote-by-mail legislation.\n\nPresenting herself as a candidate who “backs the blue,” Murray was also endorsed by the Delaware Fraternal Order of Police and watched the results come in at the Delaware State Trooper’s Association Headquarters in Cheswold.\n\nState auditor\n\nIn the only statewide race where an incumbent wasn’t up for reelection, Democrat candidate Lydia York came out on top. Unofficial results showed York received 54.2% of the votes over her opponent Republican Janice Lorrah with 45.8% of the votes.\n\nFollowing the conviction and later sentencing of former State Auditor Kathy McGuiness, York’s platform focused on restoring the office to its “proper functioning,” and Lorrah similarly promised to bring integrity and transparency to the position.\n\nWhile visiting polling locations and volunteers, York told Delaware Online/The News Journal that her top priority will be to stabilize and enhance the office of the state auditor.\n\n\"We're going to do the work that's required of this office,\" she said. \"Not just the prior administration, but even prior, all the work wasn't getting done.\"\n\nELECTION DAY 2022:Amid busy polls, residents and candidates say every vote counts\n\nThat means providing people with the information they need, York said. For example, she said she met with tenants of a high-rise building who knew that millions of dollars were allocated to improvements in their building, but they didn't know where that money went.\n\n\"You should be able to see $9.5 million of improvements or maintenance, even for that matter,\" York said. \"So that's how this office can help the people. And I think that's what's been missing for a while.\"\n\nLorrah took a different approach than her opponent by touting her ability to challenge the government, pointing to a moment earlier this year when she filed and won a lawsuit against the governor for extending mask mandates in public and private schools.\n\nUltimately, York – who was backed by the Democratic Party even in the primaries – will likely become the state’s next auditor.\n\nWhen introducing York at the Democratic Party watch party in Wilmington, Carney thanked York for stepping forward and running for office.\n\nState treasurer\n\nIncumbent Colleen Davis secured her seat with 53.6% of the votes, according to unofficial election results; her opponent Greg Coverdale was behind her with 46.4%.\n\nDavis' campaign leaned on her experience as treasurer, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic when her office was charged with overseeing the distribution of federal funding. Some of the issues that Davis has focused on include strengthening state workers' retirement plans and supporting Delaware's students by expanding college savings accounts.\n\nSTATE RETIREMENT PLAN:Delaware officials change course, revert to old health plan for state retirees\n\nCoverdale worked to appeal to voters on both sides of the political spectrum through his professional experience in finance, having worked with major companies like Morgan Stanley, TD Ameritrade and Merrill Lynch.\n\nIn campaign conversations about the fiscal health of Delaware, Coverdale talked about ensuring that Medicare is adequately funded so Delawareans can get the health care they need.\n\nStaff reporter Meredith Newman contributed to this reporting.\n\nEmily Lytle covers Sussex County from the inland towns to the beaches, with a focus on health-related issues.

By the time polls closed at 8 p.m., more than 320,000 votes had been cast statewide.\n\nAbout 77,000 of those came from early voting.\n\nWhile the election is an important one nationally with Republicans expected to take control of the U.S. House of Representatives ‒ as of 11 p.m. Tuesday, it remained a tossup which party will control the U.S. Senate ‒ races in the First State this year were largely uncontroversial.\n\nThis differed from the 2020 election, where a Delaware man was vying for the presidency and Lauren Witzke attempted to unseat U.S. Sen.

Lisa Blunt Rochester, Attorney General Kathy Jennings and State Treasurer Colleen Davis all won by at least seven percentage points on Tuesday, and Democrat Lydia York was elected as state auditor, according to the state elections website.\n\nWhile every lawmaker in the General Assembly was up for reelection this year due to redistricting, the political makeup of Delaware's legislature didn't change much.\n\n“With Delaware such a blue state, there may be some insulation for a lot of these races,” Paul Brewer, a University of Delaware political science professor, told Delaware Online/The News Journal ahead of Tuesday.\n\nDelaware Online/The News Journal kept track of election happenings in the First State on Tuesday:\n\nWHERE TO FIND ELECTION RESULTS:2022 Delaware Election Results\n\nDemocratic Kent County Sheriff loses to Republican opponent\n\nKent County Democratic Sheriff Brian Lewis was upset by his Republican challenger in a three-way race on Tuesday, according to the state election website.\n\nNorman Barlow received about 53% of the vote.

John Carney and other elected officials, including Lt. Gov.

Cox has also promoted the former president’s lies about the election. During the insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021, Cox tweeted that Vice President Mike Pence was a “traitor.”\n\nMoore’s victory flips a governor’s office from Republican to Democratic.\n\nMaryland voters also voted to legalize marijuana for those 21 and older on Tuesday. It's now the 20th state to legalize week for adult use.\n\nAssociated Press calls Delaware U.S. House race for incumbent\n\nLisa Blunt Rochester will serve a fourth term as Delaware's lone representative in the U.S. House after defeating Republican Lee Murphy in Tuesday's election.\n\nBlunt Rochester, who became Delaware's first federal representative of color and first woman in Congress in 2016, was the projected winner as polls closed in Delaware.\n\nThe Congresswoman billed herself to voters as a problem solver invested in her community and someone who can find common ground with opponents. Among her legislative priorities are reversing climate change and providing affordable health care. She also campaigned on codifying abortion rights and hailed her role in passing the Inflation Reduction Act, which she says will help Delaware families by lowering prescription drug prices and energy costs.\n\n— Brandon Holveck\n\nPolls close in Delaware, elsewhere across the country\n\nPolls in Delaware and elsewhere nationwide closed at 8 p.m., though as of 8:20 p.m., only Delaware early votes (both absentee and in-person) had been reported.\n\nThe early votes show U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester clinching the seat as expected, with 66% of the early vote. Her Republican opponent, Lee Murphy, received 33% of early votes.\n\nIn a similar percentage breakdown, incumbent Attorney General Kathy Jennings received 64% of the early vote while Republican Julianne Murray received 36%.\n\nState auditor Democratic candidate Lydia York is leading over her Republican opponent Janice Lorrah in early voting, 65% to 35%, respectively.\n\nState auditor candidate makes her rounds on Tuesday, some voting machines acting up\n\nBefore stopping by the Skyline Middle School polling location, Democratic candidate for state auditor Lydia York visited one of the Delaware Democrats offices in Pike Creek to thank volunteers who were running the phones Tuesday.\n\nYork said while she is still anxious to know the results, she’s been encouraged by the high voter turnout as she visited polling sites up and down the state.\n\nThat turnout was represented at the nearby Skyline Middle School, where candidates and volunteers said they saw lines extending along the sidewalk until about 11 a.m. The wait time could be about an hour at its longest Tuesday morning, but voters were in and out quickly around 4:30 p.m.\n\nMorgan Wright, an intern with Common Cause Delaware ‒ which leads the Election Protection Program to make sure everyone can vote without any barriers ‒ said the morning backup was due in part to technical difficulties. When someone touched a candidate’s name on the screen, it would highlight a different name. Usually that name was under the same party, Wright said, but navigating that technical challenge still resulted in some delays.\n\nWright and volunteer Christine DeBrabander will stay at Skyline until the polls close at 8 p.m. to ensure everyone can vote and the doors stay open until closing time.\n\nOne of the voters who showed up at Skyline as dusk was arriving was Adam Woo, who said he's been bringing his children with him to vote since they were newborns.\n\nHe always comes out to vote, but politics today have especially motivated him to vote Democrat.\n\n“The Republican Party has just gone full fascist and, whether you're leftist or liberal, you have to just fight that. So it's not about any issues anymore,” he said.\n\n— Emily Lytle\n\nWhat to watch for in New Castle County\n\nThe two legislative races to keep an eye on in New Castle County are the county sheriff and county council District 2 positions.\n\nVying for sheriff are incumbent Scott Philips, a Democrat, and non-partisan affiliate John Machurek.\n\nMachurek previously ran as a libertarian candidate for governor in 2020, Delaware attorney general in 2014 and for District 16 of the state House of Representatives in 2012. Machurek lost all of the races in landslide numbers.\n\nPhillips has served as New Castle County Sheriff since 2019. Prior to being elected, he had 13 years of experience as deputy sheriff and another 10 years in law enforcement with New Castle County police as a patrol officer and detective.\n\nIn the New Castle County Council District 2 race, Republican Jamie Collins is challenging Democratic incumbent Dee Durham.\n\nDurham has held the seat since 2018. A long-standing conservationist, the Democrat has sponsored legislative action aimed at getting Delaware closer to its energy goals, including requiring new homes in New Castle County to be equipped with electric vehicle charging infrastructure.\n\nAccording to Collins’ website, the Republican challenger is running on a campaign advocating for job creation and projects to “energize the County” while respecting the environment. Collins also plans to propose a resolution for the state to begin capturing revenue from online sports gambling.\n\nCollins is known partly for his late father, Richard T. Collins. The elder Collins was elected state auditor in 1974 and New Castle County Executive in 1980.\n\n— Molly McVety\n\nResidents reiterate: Voting is 'our civic duty'\n\nA slow but steady trickle of voters came out to cast their ballots at the Route 9 Library and Innovation Center in New Castle on Tuesday.\n\n\"It's our civic duty and it's necessary, especially with what's going on in our country today,\" one voter said.\n\nDionne Daniels, 47, felt this urgency when she came out to vote. She hasn't voted in a general election since Barack Obama was on the ballot, but said it's important now that she makes her voice heard.\n\nDaniels said Delawareans should come out to vote, even though it's not a presidential election. If not, someone may be elected who doesn't look out for \"everyone's best interests.\"\n\nAt the nearby polling place of DeLaWarr State Service Center, one Black voter said she's casting her ballot because \"our people died for it.\"\n\nBoth the library and the state service center had lines of paint or tape in the parking lot 50 feet away from the doors. Non-voters, including pollsters, media or potential voter intimidators, had to stay behind them. However, no one else was waiting outside.\n\nIn Elsmere, it was relatively quiet outside the fire hall and Baltz Elementary School, but a small and contingent of individuals streamed into and out of Town Hall.\n\nAfter voting, Abar Brown walked out with a look of determination and a message: “Everybody needs to vote today.”\n\nWas there any particular issue that concerned the seven-year resident of the town? No, just everything that is making headlines, including abortion, he said.\n\nBrittany Christian, 37, moved to Elsmere almost a year ago from Philadelphia and said she was voting to have a voice.\n\n\"I don't want to be in the position where I'm complaining about things going on around me, but not actively participating and making it better,\" she said. \"I'm not really one to complain, but I love to do my part. I'm just excited to participate.”\n\n— Hannah Edelman and Anitra Johnson\n\nNearly 200,000 votes cast by midday Tuesday\n\nAs of 12:30 p.m. on Election Day, 195,955 Delawareans had voted in the election, with 116,549 people voting in person on Tuesday, according to state officials.\n\nSo far, New Castle County, the most populated county in Delaware, is leading the number of people who have cast ballots. Registered Democrats are also outpacing their Republican counterparts. So far, 51,262 registered Democrats have voted compared to 42,843 Republicans.\n\nNearly 77,000 ballots were cast during early voting in Delaware, according to election data.\n\nElection officials reported that 76,977 Delawareans voted from Oct. 28 to Nov. 6 – both in the form of absentee ballot and in-person early voting. This makes up roughly 10% of registered voters.\n\nThis is the first election in which the state allowed for early voting. A total of 55,532 ballots were cast in person during this voting period, with the most taking place in Sussex County. Democrats also outnumbered Republicans by about 12,000 votes.\n\nThe only option available to Delawareans is to vote in person, either early or on Election Day, or vote by absentee ballot. In order to vote absentee, a resident must provide a valid excuse as to why they cannot vote in person.\n\nEarlier this fall, the Delaware Supreme Court found voting by mail and registering to vote on Election Day to be unconstitutional. Both of these were previously allowed during the primary in September but are now no longer options for Delawareans.\n\nUnlike other states, Delaware is expected to tally its votes quickly. In the 2020 election, results were first reported about 15 minutes after polls closed. About 90% of results were in by 10:15 p.m., according to the Associated Press.\n\nElection officials can start counting absentee ballots the Friday before Election Day, but the state cannot release counts until after the polls close at 8 p.m. on Tuesday.\n\n— Meredith Newman\n\nSussex County voter turns heads in military truck\n\nVoters trickled in steadily at Georgetown Elementary School around noon on Tuesday, with at least one making a head-turning entrance.\n\nTim Collard of Milton pulled up to the location in a military truck with flags that said \"Biden Sucks\" and \"Trump 2024.\" He said he bought it from a government surplus sale.\n\n\"It's been in parades but it's also a work truck, sort of,\" Collard said. \"At least I tell my wife that.\"\n\nAlso voting at Georgetown Elementary – though for the other party – was 69-year-old Michael Makowski, who said he feels the country is at a \"crossroads.\"\n\n\"We can either take the bad route and become more authoritarian or try to maintain the democracy we have,\" Makowski said. \"I voted Democratic because I think the Democrats are more concerned with preserving the democracy than Republicans.\"\n\nThe future of the country was also top-of-mind for voters in Brandywine Hundred in New Castle County.\n\nShelly Towler, who cast her vote at Brandywine High School, said the direction the Republican Party took under former President Donald Trump led her to recently re-register, changing her party from Republican to Independent.\n\n“The party stands for nothing that I used to think it stood for,” Towler said.\n\nShe came to the polls with the Supreme Court’s recent reversal of abortion rights on her mind. She’s also discouraged by the Republican party’s attitude toward voting rights and the integrity of democracy.\n\n“It’s a huge embarrassment. We are supposed to be the example?” Towler said. “It’s just going backwards in time.”\n\nA steady stream of voters followed Towler to the polls on a brisk morning as crunchy leaves blown by the wind scratched the school parking lot. The school is one of several polling places in the fifth state senate district, which a Democrat won in 2020 for the first time in more than 40 years.\n\nAt nearby Emmanuel Presbyterian Church, Dennis Quill said he voted for Democrats down the ballot. The country needs to ensure individuals’ right to an abortion, Quill said, and he’s disappointed by the partisan justices on the Supreme Court, a body he is in favor of broadening or term limits.\n\n“I wouldn’t vote for a Republican if my life depended on it,” Quill said.\n\nQuill said he hopes voters realize “things aren’t as bad as people think” and are motivated to support candidates who can keep the nation from a deeper slide. But he’s more focused on races in neighboring states and the national landscape than Delaware, where he expects Democrats to win easily.\n\nPaul Donohue will just be happy when political ads are off his TV. Like Quill, he says “it doesn’t really feel like Delaware has any impact races.” But that hasn’t kept other races, like the battle between John Fetterman and Mehmet Oz for Pennsylvania’s Senate seat, off his screen.\n\n“I find it pretty upsetting that they’re all mean,” Donohue said. “They don’t talk about the issues much, they just attack each other. I’ll be thankful when it’s over.”\n\n— Brandon Holveck, Shannon Marvel McNaught\n\nWhat to watch for in Sussex County\n\nThe most-watched races in Sussex this year will likely be the Senate District 6 and Representative District 20 races.\n\nDistrict 6 Republican Sen. Ernie Lopez is retiring this year, and District 20 Republican Rep. Steve Smyk is giving up his seat to run for Lopez’s. Both seats are longtime Republican strongholds in a county where only one legislator, House Speaker Pete Schwartzkopf, is a Democrat.\n\nSmyk faces Democrat Russ Huxtable and Gwendolyn Jones (Non-Partisan Delaware) in the Senate District 6 race. In the Representative District 20 race, Democrat Stell Parker Selby and Republican Dallas Wingate are running.\n\nIn Representative District 20, as of this month, registered Democrats outnumber Republicans 8,423 to 7,742. There are also 5,444 independents. That’s compared to 9,802 Democrats, 9,591 Republicans and 6,430 independents in 2020.\n\nIn Senate District 6, there are 18,942 Democrats, 15,770 Republicans and 11,471 independents. In 2020, there were 10,282 Democrats, 8,229 Republicans and 5,751 independents.\n\nSenate District 6 includes Rehoboth Beach, Lewes and Milton. Representative District 20 includes most of Lewes, Milton and parts of Georgetown.\n\n— Shannon Marvel McNaught\n\nVoters struggle to get to polling location due to road blockage\n\nVoters near Townsend were unable to get to Blackbird Community Center Tuesday morning due to Verizon blocking the road.\n\nAn election day spokesperson later told Delaware Online/The News Journal that \"elections has indicated that it is aware and is in the process of addressing the blockage.\"\n\nSteady turnout at the polls Tuesday morning\n\nAcross the state Tuesday morning, polling locations saw a steady stream of voters.\n\nThere was a line outside Clayton Fire Company just before the polls opened at 7 a.m. Among the first voters was Diana Dede.\n\nShe said the issue she’s been following the most has been the debate about guns, saying “it’s just important to me to vote.”\n\nPaul Skreenock, also one of the first in line, said he didn’t come to the polls for a specific issue or candidate but because “it’s my civic duty.”\n\nIn Wilmington, there was only one voter at the Delaware Technical Community College polling place just after 8 a.m. On the outside, the only sign that it was Election Day was the red poster indicating the entrance to the polling place.\n\nTwo seniors walked out of the voting area as a reporter walked in. According to a poll worker, this was the calm after a morning rush when the polls opened at 7 a.m. There were no issues with the voting machines, as the process took less than a minute.\n\nAbout an hour later in Dover, the parking lot at East Dover Elementary wasn't busy as residents turned out to cast their vote. Yolanda Poe, 53, of Dover, said her decision to vote was, in part, to set a precedent for her grandchildren.\n\n“For centuries as Black people, we couldn't vote and women couldn't do anything,\" Poe said after casting her vote. \"Now we have the right to, so it's important that we do something.\"\n\nIn front of the elementary school, she took a selfie with Kerri Evelyn Harris, a candidate for Delaware State Representative. Harris, shivering from the cold, was the only candidate greeting voters outside the school at 9 a.m.\n\nAn older woman who slowly walked toward the school’s entrance to vote told Harris: “Keep warm!”\n\nTo the north in Talleyville, a handful of residents were voting at Springer Middle School at 10 a.m.\n\nOne poll worker said about 170 people had voted so far Tuesday morning, but about a half-dozen more walked in less than five minutes after the poll worker gave his estimate.\n\n— Ben Mace, Isabel Hughes, Andre Lamar, Meredith Newman\n\nWhy Lee Murphy thinks he can upset Lisa Blunt Rochester\n\nA Republican hasn’t represented Delaware in Congress since 2011, but Lee Murphy, the party’s challenger to Lisa Blunt Rochester, is confident that will soon change.\n\n“I’ve lived here a long time,” Murphy said by phone Monday. “I’ve seen Democrats rule the state, Republicans be in power. For many years in this state, Republicans and Democrats worked together, but that recently hasn’t been the case. I just believe one-party rule, especially over a long period of time, isn't healthy for everyone.”\n\nMurphy, who voted Tuesday morning at Hillcrest-Bellefont Methodist Church off Marsh Road just outside of Wilmington, said his No. 1 issue is the economy. Voters he’s spoken with are hurting from record inflation and are concerned about oil prices ahead of the winter months, he said.\n\nREAD:3 takeaways from the Blunt Rochester-Murphy U.S House debate\n\nIt’s an issue he hopes energizes voters to seek change.\n\nBlunt Rochester won Delaware’s lone seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2016 after fellow Democrat John Carney left the office to seek the governorship. Murphy has run in each election since, challenging Scott Walker unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination in 2018 before losing to Blunt Rochester in the general election in 2020.\n\nThe indicators once again point in Blunt Rochester’s favor.\n\nA poll conducted by the University of Delaware Center for Political Communication published in October found 50% of registered voters plan to vote for Blunt Rochester and 33% support Murphy.\n\nBlunt Rochester’s campaign has raised almost $2.7 million, about nine times as much as Murphy’s.\n\nMurphy pointed to the Delaware Supreme Court’s ruling against vote-by-mail and same-day voter registration as a reason for optimism. Without the COVID-19 measures that expanded absentee voting by mailing ballots to registered voters in 2020 and the following two years of Joe Biden's presidency, Murphy believes he’s better positioned this year compared to previous runs.\n\n“This election is very much a referendum on Joe Biden, which is bad for the Democrats,” Murphy said. “The landscape has definitely changed.”\n\n— Brandon Holveck\n\nWhat to watch for on Tuesday\n\nWhile Delaware races may be lower-stakes this year than in past years, elsewhere across the country there are a number of hot races that many are watching.\n\nHere are some that will determine what the country looks like moving forward:\n\nPennsylvania races to watch\n\nIn neighboring Pennsylvania, all eyes are on the U.S. Senate and gubernatorial races.\n\nThe outcome of the Senate race, between Lt. Gov. John Fetterman and Dr. Mehmet Oz, could determine the balance of power in the U.S. Senate, ultimately affecting issues like abortion rights and the economy, among others.\n\nFor the governor’s race, Democratic candidate and Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro faces Doug Mastriano, a far-right Trump-endorsee who has supported the former president’s lies that the election was stolen.\n\nMIDTERMS ARE HERE:Midterms are less than a week away. Here are the key races in Delaware\n\nMaryland races to watch\n\nIn Maryland, bestselling author Wes Moore, who would become the state’s first Black governor if elected, is facing another Trump endorsee, Dan Cox. Cox has also promoted the former president’s lies about the election. During the insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021, Cox tweeted that Vice President Mike Pence was a “traitor.”\n\nMoore is seen as the favorite to clinch the gubernatorial election in Maryland.\n\nNew York races to watch\n\nTo Delaware's north, it's unlikely that the traditionally blue state of New York will look much different after Tuesday. Still, the governor's race between Gov. Kathy Hochul ‒ the state's first female governor who took over following disgraced Gov. Andrew Cuomo's resignation last year ‒ and Republican Rep. Lee Zeldin isn't a shoo-in.\n\nHochul's lead over Trump-backed Zeldin has narrowed in recent weeks, according to Politico's election forecast.\n\nGeorgia races to watch\n\nMany eyes are on Georgia's governor's race this year, a repeat matchup between Gov. Brian Kemp and gubernatorial hopeful Stacey Abrams.\n\nRecent polls show Kemp ‒ no longer the overseer of Georgia's elections as he was during the 2018 race ‒ leading by seven percentage points. Still, Abrams was able to mobilize many voters in 2018, something she hopes to carry with her this year.\n\nKEMP VS ABRAMS:In second debate, Georgia candidates Kemp and Abrams argue over abortion, gun control\n\nJust as anticipated, though slightly more contentious, is Georgia's U.S. Senate race.\n\nDemocratic incumbent Sen. Raphael Warnock is facing Trump-backed Herschel Walker, an anti-abortion advocate who, in recent weeks, has repeatedly denied that he paid for two women to have abortions years ago. The women recently came forward with the claims that Walker impregnated them and then paid for the medical procedures.\n\nEarlier in his campaign, Walker revealed that he fathered four children by four different women, a striking contrast to his public admonishments about absentee fathers and his previous contention that he had three children, USA Today reported.\n\nAccording to FiveThirtyEight, the race is quite close, with Walker leading Warnock by about one percentage point.\n\nArizona races to watch\n\nArizona's gubernatorial race remains a toss-up, but it will be closely watched.\n\nPolls are showing election denier Kari Lake slightly ahead of incumbent Democrat Gov. Katie Hobbs, though that may not mean much. The veracity of polls often depends on what entity is conducting them, what their methods are and whether they have a partisan lean.\n\nPOLLS AREN'T ALWAYS ACCURATE:Polls in Arizona's Senate and governor's races: Don't count on them\n\nThe outcome of the gubernatorial race will have important implications ahead of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nLake, a former local Fox News anchor who now markets herself as an anti-media Republican, has repeatedly reiterated the baseless claim that Trump won the 2020 election in Arizona. She's also said she would not have certified President Joe Biden's election if she were governor at the time.\n\nFlorida races to watch\n\nAs in many other states, Florida's key contests are the gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races.\n\nIncumbent Gov. Ron DeSantis, who will likely be a presidential contender in 2024, is facing off against Charlie Crist, a former Republican governor-turned-Democrat who represented Florida in the U.S. House of Representatives until August of this year. He resigned to focus on the governor's race.\n\nDELAWARE'S MIGRANT PLANE THAT WASN'T:'No reports of anyone arriving' after rumors of DeSantis' incoming migrant plane\n\nOn the U.S. Senate side of the midterms, Republican Marco Rubio, a senator since 2011, is facing off against Democrat Val Demings. Polls show Rubio with a more than eight percentage point lead.\n\nOhio races to watch\n\nThis election cycle, U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan ‒ who is vying for Ohio's U.S. Senate seat ‒ has out-raised many other Senate hopefuls across the nation.\n\nREAD:Tim Ryan is raising more than J.D. Vance. Can he counter national GOP spending?\n\nYet it remains to be seen whether Ryan's cash flow will be enough to secure him the race against Trump-backed Republican J.D. Vance.\n\nGot a story tip or idea? Send to Isabel Hughes at ihughes@delawareonline.com.

The verdict ends a two-week trial on one of those accusations. He was indicted last summer on a charge of first-degree rape of a Sussex County woman in her early 20s.\n\nThe charge alleged that Conaway not only raped the woman on June 20, 2018, but that he also injured her in the process.\n\nSussex County Superior Court Judge Richard Stokes instructed the jury on Thursday that they had two other charges they could consider as well: second-degree rape, which is rape without injury, and fourth-degree rape, which is sexual penetration with an object or body part other than a penis and without the alleged victim's consent. In this case, the objects were his fingers.\n\nThe jury returned its verdict about 2 p.m. after deliberating for less than three hours.\n\nConaway was taken from the court in handcuffs.\n\nPeople in the audience, including his accuser, began crying after the verdict. One of Conaway's family members who was leaving the courtroom shouted \"she's a liar\" at the victim, while other Conaway family members and friends stood in the hallway sobbing.\n\nBACKGROUND:Full coverage, from rape accusations to trial for former UD pitcher\n\nThe conviction comes with a possible sentence of up to 15 years in prison, with no minimum prison time required.\n\n\"This is the way it is now,\" Conaway's defense attorney Joe Hurley told the media after the verdict. \"She has virtually no responsibility. ... That's the law. That's the way it is. And it sucks.\"\n\nHurley said he has one appeal option, linked to a statement made by Deputy Attorney General Casey Ewart about Conaway's guilt during her final statements.\n\nHe said Conaway's accuser also has an option to file a civil lawsuit.\n\n\"I would fully expect he will be the victim of a civil suit,\" Hurley said. Asked if he blames the victim, Hurley said, \"Well, yeah.\"\n\nACCUSER DESCRIBES ENCOUNTER:Clay Conaway's accuser testifies she 'did not know what he was capable of'\n\n\"You can't put yourself in harm's way and then cry and whimper and go out and get your nails done two days later,\" he said. \"It's ridiculous.\"\n\nDelaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings in a statement said the verdict in the case is a message that \"no means no\" and that the court process included \"needless disrespect and insinuations about [the victim's] integrity.\"\n\n\"Going through this kind of trial takes incredible strength, and I recognize the courage of the survivor for putting herself under a microscope to ensure that justice was served,\" Jennings said in the emailed statement.\n\nConaway's accuser testified during the trial that she went to a local hospital the night of the incident. While there, she reported that she had been sexually assaulted. An examination found she suffered from pain in her wrist and vagina, but no visible injuries were detected, a nurse testified.\n\nThe News Journal does not publish names or specific identifying details of potential sex crimes victims without their consent. This can include the names of relatives or friends who could identify them.\n\nWhy former UD pitcher Clay Conaway, charged with 6 rapes, will be tried separately\n\nThe victim returned to the hospital two days later for additional treatment and was diagnosed with muscle strain in her hips, which she said was caused when he pinned her legs up near her head while penetrating her.\n\nThe trial pitted her story against his. Defense attorneys focused on private conversations the woman had with friends leading up to her only in-person meeting with Conaway to imply the woman wanted a sexual relationship with the former college athlete.\n\nEvidence from medical records and testimony from the woman, her friends and the detective investigating the case showed that, before and during their interactions at his home in Georgetown, she told Conaway she was having a period and did not want to have sex.\n\nConaway, in a recorded police interview, also said she told him that she didn't want to have sex that night, and that he was fine respecting that boundary.\n\nHe argues in the interview that they didn't have sex at all, and that she enjoyed and consented to the sexual activities they engaged in during the brief time they spent together.\n\nThe two had met about a month before on a dating app called Bumble, which the woman had joined after getting out of a 1½-year relationship.\n\nThroughout the portions of Conaway's interview with Delaware State Police Detective David Kristunas that were shown at trial, Conaway changed parts of his story.\n\nUltimately, Conaway told the detective that if he had penetrated her that night, he didn’t intend to, and eventually admitted he did ejaculate on her stomach.\n\nThat police interview, shown as a video recording during the second week of the trial, is the only time the jury heard directly from Conaway. He did not take the stand in his own defense.\n\nIt is unclear when Judge Stokes is expected to deliver Conaway's sentence. The Sussex County jury consisted of nine men and three women.\n\nEarlier this year, Stokes ruled in favor of defense attorney Hurley’s request to have the six rape accusations, including this one, tried separately. The remaining cases include charges of second-degree rape, attempted rape and strangulation.\n\nConaway: Why the former UD pitcher's rape trial is unusual\n\nA seventh case on a charge of second-degree rape against him was dropped earlier this year.\n\nThe next rape trial is scheduled to begin Dec. 2. He pleaded not guilty to all the rape charges.\n\nReporter Xerxes Wilson contributed to this story.

Walters, who has been with the state police agency for almost seven years. He remains suspended without pay or benefits, though has not been terminated.\n\nOfficials said Walters was on duty when the incident occurred. He turned off his body camera during the assault, officials said, but a program in the device meant it was still capturing video. There was no audio.\n\nOfficials released Walters' body-cam video, showing him walking up to the back of a Delaware State Police SUV that was holding the handcuffed boy. Another trooper backs out of the way as Walters strikes the boy in the face.\n\nWalters then walks around the SUV until he again comes to where the boy is being held and flashes a light at the teen, who turns his body to face the inside the the vehicle. Walters hits the button to turn his body camera on, activating its audio.\n\n\"You sure about that?\" Walters is heard saying.\n\n\"Please tell me what I did? Please tell me what I did?\" the boy asks.\n\nWalters was charged with second-degree assault, a felony; deprivation of civil rights, a felony; two counts of third-degree assault, misdemeanors; and two counts of official misconduct, also misdemeanors.\n\nAttorney General Kathy Jennings said Tuesday that the man \"chose to extract his own form of personal justice\" by \"embarking on a violent rampage.\"\n\n“As a mother and grandmother, the footage in this case is hard to watch,\" Jennings said Tuesday. \"As a prosecutor, the constitutional violations are stunning.\"\n\nState Police Col. Melissa Zebley apologized to Walters' victims on Tuesday, including one who did not participate in the prank, and said the agency recognizes \"the gravity of the situation.\"\n\n\"We assure you all that we are taking every possible step to prevent such things from happening in the future,\" she said.\n\nWhat happened to these teens?\n\nWalters was off duty and on his way home on August 17 when he saw a 17-year-old boy near the entrance to his neighborhood in Elsmere, Delaware, according to the indictment. Believing the boy was up to wrongdoing, Walters confronted him causing a verbal altercation, court documents say.\n\nWalters called Elsmere police, who picked up the teen and took him to his home in the nearby development of Lancaster Village.\n\nThe teen was not charged, but the indictment says the following day Walters looked up the teen on the state’s law enforcement information database that contains addresses, pedigree and background information.\n\nA few days later, on August 21, a 15-year-old boy and his friends were pranking homes in Elsmere by knocking on doors, then running away also known as “ding-dong ditch.” About 8:30 p.m. that day, the 15-year-old kicked Walters’ door, startling the trooper’s girlfriend. She called Walters, who was on duty.\n\nWalters drove toward his home, calling Delaware State Police troopers and other police agencies for assistance, the indictment said. Police said it was reported as an attempted home invasion, prompting the deployment of the state police helicopter and various K-9 units.\n\nWhile at his house, the indictment said, Walters spoke to a witness who told him several juveniles had run past him and toward the street where the 17-year-old boy from the earlier incident lived.\n\nWalters and an officer from nearby Newport went to the home of the 17-year-old boy and, at gunpoint, removed them from the house, according to the indictment. The 17-year-old and his friend had not been involved in the ding-dong ditch prank.\n\nThe teens were forced to the ground, where one can be heard on body camera video saying \"please help me\" and calling for his mom.\n\nThe teen's family said they were held in hot police cars for hours before they were released. The mother of the 17-year-old boy was told it was all a \"misunderstanding,\" The Delaware News Journal, part of the USA TODAY Network, has previously reported.\n\n\"Some kids were over in the other neighborhood playing [ding-dong ditch] and they hit a door that belonged to a state trooper police officer,\" the mother said an officer told her. \"Your son is not on the video. He has nothing to do with it.\"\n\nHer son was released after being detained for about four hours with police not providing an incident report. She said Walters had been knocking on doors in the neighborhood and told one of the neighbors that someone had tried to break into his home.\n\nThe indictment claims Walters left the scene after handcuffing the 17-year-old and went to where another trooper had detained the 15-year-old boy and his friends. The 15-year-old was face-down on the ground being handcuffed when Walters arrived.\n\nWalters then struck the 15-year-old in the back of the neck and head with his knee, according to the indictment.\n\nWith the 15-year-old’s hands cuffed behind him, another trooper took the boy to a state police SUV and was placing him in the rear passenger seat. That’s when the indictment said Walters turned off his body-cam, walked to the police vehicle and struck the boy’s face twice causing an orbital fracture.\n\nAnother black eye for the badge\n\nWalters' indictment adds to the growing list of Delaware law officers who have been recently charged with or convicted of crimes.\n\nDelaware State Police trooper James D. Boyda was placed on six-month probation after he pleaded guilty last year to illegally using a criminal justice computer system to find New Jersey vehicle information for a friend.\n\nEdwin Ramirez, a former Delaware State Police corporal, was indicted in 2021 in a fraudulent traffic warning scheme. He pleaded guilty to falsifying business records and official misconduct in October and was sentenced to a year of probation and 33 hours of community service — one hour for every false e-warning he filed.\n\nA state police spokesperson said the agency will be looking to see if other officers violated policies in the instance for which Walters was indicted.\n\n\"When an incident involving the Delaware State Police occurs, we follow a bifurcated process,\" Sgt. India Sturgis, a police spokesperson, told The Delaware News Journal. \"First and foremost, we prioritize the criminal investigation as was announced today. The next step in the process is for DSP to identify any potential policy violations committed by troopers on the scene.\"\n\nContact Esteban Parra at eparra@delawareonline.com, Xerxes Wilson at xwilson@delawareonline.com, and Isabel Hughes at ihughes@delawareonline.com or on X, formerly known as Twitter, @izzihughes_.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/04/22/how-tower-hill-school-administrator-caught-child-porn/7395500001/", "title": "How Tower Hill School administrator was caught with child porn ...", "text": "Tower Hill School's director of upper school admissions, William Ushler, who was arrested and fired Tuesday after he was charged with dealing in child pornography, viewed the images using school technology, court records show.\n\nUshler was sent the child sexual abuse material – a term preferred by activists to emphasize the exploitative nature of the explicit images and videos – from \"unknown persons\" in online chats, according to court records.

It is timely.\"\n\nFour Democrats — Kathy Jennings, Chris Johnson, Tim Mullaney and LaKresha Roberts— are competing for votes in a circuit of three forums and debates with more to come leading to September's primary. These events have been dominated by questions about mass incarceration, improving diversity within the ranks of the state's prosecutors and ending practices that unfairly impact the poor, such as cash bail.\n\nTwo things are primarily driving this dynamic, observers say. The candidates must appeal to Democratic voters directly in the first competitive primary in two decades. And the questions are mirroring the swell of public and outrage over police shootings, Trump administration policies and high-profile stories about the number of minorities sent to jail.\n\nThe result may be that the voters know more about the candidates and their positions than in recent elections, and advocates will have a stick to hold the eventual winner to their campaign pledges.\n\nLast contested race in 1998\n\nThis race stands out from other modern attorney general contests because there is no incumbent and no anointed Democrat to take the place of Matt Denn, who announced he would not seek re-election.\n\nThe last contested Democratic primary for attorney general occurred in 1998 when David L. Finger lost to John T. Dorsey, who ultimately was beaten by incumbent Republican Jane Brady. She served 10 years, before being appointed a Superior Court judge. Democrat Beau Biden then was elected unchallenged for two four-year terms by his party.\n\nWhen Denn was running to replace Biden, his final pitch to voters in a debate with with Republican, Independent and Green Party candidates was greater police presence in Wilmington and reforming sentencing and pre-trial release practices that put violent offenders back on the street \"prematurely.\" He was not challenged by a Democrat in that race.\n\nThis year's packed primary creates a situation in which Democrats are forced to stake their positions and appeal to the base.\n\n\"Even in a basically blue state — even if it is a little bit of a conservative blue state — if a candidate doesn't need to take a particular position on a particular issue, they don't because they have more room to do what they want when they get into office,\" said Kathleen MacRae, executive director of American Civil Liberties Union of Delaware.\n\nThe campaign and its issues also reflects a larger conversation going on around the country.\n\nThe ubiquity of video on social media in recent years has helped create a swell in moral outrage over police killings of civilians who are often unarmed and black. That's spawned a national push for greater accountability within law enforcement.\n\nDrew Serres, executive director of Network Delaware, a nonprofit aimed at leadership development, said people are becoming more aware of law enforcement and the judicial system's ability to perpetuate disparities in crime and punishment.\n\nThe days when when candidates on both the left and the right prioritized an image of \"tough on crime\" are gone for now, he said.\n\n\"The general electorate is moving that direction,\" Serres said. \"Especially for attorney general, if you were seen as soft on crime, you were not likely to win. Now I think it is shifting the other way.\"\n\nCalvin Christopher is chair of the Delaware Racial Justice Collaborative, which Wednesday hosted a forum for Democrat attorney general candidates focused on ending structural racism in Delaware. He said having candidates state their position gives advocates a way to hold them accountable to the policies they are now endorsing.\n\n\"Based on what we hear from the candidates, particularly the successful candidate, we as a group can follow up on what is said here and how their positions and promises are actually put into action,\" said Christopher.\n\nProgressive reforms sought\n\nIn the eyes of social justice advocates, Delaware's record regarding incarceration is shameful.\n\nThe state jails 756 per 100,000 residents, the 18th highest rate in the country and higher than the national average of 698, according to the non-profit Prison Policy Initiative. Delaware's rate is also higher than New Jersey (407), Pennsylvania (725) and Maryland (585).\n\n\"It is not because our crime rate is higher or because people in Delaware are bad people compared to other areas,\" MacRae said. \"It is the policy that the state and the attorney general's office are following.\"\n\nThe problem isn't confined to the number of people incarcerated and the above-average length of prison sentences. It also can be seen in the racial makeup of the prison population, MacRae said.\n\nBlack people comprise about 21 percent of the state's population but are more than half of the state's prison population.\n\nThe attorney general oversees the Department of Justice and is uniquely positioned to address these disparities, say advocates for change. That office has supervision of the hundreds of deputy attorneys general that evaluate evidence and prosecute cases.\n\nLast year, 93 percent of cases in Delaware's Superior Court, which handles felonies and drug offenses, were resolved either by a guilty plea or dropped charges. Plea offers, the dismissal of charges and the recommended sentence for a defendant are largely the realm of deputy attorneys general.\n\nThese deputy attorneys general also have sway over who is sent to drug or mental health treatment programs instead of prison.\n\n\"They are very influential in looking at low level crimes that do not deserve incarceration,\" Christopher said. \"They also have sway in housing. There are areas of predatory lending where folks who are undeserved are the most impacted.\"\n\nThe state Department of Justice is also charged with prosecuting nuisance businesses, predatory lenders and fraudster landlords.\n\nIt has has a role in educating police officers on acceptable behavior and holding police accountable for misconduct.\n\nIn May, the local ACLU and partner organizations in the community launched its Smart Justice campaign and a corresponding candidate questionnaire with the aim of \"electing an attorney general committed to ending mass incarceration.\"\n\nDelaware's attorney general is the only elected law enforcement position in the state. So voters should pay close attention, MacRae said.\n\n\"To truly reform the criminal justice system, we need a partner in the attorney general's office because they have tremendous power and can have a tremendous impact on what does or doesn't happen in reforming the system,\" MacRae said.\n\nSome daylight between candidates:\n\nIn the months following Denn's announcement that he would not seek another term, four Democrats stepped up to the plate:\n\nKathy Jennings was most recently the second-in-charge for New Castle County government. Before that, she spent two decades in the Delaware DOJ, prosecuting criminal cases and overseeing the department's statewide staff of prosecutors and eventually working as chief deputy attorney general. She has worked in criminal defense before her time with the DOJ.\n\nShe has worked in criminal defense before her time with the DOJ. Chris Johnson was most recently deputy legal counsel for Gov. John Carney. He previously worked in the Law Department for Wilmington city government as well as in private practice.\n\nTim Mullaney was most recently the director of Labor Services for the national Fraternal Order of Police. He is a former Dover Police officer and was a U.S. Marshal. He worked in the DOJ, rising to chief of staff under Biden. He has worked in New Castle County government, first as its top attorney and then as its second-in-charge administrator.\n\nLaKresha Roberts was most recently chief deputy attorney general under Denn. She previously was a prosecutor in and ultimately led the DOJ's family division. Prior to her time in the DOJ, she worked in private practice.\n\nOne person is running for attorney general on the Republican ticket, GOP officials said. Former Chief Sussex County Prosecutor and Republican Peggy Marshall Thomas has not yet filed with state election officials. She did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThree months before the primary for the party's nomination, Democratic voters may have trouble distinguishing the principles of at least three of the four candidates.\n\nIn a questionnaire issued by the local ACLU, a forum hosted earlier this month by Wilmington's Democratic Party and the forum on racial justice last week, each of the four candidates agreed on several issues:\n\nDelaware incarcerates too many people.\n\nCash bail discriminates by economic status and should be eliminated.\n\nThe DOJ should collect and publicize information outlining the racial and gender breakdown of plea bargains, sentence recommendations and diversion programs.\n\nThe DOJ's ranks of should be more diverse.\n\nThe DOJ should be at the forefront of resisting federal efforts to deport undocumented immigrants.\n\nMarijuana should be legal.\n\nOne example of how the candidates see a social justice issue that rocked the state's largest city came in the Wilmington Democratic Party forum earlier this month. The candidates were asked how they'd seek to hold accountable police officers that act improperly or dishonestly.\n\nThe question was asked in the context of the death of Jeremy McDole, a wheelchair-bound man shot to death by Wilmington Police on the city's west side in 2015.\n\nA report commissioned by the DOJ singled out Senior Cpl. Joseph Dellose for \"extraordinarily poor police work\" while wielding a shotgun during the incident, said he should not be employed in a role that involves carrying a gun in public but stopped short of an indictment.\n\nThe report concluded his conduct was not criminal because of a Delaware law that immunizes officers if they believe force is necessary to protect themselves, disappointing Wilmington civic leaders who said the result fomented distrust toward police.\n\n“One of the biggest issues we have relating to police-involved shootings is the law itself, which makes it very difficult to prosecute. As attorney general, I’d be in full support of reviewing those laws and revising them,” Roberts said. She added that Office of Civil Rights and Public Trust, which is tasked with investigating issues of police misconduct, is understaffed.\n\nMullaney had to miss that forum due to a prior commitment, organizers said.\n\nIn her response, Jennings said noted she was only candidate present at the forum who had ever authorized the prosecution of a police officer, referring to Dover Police Cpl. Thomas Webster IV. Webster was acquitted of assault charges after dashcam footage showed him kicking a black man in the head, knocking him out and breaking his jaw during an arrest.\n\nJennings said the Office of Civil Rights and Public Trust.needs to be headed by a \"very experienced attorney\" and operate with transparency so people know the reason behind its actions.\n\nJohnson endorsed the idea of \"beefing up\" the Office of Civil Rights and Public Trust, agreed with Roberts that changes of the law should be explored and pitched the creation of a citizen board to oversee police activities and potentially suspend an officer when misconduct occurs.\n\nThe events have impressed the audiences.\n\n\"I think they are woke,\" said one woman leaving last week's forum on racial inequality.\n\nA snapshot of the candidate's position on the ACLU's favored topics can be found here.\n\nIn the coming week, The News Journal will roll out a position page aggregating the candidates' responses to questions in various forums.\n\nContact Xerxes Wilson at (302) 324-2787 or xwilson@delawareonline.com.

I. du Pont in 1802. The 235-acre property is situated along the banks of the Brandywine and includes restored mills, a workers' community, and the ancestral Eleutherian Mills home and gardens of the du Pont family.\n\nIn June 1997, the museum had a famous visitor: Oprah Winfrey. Before starring in the film adaptation of Toni Morrison's novel \"Beloved,\" Winfrey had to learn how to cook on a 19th-century stove. She came to Hagley because it had a wood-fired stove from 1846 that was still functional.\n\nHagley's library delves into the study of business and technology in America. The collections include individuals' papers and companies' records ranging from 18th-century merchants to modern telecommunications and illustrate the impact of the business system on society.\n\nDuPont's Atomic Energy Division documents and records on atomic weapons and nuclear energy also are stored at Hagley Museum and Library.

The house, which had fallen into disrepair after it was damaged during an 1890 gunpowder explosion, was restored by Louise du Pont Crowninshield.\n\nShe and her husband, Francis \"Frank\" Crowninshield, who rode with Theodore Roosevelt's Rough Riders during the Spanish–American War, lived there for a few months out of the year. The house was converted into a museum in 1957 and highlights family artifacts and decorative arts with links to major events from the Louisiana Purchase to the Civil War.\n\nGuess who came to Hagley Museum?Secret revealed: The time Oprah Winfrey came to this Delaware attraction to make pies\n\nMuch of the museum's outdoor property is walkable and picnics are allowed on the grounds.

The grants are part of the YMCA's Healthy Futures Initiative, which is focused on building awareness for children and their families about the benefits of nutrition and physical activity, according to a news release. The initiative is funded through a grant from the Stop & Shop Family Foundation. Build with Purpose, a Metuchen nonprofit, worked with the YMCA to facilitate the school grant program.\n\nGrants were awarded in February to 12 schools located in communities served by the YMCA of Metuchen, Edison, Woodbridge & South Amboy. The schools are:\n\nWoodbridge: Avenel Middle School, Oak Ridge Heights, School #21, Colonia High School, Kennedy Park Elementary School #24, Iselin Middle School, Menlo Park Terrace #19\n\nEdison: JP Stevens High School, Woodrow Wilson Middle School\n\nMetuchen: Edgar Middle School, Metuchen High School, Sayreville War Memorial High School, South Amboy Middle/High School\n\nEach school received grants of up to $2,000. Grants will support a variety of school garden projects, including installation of new vegetable and flower gardens, upgrades and improvements to existing gardens, greenhouse projects and school beautification. The projects provide hands-on learning opportunities for the students as well as outdoor learning environments.\n\n\"Gardens provide a unique opportunity for learning as well as physical activity,\" said Rose Cushing, YMCA District executive child care director.

The Legislature gave final approval to the $1.3 billion prison construction plan and to a separate bill to steer $400 million of the state’s $2.1 billion from the rescue funds to pay for it. With legislative leaders standing behind her, Gov. Kay Ivey signed the bills into law soon afterward. The Republican called the construction plan “a major step forward” for the prison system, which faces various federal court orders and a lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Justice. “This is a pivotal moment for the trajectory of our state’s criminal justice system,” Ivey said. Alabama’s plan to use almost 20% of its American Rescue Plan funds for prison construction drew criticism from Democrats including U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell, who argued that was not the intent of the relief program. But state Republicans argued that the expenditure addresses a public safety need and is allowed under a provision to replace lost revenue and shore up state services.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The state on Saturday activated emergency crisis protocols that allow 20 medical facilities to ration care if needed as Alaska recorded the nation’s worst COVID-19 diagnosis rates in recent days, straining the state’s limited health care system. The declaration covers three facilities that had already announced emergency protocols, including the state’s largest hospital, Providence Alaska Medical Center in Anchorage. The state’s declaration also includes the other two hospitals in Anchorage and facilities across the huge but sparsely populated state. “Today’s action recognizes that Alaska has an interconnected and interdependent health care system, requiring the need for activation of the state’s decision-making framework,” the state health department said in a statement announcing the activation. “I want to stress that our health care facilities in Alaska remain open and able to care for patients,” said Adam Crum, the state’s health commissioner. According to data collected by Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering, 1 in every 84 people in Alaska was diagnosed with COVID-19 from Sept. 22 to Sept. 29. Fairbanks Memorial Hospital, which was covered by the state’s announcement, on Friday activated its own policy because of a shortage of beds, staff and monoclonal antibody treatments, along with the inability to transfer patients. “The move to Crisis Standards of Care is not something we take lightly,” Fairbanks Chief Medical Officer Dr. Angelique Ramirez said in a statement. “This is in response to a very serious surge of COVID in our community.”\n\nArizona\n\nChandler: A helicopter and a single-engine plane collided in midair Friday near a suburban Phoenix airport, sending the helicopter crashing into a field and killing both people on board. The plane landed safely, and the flight instructor and a student inside were not hurt. The collision happened in the city of Chandler near its municipal airport, said police Sgt. Jason McClimans. He said no one on the ground was hurt. The Chandler Fire Department received reports of a fire in a brush field next to the airport shortly before 8 a.m. Crews found a large plume of smoke and the wreckage of the helicopter on fire but were able to extinguish it relatively quickly, fire officials said. They inspected the helicopter and found the bodies of the two people on board. The chopper was operated by Quantum Helicopters and the plane by Flight Operations Academy. Both are flight schools, according to McClimans, of Chandler Police. Richard Bengoa, owner of Flight Operations Academy, said the four-seat plane is used mostly for flight training. Though officials did not allow Bengoa to get close to the plane, he said it appeared from a distance that its landing gear had been damaged. He said he had no information about how the collision happened and was not allowed to speak with the instructor or student.\n\nArkansas\n\nBella Vista: The Bella Vista Bypass opened to the public Friday, marking the end to a decades­long plan to link sections of an interstate in northwest Arkansas and southwest Missouri. Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson and Missouri Gov. Mike Parson marked the occasion with a ribbon-cutting ceremony Thursday. The new roadway allows travelers to bypass Bella Vista, Arkansas, and connects 265 miles of Interstate 49 between Fort Smith, Arkansas, and Kansas City, Missouri. Discussions began more than 25 years ago for the project, and construction began in February 2011. According to the Arkansas Department of Transportation, construction included six projects that totaled more than $220 million. “Whenever you look at what’s happening in northwest Arkansas and southwest Missouri, our economy is boosting. But if we do not have this kind of investment in infrastructure, then we can’t keep growing our economy,” Hutchinson said. “While this won’t guarantee we’ll continue to prosper in the future, it sure means we’re not going to stymie the growth we already have.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nYosemite National Park: A century-old building originally used as a laundry by Chinese workers at Yosemite’s iconic Wawona Hotel has been restored and turned into a visitor’s attraction, recognizing Chinese Americans’ contributions to the early history of the national park. Officials unveiled a new sign Friday marking the Chinese Laundry Building in Yosemite Valley, the Fresno Bee reports. New exhibits inside tell the story of Chinese workers who helped build Tioga Road and Wawona Road, critical infrastructure that made tourism to the park possible. The building – later used as a storage facility – is part of a cluster of structures that will make up the new Yosemite History Center, which will tell the histories of immigrants who made the park what it is today, said park ranger Adam Ramsey. “Chinese people have been a big part of communities throughout the Sierra Nevada for a really long time, and it’s about time that we started sharing that history here in Yosemite,” Ramsey said. According to research conducted by park ranger Yenyen Chan, in 1883 Chinese workers helped build the 56-mile Tioga Road in just 130 days. The stunning route across the Sierra Nevada reaches 10,000 feet in elevation and serves as one of the park’s main roads. Chinese workers were also employed in Yosemite as cooks, laundry workers and gardeners.\n\nColorado\n\nAurora: A majority of officers from a suburban Denver police department that had faced investigations and community outrage over its run-ins with people of color reported disapproving of the police chief who has committed publicly to reforming the force and its reputation. Members of the Aurora Police Department’s two labor unions, the Aurora Police Association and the local chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police, voted in a poll last week that asked: “Do you feel confident in the leadership of Chief Vanessa Wilson?” The response was 442 votes against her to 16 in favor, the Sentinel Colorado reports. The vote comes less than a month after Attorney General Phil Weiser announced several Aurora officers and paramedics were indicted on manslaughter and other charges in the 2019 death of Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old Black man who was put in a chokehold and injected with a powerful sedative. Weiser also announced last month that a civil rights investigation found the department’s patterns and practices indicated a history of racially biased policing. Doug Wilkinson, head of the Aurora Police Association, said the union vote was prompted by Wilson reopening an investigation into a May traffic stop of a Black man who said he was tackled and stunned with a Taser by police, who had “already been cleared of wrongdoing.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: State officials announced a settlement Friday with Eversource over the electric utility’s response to last year’s Tropical Storm Isaias, which left thousands of people without power for days. Under the deal, Eversource has agreed to return $103.4 million to consumers and provide more accountability during future storms, Gov. Ned Lamont and Attorney General William Tong announced. Eversource also has agreed not to apply for a rate increase until at least January 2023, for rates that would not go into effect until at least January 2024, Gov. Ned Lamont’s office said. The storm hit Connecticut on Aug. 4, 2020, with rain and high winds, leaving roughly 800,000 utility customers without power at its peak. Local officials complained that an inability to contact the utility made it difficult to tell residents when or where crews would be coming to restore power. Many towns did not see a utility truck for more than two days, and some people were in the dark for over a week. Under the agreement, $65 million in Eversource funds are to be immediately returned to customers in the form of credits on their December and January bills. The company said $10 million will be used to assist customers who are having difficulty paying their utility bills. The average customer will see a total credit of $35, the governor’s office said.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A Dover man who pointed a gun at counterprotesters during a campaign rally for a Republican U.S. Senate candidate last year has been convicted of two felonies. A jury convicted Michael Hastings on Thursday of first-degree reckless endangering and possession of a firearm during commission of a felony for pointing a gun at a group of protesters while attending a Lauren Witzke rally. The incident, which was caught on video by a protester, happened during a September 2020 rally in Wilmington. Witzke, who condemned the behavior, later lost to incumbent Democratic Sen. Chris Coons. “Pointing a loaded gun at anyone is always dangerous, full stop,” Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings said in a statement. “The defendant’s actions seriously endangered his fellow citizens who were exercising their right to free speech, and he now faces the consequences.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The first Women’s March of the Biden administration headed straight for the steps of the Supreme Court on Saturday, part of nationwide protests that drew thousands to Washington to demand continued access to abortion in a year when conservative lawmakers and judges have put it in jeopardy. Demonstrators filled the streets surrounding the court, shouting “My body, my choice.” Before heading out on the march, they rallied in a square near the White House, waving signs that said “Mind your own uterus” and “Abortion is a personal choice, not a legal debate,” among other messages. Some wore T-shirts reading simply “1973,” a reference to the landmark Roe v. Wade decision. Elaine Baijal, a 19-year-old student at American University, said her mother told her of coming to a march for legal abortion with her own mother in the 1970s. “It’s sad that we still have to fight for our right 40 years later. But it’s a tradition I want to continue,” Baijal said of the march. The demonstrations took place two days before the start of a new term that will decide the future of abortion rights in the United States, after appointments of justices by President Donald Trump strengthened conservative control of the high court. “Shame, shame, shame!” marchers chanted while passing the Trump International Hotel, at which some booed and waved their fists.\n\nFlorida\n\nSurfside: Personal property recovered from the destroyed units of a condo building that collapsed, killing 98 people, will be divided into two categories: soft material and hard material, according to a plan outlined before a judge overseeing litigation from the tragedy. Only the hard items collected from the rubble where the Champlain Towers South building once stood will be returned to survivors and family members of those killed, officials said in court documents. The moisture-absorbing soft items, including clothing and bedding, would cost millions of dollars to decontaminate per EPA guidelines, they said. Photos are the exception to the rule, as Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava has made those a priority to return to survivors, said Michael Goldberg, a lawyer appointed to manage the legal interests of the Champlain Towers South. About $750,000 in cash was recovered from the ruins. Family members and survivors will be reimbursed somewhat quickly for cash that is easily identifiable because it was in a wallet or purse with an ID. The actual paper bills will be transported to the U.S. Treasury in Washington, where they will be destroyed since they are contaminated. They’ll be replaced with checks, according to court documents. But “we are going to have claims for cash that far exceed what is coming back,” Goldberg said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Ahmaud Arbery’s mental health records can’t be used as trial evidence by the white men who chased and killed the 25-year-old Black man as he was running in their neighborhood, a judge ruled Friday. The decision by Superior Court Judge Timothy Walmsley further limits defense attorneys’ efforts to portray Arbery as an aggressive young man with a troubled past when the case goes to trial soon, with jury selection scheduled to start Oct. 18. The judge ruled that Arbery’s medical privacy, even in death, trumped the rights of the men standing trial to a robust defense. And he concluded that a registered nurse’s “highly questionable diagnosis” that Arbery suffered from mental illness during his first and only visit to a mental health services provider in 2018 could unfairly prejudice a trial jury. “There is no evidence that the victim was suffering from any mental health issue, or had otherwise decompensated, on February 23, 2020,” the date Arbery was killed, the judge’s ruling said. Prosecutors say Arbery was merely jogging on that date when father and son Gregory and Travis McMichael armed themselves and chased Arbery in a pickup truck in their neighborhood just outside the port city of Brunswick, about 70 miles south of Savannah.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Gov. David Ige said Friday that he would extend emergency orders requiring masks and regulating travel amid ongoing concerns about high numbers of COVID-19 infections. Ige said his new proclamation would stay in effect for 60 days. The rules mandate masks in indoor public spaces. To avoid 10 days of quarantine upon arriving in the islands, travelers must show proof of vaccination or a negative result from a coronavirus test taken within 72 hours of their flight to Hawaii. The governor said he was concerned that the seven-day average of new daily cases continues to exceed 300. He noted that while that’s down from late August, when the figure approached 900, it’s still higher than last year’s peak. He said he was watching closely whether hospitals have enough beds and staff to care for the sick, noting that Hawaii’s geographic isolation means patients can’t drive to neighboring states for health care if local hospitals are full. Earlier this year Ige had hoped to lift restrictions once 70% of the state’s population was vaccinated against COVID-19, but he said “everything changed” with the spread of the highly contagious delta variant of the virus. As of Friday, 68% of the state’s population was fully vaccinated.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin has made public a collection of documents to journalists shortly after a judge again ordered her to reveal the records. The public records included feedback from the public regarding her newly created Education Task Force, which was tasked with investigating alleged “indoctrination” in the state’s public school system – something McGeachin said was necessary to “protect our young people from the scourge of critical race theory, socialism, communism and Marxism.” Several journalists first requested copies of the public records months ago. But McGeachin’s office mostly denied the requests, telling some reporters it would cost them hundreds of dollars to access the materials and citing exemptions to Idaho’s public records law that didn’t apply to the documents. McGeachin also falsely claimed in public Facebook posts that the journalists were only seeking the records to encourage employers to retaliate against anyone who expressed concerns about the state’s public education system. In July, the Idaho Press Club sued McGeachin for the documents on behalf of Audrey Dutton and Clark Corbin with the Idaho Capital Sun, Blake Jones with Idaho Education News and Hayat Norimine with the Idaho Statesman.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The death of an Illinois State Police trooper on an expressway has been ruled a suicide, the Cook County Medical Examiner’s office said Saturday. An autopsy found District Chicago Trooper Gerald Mason, 35, died of a gunshot wound to the head, the medical examiner’s office said. The 11-year state police veteran died Friday afternoon shortly after the shooting on the inbound lanes of the Dan Ryan Expressway on the city’s South Side, authorities said. “He was an amazing District Chicago trooper,” Illinois State Police Director Brendan Kelly said during a news conference Friday evening. The trooper’s mother, Linda Mason, told the Chicago Sun-Times her son had wanted to be an officer since he was a toddler. He was a Chicago native who dedicated his life to policing, she said. “He was a sweetheart, and he loved everybody,” she said. “He just wanted to protect people and make this city and state better.” On Thursday, the Illinois State Police announced it would more than double patrols in the Chicago area beginning Friday in response to a surge in shootings on expressways over the past two years. There have been more than 185 shootings on expressways in the region this year, according to the agency, compared to a total of about 130 shootings last year and just over 50 in 2019.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Republican lawmakers gave final approval Friday to their party’s redrawing of the state’s congressional and legislative districts, brushing aside objections that the maps give them an excessive election advantage and dilute the influence of minority and urban voters. The Indiana Senate and House both voted by wide margins without any Democratic support to advance the redistricting plan to Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb for his signature. Political analysts say the new maps that will be used through the 2030 elections protect the Republican dominance that has given them a 7-2 majority of Indiana’s U.S. House seats and commanding majorities in the Legislature. Republicans maintain they followed federal and state laws to match population changes recorded by the 2020 census while avoiding splitting counties and cities among multiple districts as much as possible. Democrats and civil rights groups countered by pointing to the fragmenting of Fort Wayne’s large Black and Latino communities among three likely Republican Senate districts that will have rural white voters making up the majorities. Critics also argued that the cities of Evansville, Lafayette and West Lafayette were divided among rural, Republican Senate districts while their populations were enough for them to have districts of their own that would be competitive.\n\nIowa\n\nCedar Rapids: A University of Northern Iowa biology professor who required that masks be worn in his classroom and threatened lower grades for students who refused has been relegated to online teaching and stripped of his eligibility for merit pay. UNI professor Steve O’Kane Jr. had circulated a resolution among his colleagues saying faculty should be allowed to manage their classrooms, pushing back against a state law banning mask mandates. Regents President Mike Richards in May barred administrators from requiring masks or vaccines. He’s maintained that position despite the more contagious delta variant of the coronavirus. O’Kane received a disciplinary letter from UNI College of Humanities, Arts and Sciences Dean John Fritch, The Gazette of Cedar Rapids reports. Besides the loss of merit pay and removal from in-person classes, the letter requires O’Kane to complete training addressing his professional responsibilities as a faculty member – including following university policies – by Nov. 30. Despite the letter’s warning that he could be fired if he fails to comply with university policies on face masks, O’Kane said he will require masks again in the spring if he’s allowed to return to in-person teaching.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Residents can now register to vote at the state agencies where they receive public benefits under an agreement with civil rights groups that brings Kansas back into compliance with federal election law, the governor said Friday. Kansas’ Department of Health and Environment and Department for Children and Families have expanded opportunities for residents wishing to register or update their voter registration. The agencies have also committed to providing resources to help them register. “Every lawfully eligible Kansan deserves an equal opportunity to cast his or her ballot in every election,” Kelly, a Democrat, said in a news release. “By sharing resources and expanding opportunities to get registered to vote, we will encourage more voices to be heard at the polls and more Kansans to exercise this important right.” The National Voter Registration Act, passed in 1993, requires voter registration assistance at state agencies providing public assistance benefits. Although the agencies may have been in compliance in the past, previous administrations allowed them to abandon those obligations, Kelly’s office said. To address those deficiencies, Kelly’s office has been working since November 2019 with voting rights advocacy nonprofit Loud Light, represented by the think tank Demos, the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas, and the ACLU’s national Voting Rights Project.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Fresh off landing a record-shattering economic development deal with Ford Motor Co. that put Kentucky at the forefront of the green energy movement, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear on Friday launched a reelection run that will be tied to his aggressive actions to combat COVID-19 in his rapidly reddening state. Still two years away from voters delivering a verdict on his pandemic-plagued term, Beshear filed paperwork allowing him to raise and spend money on his 2023 reelection bid. The 43-year-old governor faces a bruising campaign in a state dominated by Republicans eager to rip into his coronavirus-related restrictions during much of the pandemic. In a social media post, the governor said: “There are so many challenges facing our Commonwealth. Kentuckians are counting on me to deliver, and I won’t let them down.” Lt. Gov. Jacqueline Coleman will be Beshear’s running mate again in 2023, said Eric Hyers, the governor’s 2019 campaign manager and adviser to his reelection effort. Several Republicans are weighing bids to unseat Beshear in 2023, including former United Nations Ambassador Kelly Craft, Agriculture Commissioner Ryan Quarles, state Sen. Max Wise and state Rep. Savannah Maddox. State Auditor Mike Harmon already announced he’s in the race.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The state’s largest health system is ratcheting up pressure to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Ochsner Health told employees it will charge them a monthly premium of $200 if a spouse or domestic partner covered under an Ochsner health plan is not vaccinated, The Times-Picayune/New Orleans Advocate reports. Ochsner has said all employees must be vaccinated by Oct. 29 to keep their jobs. President and CEO Warner Thomas said the surcharge for unvaccinated spouses and partners is part of an effort to keep health premiums low for employees. As a self-insured organization, Ochsner bears the cost of COVID-19 treatment for patients who are on its insurance plan. Unvaccinated people account for the vast majority of the health system’s COVID-19 patients. The vaccine fee for spouses and domestic partners will begin in 2022 and could deduct up to $2,400 yearly from the employee’s paycheck. Meanwhile, Louisiana is trying to encourage more people to get COVID-19 shots by offering them a cash incentive. Gov. John Bel Edwards announced Friday that the state’s “Shot for 100” program, which has been offering $100 cash cards to college students who get vaccinated, is expanding to offer the money to anyone who gets newly immunized against COVID-19.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Gov. Janet Mills’ administration submitted an application to the federal government Friday to lease about 15 square miles for a floating offshore wind research area. The Democratic governor has touted the project as the nation’s first such site in federal waters and a chance to chart a new course for renewable energy. Maine wants to deploy a dozen or so wind turbines on floating hulls designed by the University of Maine. The research site would be located almost 30 miles offshore. The Governor’s Energy Office submitted its application to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. The project “will help establish the best way for our state to embrace the vast economic and environmental benefits of offshore wind,” Mills said. Members of the state’s fishing industry have pushed back at plans for offshore wind off Maine. In response, Mills signed off on a prohibition of offshore wind projects in state waters in July.\n\nMaryland\n\nBowie: Six Flags America is scaling back hours during its annual Halloween events after a series of fights broke out over a recent weekend at the amusement park in the suburbs of the nation’s capital. A melee prompted the park to close an hour early Sept. 25, and the park said it would begin closing its gates at 9 p.m., news outlets report. Patrons won’t be allowed to reenter the park after 6 p.m., and no new entries will be allowed after 7 p.m., Six Flags said in a statement. Prince George’s County police confirmed that officers stationed at the park in Bowie responded to the fights and that several victims have filed reports but said no arrests had been made. Police and park officials said they meet regularly to discuss safety and security plans at the park and were reviewing plans late last week.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: More than a year after they graduated, hundreds of Boston University alumni returned to campus Sunday for a belated commencement ceremony. The university hosted an outdoor graduation event for the Class of 2020, which never had an in-person commencement because of the pandemic. Nearly 2,000 graduates were expected to return for the ceremony at Nickerson Field, school officials said. The ceremony makes good, 17 months later, on the university’s promise that the May 2020 event had been postponed but not canceled because of COVID-19. The school said it’s enforcing public health measures including mandatory mask-wearing indoors. The university requires COVID-19 vaccination for all students and staff and said it’s “strongly encouraged” for visitors. Victor J. Dzua, president of the National Academy of Medicine, was slated to deliver a commencement address. The ceremony was one of several events planned as part of the university’s alumni weekend. Anyone who earned a degree from September 2019 through September 2020 was eligible to register for the belated commencement. The Class of 2021 had its own in-person commencement this year, although it was scaled back to meet city and state gathering limits.\n\nMichigan\n\nGrand Rapids: The grand prize winner of ArtPrize is an old phone booth on a pedestrian bridge. Not just any phone booth, “Before You Go” allows people to listen to advice about life recorded by more than 100 local residents and others. The mother-son team of Monica Pritchard and Christian Reichle won the $50,000 prize Friday. “I’ve just had a passion for telling peoples’ stories in terms of business, and I’ve been sharing that with my son,” said Pritchard, who works as an executive sales coach. “Christian helped me make it come alive.” Pritchard said she and her son didn’t enter the competition to win it. “You pour your heart into something, and you don’t know how it’s going to go,” Reichle said. “To have the reception that we had, and then to win, is huge.” ArtPrize ended Sunday, but people still can experience “Before You Go.” The phone line where the messages are recorded can be accessed by calling (888) 665-2036. For 18 days, a variety of art was displayed in parks, museums, galleries, vacant buildings and other venues.\n\nMinnesota\n\nIsabella: The last remaining closure order related to wildfires in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness has now been lifted, according to Superior National Forest officials. A hot and abnormally dry summer caused extreme fire danger and prompted a complete closure of the popular wilderness area in northern Minnesota for a couple of weeks after wildfires broke out. The last remaining closure related to the John Ek and Whelp fires has now been lifted. Cooler conditions and recent rainfall have helped keep the fires in check. “We have not seen any smoke from the fire for a couple of weeks now, and we feel comfortable lifting this closure as this fire is unlikely to spread much, if at all,” said Patty Johnson, the forest’s East Zone fire management officer. The BWCA received 3 to 6 inches of rain in September, which is about normal for the month. But officials say over the longer term, the region remains in drought conditions, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. Fire crews have now removed all pumps, hoses and other equipment that had been staged for the John Ek fire. Meanwhile, to the south and outside the wilderness boundary, the Forest Service has scaled back the closure area around the Greenwood fire, which has reached 80% containment.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The leader of a pediatricians’ organization is urging school districts to keep mask mandates in place to slow the spread of COVID-19. “Many school boards in Mississippi are removing mask requirements,” Dr. Anita Henderson of Hattiesburg, president of the Mississippi Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said Thursday on Twitter. “Kids under 12 cannot be vaccinated and only about 30% of all 12-17 year-olds in Mississippi are fully vaccinated. Now is not the time to let our guard down.” The Mississippi State Department of Health has reported nine pediatric deaths from COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic. The state saw a significant surge in COVID-19 cases, deaths and hospitalizations starting in July, but numbers have decreased in recent weeks. In central Mississippi, the Madison County School District removed most of its mask mandate as of Sept. 24, making masks optional in most places but still required on buses. The district has about 13,000 students. The Rankin County School Board voted Sept. 22 to remove a mandate, saying that masks are now “not required but highly recommended” in the district with more than 18,000 students. The change in the central Mississippi district came weeks after some parents protested the mandate at a school board meeting.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Several thousand Missourians who previously were not eligible for Medicaid are expected to seek the health care coverage now that voter-approved expansion of the program has taken effect. Friday marked the day the health care program began processing applications. Voters approved Medicaid expansion in August 2020. The constitutional amendment passed with 53% of the vote. Previously, the state’s health care program did not cover most adults without children, and its income eligibility threshold for parents was one of the lowest in the nation, at about one-fifth of the poverty level. The expansion is expected to add Medicaid eligibility for up to 275,000 low-income Missourians. It wasn’t immediately clear how many people have applied for Medicaid under the expansion. A spokeswoman for the Missouri Department of Social Services said enrollment information for October won’t be posted until November. The expansion was the subject of a court case that wound up in the Missouri Supreme Court, where a July decision paved the way for the plan to move forward.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Most of the state’s Republican lawmakers are urging their leadership to appoint a special committee to investigate the security of the state’s voting system. The effort is led by GOP legislators who are pushing false theories of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election, the Montana State News Bureau reports. Republicans hold a two-thirds majority in the Legislature. The letter, signed by 86 of the state’s 98 GOP lawmakers, was sent Wednesday to Senate President Mark Blasdel and House Speaker Wylie Galt and asks for a response by Oct. 6. Blasdel declined to comment Friday, and the bureau could not reach Galt for comment. The letter proposes forming a committee, whose membership also would be two-thirds Republican, to conduct hearings about the election process and security and decide if any new laws are needed. “Many of our constituents have reached out to us with questions about Montana election security,” the letter said. “All Montana voters must have absolute faith in our state, county and local elections.” Montana House Minority Leader Kim Abbott, D-Helena, said the Republican letter offers no evidence that there are any problems with the state’s election system. County election officials run fair and secure elections following state laws, Abbott said Friday.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A state contractor that places Omaha-area children in foster homes, checks on their welfare and ensures their needs are met has been temporarily barred from taking any new cases because it’s struggling to fulfill the requirements of its contract. The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services set the 60-day restriction on Kansas-based St. Francis Ministries on Thursday. State officials also granted the provider a probationary license as a child placing agency. The department said state child welfare workers will handle new cases in Douglas and Sarpy counties during the probationary period. The state will rely on existing staff members to manage cases and hire additional workers. State officials have said St. Francis has failed to meet several of its contractual obligations over the past two years and has faced major financial problems. State officials negotiated a new contract with the provider in January, about three weeks before St. Francis was expected to run out of money. St. Francis initially won the Nebraska job by offering to do it for $197 million over five years, less than 60% of the bid from PromiseShip, the Omaha-based agency that held the previous state contract. Nebraska lawmakers and child advocates raised concerns at the time, but state officials gave reassurances.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: People who are healing and some still struggling gathered Friday to remember those who died and were injured during the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history four years ago on the Las Vegas Strip. “I was wounded. Those physical wounds have healed,” said Dee Ann Hyatt, whose daughter also was hurt and whose brother died in the Oct. 1, 2017, shooting. “But the lasting scars for our family remain.” Hyatt spoke to several hundred people during a sunrise ceremony at the Clark County Government Center in Las Vegas. She remembered her slain brother, Kurt von Tillow, a trucker from Northern California, before a screen at an outdoor amphitheater that displayed photos of the dead. Fifty-eight people were killed that night, and two others died later. More than 850 were injured. “We continue to live the impact of all that happened that night, four years later,” Hyatt said. “People thrive and people struggle to live with the physical and mental pain, and our lives are forever changed.” The morning memorial featured a song, “Four Years After,” sung by Matt Sky, that was composed for the anniversary by Mark R. Johnson and released with multi-Grammy award winner Alan Parsons.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A proposed rule that would severely limit remote instruction options for schools won’t go before the state Board of Education until November, but state officials already are advising districts to follow it. School districts currently can shift to fully remote or hybrid instruction for all students due to COVID-19 outbreaks. But under an administrative rule proposed by the Department of Education, schools would be required to provide in-person instruction five days per week except in cases of inclement weather or when a parent requests remote learning for an individual student. In an email to school leaders last month, Education Commissioner Frank Edelblut instructed schools on how to comply with what he called the “recently advanced” rules, without describing the current rules. Schools are permitted to offer remote instruction to individual students who have contracted COVID-19, are required to quarantine because a household contact is infected or have other family circumstances that prevent in-person attendance, he said. “I think there’s a little bit of a shift that’s taking place because we’re not in the same circumstances we found ourselves in last year, so people have to shift their mindsets,” he said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nLeesburg: A corrections officer at a state prison in southern New Jersey was arrested Friday on charges he beat and humiliated inmates without provocation or justification, according to federal prosecutors. John Makos, 41, a Millville resident who works at Bayside State Prison in Leesburg, was charged with conspiracy to deprive the inmates of their civil rights. He has been suspended from his job. From April through December 2019, prosecutors said Makos conspired with others at the prison to assault and punish certain inmates in a cruel and arbitrary manner by using excessive force that caused physical injury and pain. Prosecutors said Makos and at least one other corrections officer established an ad hoc regime of physical punishments for actual and perceived violations of the prison’s rules and customs and meted out the punishments in a cruel and degrading manner, at times with the aid of other inmates. Certain prisoners were singled out for brutal beatings, humiliation and assaults that only ended when the prisoner was close to passing out, according to a criminal complaint. In what was known to inmates as the “fence treatment,” prosecutors said Makos handcuffed a prisoner to a fence in the back area of the prison’s kitchen and the other arm to a swinging door, so the inmate would appear to be crucified.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Hundreds of hot air balloons created a colorful tapestry against a blue sky Saturday, kicking off a nine-day annual event that was canceled last year due to the pandemic. The 7 a.m. mass ascension was the first of five scheduled for the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta, which draws visitors from around the world. Two balloons hit power lines Sunday and caused a brief outage for more than 1,000 Public Service Company of New Mexico customers, who the company said were without electricity for a couple hours. No injuries were reported. Organizers of the fiesta said more than 540 balloons were registered this year. The 2019 event drew nearly 600 balloons from across the U.S. and 17 other countries. Organizers said they wouldn’t be checking for COVID-19 vaccination cards but noted precautions were being taken to preserve social distancing and provide access to hand sanitizer and hand-washing stations. Indoor dining for balloon pilots and VIPs was canceled. More than 80 balloons in special ornate or cartoonish shapes were disbursed throughout the launch field, rather than clustered together, encouraging crowds to spread out, fiesta spokesman Tom Garrity said. Scheduled events included a chain saw carving display, fireworks, sky divers, musical stage performances and a strolling mariachi band.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor on Friday denied an emergency appeal from a group of teachers to block the city’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate for public school teachers and other staff from going into effect. The teachers had filed for the injunction with Sotomayor on Thursday, in an effort to keep the mandate from going into effect Friday. Under the mandate rules, the roughly 148,000 school employees had until 5 p.m. Friday to get at least their first vaccine shot. Those who didn’t face suspension without pay when schools open Monday. Georgia Pestana, the city’s corporation counsel, said in a statement: “We are gratified by Justice Sotomayor’s decision. She made the right call on the law and in the best interest of students and educators.” Vinoo Varghese, an attorney for the teachers, said in an email: “We are disappointed, but the fight for our clients’ due process and those similarly situated will go on.” An original deadline earlier last week was delayed after a legal challenge, but a federal appeals panel said Monday that New York City could go ahead with the mandate in the country’s largest school district.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Legislative leaders and Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper announced agreement Friday on an energy bill that aims to meet Cooper’s goals on greenhouse gas reductions and gives dominant utility Duke Energy the ability to seek multiyear rate increases. The measure, which is expected to clear the Republican-controlled Legislature this week, removes most of the prescriptive actions that House Republicans laid out in an earlier version of the bill that passed the chamber in July. Instead, the new bill, largely negotiated between the Cooper administration and senators from both parties, directs the state Utilities Commission to come up with a roadmap by the end of 2022 on how to move toward goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions that align with Cooper’s Clean Energy Plan. That plan seeks to reduce carbon dioxide levels from energy producers by 70% compared to 2005 levels by 2030 and achieve net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050. The House plan would have contributed to a 62% reduction in power-sector greenhouse gas emissions by the end of the decade, according to an estimate by the commission’s public staff.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum and health officials said Friday that hospital capacity is reaching critical levels and urged residents to take action to help ease the crisis. State officials are urging the public to take a range of steps to help reduce hospitalizations, from avoiding high-risk activities to practicing defensive driving. The Bismarck Tribune reports COVID-19 hospitalizations in the state surpassed 160 on Friday for the first time in nearly 10 months, and the percentage of staffed hospital beds in North Dakota that remained available fell below 10%. “We all need to do our part to avoid hospitalization and prevent further strain on these facilities and their staff as we work through this incredibly challenging time,” said Burgum, a Republican. Hospital capacity has been a concern the past couple of months because of the spread of the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus. The 161 patients listed on the Health Department’s virus dashboard Friday was the most since mid-December. The most recent state data showed 214 available staffed inpatient beds and 15 available intensive care unit beds statewide. North Dakota’s six largest hospitals on Friday reported 43 patients had been sent to other facilities, sometimes hundreds of miles away.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state doubled the amount of money for its new Vax-to-College program Friday to $2 million and plans to expand the age range to include children 5 and older once a COVID-19 vaccine is authorized for them at the end of the month. “This is the time for younger Ohioans to get the facts and to make the choice to get the COVID-19 vaccine to help protect themselves and others,” Dr. Bruce Vanderhoff, the state health director, said during a press conference. The announcement comes as health officials across Ohio have been sounding the alarm about the rate of younger patients becoming sick and hospitalized with the disease. The overwhelming majority of those patients are unvaccinated. Vanderhoff detailed the changes in the new program in an effort to boost the number of vaccinations, which include increasing the number of $10,000 scholarships to 150 and the hope of expanding the age group to include younger Ohioans. Unlike under the Vax-a-Million program introduced in the spring, winners can put the money toward anything from college to trade school to other advancement opportunities. The program had initially targeted residents ages 12-25 who received vaccines but is now awaiting the FDA emergency use authorization for the Pfizer shot expected in late October to include 5- to 11-year-olds.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Students scored lower on standardized tests in 2021 following a year of disruptions due to the coronavirus pandemic, according to the Oklahoma State Department of Education. The department reported 22.1% scored proficient in math, 24.8% in English language arts and 29.7% in science. The last testing, in 2019, found 31.9% proficient in math, 33.4% in English language arts and 34.5% in science. “The effects of the pandemic will be seen and felt for years to come,” said State Superintendent of Public Instruction Joy Hofmeister. “There is no quick fix.” The education department said Thursday that the number of students taking the tests declined following a year in which schools statewide adopted online classes or a blend of online and in-person classes due to the pandemic. The federal education department waived its requirement that at least 95% of students take the tests. The state education department reported 92% of students were tested in math, 92% in ELA and 91% in science. “We are asking schools and districts to engage in a deeper exploration of their data to understand who tested and who did not test while considering local context and variables,” said Maria Cammack, deputy superintendent for the state department.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state’s attorney general filed lawsuits Friday against two counties that had adopted ordinances that sought to nullify new statewide gun safety laws and declared themselves “Second Amendment Sanctuaries.” In her lawsuits against Yamhill and Harney counties, Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum asked the circuit courts in those jurisdictions to declare the ordinances “invalid and void” because they conflict “with paramount state law.” “Gun safety laws exist to help keep guns out of dangerous hands and keep people safe. A county commission simply doesn’t get to override state law in this way,” Rosenblum said. The ordinances, passed by county commissioners in the two counties earlier this year, did not apply to local, federal or state firearms regulations that were in effect as of last February. But they did encompass a bill passed by the Legislature and signed by the governor June 1 that mandates the safe storage of guns and bans them from the Oregon State Capitol and Portland International Airport. The new law, which went into effect Sept. 24, also allows public school districts, community colleges and universities to set their own policy banning guns.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The deadline passed Friday for Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration to comply with a subpoena from a Republican-controlled state Senate committee pursuing what the GOP calls a “forensic investigation” of last year’s presidential election, as a state court sorted through three legal challenges. Wolf’s administration and Senate Republicans remained silent in the matter Friday. The court was expected to set up an expedited briefing schedule in one or all of the cases. Challengers, including Senate Democrats and state Attorney General Josh Shapiro, have sought broadly to block the subpoena, saying it is an abuse of legislative power, and in particular have challenged its request for the driver’s license numbers and partial Social Security numbers of roughly 9 million registered voters. Republicans maintain they are attempting to find and fix problems in last year’s presidential election and this year’s primary election. Democrats accuse them of helping perpetuate baseless claims that former President Donald Trump was cheated out of victory. It’s not clear whether Wolf’s administration can be forced to comply with a Senate subpoena. Democrat Joe Biden beat Trump in Pennsylvania by more than 80,000 votes, according to certified results.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Daniel McKee said Friday that the administration would try to find new assignments for health care workers employed by the state who are refusing a COVID-19 vaccination. The state’s health care worker vaccine mandate took effect Friday, the day after a federal judge tossed a constitutional challenge to the requirement filed by four people who work in the health care field. Workers who don’t comply are at risk of losing their state licenses and jobs. McKee said during an appearance on WPRO radio that there are a “small amount” of holdouts, but he doesn’t want to put people out of work. “We might be able to put them in another department,” he said. “We don’t want people to be without pay or without health care coverage, and we’re going to do everything we can to make sure that doesn’t happen.” He said he would also encourage hospitals and other health care organizations to take the same approach. He stood by the mandate. “We’ve made a policy that we feel as though is in the best interest of the safety of the people in the state of Rhode Island,” he told the station. Some unvaccinated workers will be allowed to work an extra 30 days beyond Friday’s deadline if their absence would compromise patient care.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nHunting Island: A 950-foot-long fishing pier at one of the state’s most popular parks – partially destroyed by Hurricane Matthew and closed for five years – has reopened, restoring an important public access to the Atlantic Ocean. The pier at Hunting Island State Park, 15 miles east of Beaufort, is in effect a sidewalk that extends three football fields from shore. It offers visitors front-row access to great fishing, wildlife viewing and solitude. When Matthew made landfall in October 2016, it caused extensive damage to Hunting Island, including the pier, making it unsafe and prompting its closure. “We’ve been waiting for this to open,” said Brian Gilfedder of Beaufort, who was fishing on the pier with his wife, Mary Lou, on a recent sunny afternoon. The new pier is wonderful, the Gilfedders said, echoing others who were fishing or just sitting on a bench, drinking in the ocean, last week as feeding dolphins thrashed in the shallows nearby. “When it was closed, we couldn’t fish,” said John Freeman, a St. Helena Island resident who lives at Eddings Point and been fishing from the pier for years. From the pier, visitors can see waves rolling in from the Atlantic Ocean onto the barrier island. Also visible from the pier: Fripp Island and “Little Hunting Island,” the product of a hurricane that breached a lagoon, cutting the beach in two.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem said Friday that she will relaunch the state’s review of social study standards after it was mired in controversy. The Republican governor said she has “set aside” the standards proposed by the Department of Education and told the department to restart the process, saying everyone who has expressed concern about the process, including Native Americans, will be included in the do-over. “Our kids deserve to learn both America’s and South Dakota’s true and honest history, taught in a balanced context that doesn’t pit our children against each other on the basis of race, sex, or background,” Noem said in a statement. New standards are released every seven years. The governor’s plan calls for a new workgroup of people from across the state to develop the standards. Members of the previous working group – appointed by the Department of Education – said in August that they were caught by surprise on Friday when the department released a document with significant changes that cut references to Native American history and culture. Conservatives have also criticized the Department of Education’s proposed standards.\n\nTennessee\n\nMurfreesboro: About 1,450 people jailed illegally as minors can claim part of an $11 million class-action settlement, but fewer than 200 people have filed eligible claims. The lawsuit revealed the Rutherford County Juvenile Detention Center regularly locked up children for misdemeanor charges, including truancy, school fights and disobeying parents, plaintiffs’ attorney Kyle Mothershead said. The suit started by challenging the incarceration of children arrested at Hobgood Elementary School in Murfreesboro before expanding to include other youth jailed at the detention center on minor charges. Tennessee law strictly prohibits the pretrial incarceration of children unless they are charged with a violent felony, weapons offense or probation violation, according to the complaint filed in July 2017. Under the terms of a June 2021 settlement, eligible plaintiffs will get $4,800 per illegal incarceration and $1,000 per arrest. The original plaintiffs will receive a larger settlement. They include Kazmere Watts, who’ll receive about $31,000 after he was incarcerated for seven days for a school fight. He punched another student, but that student wasn’t seriously injured. “That was the first time I ever got into trouble,” said Watts, who was a freshman in 2014. “I wasn’t trying to hurt him. You’re a kid. You do foolish stuff.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A man seen on surveillance video wearing an American flag bandanna when he threw a Molotov cocktail into a county Democratic Party headquarters was arrested, a fire official said. Ryan Faircloth, 30, was booked Friday in the Travis County jail. He was charged with arson and possessing a prohibited weapon – the Molotov cocktail – according to Austin Fire arson investigator Capt. Jeffrey Deane. Investigators received multiple tips after releasing the surveillance video. One of the tips led to Faircloth’s social media. Information found online and other evidence led arson investigators and the FBI to make the arrest, Deane said at a news conference. “This person was not happy with the current political climate. He blamed this office and who they represent for a lot of the issues that he saw as problems with the country,” Deane said. “He was forthcoming and confessed to that.” Deane also said Faircloth left a note at the scene. He declined to give specifics on the contents of the letter but said the suspect alluded to possible plans for future attacks, which led investigators to act quickly to get him off the streets. It was unclear whether Faircloth had an attorney who could comment on his behalf.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints urged members Saturday to listen to the faith’s leaders when they seek “pure truth” and expressed gratitude for those who have followed church guidance on the pandemic, which includes getting COVID-19 shots. President Russell M. Nelson acknowledged at a church conference that the world is “still dealing with the ravages of COVID-19 and its variants.” And while he didn’t mention vaccines specifically, he thanked members for following the advice of church leaders, medical experts and government officials. The Utah-based faith has repeatedly encouraged its 16 million members worldwide to limit the spread by getting vaccines and wearing masks. “Contrary to the doubts of some, there really is such a thing as right and wrong. There really is absolute truth – eternal truth,” Nelson said from inside a mostly empty conference center in Salt Lake City. “One of the plagues of our day is that too few people know where to turn for truth. I can assure you that what you will hear today and tomorrow constitutes pure truth.” The two-day conference was taking place again without full attendance due to the pandemic, but for the first time in two years, leaders were back at the faith’s 20,000-seat conference center, with several hundred people watching in person.\n\nVermont\n\nCharlotte: A $6 million gift is going to the Vermont Land Trust to help diversify farm ownership, make farming more economically viable, and promote farming practices that contribute to clean water, healthy soil, and climate resilience, the High Meadows Fund, Vermont Land Trust and Vermont Community Foundation announced. A fund will be created with $2 million to expand land ownership and access among people who have been historically marginalized or oppressed based on their race or ethnicity, the groups said Thursday. According to the 2017 U.S. agriculture census, just 17 of the nearly 7,000 farms in Vermont are owned by Black people. “A gift of this kind could help all of us, particularly those who have been historically marginalized or oppressed,” Lydia Clemmons, president and executive director of the Clemmons Family Farm in Charlotte, said in a statement. A total of $4 million will go toward expanding the land trust’s work “to put hundreds of farmers onto the land operating successful businesses over the next 10 years,” the groups said. The Vermont Land Trust and a diverse group of farmers and community leaders will be holding discussions on how to design and increase the $2 million fund to expand land ownership and access, the groups said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A child under the age of 10 died of COVID-19 on Wednesday in eastern Virginia – the second fatal juvenile case of the week in the region, health officials confirmed. A health department spokesperson, Larry Hill, told the Richmond Times-Dispatch he could not provide any further information about the child, whose death occurred just two days after that of 10-year-old Teresa Sperry. According to officials, they are the 12th and 13th juvenile deaths in the state since the beginning of the pandemic. Sperry, who was from Suffolk, started exhibiting severe symptoms Sept. 26 but was sent home from Sentara Obici Hospital after a chest scan came back clear. The next day, Sperry stopped breathing, her family told The Virginian Pilot. She was taken back to Sentara Obici Hospital in Suffolk. She was then transferred to Children’s Hospital of The King’s Daughters in Norfolk, where she died. Sperry’s death was officially recorded Thursday by the Virginia Department of Health but was widely reported by local news outlets Wednesday. Sperry’s mother, Nicole, wrote on Facebook that her daughter was tasked with walking sick children in her class to the clinic at Hillpoint Elementary School. Nicole Sperry said she attributes her daughter’s death to parents allowing their sick children to attend school.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: State correctional facilities will no longer place people in custody in solitary confinement as a punishment, after state officials determined it is not effective. The Washington Department of Corrections made the announcement Thursday, saying the policy has been in effect for the past two weeks, The Seattle Times reports. Corrections Secretary Cheryl Strange called it a historic moment in the department and a “key step in becoming a human-centered organization by advancing proven correctional practices and methods that support individuals in change.” She also said the practice has not been effective at deterring negative behavior. The agency collected data on the practice of isolating incarcerated people for punishment. It found that of 2,500 incidents in which people were subjected to disciplinary segregation from Sept. 1, 2019, through Aug. 31, 2020, most – 57% – were disciplined for nonviolent infractions. People who received disciplinary segregation on average spent from 11 to 16 days in isolation. Many had already been subjected to administrative segregation, which involves isolating a person for the safety of themselves or others, while their disciplinary hearing was pending. Most received credit for that time served in administrative segregation – which will remain in effect, officials said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Two fathers are suing state officials over a law that allows charter schools to open without the approval of local voters, the Charleston Gazette-Mail reports. The lawsuit filed this past week in Kanawha County Circuit Court claims the law is unconstitutional and asks the judge to stop a newly created West Virginia Professional Charter School Board from authorizing any schools. The suit comes after Republican state lawmakers in March amended an earlier charter school law, making it easier for them to win approval. The amendments created the Professional Charter School Board, which can approve both online charters that operate statewide and brick-and-mortar charter schools operating in individual districts. Those schools can be approved even in counties where the local boards of education are opposed to them. The Professional Charter School Board is unelected. Instead, members are appointed by the governor and then confirmed or rejected by the state Senate. The four proposed board members are currently awaiting confirmation, even as they review applications to open new schools. The two fathers who are suing over the new law are both public school teachers and teachers’ union members. Defendants in the case include Gov. Jim Justice and the leaders of the House of Delegates and Senate.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The former state Supreme Court justice leading Assembly Republicans’ probe of the 2020 election has sent subpoenas to election officials in Wisconsin’s five largest cities and the state elections administrator demanding information about private donations used to run voting operations. Michael Gableman sent subpoenas to election officials in Milwaukee, Green Bay, Madison, Kenosha and Racine as well as Wisconsin Elections Commission Administrator Meagan Wolfe. The subpoenas seek documents related to grants from the Center for Tech and Civic Life, which gave more than $10 million to more than 200 Wisconsin communities last year to help cover election costs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of the money went to those five cities, drawing criticism from Republicans that the money was meant to boost turnout in Democratic areas. The subpoenas command the officials to appear before Gableman in Brookfield on Oct. 15 with their documents. A recount and court decisions have affirmed that President Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump in Wisconsin by almost 21,000 votes. Only four voters out of roughly 3 million who cast ballots have been charged with fraud.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: Books about sex, LGBTQ issues and how to have a baby have public library employees in a deeply conservative city facing possible prosecution after angry local residents complained to police that the material is obscene and doesn’t belong in sections for children and teenagers. For weeks, Campbell County Public Library officials have been facing a local outcry over the books and for scheduling a magician who is transgender to perform for youngsters – an act canceled amid threats against the magician and library staff. The books are “This Book is Gay” by Juno Dawson, “How Do You Make a Baby” by Anna Fiske, “Doing It” by Hannah Witton, “Sex is a Funny Word” by Corey Silverberg, and “Dating and Sex: A Guide for the 21st Century Teen Boy” by Andrew P. Smiler, according to Susan Sisti, a local pastor who has been raising concerns about those and other books in the library. “It’s really easy to go into the library and look around a little bit and find a filthy book that should not even be in a public library,” said Sisti, pastor of Open Door Church in Gillette. Now, after a complaint filed with the sheriff’s office, prosecutors are reviewing the case. They will seek appointment of a special prosecutor to weigh in as well before deciding whether to pursue charges, County Attorney Mitchell Damsky said Friday.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/04"}]}

Kay Ivey on Monday made her first public appearance in nearly three weeks, telling reporters she was in good health but also declining to say whether she had undergone any recent medical treatment. Ivey toured a science and technology lab at Dalraida Elementary School in Montgomery in her first public appearance since an Aug. 2 groundbreaking ceremony. The gap between appearances fueled speculation about the 77-year-old governor’s health. “I’ve got a clean bill of health from the doctors, and I’m looking forward to serving for four more years as governor,” Ivey told reporters. She brushed aside questions about whether she had recently undergone medical treatment in a hospital and did not directly answer. “It just seems like a lot of you just want to will these rumors into being, and that just isn’t going to happen,” the Republican governor responded, according to al.com. “I’ve got a clean bill of health from the doctors. That’s what matters, and I’m looking forward to serving four more years as your governor.” Ivey’s office on Aug. 12 began releasing occasional photos of her at work to combat the rumors, beginning with a photo of her greeting South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem at an airport when Noem arrived in Alabama for a speech.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A state corporation is the only remaining leaseholder in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge that intends to pursue plans to explore for oil and gas on the refuge’s coastal plain after another private company gave up its lease in the region. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management said Knik Arm Services, a small real estate and leasing firm, asked to have its 49,000-acre lease rescinded and lease payments refunded. The federal agency said it will honor the request made last week, the Anchorage Daily News reports. Knik Arm Services was one of two private companies that won leases in a sale held in the waning days of the Trump administration. The other, oil company Regenerate Alaska, gave up its lease earlier this year. The Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, a state corporation, acquired seven leases in the sale. It is suing federal officials over what it calls improper actions that are preventing lease activities. The corporation got the leases to preserve drilling rights in case oil companies did not come forward. Mark Graber, who owns Knik Arm Services, said he invested about $2 million into his lease and for a first-year lease payment. He said he had wanted to hold onto his lease in hopes that the state corporation prevailed in its lawsuit and that oil development would produce royalties for his company. But he said the fight over the leases could take years.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A controversial state law restricting how the public can film police faced its first legal challenge Tuesday with a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union. The group’s Arizona chapter, joined by several news organizations in the state, filed a petition in U.S. District Court arguing the law criminalizes First Amendment freedoms. “This law is a violation of a vital constitutional right and will severely thwart attempts to build police accountability. It must be struck down before it creates irreparable community harm,” the ACLU wrote in a statement on its blog. In the complaint, the group contends the law not only has “blatant constitutional issues” but is too ambiguous in some parts. They are seeking an injunction barring law enforcement and others from enforcing the law. Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, Maricopa County Attorney General Rachel Mitchell and Maricopa County Sheriff Paul Penzone are all named as defendants. The law, signed by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey in July, makes it illegal to knowingly film police officers from 8 feet or closer without an officer’s permission. An officer can order someone to stop filming even if they are on private property recording with the owner’s consent if an officer finds they’re interfering or deems the area unsafe.\n\nArkansas\n\nMulberry: Federal authorities have now started a civil rights investigation following the suspension of three law enforcement officers after a video posted on social media showed two of them beating a man while a third officer held him on the ground. The officers were responding to a report of a man making threats outside a convenience store Sunday in the small town of Mulberry, about 140 miles northwest of Little Rock, near the border with Oklahoma, authorities said. Arkansas State Police said the agency would investigate the use of force. State police identified the suspect as Randal Worcester, 27, of Goose Creek, South Carolina. The attorney for the two deputies said Monday that Worcester attacked one of the deputies, giving him a concussion. The video shows one officer punching the suspect with a clenched fist, while another can be seen hitting the man with his knee. The third officer holds him against the pavement. In video recorded from a car nearby, someone yells at officers to stop hitting the man in the head. Two of the officers appear to look up and say something back to the person who yelled. The officers’ comments could not be heard clearly on the video.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill Monday that he said could have brought “a world of unintended consequences” by allowing Los Angeles, Oakland and San Francisco to set up sites where opioid users could legally inject drugs under supervision. “The unlimited number of safe injection sites that this bill would authorize – facilities which could exist well into the later part of this decade – could induce a world of unintended consequences,” Newsom said. While he said the sites could be helpful, he worried that “if done without a strong plan, they could work against this purpose” and said that “worsening drug consumption challenges in these areas is not a risk we can take.” It was one of the most watched and most controversial measures of this legislative session. Proponents wanted to give people who already use drugs a place to inject them while trained staff stand by to help if they suffer accidental overdoses. The proposal came amid a spike in overdose deaths and a national opioid crisis. But opponents said the move in effect would have condoned the use of dangerous drugs. “Each year this legislation is delayed, more people die of drug overdoses,” said state Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat from San Francisco who authored the California legislation.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: There is no evidence a woman who lost custody of her 7-year-old son for allegedly lying about his health problems plotted with QAnon supporters to have him kidnapped from foster care, her lawyer told jurors Monday at the start of her trial. The prosecution’s case about the alleged plot in 2019 is based on the account of Cynthia Abcug’s then-16-year-old daughter, who told her counselor that her mother was talking with followers of the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory about launching a raid on the home, defense lawyer Brian Hall said during opening statements in court in Castle Rock in suburban Denver. Many QAnon supporters believe ex-President Donald Trump was fighting enemies in the so-called deep state to expose a group of satanic, cannibalistic child molesters they believe secretly runs the globe. Hall stressed that the girl did not know details about what was supposed to happen and did not think her mother knew where her son’s foster home was. But Chief Deputy District Gary Dawson told the jury that the daughter heard her mother talking about the raid on several occasions in September and August of 2019. Around that same time, Abcug bought a gun, and a man identified only as Ryan and described as an ex-member of the military and a sniper moved into their home to provide protection, Dawson said. An older son who was no longer living at home will also testify that he remembers Abcug talking about launching a raid to get her young son back, Dawson said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNorwich: A city-maintained list of historic buildings could be the start to revitalizing the waterfront along the Thames River. A Local Historic Inventory was created during Monday’s Norwich City Council meeting, with a list of historic properties that the city would like to redevelop. All are located within areas determined by the Federal Emergency Management Association to be flood hazard areas and aren’t currently recognized by the National Register of Historic Places. The need for a list comes from a FEMA rule, which prohibits improvements worth more than half a property’s value yearly for buildings in a flood hazard area, likely preventing a quick redevelopment, Norwich Mayor Peter Nystrom said. “If you only allow (developers) to redevelop a site in a piecemeal fashion, it ties the hands of anyone interested in developing a site like that,” he said. There is an exception is if a property is on a recognized list of historic places. A property can join the National Register of Historic Places with a State Historic Preservation Office nomination. The property must be of sufficient age and historical significance, while retaining much of its historic character. If the property can make the list, there are tax credits and legal recourse to prevent demolition, said Regan Miner, executive director of the Norwich Historical Society, who was a consultant for the city in picking the list.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: DuPont plans to build a new production facility in Glasgow to support the expansion of the company’s semiconductor materials business. The new facility will likely be the first building in a 1 million-square-foot logistics park planned in the city. Once complete, about 70 current employees will move to the site. DuPont intends to hire about 10 new positions. DuPont estimates it will invest $50 million in the facility. The state on Monday approved taxpayer-funded grants up to $1.64 million to support job growth and construction of the building. “The DuPont Company has been part of Delaware’s DNA for 220 years,” Gov. John Carney said in a statement. “With this expansion of their semiconductor division, the company is showing their commitment to our state and workforce.” One member of the Council on Development Finance, the state board tasked with determining whether to give businesses money to relocate to or expand in Delaware, voted against the grants. State Rep. Ed Osienski of Newark pointed to DuPont’s history of downsizing within Delaware as cause for concern. “It’s great that you’re considering staying here, but I question the need for Delawareans to come up with $1.6 million to get DuPont to remain here and add some jobs when Delaware suffered a lot,” Osienski said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The states of Arizona and Texas continue to send asylum-seekers to the district as the school year approaches for children, but the Pentagon has again turned down a request from the mayor for National Guard aid, WUSA-TV reports. More than 8,700 asylum-seekers have been sent to D.C. from both states since April. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s office said his state has sent about 7,200 migrants on 175 buses to the nation’s capital so far, while Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey’s office said 1,516 migrants have gotten on 41 buses to go to the district. About 1,300 migrants have been bused to D.C. from those states over the past month alone. Many of the buses that have rolled into Union Station have included children. Neither state could provide data on just how many of the bus passengers were below the age of 18, but it appears they will be welcome in DC Public Schools this fall. “School-aged children will go to school,” Mayor Muriel Bowser said Monday. “That’s the plan.” Many of the kids who have been bused to D.C. have come with very little, said Madhvi Bahl, a migrant organizer with Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid Network and Sanctuary DMV. She said efforts are ongoing to collect supplies for them for the upcoming school year.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: The president of a local NAACP branch has resigned, saying that as a South Asian woman she experienced “racist marginalization” from others in the civil rights group. Dr. Vanessa Toolsie, an elected vice president of the Orange County branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, became its leader in March when Tiffany Hughes resigned to run for a Florida legislative seat. Born in Trinidad of Indian descent, she posted a lengthy resignation letter on Facebook on the NAACP branch’s Facebook page Sunday, the Orlando Sentinel reports. She also placed a brief statement on her personal Facebook page, saying: “I will NO LONGER tolerate ANY racism against me for being a #ProudBrownWoman of #SouthAsian and #Caribbean descent,” the Orlando Sentinel reports. Toolsie read her resignation letter during a virtual board meeting Monday night. One person objected, describing her claims as “false allegations against the executive committee,” the newspaper reports. Others asked in the chat feature whether Toolsie had any proof and what could be done to assure that no one else has a similar experience. The meeting was adjourned without further discussion. “I am concerned about this person and the charges that were made,” John Cummings, a spokesman for the group, told the Sentinel. “We don’t want to overlook or dehumanize or, in any way, cause anybody problems or concern intentionally or unintentionally.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: A company seeking to mine near the edge of the Okefenokee Swamp’s vast wildlife refuge said Monday that its project is back on track after a federal agency reversed a June decision that had posed a big setback. Twin Pines Minerals said the Army Corps of Engineers has agreed to settle a lawsuit filed by the company by once again relinquishing the agency’s regulatory oversight of the proposed titanium and zirconium mine in southeast Georgia near the Okefenokee, home to the largest U.S. wildlife refuge east of the Mississippi River. “We appreciate the Corps’ willingness to reverse itself and make things right,” Twin Pines President Steve Ingle said in a statement, calling the development “great news” for the project. Scientists have warned that mining close to the swamp’s bowl-like rim could damage its ability to hold water. They urged the Army Corps of Engineers to deny the project a permit. But the agency declared in 2020 it no longer had that authority after regulatory rollbacks under then-President Donald Trump narrowed the types of waterways qualifying for protection under the Clean Water Act. Trump’s rollbacks were later scrapped by federal courts. President Joe Biden’s administration has sought to restore federal oversight of development projects that under Trump had been allowed to sidestep regulations to prevent pollution of streams or draining of wetlands.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Calling allegations that a couple stole identities of dead babies for unknown reasons unique, a U.S. judge on Monday upheld a previous ruling to detain the pair without bail. According to prosecutors, Walter Glenn Primrose and Gwynn Darle Morrison are the real names of the couple who have been fraudulently living for decades under stolen identities, Bobby Fort and Julie Montague. The case has drawn speculation about Russian espionage. Prosecutors say Primrose spent more than 20 years in the Coast Guard, where he obtained secret-level security clearance. U.S. District Judge Leslie Kobayashi said the mystery behind why the couple lived under allegedly stolen identities for so long is what makes the case unique “because the real question is, ‘Why?’ ” Primrose and Morrison have pleaded not guilty to conspiracy, false statement in a passport application and aggravated identity theft. Prosecutors have suggested the case is about more than identity theft. A search of the couple’s home in Kapolei, a Honolulu suburb, turned up Polaroids of them wearing jackets that appear to be authentic KGB uniforms, an invisible ink kit, documents with coded language and maps showing military bases, prosecutors said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state’s near-total abortion ban appears to have a serious conflict with a federal law governing emergency health care treatment, a federal judge said Monday. The U.S. Department of Justice sued the Republican-led state of Idaho earlier this month, saying the abortion ban set to take effect Thursday violates a federal law requiring Medicare-funded hospitals to provide “stabilizing treatment” to patients experiencing medical emergencies. Idaho’s law criminalizes all abortions in “clinically diagnosable pregnancies” but allows physicians to defend themselves in court by arguing the procedure was necessary to avert the death of the mother. U.S. District Senior Judge B. Lynn Winmill said the potential conflict exists because Idaho’s law doesn’t appear to account for cases when a pregnant person might face serious medical consequences if the pregnancy is continued. “That is more than just a hypothetical concern,” Winmill told attorneys on both sides during oral arguments in Boise’s federal courthouse. The judge said he would decide by the end of the day Wednesday whether to temporarily block the strict abortion ban while the lawsuit proceeds.\n\nIllinois\n\nEdwardsville: Two young men who died last week after they entered a southern Illinois manhole where toxic gases were present have been identified by a coroner. Madison County Coroner Stephen P. Nonn said Jack M. Pfund, 19, of Edwardsville and Cody W. Toenyes, 22, of Bethalto died Friday at a construction site in Edwardsville. The men were found dead in a manhole leading to a sewer pipe at the residential development, and crews needed advanced breathing equipment to recover their bodies, said Edwardsville Fire Chief James Whiteford. He said first responders were met with “very little oxygen” and a “buildup of toxic gases” that likely led to the workers’ deaths, the Belleville News-Democrat reports. An Edwardsville police officer who was among the first responders at the scene was taken to a hospital for evaluation Friday in the city about 20 miles northeast of St. Louis. Nonn said Tuesday that autopsies found both Pfund and Toenyes’ preliminary causes of death were due to possible asphyxia due to low environmental oxygen and drowning. Toxicological testing that could determine the final causes of death for both men are pending.\n\nIndiana\n\nChesterton: For the second time in three years, a lifeguard shortage has prompted Indiana Dunes State Park to ban swimming until further notice. Visitors can wade up to waist-deep in the waters of Lake Michigan but are not permitted to swim or go deeper into the lake, the park announced Friday. Indiana conservation officers and park staff will be on hand to enforce the ban, it said. Visitors interested in next weekend or Labor Day weekend should monitor the Indiana Dunes State Park Facebook page for notifications regarding beach status, it said. Swimming is permitted at the beach at Indiana Dunes State Park only when lifeguards are present because of frequently changing conditions of the lake bottom and the unpredictability of dangerous rip currents that can occur along the shoreline at the southern tip of Lake Michigan, a news release said. The park is located about 50 miles southeast of Chicago and is a popular summer recreational destination for the region.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The owner of an ethanol plant in the west central Iowa city of Denison has agreed to pay a nearly $210,000 fine for failing to report chemicals that could be released during an emergency, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The penalty was part of a $1.73 million settlement the Andersons Marathon Holdings agreed to pay for 131 reporting violations there and at ethanol plants in Indiana, Michigan and Ohio. The EPA says companies must report annually chemicals released into the air, water or through land disposal via the Toxic Release Inventory, which is meant to provide communities with information to help them respond in an emergency. The fine is the largest the agency has obtained to date under the 1986 Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, the EPA said. The agency said the violations occurred from 2016 to 2020. The EPA found the Andersons Marathon plant in Denison committed 32 violations in which it failed to report the release of chemicals in the plant’s fermentation vapor stream and also failed to provide accurate data. It was fined $209,241. The company also paid $1.52 million for violations at ethanol plants in Logansport, Indiana; Albion, Michigan; and Greenville, Ohio.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The Kansas Museum of History is offering free admission to the public through Sept.3 before it closes to undergo renovations. Carrie Nation’s hatchet, George Armstrong Custer’s riding boots and Dwight D. Eisenhower’s World War II field jacket are among pieces of the past on display at the museum, along with an airplane built in 1914 by Topekan Albin Longren and a steam locomotive, named after Topeka co-founder Cyrus K. Holliday, that was constructed in 1880 for the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway. “Please join us in saying ‘Goodbye to the Past,’ ” the museum said on Facebook. The historical museum will be open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Wednesdays through Saturdays until Sept. 3. The Kansas Historical Society’s Museum Store and Discovery Place have already closed for renovations, while construction is underway near the entrance to the building where they are located, the society’s Facebook site said. The state archives research room and the historical society’s nature trail will remain open during renovations. The museum normally charges admission fees of $10 for adults; $9 for senior citizens, active military and college students with identification; and $5 for youths ages 2 through 17.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear announced Tuesday that he’s calling the Republican-led Legislature into a special session to take up a relief package for flood-ravaged eastern Kentucky. The special session will begin at noon Wednesday, the governor said. The decision to reconvene lawmakers comes after discussions among lawmakers and Beshear’s administration. “We’ve had productive conversations – not bipartisan, but nonpartisan,” the governor said in a tweet. “We have now reached an agreement.” The governor didn’t immediately offer details of the relief package to be presented to lawmakers but wrote: “Together, we can provide the support and relief eastern Kentucky needs.” Historic flooding engulfed parts of eastern Kentucky late last month. The surging floodwaters destroyed homes and caused significant damage to roads, bridges and water systems. The catastrophic flooding caused at least 39 deaths.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A deputy constable for a city court has resigned following allegations that he didn’t act when a witness told him a woman was being raped. The deputy had already been suspended after the allegation was made. The constable for 2nd City Court, Edwin Shorty, told news outlets that the deputy resigned Thursday. The deputy was working a private security detail in the French Quarter on July 26 when he was approached by a witness who said a man was raping an unconscious woman nearby. Shorty said an investigation showed the deputy stayed in his car for several minutes before walking away from the scene. He did not release the deputy’s name. Shorty said the deputy, who had 30 years of law enforcement experience, gave no explanation for his inaction.\n\nMaine\n\nBangor: The federal government will pay $8 million to settle a claim that a federally funded clinic failed to alert a mother or authorities of signs of abuse of a 6-month-old boy. Alexandria Orduna, of Brewer, contended medical professionals failed to recognize or report abuse inflicted on her son by a man who was living with her in 2019. The abuse wasn’t noted and reported until her son was taken to a hospital emergency room in Bangor. The boy is now almost entirely blind, and his brain stopped growing at the time of his attack, the Bangor Daily News reports. “This little boy couldn’t talk, but his body could, and his health care practitioners didn’t listen to what it was saying,” Terry Garmey, one of the mother’s attorneys, told the newspaper. Orduna sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which funds Medicaid, which paid for the boy’s care. The settlement sets aside $17,000 a month in a trust account for the rest of the boy’s life to contribute to the cost of his long-term medical needs and accommodations. The man who inflicted the injuries pleaded guilty last year to aggravated assault and other charges. He was ordered to serve four years in prison.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: The state’s second-largest port is set to receive much-needed dredging and open the door to a continued economic boom thanks to a new agreement. On Friday, Gov. Larry Hogan announced a landmark partnership for a major dredging project totaling 137,000 cubic yards of material dredged from the Port of Salisbury to be reused to benefit over 70 acres on the Deal Island Wildlife Management Area. The material will be used to help restore wetlands, preserve natural habitats and protect infrastructure along the Manokin River to keep pace with rising sea levels. “When we learned about the dredging needs threatening to restrict operations at this port, our team immediately got to work with (our state partners) to focus on solving the problem. Thanks to a unique partnership at all levels of government, we’re moving forward with the dredging of this port,” Hogan said. According to current economic state data, the port transports more than $200 million in goods annually, including grain, petroleum and building aggregates. It has a 150-foot-wide channel and 14-foot-deep mean tide from the Chesapeake Bay to Salisbury.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nMattapoisett: Gasoline vapors ignited by spark during a gas tank replacement project on a boat were the likely cause of a major fire at a marina last week that destroyed buildings, vehicles and boats and sent one employee to the hospital, investigators said. The fire at the Mattapoisett Boatyard on Friday that drew more than 100 firefighters and sent a plume of thick black smoke over southeastern Massachusetts that could be seen for miles was determined to be accidental, according to a statement Monday from the state fire marshal and local authorities. The investigation determined that the fire began inside a building at the boatyard where a worker had been replacing a boat’s gas tank. The fire, fanned by winds of up to 25 mph, spread to six buildings, 47 vehicles and 14 boats, authorities said. The injured worker remains in the hospital but is expected to survive. Three firefighters who suffered smoke inhalation and heat exhaustion injuries were treated at the hospital and released. Mattapoisett is about 50 miles south of Boston.\n\nMichigan\n\nGrand Rapids: A jury on Tuesday convicted two men of conspiring to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in 2020, delivering swift verdicts in a plot that was broken up by the FBI and described as a rallying cry for a U.S. civil war by anti-government extremists. The result was a big victory for the U.S. Justice Department. A different jury just four months ago couldn’t reach a unanimous decision on Adam Fox and Barry Croft Jr. but acquitted two other men – a stunning conclusion that led to a second trial. Fox and Croft were convicted of two counts of conspiracy related to the kidnapping scheme and attempts to obtain a weapon of mass destruction. Prosecutors said they wanted to blow up a bridge to disrupt police if the abduction could be pulled off at Whitmer’s vacation home. Croft was also convicted of another explosives charge. The jury deliberated for roughly eight hours over two days. “Today’s verdicts prove that violence and threats have no place in our politics, and those who seek to divide us will be held accountable. They will not succeed,” said Whitmer, a Democrat, who turned 51 years old Tuesday. “But we must also take a hard look at the status of our politics. Plots against public officials and threats to the FBI are a disturbing extension of radicalized domestic terrorism that festers in our nation, threatening the very foundation of our republic.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nProctor: The parents of a teenage boy who was assaulted after football practice have filed a federal civil rights lawsuit claiming the coach and others failed to protect their son against known hazing. The September assault resulted in cancellation of Proctor High School’s football season and the resignation of its head coach. An 18-year-old former Proctor student and football player was given probation in June for assaulting the victim with a toilet plunger and must register as a predatory offender for 10 years. The federal lawsuit alleges the hazing practice was common before and during Derek Parendo’s coaching run. The complaint said other assistant coaches, the athletic director, superintendent and guidance counselors also knew about the practice. District leaders told Parendo to remove the plunger from the locker room and to advise players on hazing, the complaint said, but the district didn’t take adequate measures to ensure this, the Star Tribune reports. Parendo has called the assault an isolated incident and said hazing is part of the district’s “old culture,” which coaches have not discussed. Superintendent John Engelking has since retired from the district. He has said the district “has never ignored any alleged misconduct toward staff or students that (was) brought to its attention.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A mother testified Tuesday that her child’s public school is harmed by the state putting $10 million of federal pandemic relief money into infrastructure grants for private schools. Tanya Marsaw of Crystal Springs is a member of Parents for Public Schools, a nonprofit group suing the state to try to block the program Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed into law earlier this year. The lawsuit cites Section 208 of the Mississippi Constitution, which prohibits the use of public money for any school that is not “a free school.” During a hearing before Hinds County Chancery Judge Crystal Wise Martin, Marsaw testified that she pays taxes. “It is some of my money, and it should not go to private schools,” Marsaw said. Reeves signed two bills in April. One created a grant program to help private schools pay for water, broadband and other infrastructure projects. The other allocated the $10 million of federal money for the program, starting July 1. The American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi, the Mississippi Center for Justice and Democracy Forward filed the lawsuit June 15 on behalf of Parents for Public Schools, an advocacy group founded more than 30 years ago.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Gov. Mike Parson on Monday called on lawmakers to return to work Sept. 6 for a special legislative session to cut income taxes. The Republican told reporters gathered in his Capitol office that he wants lawmakers to cut the top income tax rate from 5.3% to 4.8% and increase the standard deduction by $2,000 for single filers and $4,000 for couples. A single adult caring for two children and making at most $35,000 a year would see income taxes drop by about $140 a year, according to estimates provided by the governor’s office. Parson specified that, based on the limits in his special session call, lawmakers cannot cut income taxes so deeply that the state loses more than $700 million per year in revenue. The governor also recommended cutting income taxes entirely for individuals who make $16,000 or less in a year or for couples filing jointly who make less than $32,000. Missouri has more money on hand than ever before, thanks partly to a combination of inflation, higher wages and federal funds. The state closed out its 2022 fiscal year with a general revenue balance of nearly $4.9 billion – more than double the previous record set just one year ago.\n\nMontana\n\nWest Yellowstone: Cleanup continued Monday after a fuel pup trailer rolled onto its side in Yellowstone National Park last week and spilled gasoline, park officials said. The accident, which happened about 4 a.m. Friday on U.S. Highway 191 in the western side of the park, spilled 4,800 gallons of gasoline onto the roadway and into a wetland adjacent to the highway, the Environmental Protection Agency said. While the wetland feeds into nearby Grayling Creek, there had been no reports of gasoline reaching the creek. Crews were working Monday to clean up fuel, pump contaminated water, and excavate contaminated soil in and around the wetland, said Katherine Jenkins, a spokesperson for the EPA. Park law enforcement cited the truck driver for failure to maintain control, said park spokesperson Morgan Warthin.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A state lawmaker from Omaha is promising to introduce a bill to legalize medical marijuana after similar measures failed to collect enough valid signatures to appear on the November ballot. State Sen. Jen Day said in a news release Tuesday that she will introduce legislation in the upcoming legislative session slated to begin Jan. 4. “We will exhaust every measure possible to get Nebraskans the medical freedom they deserve and want,” Day said. Her announcement came a day after Nebraska Secretary of State Bob Evnen announced that the Medical Cannabis Patient Protections Initiative and the Medical Cannabis Regulation Initiative failed to get the nearly 87,000 signatures required to get on the Nov. 8 ballot. The failure did not come as a surprise. Organizers announced in early July that they would likely miss the signature goal needed to make the November ballot, citing the death of one of the effort’s top donors. That forced organizers to rely primarily on volunteers.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: As students move into a repaired and remodeled college dormitory for the first time since it exploded three years ago, the legal battle over who is to blame has just started. More than 700 students, mostly freshmen, will be living in the University of Nevada, Reno’s Argenta Hall when the fall semester starts Monday. “Argenta is back,” UNR President Brian Sandoval announced Aug. 16 during a reception to thank contractors, architects and university staff for helping to rebuild and for getting through the past three years. On July 5, 2019, an explosion left the eight-story residence hall, the largest of nine dorms on campus, uninhabitable. UNR officials have often called the explosion the luckiest disaster: No one was seriously hurt when a pipeline in the boiler room filled air ducts and elevator shafts with gas, causing a massive explosion that rattled campus, twisted metal, blasted appliances across rooms and broke windows. A lawsuit filed in June by UNR’s insurance company says the company that serviced the boiler is to blame and responsible for millions in costs. A status conference with both parties is scheduled with Washoe District Court Judge Egan Walker at 10 a.m. Thursday.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Election monitors have been appointed in Windham, Bedford and one ward in Laconia for the state’s Sept. 13 primary after problems were found in vote counting or the administration of elections in November 2020, the attorney general’s office said. The office said in a news release Monday that the monitors are appointed to work with election officials and review the conduct of the upcoming election to ensure compliance with state law. Following the November 2020 election, the Windham election review found “administrative shortcomings and significant inaccuracies in vote counts due to the processing of incorrectly folded ballots,” the office said. In Bedford, the election review found that election officials inadvertently failed to count 190 absentee ballots “due to misplacing a container of ballots during election day processing,” according to the attorney general’s office. The office said the Laconia Ward 6 election review found that “election officials inadvertently failed to count 179 ballots from 2020 elections that were cast but left in a ballot collection box, as well as some officials double-counting dozens of ballots” in the November 2020 election. The election monitors are required by law to produce a report within 30 days of the state primary election.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAnnandale: After a school year of fighting personal attacks and opposing the removal of LGBTQ books from school libraries, North Hunterdon High School librarian Martha Hickson was awarded the Lemony Snicket Prize for Noble Librarians Faced with Adversity by the American Library Association. Daniel Handler, also known as Lemony Snicket, presented Hickson with the award − a $10,000 prize, a certificate and an “odd, symbolic object” from Handler’s private collection − at the ALA’s annual conference in Washington, D.C., in June. The award annually recognizes and honors a librarian who has faced adversity with integrity and dignity intact. During the 2021-22 school year, Hickson was personally targeted when parents and other community members sought to remove five books that are LGBTQ-themed from the North Hunterdon High School library, which she opposed. The group labeled her as a “pornographer” and “pedophile” for providing children with access to the books in question, and she received hate mail, threats, nuisance vandalism, and questions about her judgment and integrity. She said the adversity became so pervasive and extreme that her blood pressure and anxiety rose to a dangerous point, and her physician removed her from the workplace.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: More than four grueling months and $300 million later, the federal government has declared the largest wildfire in New Mexico’s recorded history 100% contained, a notable milestone but just another step in what local residents and officials say will be a long journey toward recovery. The blaze was sparked in the spring by two errant prescribed fires conducted by the U.S. Forest Service. More than 530 square miles of the Rocky Mountain foothills burned, hundreds of homes were destroyed, livelihoods were lost, and drinking water supplies were contaminated. Local officials say there are years of work ahead of them to restore the landscape and protect against post-fire flooding. San Miguel County Manager Joy Ansley and her team have been working nonstop since the first plumes of smoke began rising from the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. They helped coordinate the evacuation of thousands of people from small mountain villages and worked with the state and the city of Las Vegas as flames approached. With the summer rainy season in full swing, Ansley said parts of northern New Mexico are flooding on a weekly basis. “It’s going to be a long process, and just because the fire is contained, we’re certainly not out of the woods,” she said Tuesday.\n\nNew York\n\nRochester: A couple whom a Black firefighter accused of throwing a racist pool party this summer mocking the Juneteenth holiday said Tuesday that the party was intended to ridicule liberal politicians but wasn’t bigoted. The couple, dentist Nicholas Nicosia and real estate agent Mary Znidarsic-Nicosia, said their July 7 party had been mischaracterized, but Znidarsic-Nicosia confessed to running a racist Twitter account. According to a legal notice filed by firefighter Jerrod Jones, the Nicosias’ party featured a display mocking the Juneteenth holiday, which celebrates the end of slavery in the 19th century, with Juneteenth flags displayed over buckets of fried chicken. Jones, a 14-year veteran of the fire department, said his captain forced him and two co-workers to attend the party while on duty. He filed a notice of claim against the city of Rochester and the fire department seeking at least $3 million for emotional distress and at least $1 million in compensatory damages. The fire captain, Jeffrey Krywy, was suspended by the department and later retired. Znidarsic-Nicosia did admit to running an anonymous Twitter account that posted racist images and content but denied being racist. “I have made blatantly racist comments under that persona,” she said. “The culture of Twitter operates that way. It gives you an opportunity to be someone you’re not.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: North Carolina’s most powerful state senator said Tuesday that he would prefer to have approved restrictions on abortion after roughly the first three months of pregnancy. Senate leader Phil Berger, speaking before convening another round of no-vote General Assembly sessions this week, also said he would support exceptions to any prohibition following the first trimester, such as in situations of rape and incest or when the mother’s life is in danger. The views of Berger, R-Rockingham County, would appear to represent a more tempered effort compared to GOP legislators in North Carolina and other states who want to outlaw abortion or dramatically scale it back following a U.S. Supreme Court decision in June to overturn Roe v. Wade. A federal judge last week reinstated a North Carolina law that prohibits abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy save for urgent medical emergencies. Incest and rape exceptions currently are not granted in state law. The first trimester is usually defined as 12 or 13 weeks of pregnancy. “I would say that after the first trimester, the state has an absolute interest in regulating the incidence of abortion,” Berger told reporters. House Speaker Tim Moore, R-Cleveland County, and Berger have said no potential action on abortion would occur until next year.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The main group working to legalize recreational marijuana in the state has more than a half-million dollars to press its case – far more than the mostly shoe-leather effort on which it relied four years ago. Meanwhile, a major oil industry group that helped fund opposition last time says it will sit on the sidelines this time. The North Dakota Petroleum Council will not contribute to the fight the pot legalization effort that will appear on the November general election ballot, said Ron Ness, the group’s president. “It’s one of those things where we only have so many resources,” said Ness, whose group represents several hundred companies. Ness said 1 in 6 North Dakota jobs is directly or indirectly tied to the state’s oil industry. Most oil-field jobs require drug testing, and legalizing pot would likely shrink the employment pool, he said. The energy group contributed $30,000 to the failed statewide ballot effort in 2018 to legalize recreational marijuana. It was among a group of lawyers, law enforcement and business leaders that pushed opposition. The Greater North Dakota Chamber, the state’s largest business organization, contributed $64,000 to oppose the measure in 2018. CEO and President Arik Spencer said the group hasn’t decided whether it will help fund or even support another opposition effort.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Two constitutional amendments have cleared their last big hurdle before heading to November ballots – one seeking bail reform, the other prohibiting noncitizens from voting. The specific language for describing the amendments was approved Monday by the Ohio Ballot Board, a panel of legislative appointees led by Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican. The Legislature had sent the amendments in June to be put on the ballot. Issue 1, the amendment on bail, would change the conditions and amount of money needed to release someone. Bail would no longer be a standard set by the state. Instead, it would be up to a judge’s discretion based on factors such as public safety, including the seriousness of an offense, an individual’s criminal record, the likelihood a person will commit another offense, or “any other factor the General Assembly may prescribe.” The proposal followed a ruling by a divided Ohio Supreme Court in January, which said a $1.5 million bond for a Cincinnati man accused of fatally shooting a man during a robbery was too high. The language cleared the committee unanimously. The second amendment, Issue 2, would prohibit local governments from allowing non-U.S. citizens to vote in local elections. They are already prohibited from voting in federal and state elections.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Green or red – the colors will symbolize life or death, mercy or no mercy, in a prominent anti-death penalty display outside a northwest Oklahoma City church. Twenty-five crosses have been erected along the front lawn of The Lazarus Community at Clark Memorial United Methodist Church, each representing a person the state is scheduled to execute, beginning Thursday with James Coddington, and extending into 2024. The Rev. Bo Ireland, the church’s pastor, said the crosses – each 6 feet tall and about 4 feet wide – are hard to miss along a busy thoroughfare. But he said they’ll be even more eye-catching in the coming days and weeks. Ireland and a group of volunteers spray-painted the large crosses white Monday, but they won’t stay that way. “If James Coddington is executed, we will paint one of these crosses red, and if he is granted clemency, we will paint it green,” Ireland said. Coddington is set to be executed by lethal injection at 10 a.m. Thursday at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester. He was convicted and sentenced to death for the 1997 murder of Albert Hale. The Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board recommended clemency for Coddington in early August. It is up to Gov. Kevin Stitt to decide whether the death row inmate is granted clemency or executed Thursday.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A new microshelter village for unsheltered residents is set to open in south Salem after the City Council allocated funds for the project Monday night. The council voted unanimously to direct $750,000 in state sheltering grant funds to fund a microshelter village at Turner Road SE near Church at the Park, which owns the property there. The money was previously allocated to establish and operate a safe park program on Front Street, but staff said the location is no longer cost-efficient due to higher than anticipated costs. “Startup expenses will exceed original projections, leaving less for operations,” city staff said in a report to council Thursday. “For example, environmentally friendly sanitation services for up to 40 recreational vehicles requires a high level of up-front investment. The lease for the property ends in December 2023.” The Turner Road location was one of three locations Salem City Council approved for microshelters in a Jan. 24 meeting. Another was Front Street. Work is currently underway to relocate the Village of Hope shelter site to the other location approved on Center Street. Local advocates have made it their goal to have microshelter villages throughout the city in all eight wards. A community effort has raised more than $770,000 in donations – enough for at least 154 shelters.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Last week, searches for the word “crudités” on Dictionary.com spiked by more than 10,000% after Dr. Mehmet Oz mentioned the raw vegetable appetizer in an online video that went viral in the worst way possible for the U.S. Senate candidate. “Thought I’d do some grocery shopping. I’m at Wegners,” the GOP nominee says at the outset of the TikTok video, apparently jumbling the names of supermarket chains Redner’s and Wegmans by accident. The clip continues as Oz scans the produce section and grabs a head of broccoli, a bag of whole carrots, asparagus, salsa and guacamole in an awkward attempt to make a point about inflation. Cradling his vegetables, he announces aghast that the total at the register would come to $20 – for crudité! But few besides Oz seemed to know what that is. “In PA we call this … a veggie tray,” Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, Oz’s Democratic opponent in the Senate race, tweeted dryly after the video started to blow up. But even after figuring out what a “crudité” was, the internet still had many questions for Oz. Why didn’t he have a shopping basket? Why did he feel salsa and guacamole would be appropriate dips for raw vegetables? Who eats uncooked asparagus? The TikTok video has racked up 4.4 million views to date and has been shared thousands of times on Twitter, generally accompanied by snarky comments. Fetterman wasted no time capitalizing on Oz’s social media mishap, reportedly raising $500,000 in just 24 hours after the clip went viral.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Federal officials have declared a drought-related disaster in the state. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack on Monday declared all five of Rhode Island’s counties as “primary natural disaster areas” because of the ongoing drought. The declaration allows eligible farms to be considered for low-interest, emergency loans and other assistance from the department’s Farm Service Agency. Farmers have eight months from the date of the disaster declaration to apply for the assistance. “This prolonged drought has been tough on many Rhode Island farmers, harming the yield and quality of crops,” U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat who earlier this month requested the disaster declaration, said in a statement. “This federal declaration is good news for the state and should help mitigate some of the production losses local farmers are facing.” Rhode Island saw less than 0.5 inches of rain in July, compared to an average of 2.5 inches, according to Reed’s office. More than 99% of the state is experiencing extreme drought.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The director of the state’s Department of Mental Health is giving up the post he’s held for two years, officials said. Dr. Kenneth Rogers, a psychiatrist hired to run the agency in April 2020, announced Thursday at an executive session of a meeting of the Mental Health Commission that he would be leaving the department effective Nov. 1, The State reports. Rogers emailed agency staff Friday shortly after The State reported news of his resignation, to announce his pending departure and thank them for their support. “You have shown incredible fortitude as we have faced extraordinary challenges, and I am proud to work with you,” he wrote. “While I am moving on to a new opportunity, I will forever be grateful for returning to SCDMH and for all I have learned during my tenure as state director.” Rogers did not disclose his next move to staff but pledged to send more information about what to expect in the near future and said he was confident the agency would be in “capable hands” going forward. The seven-member Mental Health Commission, which is appointed by the governor, will select the agency’s next director with confirmation from the Senate. Commission Chairman Greg Pearce said the board was surprised by Rogers’ announcement and had not asked him to resign.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nAberdeen: Gov. Kristi Noem has suggested she won’t push back if voters approve a recreational marijuana ballot measure this fall. The Republican governor talked about the possible future of legal cannabis in South Dakota during a visit to Aberdeen last week. Residents will once again vote on the issue when Initiated Measure 27 appears on the ballot in November. “From what I’ve seen, this amendment this year that will be on the ballot is written more appropriately towards the Constitution,” Noem said Friday at the Brown County Fair. In 2020, Amendment A sought to legalize recreational marijuana. It was approved by voters but struck down by the South Dakota Supreme Court after justices ruled that the amendment violated a provision in the constitution requiring amendments to encompass only one subject. Noem was an opponent of Amendment A two years ago. At her request, state Highway Superintendent Rick Miller and Pennington County Sheriff Kevin Thom filed the lawsuit that led to the court battle. Noem said that her job as governor is to implement the recreational marijuana resolution if it’s approved by voters in November. Unlike Amendment A, Initiated Measure 27 does not include tax and regulatory stipulations. Those will be left up to the Legislature.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Disgraced former Tennessee House Speaker Glen Casada and his top aide were arrested Tuesday on federal charges including bribery, kickbacks and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Their indictments follow the abrupt resignation in March of Republican state Rep. Robin Smith, who pleaded guilty to federal wire fraud charges involving Casada and his chief of staff, Cade Cothren. Afterward, speculation swirled about what additional charges might come in the corruption probe. FBI agents arrested Casada and Cothren at their homes Tuesday morning. If convicted, they each face up to 20 years in prison. Both pleaded not guilty Tuesday and received pretrial release with travel restricted to the middle district of Tennessee unless otherwise approved. The 20-count charging document alleges Casada and Cothren exploited their positions of power by working with another unnamed lawmaker to funnel money to themselves using a political consulting firm – known as Phoenix Solutions, LLC – to conceal their involvement. Cothren registered the firm in New Mexico because the state allows anonymous registration of LLCs, and he rebuffed requests for in-person meetings with Casada’s fellow lawmakers, saying the company representatives were out of state.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, accused of acting unethically and dishonestly when he worked to overturn Democrat Joe Biden’s presidential election victory in 2020, has turned to his agency for help in a legal battle that could put his law license in jeopardy. A State Bar of Texas disciplinary committee sued Paxton in May, arguing he should be sanctioned for violating his duties as an attorney by lying to the U.S. Supreme Court when he said Texas had substantial proof that voting fraud propelled Biden to victory in four swing states. Paxton “knew or should have known” that his claims were false, misleading and unsupported by credible evidence, the bar argued. Paxton responded in June by asking a state judge to dismiss the lawsuit as an unconstitutional check on his power and a politically motivated attack based on his support for fellow Republican Donald Trump. State District Judge Casey Blair of Kaufman County is scheduled to hear arguments on Paxton’s motion during a Wednesday morning hearing in Kaufman, about 30 miles southeast of Dallas. The Texas Attorney General’s Office entered the fray last week when it asked state District Judge Casey Blair of Kaufman County to allow the agency to join the case on Paxton’s behalf.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Democrats are demanding that Gov. Spencer Cox’s pick to head the Department of Natural Resources resign his legislative seat and withdraw from the November ballot, saying it violates the state constitution for him to serve in both roles. Cox selected Republican state Rep. Joel Ferry as the agency’s executive director, a Cabinet position. Ferry has been serving in an acting role pending his confirmation by the Utah Senate, but he’s hanging onto his legislative seat and remains on the ballot in House District 1. The Utah Democratic Party says that violates the separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches set out in the Utah Constitution, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. The governor’s office has previously argued that it doesn’t because Ferry resigned from legislative committees and assignments that would govern natural resources-related issues, and he is not taking any compensation for his legislative role. Legal counsel for the Utah Democratic Party and Joshua Hardy, Ferry’s opponent in November, wrote to Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson’s office Thursday asking for Ferry to be disqualified from the ballot since he’s ineligible to hold office if he is reelected.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state’s primary election results have been certified after a delay caused by a technical issue, Secretary of State Jim Condos announced Tuesday. The vote tallies and winners in the Aug. 9 primary were certified as official at a meeting of the canvassing committee Monday, he said. “The tri-partisan certification of election results as official is an important step in verifying the accuracy and integrity of our election results,” Condos said in a statement. “Vermonters deserve to have 100% confidence that official vote totals accurately reflect the ballots cast by voters. That is why results are carefully reviewed and certified by a member of each major political party.” Of the 133,578 ballots cast, 809 were deemed defective, his office said. Of those, 492 were fixed by voters under the new ballot-curing provisions of Vermont’s election law, leaving 317 defective ballots that were unable to be counted, he said. That amounts to a very low defective ballot rate under 0.25%, he said. The secretary of state’s office said a week ago that the certification was delayed because a state contractor had been unable to resolve a technology issue affecting the office’s ability to produce reports from votes submitted by town and city clerks.\n\nVirginia\n\nFairfax: Police say their efforts to inform a school system about the arrest of a counselor on solicitation charges were thwarted by undeliverable emails. Fairfax County Public Schools has launched an investigation into how Darren Thornton, 50, was able to keep his job as a counselor at Glasgow Middle School for 20 months after his arrest on charges of soliciting prostitution from a minor in November 2020. Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin and others criticized the school system after police in Chesterfield County, where Thornton was arrested, said they informed school administrators in Fairfax County at the time of the arrest in 2020. Now, though, Chesterfield police say the emails they sent back in 2020 never went through. In a statement posted Tuesday on Facebook, Chesterfield County police Chief Jeffrey Katz said the email addresses his agency used had typos in them. “I think it is important not to lose sight of the fact that our staff caught Thornton (twice),” Katz said. “We made good faith efforts (twice) to ensure he was appropriately dealt with by the criminal justice system and his employer.” Thornton was arrested as part of an online sting when a police officer posing as a 17-year-old connected with Thornton over the internet.\n\nWashington\n\nGeorge: The Grant County Sheriff’s Office believes its deputies stopped a man from carrying out a mass shooting at the Gorge Amphitheater on Friday night. The sheriff’s office said people at the event and security personnel told them about 9 p.m. of a man in the parking lot near his vehicle, KOIN-TV reports. Witnesses saw the man inhale an unknown substance from a balloon and then load two 9 mm pistols from the trunk of his car, according to the sheriff’s office. Witnesses also told investigators the man put one gun in the waistband of his pants and the other in a holster that was outside his waistband. Witnesses say he then approached concertgoers and asked what time the concert ended and where they would be leaving the venue. The sheriff’s office said the man, identified as Jonathan Moody of Ephrata, Washington, was stopped by security outside the gates and disarmed. The sheriff’s office said no one was injured. After investigating, deputies arrested Moody on suspicion of one count of possession of a dangerous weapon and one count of unlawful carrying or handling of a weapon. Moody was lodged in the Grant County Jail. It wasn’t immediately known if he had a lawyer to comment on his behalf.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A rainy summer has set a record in the state capital. With a month still left in the summer, the 23.23 inches of rain that have fallen in Charleston since June 21 broke the mark of 23.13 inches set in 1958, the National Weather Service said. Nearly 4 inches of rain fell last week in the Charleston area. Flooding in parts of Kanawha and Fayette counties prompted Gov. Jim Justice to declare a state of emergency. Five of the 10 rainiest summers in Charleston have occurred this century. The others happened in 2003, 2006, 2013 and 2018, the weather service said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Republicans who control the Legislature asked a judge Tuesday to dismiss Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul’s lawsuit challenging Wisconsin’s 173-year-old abortion ban. Kaul filed the lawsuit in June after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade, the landmark decision that essentially legalized abortion across the country. The ruling gave states the authority to regulate abortion on their own, putting Wisconsin’s ban back into play. The ban prohibits abortions in every instance except to save the mother’s life. Kaul’s lawsuit argues that the ban conflicts with a 1985 Wisconsin law that allows abortions before a fetus has grown enough that it could survive outside the womb. That point in time is unclear; some physicians say it’s about 20 weeks, others around 28 weeks. The attorney general also argues that the ban is unenforceable because it has become obsolete. The Wisconsin Department of Safety and Professional Services, the Wisconsin Medical Examining Board and former Democratic state Rep. Sheldeon Wasserman, who works as an obstetrician and gynecologist, have joined Kaul as plaintiffs in the case. Senate President Chris Kapenga, Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMehieu and Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, all named defendants, filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit in Dane County Circuit Court.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: The state has lost its holdout status in the monkeypox outbreak, with the Wyoming Health Department reporting Monday morning that a case has been detected in Laramie County, the Jackson Hole News&Guide reports.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/11/03/cdc-kids-vaccine-covid-updates/6256709001/", "title": "CVS, Walgreens open COVID vaccine appointment for kids: Updates", "text": "Young children began receiving COVID-19 vaccines Wednesday in what was a moment of joy not only for their parents but the kids themselves.\n\nCate Zeigler-Amon, 10, said she was \"very, very, very excited and very happy\" after getting her first dose at a drive-through vaccination site in Atlanta.

Garcetti, who is attending the United Nations conference on climate change in Glasgow, Scotland, was “feeling good and isolating in his hotel room.”\n\nHe is fully vaccinated but hasn’t received a booster shot, his office said.\n\nGarcetti was scheduled to fly back to Los Angeles on Thursday but will follow U.K health guidelines, spokesman Harrison Wollman said. Those guidelines say an individual should quarantine for 10 days, meaning Garcetti might be stuck in Scotland until then.\n\nThe UN event, COP26, attracted world leaders, including President Joe Biden, and included safety measures due to the coronavirus. That included reduced capacity, social distancing and the use of a virtual platform to participate remotely.\n\nGarcetti had been getting rapid COVID-19 tests each day of the conference, his office said, but had a PCR test before his flight home and got a positive result Wednesday. Garcetti had participated earlier in the day in a discussion about challenges with tackling climate change.\n\n-- Christal Hayes\n\nWhite House takes steps to counter misinformation about children vaccines\n\nAs they enthusiastically welcomed the coronavirus vaccine for children ages 5-11, members of the White House COVID-19 response team made a point Wednesday to tell parents about the importance of the shots, as well as their safety and efficacy.\n\nMost notably, the experts sought to warn parents about what Surgeon General Vivek Murthy called “the wave of misinformation about COVID-19 and vaccines that is coming their way.’’\n\nMurthy said the government is trying to counter these bogus claims with outreach efforts involving trusted sources such as doctors, teachers and faith leaders, as well as organizations well known to parents, including the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n\nForums and town halls with answers to parents’ questions, along with appearances by doctors on local media, will be also be part of the drive to provide accurate information to those making the decisions on whether to get the newly authorized pediatric vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech.\n\n“Many parents are already seeing inaccurate claims on social media, text threads and in their in-boxes,’’ Murthy said. “Misinformation robs them of (the ability to make informed choices). That’s why I’m asking parents to please seek answers from credible sources, like their doctor, their local hospital, their local health department or the CDC.’’\n\nFellow team members Drs. Rochelle Walensky and Anthony Fauci underscored that, while older adults are more vulnerable to COVID-19, the virus has infected nearly 2 million children ages 5-11, sending 8,300 of them to a hospital. One-third of those kids required treatment in an ICU.\n\nNow there’s a tool to prevent many of those illnesses.\n\n“Pediatric vaccination has the power to help us achieve healthy, safe and inclusive environments for our children,’’ Walensky said.\n\n-- Jorge L.

The first vaccine shipments are scheduled to arrive at some Walgreens locations this week, the company said Wednesday.\n\nCVS will begin administering the vaccine this weekend, spokesperson Joe Goode told USA TODAY.\n\nThe vaccine will also be available at the offices of pediatricians and primary care doctors, children's hospitals and clinics at schools.\n\nVaccines.gov – the one-stop shop federal government website – is expected to soon list the closest available vaccine appointments for children.\n\n\"The COVID-19 vaccine is just as important to protect children as other routine immunizations are, and the expanded eligibility will help children stay in school safely and prevent severe illness due to COVID-19,\" Kevin Ban, Walgreens' chief medical officer, said in a statement.\n\nThe Biden administration's distribution program will be \"running at full strength\" the week of Nov. 8, presidential adviser Jeff Zients said Monday, as it has already ordered enough vaccine to cover all 28 million American children in the age group.\n\nArizona Supreme Court: Schools can keep mask mandates\n\nIt took the Arizona Supreme Court less than two hours Tuesday to agree that the Legislature's practice of stuffing policy matters into appropriations bills is unconstitutional.\n\nThe unanimous ruling from the seven-judge court upheld a lower court judgment that found the Republican-controlled Legislature violated the state constitution by including new laws banning school mask mandates and a series of other measures in unrelated budget bills.\n\nThe Supreme Court agreed with lower-court judge Katherine Cooper, who sided with education groups, including the Arizona School Boards Association, that had argued the bills were packed with policy items unrelated to the budget.\n\nCooper’s ruling cleared the way for K-12 public schools to continue requiring students to wear face masks to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. At least 29 of the state’s public school districts issued mask mandates before the laws were set to take effect, and some immediately extended them after Cooper’s ruling.\n\nColleges in red states require vaccines to keep millions in federal money\n\nMore universities are rolling out new COVID-19 vaccine mandates for university employees – this time for university employees.\n\nThat's because of the government’s requirement that its contractors all be vaccinated or risk losing federal money. Many, although not all, universities receive federal money to conduct research.\n\nCiting the federal order, colleges in states such as Arizona, Alabama and Mississippi have required their employees to be vaccinated, even after their local leaders opposed and sometimes outlawed such mandates. Other universities in red states such as Georgia, Missouri or Tennessee are interpreting the federal order more selectively.\n\nEither way, the federal government’s deadline to comply with the vaccine requirement is Dec. 8. The mandate allows exemptions for religious or medical reasons, and so will the universities adopting the new orders.

The markets regulator would be taking a decisive initial step toward forcing private sector businesses to reckon with their carbon footprints.\n\nCurrent disclosure methods are “fragmented” and “inconsistent,” the SEC said in a fact sheet Monday. The agency said around one third of companies already disclose some sort of climate information in their annual reports.\n\nNotably, the rule will also require companies to report “Scope 3” emissions, which are indirect emissions created up and down a company’s supply chain, such as greenhouse gases from cars burning gasoline.\n\nClimate-related risks that have both a “material impact” on financial statements and an effect on the company’s outlook will have to be disclosed. Companies will have to provide these disclosures in statements such as annual reports and other regulatory filings visible to investors.\n\nImpact from climate-related events like severe weather would also have to be disclosed. Additionally, companies that have made their climate goals public will be required to share details and relevant data.\n\nInvestors are pushing for companies to disclose information and acknowledge the risks of climate change, and advocacy groups have long called for Scope 3 emissions to be tracked. But many industries have pushed back against reporting, and legal challenges are expected.\n\nBusiness and conservative groups have raised concerns about the financial regulator passing such sweeping rules to combat climate change.\n\n“The proposal … tells corporate managers how regulators doing the bidding of an array of non investor stakeholders expect them to run their companies,” Hester Peirce, a Republican SEC commissioner, said in a meeting Monday.\n\nBut Todd Phillips, director of financial regulation and corporate governance at the Center for American Progress, said the rule is “far from” a government mandate for reducing greenhouse emissions.\n\n“Investors are going to have to make their own individual determinations about how to use the information and where to put their money,” Phillips said. “Some investors may make investing decisions based on this information, some may not.”\n\nThe US Chamber of Commerce expressed concern about the rule’s “prescriptive approach” in a statement Monday.\n\nKathleen Sgamma, president of the Western Energy Alliance, a natural gas and oil trade association, called the step to include Scope 3 disclosures “extreme” in a statement to CNN Business.\n\n“By elevating climate change above basic market factors, SEC is on a path to starve oil and natural gas of capital and deliver lower returns to investors,” Sgamma said.\n\nThe US is lagging other countries in requiring this type of reporting.

The state had about 30,600 fewer jobs last month than in June 2019, according to the report. Industries hit hard during 2020 saw big gains in the new report, the department said. For example, there were 4,500 more jobs in leisure and hospitality last month than a year earlier and 4,200 more in the trade, transportation and utilities sector. However, there were 11,300 fewer jobs in leisure and hospitality last month than in June 2019 and 6,300 fewer in trade, transportation and utilities, according to the report. Health care employment and construction were up from June 2020 and equaled their June 2019 numbers. Manufacturing, which the department said is mainly seafood processing, had 1,200 more jobs last month than a year earlier and 100 fewer than in June 2019.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Gov. Doug Ducey announced he’s using $101.1 million of federal relief funding to launch a new program to encourage more tourism spending in the state and help the hospitality industry recover from the pandemic. The Visit Arizona Initiative will use the American Rescue Plan money to help the tourism sector of the state’s economy to prosper and “continue to recover from the effects of the pandemic,” Ducey said in a statement. Examples of planned funding uses include destination and travel marketing, local programs and events, state park improvements, Arizona State Fair marketing and a workplace initiative for the hospitality industry. Ducey’s move to bolster the tourism industry followed his announcement that he was tapping federal cash from the American Rescue Plan to refill the state unemployment insurance trust fund.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith:The Arkansas Department of Agriculture has added Sebastian, Logan, Prairie and White counties to a state quarantine to try and prevent the spread of fire ants. The designation means people cannot remove any of the following items from the quarantine zone without treating them: nursery stock with soil or potting media, grass sod, baled hay stored in contact with the soil, baled straw stored in contact with the soil, as well as soil and used soil-moving equipment. There are 43 counties in the quarantine, according to the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture. Paul Shell, a plant inspection and quarantine program manager with the Arkansas Department of Agriculture, estimated that fire ants have been present in the state since the 1980s. Fire ants spread naturally through flight but can also spread when people move soil. Fire ants can inflict painful stings multiple times and can cause allergic reactions including anaphylactic shock.\n\nCalifornia\n\nPetrolia: A 5.1 magnitude earthquake struck off the northern California coast late Saturday. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the earthquake just before midnight was about 7.5 miles west of Petrolia in Humboldt County and 35 miles southwest of Eureka. The depth was just over 18.5 miles. The shaking could be felt as far south as San Francisco and as far east as beyond Yuba City, according to reports submitted to the USGS. Further details weren’t immediately available.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: The north end of Denver International Airport’s terminal is about to become unrecognizable when the Hensel Phelps construction firm begins building new security checkpoints as the Great Hall improvements reach Phase 2. Plans call for three escalators to move people from the new sixth-floor security station directly to the train platform. Improvement should be functioning by the beginning of 2024, said outgoing airport CEO Kim Day, who retired Friday after 13 years at the helm. Phase 1 included expanding the number of gates by 39, adding four additional restrooms and improving the check-in stations for Southwest, United Airlines and Frontier Airlines. The new check-in points are now on Level 6, above the existing TSA security checkpoints. Hensel Phelps took over for the previous general contractor, which was fired two years ago after delays and cost overruns. The new security area is to include “state of the art” screening technology, new line processes and streamlined procedures, Day said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nStamford: Former Major League Baseball player and manager Bobby Valentine has raised about $300,000 for his independent campaign for mayor of Stamford since announcing his bid in May, including donations from former President George W. Bush and other high-profile Republicans. Bush gave $500 to Valentine’s campaign, Hearst Connecticut Media reported Saturday, citing financial disclosures. Bush was managing partner of the Texas Rangers in 1992 when the team fired Valentine as manager. Valentine, a Stamford native, also received $1,000 maximum contributions from Anthony Scaramucci, who briefly served as White House communications director for former President Donald Trump, and Linda McMahon, former administrator of the Small Business Administration under Trump and former chief executive of Stamford-based World Wrestling Entertainment. The $300,000 in individual contributions is more than the two Democrats running for mayor raised during the first half of this year, the records showed. Democratic Mayor David Martin has collected more than $78,000 in individual donations as he seeks a third term, and state Rep. Caroline Simmons has raised nearly $140,000.\n\nDelaware\n\nDewey Beach:The city has opted to triple its police department’s liability insurance, noting a rise in civil rights lawsuits. The Dewey Beach Town Council voted recently to increase the coverage from $1 million to $3 million, the News Journal reported. “I think it’s prudent for the town to consider upping the amount to protect us, so, God forbid, something happened we wouldn’t have to liquidate any town assets,” said Police Chief Sam Mackert during a July 9 council meeting. Mackert said he has been watching other towns across the country pay settlements far beyond Dewey Beach’s policy limit. The town has a total budget under $4 million. The increase in coverage will lead to a hike in its premium. The town already had some money budgeted for it and will use funds from its real estate transfer tax to help make up the difference, the newspaper reported. “You hope and pray that you never have to use it,” Commissioner Paul Bauer said. “But better safe than sorry.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:The Golden Triangle Business Improvement District told WUSA9-TV last week that small businesses could receive multiple months of free rent as part of a new program to help the area recover from a high number of vacant office and retail spaces. The Golden Triangle area stretches 44 square blocks from Dupont Circle to Pennsylvania Avenue. A spokesperson for the Golden Triangle Business Improvement District said the area encompasses 34 million square feet of office space and can attract almost 90,000 workers a day. However, the pandemic brought closures and forced many of the workers to work remotely. Buildings that usually bustled with activity had only about 8% occupancy for months, according to BID data, and pedestrian counts were down 90%. Over a year after the pandemic spread to the district, the group said the Golden Triangle has 122 vacant office and retail spaces. By fall, the spokesperson said the group hoped to get the area back on track to where it once was before businesses and workers left.\n\nFlorida\n\nNew Smyrna Beach: A man is facing animal cruelty and other charges after investigators said he attacked and seriously wounded a dog with a machete. An affidavit by a Volusia County sheriff’s deputy said Richard Nelson, 46, injured the dog during a confrontation earlier this month outside a New Smyrna Beach home. Nelson is also charged with falsely telling deputies he acted in self-defense when the dog attacked him first. Nelson was arrested Friday and released on his own recognizance the next day, court records showed. No attorney is listed to speak for Nelson, who authorities said has no fixed address. According to the affidavit, Nelson and the dog had issues in the past. Initially, Nelson told investigators the dog ran at him unprovoked and bit him, leading to his decision to use the machete. Video evidence, however, showed that Nelson stood up aggressively when the dog approached, striking the dog several times with the machete as he chased the animal around the yard, the affidavit said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nWarner Robins: A thriving Black community established in the 1940s for African American workers at Robins Air Force Base has been commemorated with a historic marker. The new plaque in Warner Robins – unveiled last month – celebrates the Jody Town Community, a segregated neighborhood that became a hub for Black life in the area before an urban renewal plan in the 1970s led to its destruction, The Telegraph newspaper reported. Johnson-Granville recalled going to an ice cream shop in the neighborhood and learning how to sew and bake cookies with her Girl Scout troop there. The Dodgers scouted players at a park where the Warner Robins Jets baseball team played, she said. But an urban renewal project in the 1970s supported by a federal grant displaced residents and brought down buildings. The neighborhood disappeared. Johnson-Granville called the marker “a symbol of what our ancestors did in the past.” The marker is the latest addition to the Georgia Civil Rights Trail, an initiative led by the Georgia Historical Society that aims to commemorate key events during the Civil Rights movement.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: A federal judge ruled Maui County must get permits to operate injection wells that environmental groups said are polluting the ocean. Several environmental groups filed a lawsuit in 2012 over the injection wells, saying effluent from the Lahaina Wastewater Reclamation Facility was entering the ocean and damaging coral reefs and sea life. The groups pointed to studies that traced the discharge from two wells to the ocean. In a ruling Thursday, U.S. District Judge Susan Oki Mollway sided with the environmental groups and ordered Maui County to “obtain a permit under the Clean Water Act consistent with the analysis established by the Supreme Court,” The Maui News reported. Maui county officials had refused to settle the case and brought it to the Supreme Court in 2019. The Supreme Court in April 2020 ruled that injection wells fall under the Clean Water Act. The county argued that treated wastewater from injection wells did not require permits under the Clean Water Act because the discharge did not go directly into the ocean.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Anti-government activist Ammon Bundy has asked a judge to throw out his conviction for trespassing at the Idaho Capitol and acquit him instead because he said the state’s trespassing law should not be applied to public property. Idaho’s courts, like many states, allow defendants to ask the judge for an acquittal within several days of a jury verdict. The move is seldom made, however, and rarely successful. It stems from Bundy’s arrest on Aug. 25, 2020, after he refused to leave an auditorium in the Statehouse after officials ordered it to be cleared. Officers also said he went limp and refused to stand up and put his hands behind his back. Officers ultimately wheeled him out of the Capitol building on a swivel chair. The arrest came during a special session of the Idaho Legislature that was called so lawmakers could address issues related to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIllinois\n\nMarion: Authorities in southern Illinois are investigating after skeletal remains were found at a wildlife refuge. The Williamson County Sheriff’s Office was working with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Illinois State Police and the county coroner. The remains were found Thursday at the Crab Orchard National Wildlife Refuge, according to a news release. No further details were released. The roughly 44,000-acre refuge includes hardwood and pine forests, croplands, grasslands rolling hills and several lakes.\n\nIndiana\n\nCharlestown:Hundreds of people turned out for an auction at a former Indiana wildlife center where the ex-proprietor and his ex-wife were found to have violated the Endangered Species Act by taking and wounding animals, including tigers and lions. A federal judge in June ordered Timothy Stark and his ex-wife, Melissa Lane, to pay more than $700,000 to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals for attorney fees from the group’s successful lawsuit against the pair. Stark gained attention last year as one of the people in the Netflix true-crime series “Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness.” Along with volunteers, he operated the Wildlife in Need center in southern Indiana for more than 20 years. They showed off hundreds of exotic animals at the roadside center, charging admission of $25 or more. On Saturday, more than 7 acres of land, several buildings and a four-bedroom frame home were up for sale, the Indianapolis Star reported. Personal property including a Polar King walk-in freezer and refrigerator, trucks, trailers and ATVs also were auctioned.\n\nIowa\n\nShenandoah: The Pella Windows & Doors company plans to shift more window production to its southwest Iowa factory and hire 120 additional workers in Shenandoah. Company officials said they plan to move production of their wooden double-hung windows to Shenandoah from a factory in Macomb, Illinois, according to The Des Moines Register. The Iowa Economic Development Authority agreed to give the company a forgivable $200,000 loan to help pay for the move. In return, the company said it plans to spend $5.6 million on equipment for the new lines, and the new jobs will pay at least $20.58 an hour, state officials said. The city of Shenandoah is also providing a $40,000 forgivable loan. Pella already employs about 300 people at the plant in Shenandoah. That will grow to more than 400 once the change is made.\n\nKansas\n\nManhattan: Kansas State University will require that first-year students to live on campus starting in the fall of 2022. The university said in a news release the requirement aims to enhance student success. Thomas Lane, vice president for student life and dean of students, said data showed the university’s first-year students who live on campus have higher grade-point averages, stay in school in higher numbers and graduate faster. The retention rate for freshmen who lived on campus in the fall of 2018 was 87.6%, compared to 79.9% for those who did not. For the fall of 2019, the university found that 5% more first-year students who lived on campus stayed in school than those who lived off campus. Kansas State will join all other institutions in the Kansas Regents system, with the exception of the University of Kansas, in requiring freshmen to live on campus. Students can apply for an exemption to the policy.\n\nKentucky\n\nCadiz: A riverboat stuck in Lake Barkley for more than a week was freed Friday, the U.S. Coast Guard said. The American Jazz, with 120 passengers and 54 crew members, became stuck on a sandbar last week while on a seven-night cruise between Memphis and Nashville, Tennessee, according to its operator, American Cruise Lines. The passengers were moved off the ship and transported to a Nashville hotel on July 9. The boat was not damaged. The boat was left in full reverse for about three hours Friday while a towing vessel pushed on it, and after taking a break, the boat worked itself free around 3:20 p.m., said Lt. Phillip Baxter of the Coast Guard in Paducah. The American Jazz’s hull was being inspected to make sure there was no damage or water going in before sending it on its way, Baxter said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Bagpipes played as an honor guard carried the flag-draped casket bearing the body of former Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards down the steps of Louisiana’s towering state Capitol on Sunday and loaded it onto a horse-drawn carriage for transport to his funeral site. The four-term former governor died at his home in Gonzales on July 12 at age 93 after placing himself in hospice care following bouts with respiratory illness. His body lay in honor Saturday at the Capitol, where members of the public were allowed to file by. The Southern University marching band was part of a procession that carried the body from the 34-story Capitol built in the 1930s, on a nearly mile-long route to the Old State Capitol, a 19th Century structure, where a private funeral ceremony for Edwards was held. Among the speakers was current Gov. John Bel Edwards – no relation – who praised Edwards as a consensus builder and deal-maker who modernized state government and worked hard to fund education and the state’s charity hospital system.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The percentage of Maine teenagers and 12-year-olds who have had at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine has exceeded 50%. Maine has been ahead of most of the country in vaccinating residents against COVID-19. The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday that about 51% of the state’s 12- to 19-year-old residents have had at least one dose, and about 47% have had a final dose. The rollout of vaccines to teens and adolescents has been much slower nationwide. Only about 14% of the U.S. population that is under 18 has had a first dose of the vaccine, according to data from the Mayo Clinic. In Maine, the percentage of the total population that is under 20 and has had at least one dose is about 22%, the Maine CDC reported. That includes people too young to receive a vaccine. More than two-thirds of Maine’s population old enough to receive a COVID-19 vaccine has received a final dose. That is one of the highest percentages in the country.\n\nMaryland\n\nHagerstown:Point Broadband, an internet provider based in Georgia, is expanding its a fiber optic network to the Hagerstown area. The company, which acquired Hagerstown Fiber a little more than a year ago, will offer internet and telephone service for homes and businesses. Clint Wiley, general manager of Point Broadband in Maryland, said part of the work has already started. Wiley, who owned Hagerstown Fiber, said the company had started building a fiber optic network in the city before being acquired by Point Broadband. “That initial build was successful. ... We’re obviously building from where we are in Hagerstown outwards,” he said, referring to a map of the planned coverage area, which stretches from the Pennsylvania state line south to Williamsport, and from just west of Hagerstown east to Smithsburg. It includes communities such as Maugansville, Halfway and Funkstown.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority is working with Boston and several other area communities to build nearly 5 miles of bus lanes and make other upgrades along crucial transit corridors, transportation officials said. The projects are designed to boost bus speed and reliability and in turn support economic growth as the region eases public health restrictions put in place during the coronavirus pandemic, the MBTA said in a statement. The work is also being done in Lynn, Brookline, Malden, Revere, and Somerville. “These quick-build projects aim to address transit delay on some of the region’s most congested roadways in order to improve bus travel time and reliability, and move more people more efficiently to support economic recovery and public health,” the T’s statement said.\n\nMichigan\n\nMackinaw City: A bomb scare closed the bridge connecting Michigan’s two peninsulas for about three hours on Sunday afternoon, authorities said. Law enforcement notified the Mackinac Bridge Authority of the threat and the bridge was closed in both directions at about 2:15 p.m., the authority said in a tweet. The Michigan State and Mackinaw City police investigated. Nothing was found after an “extensive search,” the authority said, and the bridge was reopened shortly after 5 p.m. The more than 26,300-foot structure is the longest suspension bridge in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nMinnesota\n\nEly: Superior National Forest officials said they are expanding their closure order for the popular Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness north of Ely because of the threat of wildfires burning across the Canadian border. The newly expanded order, which took effect Sunday, includes 12 more BWCA entry points and the area around Lac la Croix, in addition to the areas around Crooked and Iron lakes that had been included. It now stretches east nearly to Basswood Lake, west nearly to Crane Lake, and south to the Echo Trail, Minnesota Public Radio News reported. Authorities said wildfires burning unchecked just across the border in Ontario’s Quetico Provincial Park could cross into the BWCA. Forest Service officials said the new order is meant to give campers time to leave the area. The closure order will last at least seven days, or until the fire danger has subsided.\n\nMississippi\n\nTupelo: A lake named for the king of rock ‘n’ roll is closed for repairs and could reopen in the spring of 2024. Elvis Presley Lake has been drained and the entrance to it is locked, the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reported. Dennis Riecke, fisheries and environmental coordinator with the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries & Parks, said plans include an inspection of the drain structure and installation of a rack to prevent logs from getting caught in the drain pipe. They also include the addition of fish attractors or brush piles in the shoreline areas and the addition of gravel beds to provide spawning sites for bass and bluegill. The state in recent years also temporarily closed Trace State Park Lake and Lake Lamar Bruce for improvements. Both are open again.\n\nMissouri\n\nFredericktown: A flash flood in rural eastern Missouri led to a water rescue of two people after their vehicle became stranded in fast-rising water. Heavy rain on Friday prompted a quick rise of the St. Francis River in Madison County. KFVS-TV reported that the water came up so quickly that both people were forced to stand on top of the vehicle to escape drowning. A Missouri State Highway Patrol marine operation trooper, R.A. Walker, and Madison County Emergency Management Director Dean Stevens were able to navigate the flooding waters and rescue the victims.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Extreme heat descended on parts of the U.S. northern Rocky Mountains on Monday, as authorities struggled to contain dozens of wildfires burning in a region parched by prolonged drought and blanketed with dangerous smoke. Record-setting temperatures were forecast for much of eastern Montana and portions of northern Wyoming. Billings, Montana’s largest city, was expected to hit 106 degrees Fahrenheit, topping a record set 61 years ago. Glasgow was forecast to reach 108. The heat will linger through Thursday, the National Weather Service said. Red flag warnings for high-fire risk were issued across almost all of Montana and Idaho and portions of northeastern and western Wyoming. More than two dozen new fires broke out across the three states Sunday, further straining firefighting resources stretched thin by a high number of early summer fires. Thunderstorms rolling through Monday night will bring winds that could fan wildfires and lightning that could spark new ones, according to the weather service.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: City officials are defending their actions to remove a homeless encampment that had been set up in a wooded area. Officials said concerns from residents nearby prompted an investigation by Lincoln Fire and Rescue and the Lincoln-Lancaster County Health Department. Jon Carlson, the mayor’s deputy chief of staff, told the Lincoln Journal Star that conditions were found to be dangerous for those who were living there. Carlson said dead trees, dry brush, wood, grills, propane tanks and gas cans created a fire threat. Health officials also determined conditions were unsanitary. But some homeless advocates said it was unjust to demolish a community people made for themselves. About 20 people attended a protest and sought to raise donations to help those affected by the demolition.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Some Las Vegas resorts and casinos are again requiring employees to wear masks, a response to a recommendation issued by regional health officials amid rising COVID-19 case rates. The Southern Nevada Health District on Friday recommended that all people, regardless of whether they’ve been vaccinated, wear face coverings in public settings such as stores, malls, casinos and events. The district’s recommendation isn’t a mandate but local media outlets reported that it prompted properties such as Westgate Las Vegas, The Venetian and Las Vegas Sands to impose masking requirements for employees. Some properties also posted the district’s recommendation at entrances and offered complimentary masks to visitors. Nevada Resort Association President Virginia Valentine said the district’s guidance was “ an important reminder that masks are effective in reducing spread.” Restrictions affecting casinos and other venues were lifted in May when the state fully returned pandemic control measures to counties.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nMilford: Hitchiner Manufacturing has installed a 510-kilowatt solar array at one of its facilities in Milford. The array will produce more than 625,000 kilowatt-hours of renewable energy every year at a cost of less than $0.04 per kilowatt-hour, the company said in news release Friday. This will save Hitchiner more than $3.5 million over the array’s lifespan, and reduce Hitchiner’s carbon footprint by more than 665,000 pounds annually, the company said. One of the major hurdles in deciding to make the investment was the state’s high electrical costs, the company said. Hitchiner needs to “develop competitive and reliable sources of commercial energy so that businesses, and manufacturers in particular, can grow the state’s economy,” John Morison III, Hitchiner’s chairman and CEO, said. Hitchiner worked with ReVision Energy on the installation.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nSpringfield Township: A small tornado touched down in New Jersey over the weekend leaving behind a trail of damaged trees, the National Weather Service said. According to forecasters, a line of thunderstorms produced the EF-1 twister about a mile from the Burlington County Fairgrounds on Saturday night. It is estimated the tornado was packing winds of 80 to 90 mph. The tornado followed a narrow path of nearly 8 miles, damaging trees north of Columbus-Jobstown Road, snapping tree limbs on Island Road, uprooting a tree on Juliustown-Georgetown Road and causing additional scattered tree damage before the twister dissipated near the Ocean County border. No injuries were reported. The weather service determined a tornado was responsible after surveying the damage on Sunday.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: New Mexico plans to convert two privately run state prisons in rural areas into facilities operated by the Department of Corrections, the agency said. The department said Friday that it will take over operations of the Northwest New Mexico Correctional Center in Grants and the Guadalupe County Correctional Facility in Santa Rosa by November, the Santa Fe New Mexican reported. The facility in Grants is operated by CoreCivic, which is headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee, and the facility in Santa Rosa is operated by Geo Group, which is based in Boca Raton, Florida.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Mayor Bill de Blasio said he does not plan to reinstate a city-wide mask mandate even as COVID-19 cases increase, opting instead to focus on vaccinating more residents. There have been calls for New York City to follow the lead of Los Angeles County, which announced last week that it will require masks be worn indoors amid a sharp increase in virus cases. But De Blasio insisted vaccinations are a better strategy for the nation’s most populous city. There are 4.8 million city residents with at least one vaccine dose, the mayor said. The daily number of COVID-19 cases in the city has increased since mid-June, though the caseloads are nowhere near the pandemic’s peak this past winter. The 628 confirmed and probable cases recorded citywide Thursday, the most recent day available, compares to 241 on July 1. The number of virus cases has been rising around the country, many of them the highly transmissible delta variant. City health officials said the variant makes up about 7 in 10 cases they sequence.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheboro: At the same time the North Carolina Zoo is seeing a huge increase in visitors compared with last year, it’s struggling to find staff to keep all of its exhibits open. “Like just about every other business out there, we’re having difficulty finding applicants,” Diane Villa, director of communications and marketing for the Asheboro zoo, told The Courier-Tribune. Most attractions are open, but certain features like an obstacle course and feeding activities have remained closed, the newspaper reported. Villa said 20 people recently turned out for a job fair with dozens of open positions. She said the zoo is partnering with other organizations that hold job fairs and is advertising locally to try to find applicants. Many of the jobs at the zoo are part time, temporary and pay about $10 to $12 per hour.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nTowner: A California man rode his bicycle to North Dakota to celebrate his mother-in-law’s 90th birthday. Brian Gonsalves, who lives in the San Diego area, isn’t new to long-distance bicycle rides. The X-ray technician rode to Georgia in 2018, a trip totalling 2,709 miles. As a survivor of a 2016 bicycle accident, he used that journey to celebrate his 50th birthday and raise money for Scripps trauma services. “I had a laparotomy, resection of my pancreas, and splenectomy that night,” Gonsalves said of the crash. “Two years later, my employer gave me time off to ride across America. I hope to encourage people to do what they love.” With his wife, Dorreen Drader-Gonsalves, providing his mobile support, he started the 2,143-mile trip from California on June 18 and made it to the International Peace Garden on July 11. From there, they drove the 65 miles to Towner for Beverly Lynch’s birthday party, the Minot Daily News reported. “It’s a beautiful country to ride across,” Gonsalves said. He said the minute he entered North Dakota the roads became “smooth as glass,” unlike some other areas.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A dog that had been missing for five days is back home after it was found trapped between two concrete walls in a nearby home’s garage and freed by firefighters using a saw and sledgehammer. The homeowner called the Cincinnati Fire Department on Sunday after hearing the dog’s cries. Firefighters discovered Gertie had fallen down a crevice and was trapped between the walls. The dog had escaped from its home on July 13 and its owners had put up missing posters across the neighborhood. A video posted on Facebook showed firefighters using the tools to create an opening in the wall to pull Gertie to safety after about 10 minutes. The dog wagged its tail after being rescued. “It was just so sweet, just wagging that little nub tail, and she was just so, she was so excited,” Gertie’s owner, Connie Frick, told WXIX-TV.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Oklahoma reported more than 550 new coronavirus cases Monday as daily cases of the illness continued the upward trend they have charted over the past two weeks. The State Department of Health said the state recorded 557 cases of COVID-19 on Monday, bringing the total number of cases since the pandemic began to 466,733. The rolling average number of daily cases over the past two weeks has increased by 336, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. Oklahoma has seen about 155 cases per 100,000 people in the past two weeks, which ranks 11th in the country for per capita cases. According to Johns Hopkins, about 46.2% of Oklahomans have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and 39.5% of the population is fully vaccinated.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:Oregon’s salmon license plate, first introduced in 1998, is getting an updated, more colorful look, available Sept. 1. Fans of classic salmon license plate who want it on their vehicle have until Aug. 31 to get to the Oregon DMV to register for one. The original plate, designed by Newport artist Herb Goblirsch, was first introduced by the Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board and Oregon Parks and Recreation department in 1998, becoming one of the state’s earliest custom plate designs. Revenue from the specialty plate has contributed more than $8 million into salmon recovery, helping protect and restore native salmon habitats, according to the release announcing the new design, The new design comes from Gretchen Kirchner, an amateur artist and former graphic designer for the watershed board. Kirchner drew inspiration from her 16 years in Oregon and the state’s beaches, forests, mountains and valleys and she worked with OWEB biologists to accurately represent the salmon’s details. More information about the new salmon license plate, auction rules and eligibility, is available at orsalmonplates.com. Registration fees and ordering information are available on the DMV website.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Pennsylvania smashed its record for gambling revenue, state regulators said Monday, reporting nearly $3.9 billion in the last fiscal year as every category of wagering showed growth in one of the nation’s largest casino and gambling states. The rebound comes after pandemic-related shutdowns helped knock casino revenue down significantly. The nearly $3.9 billion from 14 operating casinos, fantasy sports operators and truck stops for the fiscal year ending June 30 beat the previous high, two years ago, by about 17% and last year’s take by more than 40%, according to figures from the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board. Revenue in casinos from slot machines, at just below $1.9 billion, and from table games, at $721 million, remains lower than record highs in previous years. Online casino gambling grew to nearly $900 million in just its second year, and sports betting grew to $309 million in just its third year. Pennsylvania legalized both as part of an aggressive gambling expansion in 2017.\n\nRhode Island\n\nJamestown:A Rhode Island man is planning a 19-mile swim from Block Island to Jamestown on July 31 to raise money for a nonprofit that works to keep oceans clean. Ben Tuff’s grueling swim will raise money for Clean Ocean Access. Just two years ago, he swam 23 miles around Conanicut Island to raise more than $54,000 for the organization, The Newport Daily News reported. Tuff is director of admission at Rumsey Hall School in Connecticut and a former triathlete who grew up in Jamestown. To keep safe, he will wear a shark-repellent device. About 6 feet long, the device will trail behind him. It can be a burden, but Tuff said it will provide peace of mind during a stretch of the swim when he won’t be able to see land. Two boats and a paddle boarder will trail him during the swim. He estimated the swim will take one to two hours more than his Jamestown around-the-island swim in 2019 that lasted 9 hours, 11 minutes, but much depends on currents.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Starting on Oct. 1, 2024, nurseries in South Carolina will be prohibited from selling Bradford Pear and Callery pear trees, according to the Post and Courier. The trees are known for their early spring white flowers. But they also are known as one of the weakest structural trees in existence, with branches that commonly break after 10 to 15 years and a short life expectancy of 20 to 30 years. The ban affects the Bradford pear and any other tree grown from the Pyrus calleryana rootstock. State lawmakers and the state’s Crop Pest Commission approved the ban after an advisory panel added the tree to the State Plant Pest List. The Bradford pear was introduced to the United States in the 1950s. Although technically sterile, its fruit can cross pollinate with any other variety of pear tree and produce Callery pear trees, said David Coyle, assistant professor of Forest Health and Invasive Species at Clemson. He has started a program to encourage people to cut down and replace Bradford pears.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nWatertown: The Department of Game, Fish and Parks is weighing how to proceed on beaver hunting in the Black Hills and the state. The idea for a hunting ban came up recently when the Game, Fish and Parks Commission discussed a proposal to create a year-round beaver hunting season across the state, with hunting only allowed in portions of the Black Hills not owned by the U.S. Forest Service from Nov. 1 to April 30. “By creating one statewide beaver season (with the exception of the Black Hills) that is year-round, it simplifies this regulation and allows landowners in eastern South Dakota the ability to remove beavers that are causing damage,” the proposal stated. Keith Fisk, the agency’s program administrator, said he receives at least 500 beaver complaints on an annual basis, the Black Hills Pioneer reported. “There are a number of landowners out there that would take advantage of this opportunity to remove some of those problem beavers whether it is them practicing that or someone they know willing to come and help them out,” Fisk said. But Commissioner Travis Bies said the Black Hills does not have problems with beavers, and the population has been greatly decreased. Bies called for a study of the beaver population, a suggestion that prompted the commission to table the proposal to its September meeting.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Tennessee officials said state tax revenue continued to exceed projections in the latest monthly report. The Tennessee Department of Finance and Administration said revenue for June were $1.9 billion, which is $372.3 million more than the budgeted monthly revenue estimate and $321.1 million more than June 2020. That represents a growth rate year-over-year of 20.9%. The revenue also represents a monthly growth rate of 18.6% compared to June 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic. The revenue reflects taxable sales activity from the month of May. On an accrual basis, June is the eleventh month in the 2020-2021 fiscal year. Year-to-date revenues were $2.8 billion more than projections.\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso:A section of east El Paso received more than 3 inches of rain within an hour Sunday night, the National Weather Service said Monday. The largest amount of rain – 3.28 inches – was recorded in the Eastwood area along Montwood drives between McRae Boulevard and Yarbrough Drive, according to a NWS rain totals map. The next-largest rain totals were 2.46 inches near Vista Del Sol and Yarbrough Drive and 2.07 inches near the El Paso Community College Valle Verde campus. Other areas of El Paso received less than a half-inch to more than 1 inch of rain Sunday night as thunderstorms moved through the region. Flash flooding was reported in parts of El Paso, where 1 to 2 inches of rain had fallen earlier in the night. Drivers were cautioned not to enter flooded roads. There were reports of vehicles stuck and partially submerged in high water in several parts of the east side, including off Lee Treviño Drive and McRae Boulevard. There also was high water impacting traffic in the area of Interstate 10 and Piedras Street.\n\nUtah\n\nSpringdale:Zion National Park has set a record for visitors in a month. National Park Service data showed the park saw nearly 676,000 visitors in June, topping the number during the same period in 2019 by a wide margin, the Spectrum newspaper reported. In June 2019, the park saw 595,000 visitors. The number dipped in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic to about 377,000 visitors. “We far surpassed our record,” Superintendent Jeff Bradybaugh told the Springdale Town Council. Two other Utah parks, Canyonlands National Park and Capitol Reef National Park, saw their busiest June ever, with nearly 110,000 and 190,000 visitors respectively. Arches National Park temporarily delays entry almost daily now because of high visitation volumes but the official data hasn’t been released for June. Utah parks have seen visitation rise steadily over the past decade, with some parks seeing their average annual attendance nearly double.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Celebrations were held at Amtrak stations across Vermont on Monday to mark the return of passenger rail service to the state. The Vermonter train and the Ethan Allen Express resumed passenger service Monday. The service was suspended last year at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Amtrak offered $1 fares at each Vermont station to include Brattleboro, Bellows Falls, Windsor, White River Junction, Randolph, Montpelier, Waterbury, Essex Junction and St. Albans. The Vermonter train runs between New York City and St. Albans. The Ethan Allen Express runs between Rutland and New York. The southbound Vermonter was a few minutes late when it arrived in Montpelier on Monday. There were scores of people there waiting for it getting ice cream from a food truck and listening to a band that was set up under a tent.\n\nVirginia\n\nSpotsylvania: A massive Virginia solar plant that drew a flood of opposition when it was first proposed is now more than half completed and sending electricity into the power grid. The first phases of the Spotsylvania Solar Center are generating 259 megawatts each day, providing power for some of the companies that bought the rights to the energy, the Free Lance-Star reported. Among them are Apple, Microsoft and the University of Richmond, which contracted to receive the electricity credits from the facility in rural western Spotsylvania County. The remaining portion of the solar facility should be online by the fall, Helen Humphries, a spokeswoman for AES Corp., told the newspaper. The plant is on track to become one of the largest in the U.S., with about 1.8 million panels generating 484 megawatts a day.\n\nWashington\n\nKitsap:The Central Kitsap School District plans to start building a new facility on the campus of Olympic High School to replace Fairview Middle School in 2022. The district’s board members approved its Long-Range Facilities Plan, which includes the replacement of Fairview Middle School, in a board meeting last Wednesday. The long-term facilities plan provides a 40-year roadmap for the replacement and modernization of facilities in Central Kitsap, according to a document provided by the district. Having been meeting regularly with the district’s general contractor, Skanska, Central Kitsap School District will have some conceptual drawings of the new facility in August or September, Newell said in the board meeting. The new facility on the Olympic High campus will accommodate about 750 students, the same number of students which Fairview Middle School currently has, the district’s spokesperson, David Beil, said. The construction is estimated to cost $65 million, with $48.5 million coming from the federal government and $16.5 million from the state, according to a document provided by the district.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Jean Dean, the first woman to serve as mayor of Huntington, has died. Dean died Saturday morning, her son Justin Gibson told the Herald-Dispatch. Her health had been deteriorating, he said. Dean served from 1993 to 2000. Before that, she was director of administration and finance, a position similar to a city manager. “She considered it a great honor to serve the people,” Gibson said. Current Mayor Steve Williams called Dean a “graceful giant.” Her vision, determination and graceful countenance set a foundation on which we continue to benefit, Williams said in a statement. Gibson said his mother was willing to work with representatives in Congress, local business leaders and residents to support the city. Funeral arrangements were pending Sunday.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Wisconsin’s two medical schools are collaborating on a study addressing health disparities in the state. The University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health and the Medical College of Wisconsin will use $3 million in endowment money to measure and recommend solutions for health inequities, which have been underscored by the coronavirus pandemic. The Wisconsin Collaborative for Healthcare Quality is a consortium of state health systems and hospitals. The collaborative in 2020 found low rates of colon cancer screening and HPV vaccination in some rural areas and low rates of childhood vaccinations and depression screening in some urban neighborhoods. Blacks in Wisconsin have higher rates of cancer and sexually transmitted diseases than other groups, and poorer outcomes for stroke, diabetes and asthma, stemming in part from more poverty and less education, according to the state Department of Health Services, the State Journa l reported.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Dusty Campbell completed a 285-mile rollerblade journey from Jackson to Salt Lake City on July 4 in just 47 hours and raised $15,200 for the Wounded Warrior Project, a nonprofit that helps veterans recover from mental and physical injuries. With those service members in mind, Campbell rollerbladed through two nights, resting only for three 30-minute naps. He was still on his wheels at 4:20 a.m. on July 4, with about 50 miles left to go. When he first set off from Town Square in Jackson, there wasn’t much fanfare. The stagecoach driver gave him a tip of the hat, and some tourists vaguely noted the size of his wheels. The symbolism of the location was noted, though, in Instagram live videos that showed the rollerblader in front of the veteran memorial in the center of the square. “In my mind there’s no greater cause,” Campbell said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/16/world/coal-use-record-high-climate-intl/index.html", "title": "The world is burning more coal than ever before -- and the ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe global energy crisis caused by Russia’s war on Ukraine has pushed global demand for coal – the most polluting of all fossil fuels – to a record high in 2022, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Friday.\n\nDemand for coal is set to grow 1.2% and top 8 billion metric tons for the first time ever this year, the IEA said in the latest edition of its annual coal report. This record comes only a year after countries agreed to phase down their use of coal at the United Nations’ climate conference in Glasgow.\n\nThe growth is mostly down to a rapid rise in the prices of natural gas and other fuels, which has forced some countries and regions to turn to coal as a cheaper alternative.\n\nCoal is the world’s largest source of energy for electricity generation and the production of steel and cement. But it is also the biggest single contributor to the climate crisis, accounting for around 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel use.\n\n“Europe – and the European Union in particular – has been one of the regions hardest hit by the energy crisis, given its reliance on Russian pipeline supplies of natural gas,” the report said, adding that technical problems in French nuclear power plants made the problem even worse.\n\nTo keep the lights on, Europe turned back to coal – even switching some of its recently closed coal power plants back on.\n\nPieter de Pous, who leads the Fossil Fuel Transition Program at E3G, a climate think tank, told CNN the growth in coal use was a U-turn, coming “at the end of a decade that saw coal use cut in half.”\n\nThe IEA said that while the increase in coal consumption was relatively modest in most European countries, Germany saw a reversal of a “significant scale.”\n\nThat has put the EU, which has positioned itself as a global climate leader, into an uncomfortable position, with some criticizing European countries like Germany for only pursuing the green agenda when it suits them. Germany and the EU have pushed back on that idea, stressing the U-turn was only temporary and that the bloc has significantly ramped up its investment into renewable energy.\n\nThe IEA expects the EU’s coal use to drop 29% by 2025 compared to 2022, de Pous said. “This will be the result of action taken in as many as 19 EU countries to accelerate renewables,” he added.\n\nChina, which accounts for more than half of global coal consumption, also ramped up its use of coal earlier this year, when the worst heatwave and drought in six decades hit its hydroelectricity production.\n\nIn August alone, coal power generation in China increased by around 15% compared to the same period last year, the IEA said, to a level of generation that was higher than the total annual coal power generation of any other country, except India and the United States.\n\nRichard Black, a senior associate at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, a climate advisory group, said that despite the increase in China’s use of coal, the long term direction for coal in China and India – another major coal user – was clear.\n\n“Renewables are going to be providing an increasing share of the generation and the role of coal is going to transition from being a baseload fuel to being a backup,” he said.\n\n“The science suggests that a country such as China ought to have eliminated unabated coal use by 2040 and ideally earlier than that,” he said. “That’s absolutely feasible. As with Europe, if there is a short term increase in coal use, that’s not necessarily a disaster. The key thing is going to be to build out transmission capacity, build out energy storage, keep on making energy use more efficient, and to provide alternatives for the workers in the places where coal mining is a big employer so that there’s a socially just transition.”\n\n‘Peak in fossil fuel use’\n\nThe IEA forecasts that global coal consumption will remain flat at the current level to 2025 as falls in some countries are offset by continued strong demand in emerging Asian economies. Although there are global moves to help big coal producing countries transition off the fossil fuel. This week, Vietnam agreed to a $15.5 billion climate-financing deal with leaders from G7 industrialized nations to move away from coal, which followed a recent $20 billion funding deal for Indonesia to increase clean energy and phase out coal.\n\n“The world is close to a peak in fossil fuel use, with coal set to be the first to decline, but we are not there yet,” said Keisuke Sadamori, the IEA’s director of energy markets and security, said in a press release.\n\nEarlier this year, the IEA said CO2 emissions from coal power generation were forecast to grow by more than 200 million tons, or 2%, this year. It said that investment into new fossil fuels infrastructure must stop immediately if the world wants any chance of achieving net zero by 2050.\n\nThe latest climate science shows that achieving net zero by the mid-century is necessary to keep temperatures from rising well above 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared with pre-industrial times. Beyond that threshold, the world will face climate crisis impacts that could take millennia to correct, or could be irreversible altogether.", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová"], "publish_date": "2022/12/16"}]}

A dollar store now occupies the plot of land where Richard's stood.\n\nThe 12-lane bowling center was one of several in the Ithaca area during the sport's heyday in the 1960s, '70s and '80s, and attracted players from Trumansburg, Ithaca and the surrounding areas. The establishment's beloved proprietor, Richard Updike, who died in October 1995, created a unique, welcoming atmosphere at the bar, and his restaurant featured prime rib that people would drive miles to enjoy.\n\n\"I used to go there and watch football games and have a hamburger and just meet people at the bar,\" Todd Parlato of Trumansburg said. \"I was brand new to the area and didn't know anybody, and I was saddened as well when it burned down. I loved going there.\"\n\nParlato, an Oneonta native, is a forester by education who took an internship in the Hector National Forest approximately 20 years ago and never left. He is also a restaurateur, having worked for more than 13 years at Maxie's Supper Club in Ithaca, the last eight as its general manager. He left there more than two years ago and began the process of opening his own establishment.\n\nThat process is scheduled to come to fruition at 5 p.m. Wednesday with the opening of Atlas, a restaurant and bar that includes the odd feature, both literally and figuratively, of seven bowling lanes. That \"lucky\" number perhaps illustrates where Parlato and his team — designer Jon Wagner and restaurant operations \"guru\" Pete Browning, chef/owner of Viva Taqueria — are placing their priorities.\n\n\"We decided that instead of doing a traditional bowling center, which really isn't that interesting to me,\" Parlato said, \"we would really put the focus on a restaurant and a bar, that has an entertainment concept to it, that component being bowling. If we had more space, we probably would have brought in vintage pinball machines and dart boards, but we're comfortable with the layout we have.\"\n\nWhile the official opening is Wednesday evening, the public got a sneak peek at Atlas on Saturday night during a fundraising event for the TCSD Foundation, a not-for-profit corporation that provides funding for not-for-profit organizations that benefit students in the Trumansburg school district. The event attracted approximately 400 people, Parlato said, and raised $2,437 for the foundation.\n\nHe also hosted an invitation-only gathering on Sunday for friends, family and people who've helped in the planning and construction of Atlas, including the 25-person staff.\n\nParlato and his partners have made a considerable investment in Atlas, and have taken out a 30-year lease with the building's owner, David McCune of McCune & Murphy Physical Therapy, P.C.\n\nMcCune's Trumansburg office occupies the other half of the 14,000-square-foot building at 61 W. Main St., which they bought in 2013.\n\nThe furniture inside Atlas was designed by Wagner and built by local artisans who \"are just super-talented,\" Parlato said. The restaurant features seating for approximately 120, with a designated space in one corner for gatherings of up to 22 people — \"24 if you're friendly,\" Parlato said with a laugh.\n\nThe settee area behind the lanes has facing benches with a low table in the middle for beverages and snacks, and the scoring table is illuminated by a modern silver lamp. But that's the only modern thing about the scoring desk: Bowlers will keep their own scores with pencil and paper score sheets, in keeping with the retro theme of Atlas' bowling experience.\n\nThe Brunswick machines and lanes were purchased from a now-defunct bowling center in Detroit, Parlato said, and are from the 1950s although updated in some respects. The gutters, for example, feature pop-up rail bumpers that are popular for children's bowling parties.\n\nParlato said the seven-lane concept is a function of space. The inside of the former grocery store was large enough for a more traditional eight-lane setup, but that would have cut into the pantry and the sitting area near the three-sided bar, which was crafted with wood from that eighth lane. So the decision was made to leave the bowling at seven lanes.\n\nThat there will be a bowling establishment in the village for the first time in nearly 16 years is great news, says Jack Fulton, whose late father, Charles, built Tri-County Lanes in the mid-1950s along with his mother, Marge, who still lives in town.\n\n\"There's no doubt it's a welcome thing for the village, the kids need something to do,\" said Fulton, who bought Tri-County from his parents in 1974 and recruited Updike to run the restaurant. \"Bowling has sort of dropped off again from what it was. We bowl in Watkins Glen now, have for about 10 years, there's eight or nine of us that go over there and bowl. And a lot of the good bowlers have quit bowling.\"\n\nThere's no certainty that regular league bowlers will be coming back to Trumansburg any time soon. Parlato said he's considering the possibility of leagues in the fall, but not the traditional 30-week variety.\n\n\"Most of the people I know who are interested lead really busy lives,\" he said, \"and the commitment for six months is hard for a lot of us to dial in. But if you did six weeks, people can do that and then take a week off, and then we fire up another six-week league.\"\n\nParlato said he might gear leagues toward hospitality workers, people in the restaurant business or winery/brewery owners, to \"bring communities of people together to kind of commiserate and network within their communities.\"\n\nWhile Richard's and Tri-County Lanes was more a traditional bowling center as well as a popular gathering place, Atlas will definitely be a restaurant first, Parlato said.\n\n\"Our name is Atlas, and our tagline is 'Eat, Drink, Bowl,'\" he said, \"and we place our emphasis in that order. We're really focused on the restaurant, the bar and the bowling, but the restaurant has to be successful and pleasing to everybody for us to consider it a success.\"\n\nFollow Tom Fleischman on Twitter @TomF_IJSports.\n\nIf you go\n\nWhat: Atlas (Eat, Drink, Bowl).\n\nWhere: 61 W.

This is an invitational tournament for all first-place teams in sanctioned Morris County Leagues.\n\nThe scratch team winners were: North Jersey Three — Bob Lapinski, Justin Cabiltes, Jim Hosier, Stephen Friedella and Mark Wykoff, 3428. They were followed by The Barn — Lynne and Bill Coleman, Gene Pukas, Glenn Frey and Ricky McColligan Jr., 3147 and We “B” Different — Tyrone Roberts, Pat and Charles Wilfong, Bette Simmons and Thomas Thorpe, 3053.\n\nIn the Handicap Team Division, top winner was We “B” Different (3530 gross), followed by Crystal Mountain Springs — Judy Layton, Mabel DiPetrillo, Sheila Phillips, Carol Chadwick and Nancy Hunt, (3512), Jersey Girls — Susan Sweller, Shirley White, Colleen Graham, Gloria Jichetti and Bev Maliwee (3456), and The Barn (3444).\n\nGlenn Frey posted high game for men with 296 while Nancy Hunt paced the women with 256. For series, it was Jim Hosier with a big 813 and Rachel West, 589.\n\n“I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone for their participation in this year's tournament and look forward to your participation next year,” tournament director Arnold Coslit said.\n\nPostcard from Mechanicsburg\n\nGuy and I had the honor of going to Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, last Friday to see the PWBA tournament. For starters, we could hardly get in the front door of ABC West Lanes because the crowd of spectators was so big!\n\n“This has become the new norm. Big supportive crowds,” tournament director Tennille Milligan said.\n\nThe second observation was to see all the triple ball bags and the physical work the ladies had to do just to get all their equipment from lane to lane. Additionally, the format consisted of two eight-game blocks, one at 9 a.m. and the other at 5 p.m. before the cut was made to the top 32. It appeared to be an extremely demanding condition.\n\nIt was great to see Jersey girls Kelly Kulick, Jen Russo and our localite Michelle DeVries in the qualifiers. We also watched a local 17-year-old girl bowl a 279 game. She participates in the Pennsylvania Junior Bowlers Tour, which is excellent for her to bowl with different conditions in different centers. Her attitude was great and Chloe Skurzynski from Carlisle, Pennsylvania, will go a long way, to say the least.\n\nEach player gave each other a “low 5” after each shot. The finals on Xtra Frame showed that the shot was still more than challenging. In the final match. Shannon O’Keefe lost to newcomer Jordan Richard, both on Hammer Staff. The scores were 222-194.\n\nThe best part, including Jordan’s happy tears, was Shannon’s obvious sportsmanship as she hugged the winner. This week the women are in Florida for the US Open. Watch all the action on Xtra Frame but note that the championship rounds will be televised on CBS Sports Network at 5 p.m. Saturday.\n\nShe did it again! Val Johannessen saw her ninth sanctioned 300 game. This was on the first night of the Michelob Ultra Doubles League at Circle Lanes, on her 205 average. She used a Hammer Phobia drilled by the man, Ken Yokobosky. Way to start a summer league!\n\nAs you read this, I will be on my way to Syracuse, New York, with three county women to bowl in my first USBC National Tournament.\n\nI thought back to my first of many WIBC (women’s) national tournaments. Each team lined up on her lane for the national anthem, and I thought I whispered to myself, “What am I doing here.” Apparently the team on the next lanes heard me and giggled. Good times.\n\nWhile my aspirations include having fun, doing my best and maybe winning some brackets, I look forward to a place highly recommended by the locals known as Dinosaur Barbecue. Maybe a dinosaur will taste like chicken.\n\nA big scholarship tournament is coming up featuring $10,000 in scholarships for youth bowlers.

Andy Beshear and Louisville Gas & Electric spokesperson Liz Pratt described efforts to restore power as a \"multi-day\" process during separate press conferences Saturday. At one point, according to power outage aggregator poweroutage.us, more than 500,000 people in the commonwealth were without electricity.\n\n7:30 p.m.: Schools cancel classes Monday\n\nJefferson County Public Schools announced classes will be canceled Monday. A release Sunday evening said that there are nine schools without or with partial power and another 25 without internet access.\n\n\"While crews continue to work throughout the night to restore power to as many schools as possible, we know our families and staff were impacted by the storm,\" a release from Carolyn Callahan, JCPS spokeswoman said. \"We want to support our families and staff, so all JCPS schools will be closed Monday, March 6, 2023.

She noted higher priority locations, including nursing homes, fire stations and hospitals, are addressed first, followed by residential customers.\n\nThrough a mutual aid partnership, 1,500 technicians and support personnel from out of state are working on repairs in Kentucky, Pratt said. The storm downed 2,500 power lines and snapped over 230 utility poles.\n\nFewer than 10 roads were still blocked due to tree debris in Jefferson County, public works officials said Sunday. Intermingling with electrical wires is delaying those roads for being cleared, said spokesman Sal Melendez.\n\nCrews will start working on clearing alleys Monday. The city will open seven sites for yard waste drop-off, which will operate 8 a.m. - 7 p.m. Monday-Saturday.

According to poweroutage.us, about 227,000 homes across the state are still without power as of about 12:40 p.m.\n\nAbout 30 local schools are still without power, Jefferson County Public Schools spokesperson Carolyn Callahan said Sunday morning. The district, which called off classes Friday, has not said whether school will be in session Monday.\n\n“We will continue to monitor this situation throughout the day. Our crew and LG&E are working as quickly and safely as they can,” Callahan said in an email.\n\nThe work continues in Louisville and the surrounding region.

The Friday storm accounted for the third-most significant power outage event in the past 20 years, she added.\n\nWhat happened Friday?\n\nA strong storm ripped through Kentucky on Friday, dropping several inches of rain throughout the state. High-speed winds followed, dropping trees and power lines and causing widespread damage.\n\nAt least five people were killed due to the storm, Beshear said Saturday: a 23-year-old man in Edmonson County, a 63-year-old man in Logan County, an 84-year-old man in Bath County, a 68-year-old man in Simpson County and a 41-year-old woman in Fayette County.\n\nLouisville officials do not believe the storm caused any deaths in Jefferson County, but it did lead to widespread property damage and at least two major interstate closures Friday, as wind speeds in the region peaked at 79 mph.\n\nSchools were out Friday in anticipation of the storm but were expected to be back in session Monday.\n\nReporters Ana Rocío Álvarez Bríñez and Matthew Glowicki contributed.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnists/joan-taylor/2018/07/01/kiss-bowling-camp-rockaway-ken-yokoboskyrolls-simpler-format/748412002/", "title": "KISS Bowling Camp in Rockaway rolls to simpler format", "text": "Joan Taylor\n\nColumnist\n\nWelcome to the 18th Pro Image KISS Bowling Camp! Not KIDS, it’s KISS, as in Keep It Simple, Stupid.\n\nAfter 17 camps at Rockaway Lanes, Ken Yokobosky and his staff of Incredibles came up with a new, simpler format, and the campers and coaches alike seemed to welcome the change. Today was the last day of the three-day camp.\n\nHere are the highlights of the modifications.\n\nOld: Each of seven or eight coaches spent about 25 minutes with five bowlers on a pair of lanes, and then moved to the next pair. New: Each of six coaches spent a full hour on a pair of lanes with five bowlers.\n\nOld: Every lane was used, except a few lower ones for special sessions. New: Every other pair was used, increasing the time with coaches, without the expected lane courtesy on adjacent lanes.\n\nOld: Coach Ken Yokobosky using “The Coach’s Corner” software on lanes 1 and 2 for one-on-one video sessions and immediate reviews of the video. New: Yokobosky took the videos on each pair of lanes he was coaching with a tablet, sharing the videos instantly with each camper and his or her partners on the lanes as well.\n\nOld: Former camper Eric Gentilella ran the Digitrtax which recorded ball speed, angle of entry, launch angle off the bowler’s hand and more. New: No more Digitrax, taking up time and lanes.\n\nOld: Long classroom and on-lane sessions. New: One hour classroom, one hour lanes, one hour classroom, etc. Each day ended at 4 p.m. instead of 5 p.m.\n\nSomewhat new: The bowling ball “demo day” was brought back. This one sponsored by Storm whereby the campers could try out bowling balls with the option of buying them.\n\nOne element that remained the same, thankfully, was Donna Ratta and her staff at the Pinsetter Café providing breakfast (muffins, bagels, orange juice, coffee) each of the three days. They also provided homestyle lunches, Friday’s being baked ziti, meatballs, wings and salad, Saturday’s being a cold buffet with side salads, and today assorted pizzas were planned. All this was included in the camp tuition.\n\nYoungest, oldest\n\nThis year’s youngest camper isn’t even in high school yet. Amanda Granata of Florham Park is 13 and going into eighth grade at Ridgedale Middle School. She already has won a Junior Bowlers Tour Masters tournament in the handicap division and came to improve her game over her 158 average.\n\nRobert Pontillo was a repeat camper, proving you are never too old to learn at age 76.\n\nDawn Palmer of Sparta attended her fourth nonconsecutive camp. “Each time I was given different things to work on, such as my timing, my first step and not knuckling the ball,” she said.\n\nMore Bowling:Champion of Champions tournament winners announced\n\nThis year’s coaching staff added the PBA’s Eastern Region Tournament Director Russ Mills. In addition to Yokobosky, gold level and head women’s bowling coach at Caldwell University, the rest of “the Incredibles” were silver level coach and Brunswick staffer John Neral, Wichita State University’s head bowling coach Gordon Vadakin, silver level coach and seminar leader John Yankanich, head coach of Team Puerto Rico and USBC Hall of Fame 2018 inductee Jeri Edwards and camp manager Natalie Pedri, who graduated from nursing school this year.\n\nThe newest and most significant theme of the camp was “What do you need?” Each camper expressed the top three areas of his or her game to improve upon, and the coaches worked with those elements. Today, a tournament was scheduled, and next week’s Part Two of this column will give the results as well as comments from bowlers who got the most out of this amazing camp, camp KISS!\n\nCalendar\n\nThursday: Entries close for the fourth annual Morris County USBC WBA Mixed Charity Tournament at Boonton Lanes, benefiting the Bowlers to Veterans Link.

Wade, corporate giants from a range of industries pledged to provide support and financial assistance for employees — and, in some cases, their dependents — seeking abortions in states that outlaw the procedure.\n\nThe court’s decision to roll back the nearly 50-year-old landmark ruling, which protected the federal, constitutional right to an abortion, is expected to transform the landscape of reproductive health in America, leaving abortion policy up to individual states and paving the way for numerous states to pass new abortion restrictions. As of Friday afternoon, state officials in at least seven states said that new abortion bans can now be enforced.\n\nMillions of people seeking abortions could soon be forced to travel across state lines to access the procedure, adding to the cost of an already often expensive healthcare service. For many, employers’ benefit packages may be the only way they can afford an abortion.\n\nIn response, corporations, some with headquarters or offices in Republican-controlled states, are taking action. Companies such as Citigroup (C), Salesforce (CRM) and Match Group (MTCH) first promised financial support to employees seeking abortions in affected states after a draft version of the opinion leaked in May. Many more followed suit on Friday. Some, including Bumble and Lyft, also previously said they would donate to organizations that support women’s rights, such as Planned Parenthood and Fund Texas Choice.\n\nCorporate America is increasingly being drawn from the political sidelines on the abortion issue in response to pressure from investors, customers and employees. Companies are also struggling to attract and retain talent, and worry about the impact these states’ anti-abortion laws could have on their workers.\n\nHere are some of the prominent companies offering expanded assistance to staff in states curtailing abortion care.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) extended its financial support for “critical healthcare,” including abortions and gender-affirming care, to include coverage for travel expenses for such services, after the draft opinion overturning Roe was first leaked.\n\nApple\n\nThe company’s existing benefits package allows employees to travel out of state for medical care if it is unavailable in their home state, according to an Apple (AAPL) spokesperson.\n\nThe tech giant intends to offer travel expense reimbursement “to the extent permitted by law” for employees seeking out-of-state health care and reproductive services, according to a spokesperson. “We are in the process of assessing how best to do so given the legal complexities involved,” the Meta spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nYelp\n\nYelp’s existing healthcare plan for US employees pays for women, family members and partners to travel out of states with strict abortion laws, such as Texas and Oklahoma, which ban abortions after 6 weeks.\n\n“This ruling puts women’s health in jeopardy, denies them their human rights, and threatens to dismantle the progress we’ve made toward gender equality in the workplaces since Roe,” Jeremy Stoppelman, co-founder of Yelp (YELP), said in a statement Friday. “Business leaders must step up to support the health and safety of their employees by speaking out against the wave of abortion bans that will be triggered as a result of this decision, and call on Congress to codify Roe into law.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Why this company will cover travel and health care for employees seeking an abortion 02:59 - Source: CNN\n\nDisney\n\nDisney (DIS) employees who are unable to access medical care in one location will be given affordable coverage to access the same care in another location, according to a company spokesperson. The benefit covers family planning and pregnancy-related decisions.\n\nUber\n\nUber (UBER)’s US insurance plans already cover reproductive health benefits, including abortion and travel expenses to access healthcare. The rideshare company will also reimburse any drivers sued under state law for providing transportation to a clinic through the app, according to an Uber (UBER) spokesperson.\n\nNetflix\n\nThe streaming company offers travel reimbursement coverage for US full-time employees and their dependents who need to travel for healthcare treatments including abortions and gender-affirming care, a Netflix (NFLX) spokesperson told CNN. The company provides a lifetime allowance of $10,000 per employees (or their dependents) per service.\n\nBumble\n\nBumble (BMBL), a female-driven dating app, said Friday that it will support its employees’ ability to access “the healthcare services they need,” including abortion care. A Bumble (BMBL) spokesperson added that the company will donate to the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas and Planned Parenthood Federation of America.\n\n“Abortion is healthcare, and healthcare is a human right. We are deeply troubled by the Supreme Court decision,” the spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nMatch Group\n\nDating app company Match Group (MTCH) in October established a partnership with Planned Parenthood Los Angeles to provide abortion access for its Texas employees and their dependents. The company is currently considering expanding that benefit to all its US staff, including remote employees in states with trigger laws that may soon ban abortions, according to a Match spokesperson. Match healthcare plans also help to cover travel and lodging costs for employees who need to travel to receive care, the spokesperson said.\n\nBox.com\n\nBox.com will cover employee travel and medical expenses incurred by employees while seeking reproductive services.\n\nLevi Strauss\n\nThe denim company said through The Levi Strauss Foundation that it is providing grants to the Center for Reproductive Rights, Afiya Center and ARC-Southeast which provides direct assistance to women and communities in need of care. The company previously said that under its benefits plan, employees can be reimbursed for travel expenses for services not available in their home state, including abortion. Part-time staff and others who aren’t included in the company’s benefits plan are also eligible for reimbursement, it said.\n\nComcast-NBC Universal\n\nComcast (CCZ) has an existing healthcare travel benefit for all employees that covers up to $4,000 per trip, up to three trips per year, with a maximum coverage cap of $10,000 per year. The amount paid out depends on the type of health care procedure, but abortion care is covered, according to the company.\n\nWarner Bros Discovery\n\nWarner Brothers Discovery, which owns CNN, on Friday expanded healthcare benefits options to include expenses for employees and their covered family members who need to travel to access abortions and other reproductive care, according to a company spokesperson.\n\nCondé Nast\n\nThe media company said Friday it will reimburse travel and lodging for employees who need abortion, infertility or gender-reaffirming services and cannot obtain them locally. CEO Roger Lynch said in an internal memo the Supreme Court decision was a “crushing blow to reproductive rights” and said the most powerful way the company can respond is through its content and journalism.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\n\nJPMorgan (JPM) on Friday said that its health care benefits have long covered abortion care. And starting in July, abortion will be included in the company’s health care travel benefit that covers services that can only be obtained far from home, according to spokesperson Joseph Evangelisti.\n\nNike\n\nThe sportswear company said in a statement that it covers travel and lodging expenses in situations where healthcare services are not available close to home, according to a statement Nike (NKE) released Friday.\n\n“No matter where our teammates are on their family planning journey — from contraception and abortion coverage, to pregnancy and family-building support through fertility, surrogacy and adoption benefits — we are here to support their decisions,” the statement reads.\n\nStarbucks\n\nThe coffee company is providing employees enrolled in its healthcare plan a medical travel benefit to access an abortion, according to a public letter to employees by Sara Kelly, Starbucks (SBUX) acting executive vice president of partner resources.\n\n“We all need to process this in our own way, and as you do, here is what I want you to know: no matter where you live, or what you believe, we will always ensure you have access to quality healthcare,” Kelly said in the letter.\n\nDick’s Sporting Goods\n\nFor employees who live in a state that restricts abortion access, Dick’s will provide up to $4,000 in travel expense reimbursement to travel to the nearest location where care is legally available, the company said in a statement Friday. The benefit will be provided to any employee, spouse or dependent enrolled in its medical plan, along with one support person.\n\nKroger\n\nThe grocer’s healthcare package includes travel benefits of up to $4,000 to facilitate access for reproductive healthcare services, including abortion and fertility treatments, according to a Kroger (KR) spokesperson.\n\nAlaska Airlines\n\nAlaska Airlines said in a statement that it has always provided travel reimbursements for “certain medical procedures and treatments if they are not available where you live.”\n\n“Today’s Supreme Court decision does not change that,” it said.\n\nGoldman Sachs\n\nGoldman Sachs (FADXX) on Friday extended its healthcare travel reimbursement policies to include all medical procedures, treatments and evaluations, including abortion services, in areas where a provider is not available near to where its employees live, a benefit that will be effective July 1, according to an internal memo obtained by CNN.\n\nZillow\n\nZillow (Z) said in a statement Friday that its health benefits cover a wide range of reproductive health services, including abortions. The company said that as of June 1, its health plan has been updated to include a reimbursement of up to $7,500 “each time significant travel is necessary to access health care, including reproductive services.”\n\nHP\n\nThe technology company said in a statement that its existing healthcare plan covers a “wide range of reproductive health services,” including abortion and related travel costs.\n\nHPE\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise, which spun off from HP several years ago and moved its headquarters earlier this year from Silicon Valley to Texas, offers a medical plan that covers out of state care, including abortions and related travel expenses, according to a company spokesperson.\n\n“Restricting a woman’s ability and choices in obtaining health care is inequitable and harmful to the advancement of women,” HPE CEO Antonio Neri said on Twitter Saturday.\n\nAcccenture\n\nAccenture’s existing healthcare plan includes “a full range of reproductive healthcare benefits” and travel assistance for “covered medial services” that are not located within 100 miles of an employee’s residence, a company spokesperson told CNN.\n\nChobani\n\nThe yogurt company updated its healthcare policy for employees in May, following the leak of the draft opinion on Roe, to cover transportation and lodging expenses for any employee or dependent (as well as one caregiver) who needs to travel to receive specialized healthcare, including abortions. The policy also includes reimbursement for childcare costs incurred from the travel, according to a memo Chobani COO Kevin Burns sent to employees in May, which was shared with CNN.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy Jennifer Korn", "Clare Duffy", "Jennifer Korn"], "publish_date": "2022/06/24"}]}

Theodore Rothrock of St. Elizabeth Seton Catholic Church from leadership.\n\n\"The only lives that matter are their own and the only power they seek is their own,\" Rothrock wrote in his weekly message on Sunday, June 28. \"They are wolves in wolves clothing, masked thieves and bandits, seeking only to devour the life of the poor and profit from the fear of others. They are maggots and parasites at best, feeding off the isolation of addiction and broken families, and offering to replace any current frustration and anxiety with more misery and greater resentment.\"\n\nHe went on to say the church must oppose Black Lives Matter and Antifa and carry the \"message of peace.\"\n\nHe also criticized the destruction of monuments and questioned whether Frederick Douglass and Martin Luther King Jr. would have been marching with the Black Lives Matter organizers because of the \"alleged systematic racism.\"\n\n\"Black Lives Matter, Antifa, and the other nefarious acolytes of their persuasion are not the friends or allies we have been led to believe,\" Rothrock wrote. \"They are serpents in the garden, seeking only to uproot and replant a new species of human made in the likeness of man and not in the image of God.\"\n\nProtests:Women in viral video file excessive-force lawsuit against IMPD officers\n\nAll of his weekly messages, including the one on Black Lives Matter, and the staff contact page have since been taken down.\n\nRothrock did not immediately respond to IndyStar's request for comment.\n\n'Expect Father Rothrock to issue a clarification'\n\nRothrock was ordained in 1983, according to a Diocese of Lafayette-in-Indiana newsletter.\n\nHe previously was the president of St. Theodore Guerin High School but resigned in 2009, after he was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol. He later was charged with operating a vehicle with an Alcohol Concentration Equivalent of .08 or higher.\n\nHe is poised to take over as the missionary pastor at Our Lady of Mount Carmel.\n\nIn a statement posted online titled \"Pastoral response to racism,\" Bishop Timothy Doherty from the Diocese of Lafayette-in-Indiana said he hadn't approved or previewed the article.\n\n\"Pastors do not submit bulletin articles or homilies to my offices before they are delivered,\" he said. \"I expect Father Rothrock to issue a clarification about his intended message. I have not known him to depart from Church teaching in matters of doctrine and social justice.\"\n\nDoherty also refrenced a column he wrote in early June, in which he called the killing of George Floyd brutal and unjust.\n\n\"Peaceful demonstrations in the streets are one way to elevate voices for fairness and justice. Not so the wanton destruction of property and violence,\" Doherty wrote. \"I ask our priests, in particular, to include prayer intentions in all our upcoming Masses for an end to injustice and the poison of racism, so that our very lives will breathe justice and compassion.\"\n\nHe didn't answer IndyStar questions about whether Rothrock would be removed from church leadership.\n\nCommunity reactions\n\nCarmel Mayor Jim Brainard, who is an active member of the church according to Carmel's website, declined to comment specifically on the pastor's message.\n\n“My administration will continue to work to make Carmel a place where everyone regardless of background can thrive and prosper,\" Brainard told IndyStar. \"Great cities must be places where people of any race, religion or place of origin feel welcome and included.”\n\nThe newly formed Carmel Against Racial Injustice group called for parishioners of the church, other religious leaders and members of the community to denounce the message.\n\n\"Carmel Against Racial Injustice is disgusted and shocked by the recent letter written by Father Theodore Rothrock,\" the group said in a statement. \"We are also deeply saddened by the fact that the church leadership did not condemn the statement and saw fit to allow its publication. Silence is the action of being complicit in injustice.\"\n\nThe group plans to hold a protest in front of the church Sunday, July 5, from 7 a.m. until 6:30 p.m. calling for Doherty to remove Rothrock.\n\nCall IndyStar reporter Kaitlin Lange at 317-432-9270.

The young Hopi girl still remembers what she encountered at what was one of the country's largest boarding schools for elementary and high school Native American students.\n\n“The teacher put out a box of standard readers for me to read,” said Talahongva. She pulled out the eighth-grade book, but the teacher told her to start with a fifth-grade reader. “That book was just a tiny little book, and it was just a little more difficult than the Dick and Jane readers.\"\n\nAfter Talahongva demonstrated her reading ability, the teacher said, “’You don’t belong here; you need to find a different reading class.’’ She ended up in a senior honors class.\n\nTalahongva, the curator of the Phoenix Indian School Visitor’s Center, said the inferior education she and other students received seemed to hearken back to the school's original purpose as the Phoenix Indian Industrial School, when education took a back seat to learning farming or domestic chores.\n\n“They were set up for failure,” she said.\n\nNative boarding schools left generations of Indigenous people ill-equipped to survive in or out of their home communities. They endured poor education, severe punishment for the smallest infractions or for speaking their Native languages, disease resulting from poor sanitation and health care, abuse and the traumatic effects of ripping children as young as 5 from their homes to be sent hundreds or thousands of miles away.\n\nHundreds or even thousands of children died in government-funded boarding schools.\n\nThe legacy of those schools echoed with the gruesome discovery in June of more than 1,000 remains of Native children buried in unmarked graves on the grounds of several Canadian residential schools for First Nations students. Now, U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland has pledged to take action.\n\nHaaland, a member of the Laguna Pueblo whose grandparents were subject to the boarding school system, has launched an investigation into the lasting effects of the more than 350 government-funded Indian boarding schools in the United States.\n\nHaaland said in a statement that the primary goals of the Federal Boarding School Initiative are to identify boarding school facilities and sites, locate known and possible burial sites at the schools, and determine the identities and tribal affiliations of children who are buried in these cemeteries.\n\nIn a video provided to the National Congress of American Indians in June, Haaland referred to her own ancestors who endured assimilationist policies by the department she now leads.\n\nAmong the 51 known Indian boarding schools in Arizona, 28 are still open, and three continue to offer boarding to students. Most of them are run by the Bureau of Indian Education, an Interior Department agency. One former boarding school, Shonto Preparatory in the Navajo Nation, is managed both by the bureau and as a state charter high school.\n\nBIE schools:The federal government gives Native students an inadequate education and gets away with it\n\nAt least two Catholic-run schools, St. Peters Mission School in Bapchule in the Gila River Indian Community, and St. Michael Indian School in the Navajo Nation, are also still open.\n\nThe discoveries in Canada have led to renewed calls for more investigations. Canadian news outlets reported that more than 1,000 unmarked graves and human remains of Indigenous children in at least four Canadian residential schools were found, with more inquiries at other schools in the works. The news set off a firestorm of protests across Canada, including nationwide marches on Canada Day on July 1.\n\nSince then, several Catholic churches have been set ablaze, and statues of Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth II were toppled in Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nCenturies of assimilation policies to be examined\n\nHaaland’s directive aims to shed light on the centuries-long controversy of governmental policies meant to quash tribal cultures, languages and religions and assimilate Indigenous peoples into Western society.\n\nUsing Western-style education methods to “civilize” Indians dates as far back as the pre-Revolutionary War era. In the mid-17th century, colonists established what is now called Dartmouth College and the “Indian College” at Harvard University, among other such institutions. The first Native person to graduate from a Western-style university was Caleb Cheeshahteaumuck, a Wampanoag from Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts. He obtained a degree from Harvard in 1665.\n\nOther such schools opened throughout the colonies, including Jesuit-run schools like a Catholic school that educated Native youth in St. Mary’s City, Maryland, established in 1677.\n\nDig deeper on race and identity:Subscribe to This Is America, USA TODAY's newsletter\n\nAfter the founding of the United States, sentiment turned from simply inculcating Native peoples with Western ways through higher education toward a more aggressive assimilationist policy. Henry Knox, President George Washington’s Secretary of War, said it was “impracticable to civilize the Indians of North America” despite teaching farming and arts to Native people.\n\nThat sentiment led to a nearly two-century policy of assimilating Native children into Western ways. The Civilization Fund Act of 1819 funded organizations, including many religious orders, to educate Indigenous children in schools in or near tribal communities.\n\nThe most well-known era of these schools started in the late 1870s, when Brigadier General Richard Henry Pratt instituted military-style discipline and strict rules against practicing tribal cultures, speaking Native languages or wearing long hair or traditional clothing in Indian schools. His motto was “Kill the Indian, save the man.”\n\nPratt’s philosophy shaped Native education for the next several decades after he founded the first off-reservation boarding school, the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania, in 1879.\n\nPratt’s model became the norm nationwide. Native children as young as 5 were forced from their families and shipped off to schools as far as 2,000 miles from home. The kids' hair was cut. They were scrubbed down in tubs with harsh soap and given uniforms. The children learned to march everywhere. They were required to attend Christian churches. Boys were educated in industrial arts or in farming; girls in domestic duties. All students received only basic instruction in reading, writing and math.\n\nStudents in these institutions suffered not only from poor education, but from poor sanitation leading to swiftly-spreading diseases like tuberculosis and measles, which caused many deaths. Health care was sporadic and spotty. Children were forced to work hard on farms, in the laundries and in other parts of the school. Many children suffered physical and sexual abuse from teachers and caretakers. Punishment for small infractions could be severe.\n\nWhen graduates of these schools returned home, they bore the physical and mental scars of their experience. The Native American Rights Fund reported in 2013 that the directors of the boarding schools expected Indians to return home as capable farmers and farm wives who worshipped in Christian churches.\n\nInstead, unable to speak their languages, relate to their communities or conduct themselves in cultural practices and lacking parenting skills, many Native people who survived the experience suffered from the inability to thrive in either Indigenous or Western communities. This sparked an epidemic of intergenerational trauma that has lasted through the years.\n\n“I think the initiative will be a realization that people have generational trauma from the boarding schools,” said Dakota Sioux historian Jeanne Eder Rhodes. “We have to contend with violence, sexual abuse and other traumas.\n\n“Those kids weren’t taught to be businesspeople, entrepreneurs or doctors,” said Rhodes, the co-author of “American Indian Education: A History.”\n\nShe said even in the 21st century, Native students aren’t surrounded with Indigenous role models like astronauts, scientists and Native people in other professions, which she attributes to past educational failures.\n\nA campaign to destroy cultures\n\nThe National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition notes on its website that by 1925, more than 60,000 Indigenous children were placed in schools operated by the federal government and various churches. That accounted for nearly 83% of all Indian school-aged children, the organization said.\n\nAlthough reforms were enacted beginning in the early 1930s, many schools still failed to adequately educate their Indigenous charges.\n\nOne student recounted that she sought to come to Phoenix Indian School so she could become a teacher, said Talahongva, the visitor center curator. But the education the student received at the institution was so poor that she couldn't pass the test for admission to the Arizona Teachers' College, now known as Arizona State University.\n\n\"She hired on with a professor as the domestic help in his house, and in the evenings he would tutor her,\" said Talahongva. A year later, the girl passed the exam for the college.\n\n\"How do you graduate anywhere with honors and still not be able to pass a college entry exam?\" she asked.\n\nTalahongva, who was at Phoenix Indian School for two years, also encountered the Indian school's military-style discipline. \"We had to make our beds each day so that a quarter could be bounded off it,\" she said. \"If not, the inspector would rip the bedding, and sometimes the mattress, off the bed.\" Each time that occurred, the student received a demerit.\n\n\"I would come back from breakfast to get my books for class and find my bed torn apart,\" Talahongva said. \"I had to make it back up fast so I wouldn't get another demerit for being late.\"\n\nOne Indigenous nation official said that ripping children from their families to faraway schools was just one tactic in the government's campaign to destroy Native peoples' cultures and nations.\n\n“By ‘deculturing’ Indians, the government was denying their spirituality, which is the core of Indian identification,” said William Bradford, attorney general of the Chiricahua Apache Nation. The Chiricahua and Warm Springs bands were signatories to the 1852 Treaty of Santa Fe between the “Apache Nation of Indians” and the U.S.\n\nThe Chiricahuas scattered after the Apache Wars, hunted by army troops or rounded up and marched to concentration camps, he said. Thousands fled to Mexico, while others were banished as far away as Florida. Many Chiricahua children were transported to Carlisle and other remote boarding schools in an effort to destroy the band.\n\n“The U.S. considered Indian kids as not quite human,” said Bradford.\n\nHe thinks that the boarding school investigation will accomplish more than just its stated purpose.\n\n“Secretary Haaland is advancing the meaning of tribal sovereignty and asking questions that are very uncomfortable,” Bradford said.\n\nBradford hopes the boarding school inquiry will also spark larger questions, like why the U.S. employed such methods, what should happen next, and how the federal government can address the issue of lands that were stolen from Native peoples.\n\nInterior Department outlines plan of action\n\nThe first order of business for the government is to focus on the schools that are or were under Department of the Interior control, said Bryan Newland, principal deputy assistant secretary for Indian affairs at the Interior Department.\n\n“We’ll set about identifying the records and getting custody of those records from other federal agencies,” he said.\n\nNext on Newland’s agenda: identify known and possible sites and consult with tribes on how to protect and use what they find, particularly the records and names of children who attended the schools and who may have died in them. Newland’s task force will also identify and protect burial sites at boarding schools.\n\n“We’ll submit a report to the secretary by April 1 on what we know, what we don't know, the work that needs to be done to better understand the records that we have and lay out a path forward,” said Newland, an Ojibwe who is a citizen of the Bay Mills Indian Community in Michigan.\n\nFulfilling Haaland's directive will be a daunting task. The Boarding School Healing Coalition has identified 367 Indian boarding schools that operated in the U.S. between approximately 1870 and 1970.\n\nSome boarding schools, like Phoenix Indian School, closed their doors after 1970, and several are still open. The organization has located just 38% of the records from known schools. That means that the tally of Native children who attended, died or went missing from these schools is unknown. And that is what Newland is charged with learning as a first step.\n\nTalahongva said nobody has records of how many students attended Phoenix Indian School, which operated for 99 years until 1990. It was the only off-reservation school managed by the Interior Department in Arizona.\n\nCurrently, she said, the visitor center will share a document request form with former students or their relatives.\n\n“The feds won’t allow us total access to those records, because of privacy laws,” Talahongva said. But because the Phoenix school was the second-largest in the nation, she estimated that tens of thousands of students passed through the campus.\n\nMany children who attended Indian boarding schools came from tribes that were never federally recognized. Some belonged to tribes whose status was terminated by the federal government in the mid-20th century. Since current federal law restricts tribal consultation to currently-recognized tribes, consultation with these survivors and their descendants will be more complicated.\n\nAlthough Newland said working with people across Indian Country is filtered through the government-to-government relationship model, the boarding schools touched many Indigenous peoples’ lives. The Interior Department will have to consider how the boarding school investigation affects the BIA's federal recognition process and other regulations, he said.\n\n\"But our trust obligation extends to Indian people, those who came before, those who are here now and those who will come in the future,” Newland said. “This initiative is an opportunity for us to engage directly with Indian people about the legacy of the federal government's practices and how they shape the lives of people, regardless of whether or not they are enrolled in what is now a federally recognized tribe.“\n\nNewland also said his task force has a responsibility to boarding school survivors and their families to be aware of their well-being as they learn facts that he said could be gruesome.\n\n“We know we have a responsibility to not add to the harm that's already been done, so we are taking a thoughtful approach,” Newland said. “That might cause the initiative to go slower than some people would like. But doing it the right way is more important than doing it quickly.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2020/03/17/st-patricks-day-why-wear-green-who-was-he-more/5020436002/", "title": "St. Patrick's Day: Why we wear green, more questions answered", "text": "St. Patrick's Day in America may be seen as some as a pot of gold on the calendar – a chance to don green while swigging jade beer and searching for an ounce of Irish ancestry with the same tenacity as you would a four-leaf clover.\n\nBut as the experts tell it, the day that originated in America is a prideful one for Irish and Irish Americans, one where their heritage is celebrated.\n\nTo get the scoop on the holiday, we turned to Elizabeth Stack, executive director of Albany's Irish American Heritage Museum and Brian Witt, the cultural exhibits coordinator for Milwaukee Irish Fest.\n\nHere's how they answered questions that you may have:\n\nCoronavirus halts St. Patrick's Day parades in Boston, Dublin; heavy economic impact likely\n\nSt. Patrick's Day parades canceled, Coachella rescheduled amid coronavirus fears.

Details of the settlements, made over the past couple of months, were not disclosed.\n\nMeanwhile, a priest at the center of eight of the lawsuits allegedly admitted to having sexual encounters with about 50 boys, according to documents filed with the lawsuits in Superior Court in Morristown.\n\nThat priest, Timothy Brennan, is accused in three of the settled cases and five pending complaints. He was convicted 30 years ago of aggravated sexual contact with a 15-year-old Delbarton student.\n\nThe abuse outlined in the suits allegedly took place while most of the victims were students at Delbarton or St. Elizabeth of Hungary in Linden, which was managed by the order in an agreement with the Newark Archdiocese, according to an order spokesman.\n\nThe 11 lawsuits include accusations made by 10 men and one woman who said she was abused by Brennan while she was a student at St. Elizabeth's. Eight clerics who belonged to the order were accused of sexual assault or sexual abuse that allegedly took place from 1968 through 1984.\n\nAllegations in six of the 11 lawsuits were related to St. Elizabeth's. The Archdiocese of Newark was also named as a defendant in those cases. Spokesman Jim Goodness declined to comment on Thursday.\n\nOne of the accused is Luke Travers, a priest who was Delbarton's headmaster more than a decade ago. He was the subject of allegations filed in a civil complaint filed five years ago, accusations stemming from the late 1970s, long before he was headmaster.\n\nThe complaint was filed by twin brothers who lived on the grounds of the Delbarton School, where their father was a teacher. They announced the lawsuit on the lawn of the Morristown courthouse.\n\nOne of the brothers, Tom Crane, said at the time that he had been sexually abused by Travers and another priest, the Rev. Justin Capato. Bill Crane Jr., said he was abused by Capato.\n\nTheir complaints were later separated into two lawsuits and were settled on March 20, according to documents signed by Superior Court Judge David H. Ironson.\n\nTravers, who is no longer a member of the order, continues to deny the allegations, said his attorney, Gerard Hanlon.\n\nCapato was named in another suit, one of three complaints settled in May. The priest has denied the allegations, according to court documents. His attorney did not respond to a message left at his office Thursday.\n\nWhile living at Delbarton, the Crane brothers attended school at St. Joseph's in Mendham where they said they were abused by another priest — parish pastor James Hanley, who was defrocked after admitting he molested at least a dozen children.\n\nHanley has said Bill Crane Jr. was his last victim.\n\nTom Crane, who lives outside of Seattle, said in a telephone interview Thursday night that he went through \"a nightmare of intimidation\" after the complaint against St. Mary's was filed. He alleged that friends from Delbarton who spoke in support of the Cranes were told by a school attorney not to talk about the case.\n\n\"They told these guys to keep their mouths shut,\" he said, adding that the settlement was \"a big victory.\"\n\nGreg Gianforcaro, the attorney for all 11 plaintiffs in the St. Mary's Abbey cases, acknowledged the settlements and said his clients \"showed amazing courage for coming forward.\"\n\nHe declined to specify the amount of the settlements or discuss the pending cases. He had represented many of Hanley's victims in a lawsuit that the Paterson Diocese settled in 2005 for $5 million.\n\nSt. Mary's Abbey and the Delbarton School also acknowledged the settlements and issued a statement late Thursday afternoon saying its officials are \"committed to continue ensuring a safe, healthy, and respectful learning environment. We look forward to a resolution of these issues but are unable to comment on active litigation.”\n\nBrennan, who was sentenced to one year of probation in 1987, was a central figure in the lawsuits, and court records revealed that he once allegedly acknowledged having so many sexual encounters with boys that he was unsure of the number.\n\n\"He says that he has had sexual experiences with approximately 50 male minors,\" a clinical psychologist wrote in a letter following an evaluation of the priest at Saint Luke Institute, a Catholic mental health facility in Maryland. \"Father Brennan is uncertain if this number is accurate.\"\n\nThe letter, sent in 1995 to an official with the Trenton Diocese, where Brennan had been working after his conviction, went on to say the priest told evaluators that his encounters were with boys around the age of 13.\n\nBrennan had been hearing confessions of children, according the letter. The psychologist recommended that \"Father Brennan have no ministry with minors\" and \"hear no confessions of minors.\"\n\nAccording to the letter, Brennan said he was molested by a priest when he was 15 years old and began acting out sexually in the early to mid 1970s. The letter also said Brennan had worked for a time at an unnamed hospital in the Trenton Diocese. The diocese did not immediately respond to a request for information about Brennan and his time there.\n\nSt. Abbey's officials had acknowledged years ago that Brennan had been working at a parish in Lakewood where he cared for the elderly at a nursing home and a hospital.\n\nBrennan, who has been living at a treatment center for priests in Missouri for the past 15 years, did not reply to a message seeking comment.\n\nHe became a Benedictine priest in 1961 and had been a teacher and guidance counselor at Delbarton before he was removed from the school after being accused of sexual abuse in 1986.

And you look at yourself and you say, \"If I don't pay back, shame on me.\" I do hope that people continue to realize the value of giving back. If you've been blessed, you just really have to.\n\nWhat motivates her\n\nWhat really motivates my life is the saying, \"Christ has no hands but mine.\" I really do have to be the hands of Christ. My faith is critically important to me. We've only got so much time, so why not be motivated by the right things?\n\nSetting an example\n\nI want my granddaughters to see that volunteering is just as important as having a big, high-powered job that makes a lot of money. Also, I want them to see that women can make a difference in lots of different ways. I want these girls to grow up and realize, \"Your willingness to give and your talents are critically important.\"\n\nHer greatest accomplishment\n\nFor Christmas the last two years, instead of giving me a gift, my son has given a very generous gift to Be Concerned. If everybody would adopt that attitude, the world would be a much better place.\n\nBarbara Bushman\n\nBy Cindy Schroeder | cschroeder@enquirer.com\n\nWhen Barbara Bushman is working on a major gala or fundraising event, it's not unusual for the longtime volunteer to spend up to 35 hours a week helping one of the dozen or so Greater Cincinnati nonprofits she supports.\n\nThose who nominated Bushman to be an Enquirer Woman of the Year described her as a \"poster child for leadership\" because of her tireless civic activism. She's a team player who's willing to tackle any project or task, no matter how large or small. She never complains, nor does she seek recognition. When she sees a need, she simply fills it, Bushman's supporters say.\n\n\"If I didn't enjoy what I was doing, I wouldn't do it,\" Bushman said. \"I guess it's hard for me to say no.\"\n\nJust a few of the many beneficiaries of Bushman's talent and hard work include CET, the first licensed educational TV station in the U.S.; the World Choir Games; the Cincinnati Horticultural Society; the Cincinnati Chamber Orchestra; and Mt. Washington Presbyterian Church. She has served in leadership positions for Town Club, Cincinnati's Young Presidents Organization, and ReSource, an organization that enables nonprofits to purchase furniture and office supplies at a fraction of their cost.\n\nBushman can trace her start in civic involvement to 1976 when her family moved from West Chester to Anderson Township. She attended a neighbor's meeting for Kindervelt of Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. She not only met her neighbors, she soon found herself raising money to help sick children.\n\nFrom there, she progressed to leading her sons' PTA organizations in the Forest Hills Local School District and running Forest Hills' community education program as a volunteer for 12 years.\n\nBesides her many nonprofit endeavors, these days the Covington resident serves as a mentor to budding civic leaders. Among those for whom she has served as a role model are her 12-year-old twin granddaughters, Emma and Amy Bushman, who were inspired to create their own nonprofit organization, Bake Me Home, to help moms and kids at homeless shelters.\n\n\"Barbara has never once said to me, 'You should volunteer,' but her actions have modeled this to me in a thousand ways,\" her daughter-in-law, Alison Bushman, wrote in her letter of nomination.\n\n\"Every committee she has chaired, every envelope she had stuffed, has said, 'When you are able to help, you have a responsibility to help.' Her inherent mothering extended from her family to her city, and Cincinnati is a better place because of it.\"\n\nMORE ABOUT BARBARA\n\nBirthplace: Cincinnati\n\nCurrent residence: Covington\n\nFamily: Married to Jim Bushman; two children and four grandchildren\n\nEducation: Woodward High School in Cincinnati; associate's degree in science from the University of Cincinnati, 1964\n\nOccupation: Worked at Procter & Gamble doing executive secretarial work before leaving in the late 1970s to raise her family and volunteer\n\nWHAT SHE SAYS\n\nWhat's the best advice you've ever received?\n\nDon't just do something because somebody says, \"This is the way it needs to be done.\" You need to stand up for your own principles.\n\nWhat's your best advice for others?\n\nGet out there and volunteer early, and get young people involved. That will help them for the rest of their lives.\n\nWho are your greatest influences?\n\nMy husband, Jim, has done so much with his life. He put himself through college by working. He used to work 40 hours a week doing things like stocking grocery shelves at night, then go to school full time at UC during the day. He has his own company that our sons are running today.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about your civic involvements?\n\nI really enjoy seeing what the money that I've helped raise has accomplished. For example, some children may not go to preschool, but most families have a TV to bring CET's educational programming into their home. I just like to feel that I've done my part to make someone's life a little better.\n\nKaren K. Cassidy\n\nBy Brent Coleman | bcoleman@enquirer.com\n\nKaren Cassidy's eyes well up when she talks about meeting local soldiers at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center who have lost limbs fighting in Afghanistan.\n\n\"How can you not respect them?\" she asked. \"They're all incredible, and they all have incredible stories.\"\n\nGiving those stories a happy chapter is what motivates Cassidy in her volunteer work with USO Tribute Cincinnati, a fundraising organization she and a group consisting of Steve Lee, Nancy Blum, Craig Combest, Duane Hickerson and Dean Gregory launched 11 years ago.\n\nThe group has flown in and honored more than 40 American soldiers of local families, including one Medal of Honor recipient.\n\nUSO Tribute's events – last year it was dinner and a night with the Cincinnati Pops at Music Hall – have brought in close to $5 million to ensure that our nation's wounded warriors are supported and cared for properly.\n\nThe money supports USO Metro Washington at Walter Reed and Bethesda Medical Centers, which care for some of the most severely wounded soldiers.\n\nCassidy's concern for veterans is lifelong: Her grandfather fought in World War I, and her father and uncle in World War II.\n\nShe recalls the active support her father gave to soldiers returning from Vietnam who weren't given the hero treatment of his generation.\n\n\"He would say, 'If you don't agree with the war, at least you have to support them,'\" Cassidy said.\n\n\"As a 16- or 17-year-old, I remember the passion in my dad's voice, and it made a big impact on me.\n\n\"When the conflict started in Iraq, I just wanted to make sure (American soldiers) knew they were respected.\"\n\nShe said about 70 percent of her volunteer time goes to USO Tribute Cincinnati. Most of the rest she devotes to Cris Collinsworth ProScan Fund, which provides free mammograms and health support to women in underserved communities, particularly Over-the-Rhine.\n\nCassidy helps organize the annual Queen City Classic Chess Tournament for 300 public school children and has co-chaired Pro Scan's Pink Ribbon Luncheon several times.\n\nThe group's 12th luncheon last year at Duke Energy Convention Center drew 1,400, a number her peers in bigger cities have admired, she said.\n\n\"I think Cincinnati is one of the most giving and supporting communities,\" said the 18-year resident, who grew up in a Cleveland suburb.\n\n\"I'm most proud of the people I work with. They're the People of the Year.\"\n\nMORE ABOUT KAREN\n\nBirthplace: Lakewood, Ohio\n\nCurrent residence: Indian Hill\n\nFamily: Married to Jack Cassidy; three children\n\nEducation: Degree in nursing, Ohio State University\n\nOccupation: Former registered nurse, board member of Cris Collinsworth ProScan Fund\n\nWHAT SHE SAYS\n\nMost rewarding achievement\n\nOn the home front – being a mother and wife. As a volunteer – working with dedicated people and seeing the difference being made in the lives of others.\n\nCreative and energetic\n\nI truly enjoy working with others and seeing all the creative ideas and energy become something tangible.\n\nLatest project\n\nI continue to volunteer focusing on the needs of service members in our community. I'm working on the 2014 Pink Ribbon Luncheon via the Cris Collinsworth ProScan Foundation, and promoting brain health via the Lindner Center of Hope. I'm also working with Lighthouse Youth Services to support programs for teenagers in need of guidance.\n\nBest advice she ever received\n\nLove one another.\n\nRecipe for success\n\nSurround yourself with people who are smarter than yourself, who share the same passions. When dedicated, smart people work together they have fun and great things happen.\n\nJan Armstrong Cobb\n\nBy John Faherty | jfaherty@enquirer.com\n\nTikkun olam is a simple Hebrew phrase loaded with meaning. Literally, it says: \"World repair.\" For Jan Armstrong Cobb it apparently means to join every cause, to help whenever possible and to sleep only when nothing is left to do.\n\nFor work, Armstrong Cobb oversees management of 3.5 million square feet of office space and a 10-million-square-foot industrial portfolio for Duke Realty.\n\nTake a deep breath and read through a list of her philanthropic and civic efforts:\n\nChairwoman of the board of ReSource and past-chairwoman of JVS Career Services; board member of American Jewish Committee, Easter Seals Tri-State and Jewish Cemeteries of Greater Cincinnati; and member of the West Chester Township Zoning Resolution Review Committee.\n\nSo really, there are two questions for Armstrong Cobb: How and why?\n\n\"How\" is fairly easy: Armstrong Cobb is a tireless worker and says she also has an understanding husband and a nice boss.\n\n\"Why\" is a combination of faith and family: Armstrong Cobb says she is only continuing down a path first traveled by her mother and grandfather.\n\nShe grew up in Fort Wayne, Ind., and realized as a child she was born into a legacy of helping people. Her maternal grandfather, a tailor, helped sweatshop workers in Minneapolis at the turn of the century because they were being mistreated.\n\nHer mother, Neti Weintraub, helped quietly. \"She told me there was always a good cause worth supporting,\" Armstrong Cobb said. \"There was always a person who could use a little help.\"\n\nThis vision of the world, as a place that could be repaired, became part of Armstrong Cobb.\n\nOnce in Cincinnati, she first volunteered at ProKids, which advocates for abused and neglected children. Then she began working with United Way of Greater Cincinnati. This helped her realize she could raise a family, have a big job and still help her community.\n\n\"There is more to life than what you do between 8 and 5,\" she said.\n\nA center of Armstrong Cobb's life has been her synagogue, Adath Israel Congregation. In 2003, she became Adath Israel's first female president.\n\nArmstrong Cobb got involved with ReSource, which collects office goods from corporations and distributes them to nonprofit agencies, in part because it typifies the type of charity she has always believed in. It is practical and more important than people think.\n\nArmstrong Cobb is a mother, stepmother and now a grandmother.\n\nMaybe they will remember Armstrong Cobb's favorite quote from her mother, one that taught her that life is fleeting, but that good works can make a lasting difference: \"I shall pass this way but once. If I can do any good for a human being let me do it now, for I shall not pass this way again.\"\n\nMORE ABOUT JAN\n\nBirthplace: Washington, D.C.\n\nCurrent residence: West Chester\n\nFamily: Married to Barry Cobb; two children and a stepchild\n\nEducation: Bachelor's in psychology from Oberlin College; MBA from the University of Chicago\n\nOccupation: Vice president of asset management and customer service at Duke Realty\n\nWHAT SHE SAYS\n\nWhy inclusion is important\n\nI realize that in addition to \"helping people\" as I said so tritely, equal opportunity is a reason I get involved in so many things. I think, as a Jewish person, I realize that oppression of minorities is convenient for so many people and gets carried out in active and passive ways. Whatever I can do to create opportunities for more understanding of our differences is something I work for.\n\nHow Cincinnati became home\n\nIt was 1980. We wanted a good place to raise the kids, we wanted better weather (than Chicago), we wanted a good business community and we wanted to stay in the Midwest. Cincinnati is a decision that still makes sense today.\n\nOn the importance of family\n\nBeing a grandmother is my favorite job.\n\nApril D. Davidow\n\nBy Rachel Richardson | rrichardson@enquirer.com\n\nApril D. Davidow is the kind of volunteer every nonprofit organization dreams about.\n\nShe's energetic, well-organized and dedicated. A self-taught sculptor, Davidow's events are often remembered for their artsy flair – and the hundreds of thousands of dollars they raise for community projects.\n\nDavidow says she owes her successful track record to her late parents, Abrom and Sarah Dombar, a hardworking couple who often worked six days a week to make ends meet, but still encouraged their two children to make a difference in their community.\n\n\"I saw my mother write a check for an organization when I was younger and said, 'Mom, there are so many things we don't have. How can you give somebody else a check?' She said, 'There's always somebody who has less than we do,'\" Davidow remembered.\n\n\"That's the way we grew up.\"\n\nDavidow began volunteering in high school and never stopped. The Woodward High graduate served with the Jewish Federation and Hadassah, the benevolent Jewish women's organization, and as a \"cheerette\" at a local hospital.\n\nAs a young mother of two sons, Davidow devoted herself to the Organization for Rehabilitation through Training, which supports vocational opportunities for Jewish students, and served as Hadassah's president.\n\nAfter her divorce in the mid-1980s, she became president of the Jewish Hospital auxiliary, where she met now-husband Harry Davidow. The couple, who share a passion for philanthropy, have been married 23 years.\n\nWhen Harry's sister Lynn Stern asked the couple for help in launching a Wellness Community chapter in Cincinnati, Davidow sprung into action to help raise the necessary $250,000.\n\nFounded in 1982 in California, the national organization – which changed its name in 2009 to the Cancer Support Community – provides emotional support groups, healthy lifestyle classes and educational and relaxation workshops at no cost to cancer patients and their families.\n\nIn 2007, Davidow turned her fundraising expertise to planning the first Hats Off luncheon, an event organized by volunteers to support efforts to build Smale Riverfront Park. The event, now in its seventh year, has raised more than $700,000.\n\n\"Everybody knows when they turn to April, she will get the job done,\" Kim Thiboldeaux, president and CEO of the Cancer Support Community, wrote in her letter nominating Davidow to be an Enquirer Woman of the Year. \"She has a beautiful and unique ability to turn the ordinary into the extraordinary.\"\n\nMORE ABOUT APRIL\n\nBirthplace: North Avondale\n\nCurrent residence: Downtown\n\nFamily: Married to Harry; two children and three grandchildren\n\nEducation: B.A., education, University of Cincinnati\n\nOccupation: Philanthropist\n\nWHAT SHE SAYS\n\nWhy she does what she does\n\nI see that I've done good for other people. I've done good for the organization and the people, but I also got back in that I got these wonderful friendships. I've made my very best friends through volunteering. My girlfriends from my (high school) youth group live all over the world and we still see each other every year and email every week.\n\nSecret to her success\n\nI love starting something new that's never been done. And I know that if you start it, you chair it. One of my best qualities is being so organized. I write things down a lot. I'm never late. I budget my time and write a list for the day or the month and I make sure it gets done. I learned not to spread myself too thin on too many different things at one time. I either do it right, or I don't do it.\n\nThe legacy she hopes to leave\n\nYou're not born knowing to give of yourself and to give money. You have to be taught that. I've given a legacy to my sons, who both volunteer, and my grandchildren. It's a very good feeling.\n\nMary M. Gimpel\n\nBy John Johnston | jjohnston@enquirer.com\n\nThe word is out about Mary Gimpel's garage and the things it might contain, such as 10-foot-tall Corinthian columns or unusual table centerpieces.\n\nAt one time or another, people who throw elaborate fundraisers have asked to borrow such handmade decorations and other items.\n\n\"The joke is: What do you have in the garage that we can use?\" said Gimpel.\n\nIt's no joke that Gimpel is known not only as one of the top fundraisers in the area, but also as someone who creates her own extraordinary decorations for fundraising events, sometimes with an assist from her husband, Jack. She has put her skills to work many times while chairing events and volunteering her time on boards and committees.\n\n\"Mary's gift for transforming spaces into unimaginable beauty, benefiting fundraising efforts for a multitude of organizations, leaves patrons breathless,\" Kathy Wade and Joanie Lotts, both previously honored as Enquirer Women of the Year, co-wrote in their letter nominating Gimpel for the honor.\n\nA partial list of the organizations that have benefited from her work includes Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Babies Milk Fund, Caracole, Learning Through Art, Cincinnati Shakespeare Festival, Playhouse in the Park, the Cincinnati Art Museum and the Taft Museum of Art. The past six years, many of her efforts have been focused on Cincinnati May Festival and Ohio Citizens for the Arts.\n\n\"As a lifelong supporter of the arts in general and the May Festival in particular, Mary is a driving force in Cincinnati's arts scene,\" Steven Sunderman, the festival's executive director, wrote in his nominating letter. \"Equally comfortable on the front lines as well as behind the scenes, her tireless devotion to the arts has enabled countless thousands, indeed hundreds of thousands, to experience world-class culture right here in Cincinnati.\"\n\nGimpel said her work with Ohio Citizens for the Arts, a statewide advocacy organization, gives her perspective on how fortunate Cincinnati is. \"Not only do we have two major-league teams, but we have all the art forms represented here. People in other parts of Ohio are not that lucky,\" she said.\n\nCincinnati might not be so lucky if not for Gimpel's efforts to maintain a vibrant arts scene.\n\n\"It is hard to ask for money,\" she said. \"Of course, the easiest way is through throwing a party or an event that showcases one of the arts. That part of fundraising is fun.\"\n\nAnd sometimes, it all starts in her garage.\n\nMORE ABOUT MARY\n\nBirthplace: Celina, Ohio\n\nCurrent residence: Indian Hill\n\nFamily: Married to Jack Gimpel; two children and four grandchildren\n\nEducation: Bachelor's degree in English literature, Edgecliff College\n\nOccupation: Community volunteer\n\nWHAT SHE SAYS\n\nBest advice she ever received\n\nWe moved to Indianapolis (because of her husband's job) when we were first married. I knew no one. (Her husband's company) had a group for the wives and women employees. One of the women said to me, \"You have to get to know the community. Get out there, be curious, find an organization or a group you're interested in, and get really involved, and you'll get to know the fabric of the community.\"\n\nFavorite fundraiser she's organized\n\nI've loved all of them. I like the creative part of it. I even like the nuts and bolts of it. I haven't disliked anything, which can't be said for some things in life.\n\nMost challenging fundraiser\n\nThe Mason-Dixon Steeplechase (for Cincinnati Children's and St. Elizabeth Healthcare). Mercifully, I did not have to deal with the horses. It was all done in tents, outside. There were no cooking facilities, no water. It was very elegant, and you had to make it look good, taste good, and everybody have a good time.\n\nPeople would be surprisedto know\n\nWhen I was in junior high school, I was in a music program for piano, like a quiz program for kids.

Grady\n\nBy Krista Ramsey | kramsey@enquirer.com\n\nAsk Joellen Grady to reflect on her life and what comes into her mind are children's faces.\n\nThe little girl at the orphanage where Grady worked as director of development who was returned to the home where she had been sexually abused.\n\nThe boy at her church who was being sent to Cleveland because his father could no longer take care of him.\n\n\"He called at Christmas to say, 'I just want to come home,'\" she remembered.\n\nThe girl in foster care who lived with Grady's grandmother.\n\nWhen they took the girl to visit her own grandmother in the West End, Grady saw that the woman was blind and poor – and filled with love and tenderness for her granddaughter.\n\nGrady's career path has routed her through City Hall, where she served as chief administrative assistant to Mayor Ken Blackwell, through the Archdiocese of Cincinnati where the Presbyterian elder raised tens of thousands of dollars to save and stabilize seven inner-city Catholic schools, and, for the last 23 years, to serving as executive director of the Council of Christian Communions, where she galvanized local religious leaders around social causes.\n\nBut the secret to Grady's influence was that she never forgot the faces, names and stories of people in need she met along the way.\n\n\"What's so sad about our society is that we form opinions about people in certain situations and we don't know why they got there, and we don't know how they got there – we don't know anything about it at all,\" she said.\n\nThe drive to serve people largely forgotten by the world led Grady to champion a prison visitation program so children could see their parents during incarceration, and to expand a chaplaincy program to provide worship services for inmates in the Hamilton County Corrections Center.\n\nIn recent years, she's devoted herself to Whole Again, a faith-based program that provides meals, educational help and recreation during the summer to 1,800 city children at 26 church sites.\n\nThe Rev. Damon Lynch Jr. says Grady is a hard worker, good fundraiser and great organizer who helped bring the Billy Graham mission to Cincinnati following the city's race riots.\n\n\"We broke an attendance record for Paul Brown Stadium at that time,\" he said.\n\n\"Joellen did a great job. We brought together all kinds of people and, after that, she was on her way.\"\n\nMORE ABOUT JOELLEN\n\nBirthplace: Cincinnati\n\nCurrent residence: Amberley Village\n\nFamily: Married to August Grady; two children\n\nEducation: B.A., public relations, Union Institute\n\nOccupation: Executive director/CEO, Council of Christian Communions; executive director, Whole Again International\n\nWHAT SHE SAYS\n\nMost rewarding project\n\nA benefit dinner for the Catholic Inner-city Schools Education fund that brought so much money into the pot for those schools, and that meant, \"Let's keep them going.\" And they're still going!\n\nBest advice received\n\nMy father and mother used to say, \"Girl, you better think.\" That's all they'd say, and it made me consider if what I wanted to do was the right thing to do.\n\nBest advice for others\n\nI'd say be true to yourself and take care of one another. It's all about building and nurturing and not being self-serving.\n\nWhy I do what I do\n\nBecause I can't be still, and because children are the biggest resource in the world and we won't survive if we don't take care of them – and yet we often treat them like throwaways.\n\nMarlene R. Johnson\n\nBy Cliff Peale | cpeale@enquirer.com\n\nOrganizing the company she founded in 1995 with her second husband is only the most recent challenge for Marlene Johnson.\n\nBeyond the work of running a company, she has been a vigorous volunteer, working with groups including the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra Association, the May Festival, the Sister Cities Association, the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center and the Visiting Nurse Association, where she's planning a late-April event.\n\n\"It is obvious that Marlene is willing to roll up her sleeves, dig in and do whatever it takes to help many causes thrive,\" Trish Bryan wrote in a letter nominating Johnson as an Enquirer Woman of the Year.\n\n\"Her background is in nursing and I have always teased her about being a Florence Nightingale, coming in to help, lead and answer the call readily.\"\n\nShe has maintained the volunteer work while leading the Jamar International Corp., which is developing an alloying technology that was discovered in Ukraine.\n\nWhen husband James Johnson passed away three years ago, she found herself alone at the helm of the company. She reorganized it, searched for new experts, scanned reams of test results and tried to arrange the first stages of testing.\n\n\"It's something different every day,\" said Marlene Johnson, 77, of Pierce Township.\n\nDealing with challenges, both in business and in the nonprofit sector where she has been a contributor for decades, is a theme in Johnson's adult life spent in Greater Cincinnati.\n\nShe first moved here from her native Wisconsin in the 1950s when her first husband, Edward Rowat, started a residency at Good Samaritan Hospital.\n\nNow, working with the Visiting Nurse Association, she has enjoyed getting back into the health care arena, where she once worked as a nurse.\n\nShe's thinking of more civil rights work, in which James Johnson was prominent for years.\n\nMORE ABOUT MARLENE\n\nBirthplace: Tomah, Wis.\n\nCurrent residence: Pierce Township\n\nFamily: Two children and two grandchildren\n\nEducation: Three-year nursing program, completed at Deaconess Hospital\n\nOccupation: President, Jamar International\n\nWHAT SHE SAYS\n\nHow she moved to Cincinnati and became involved with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra\n\nMy husband was from Austria. When we got engaged, he said, \"Marlene, we're moving to Cincinnati.\" Basically, that was how we became involved in music. Music was a very important part of my life, even as a child.\n\nWhat she likes best about Cincinnati\n\nCincinnati offers so many opportunities. It's a very comfortable city to live in, but you can be as active as you like. I love meeting all the people. I enjoy meeting people from all walks of life. It doesn't matter what their vocation is or where they came from.\n\nWhat it was like reorganizing the business when her husband passed away\n\nIt was a challenge. Just getting the scientific information together and hooking up with people who could assist me. But I never shy away from work. I never shy away from challenges. I'm not a worrywart. I just deal with challenges as they come.\n\nWhat's a typical day like?\n\nI put in a full day. I'm usually working until about 5 o'clock. I lead a very well-rounded life. Every day is something different. I don't dwell on the challenges. You simply tackle it and cope with it and move on your way.\n\nWhat's next for her?\n\nI'll have to continue with the business. I was just thinking of trying to get into a little more one-on-one activity, whether it's Women Helping Women, or something with children or with aging. I would like to be a little more hands-on.\n\nJane Portman\n\nBy James Pilcher | jpilcher@enquirer.com\n\nJane Portman may not be as well known to the public as her husband, Rob Portman, the U.S. senator. But to those in Cincinnati's volunteer community, and especially at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Jane Portman is known as the \"one who shows up.\"\n\nAnd by that, Children's chief executive officer Michael Fisher means that Portman is ready to go to work as a key member of the hospital's board of directors.\n\n\"She shows up figuratively and literally ... when she's there she is incredibly engaged,\" Fisher said. \"Jane's commitment of her personal time and dedication is extraordinary.\"\n\nPortman chairs Children's governance/nominating and patient care committees, and serves on the board's executive committee.\n\nShe also has served on the board at Beech Acres, and tutors students at Cincinnati Public Schools, going so far as unofficially \"adopting\" two Vietnamese girls and helping them through the district's Academy of World Languages.\n\nHer eyes light up when she recounts taking the girls, Minh Ahn Nguyen and Truc Nguyen (unrelated), out for lunches and to the movies, as well as working with them on their studies.\n\n\"I love kids, love being around kids, and that is where I wanted to focus my time,\" Portman said.\n\n\"That's also a major reason for getting involved at Children's.\"\n\nPortman sees her involvement as just an extension of her life, saying that was the way she was raised.\n\nIn fact, she says that when she was called about being involved with the Women of the Year award, she thought she was initially being asked to endorse someone else.\n\n\"Let's just say I was very surprised that it was about me,\" she said. \"I am really touched by even being considered for this, and it is an incredible honor to be included in such a distinguished sisterhood.\"\n\nPortman's background is originally in marketing, and she has held positions at The Greater Cincinnati Foundation as well as at the Eureka Ranch, the Newtown-based innovation consultancy started by Procter & Gamble veteran Doug Hall. He calls Portman \"a truly remarkable woman, who unselfishly gives of herself to so many.\"\n\nPortman says it isn't always easy juggling her volunteerism with her life as a mother of three, as well as the wife of a very well-known political figure.\n\n\"But I've just ended up where I've ended up and I'm happy to do it,\" she said. \"We get out of something what we put into it and I'm incredibly grateful for the opportunities I've had.\"\n\nMORE ABOUT JANE\n\nBirthplace: Sheppard Air Force Base, Wichita Falls, Texas\n\nCurrent residence: Terrace Park\n\nFamily: Married to U.S. Sen.

My parents were very involved in the community, and I saw them get involved with the Salvation Army, the Junior League, the Symphony Guild. In fact, my dad is still very involved in the Institute for the Blind. And then coming to Cincinnati, there is such a culture of volunteerism and such a strong sense of community where people want to contribute and want to give.\n\nWhat she thinks about Cincinnati Children's\n\nWhen I talk about Children's, I always tell people and my friends that I think of it as a place that is all about hearts, smarts and dedication. It's such a tremendous resource. There are just so many people who are really smart and are completely devoted to helping take care of kids.\n\nHow has she passed on her volunteer spirit\n\nIn our own family ... we've all been supportive of each other, with Rob and his public service, and our kids have volunteered at Stepping Stones (a program helping the disabled lead independent lives), or organized coat drives or done tutoring on their own. It is important to give when you can.\n\nSister Bonnie Steinlage, SFP\n\nBy John Kiesewetter | jkiesewetter@enquirer.com\n\nSister Bonnie Steinlage's ministry is as simple as Matthew's Gospel passage that inspired it: \"When you fast and pray, wash your face and comb your hair.\"\n\nShe's given more than 38,000 haircuts to the homeless in 25 years of her Franciscan Haircuts From The Heart program. It also has provided more than 10,000 free haircuts to children and adults at area barber shops, salons and schools since 1998.\n\n\"I took the literal translation, which was: Go to the beauty shop and get a perm,\" says Sister Bonnie, who celebrates her 50th anniversary with the Franciscan Sisters of the Poor this year. She was a nurse and chaplain at old Providence Hospital for 25 years before attending cosmetology school.\n\nFor $2 – or a plastic grocery bag filled with smashed aluminum cans – she gives the homeless more than just a wash and cut at St. John Social Services, 1800 Logan St., Over-the-Rhine. Her healing touch restores their self-esteem and gives them confidence to improve their lives and possibly find a job.\n\n\"As a Franciscan Sister of the Poor, our ministry is to care for our brothers and sisters who are less fortunate,\" Sister Bonnie said. \"With these hands, and a comb and shears, they are transformed in their appearance. People tell me they feel human again.\"\n\nKevin Staigl was a homeless alcoholic for six months when he sat in Sister Bonnie's salon chair in 2005. \"It changed my life. It made me feel like, 'Now I can do something.' I wasn't embarrassed any more,\" said Staigl, who operates KMS Plumbing from his Colerain Township home.\n\nFor the first seven years, Sister Bonnie cut hair at Mary Magdalen House, the Over-the-Rhine shower facility for the homeless.\n\nShe split her time in the 1990s between a small OTR shop and her Pearly Gates salon in downtown Hamilton.\n\nSince 2009, she's cut hair with a few volunteers Monday-Thursday in the center near Findlay Market. On Fridays, she cuts hair at the Franciscan Sisters of the Poor convent in Hartwell and makes house calls.\n\n\"You think of a nun as pious, holy and serious. But she's so humorous, it's very disarming, and puts her clients at ease,\" says Estelle McNair, executive director for the program, which operates on a $100,000 annual budget.\n\nFriends credit the sheer power of her personality to her being able to establish and spread the program.\n\n\"For many, their first meeting with Sister Bonnie is the first time they have had the comfort of human touch,\" said Deborah Dutton-Lambert of Mount Healthy.\n\n\"People come to that salon, and their lives are changed by the simple act of getting a haircut. She is an architect of change.\"\n\nMORE ABOUT SISTER BONNIE\n\nBirthplace: St. Henry, Ohio\n\nCurrent residence: Mount Airy\n\nFamily: Four sisters, one brother\n\nEducation: St. Henry High School; St. Francis School of Practical Nursing; International Academy of Hair Design\n\nOccupation: Member of the Franciscan Sisters of the Poor since 1964; founder and manager/cosmetologist at Franciscan Haircuts From The Heart (haircutsfromtheheart.org)\n\nWHAT SHE SAYS\n\nMost rewarding achievement\n\nWhen people tell me they feel human again, that really touches me. If you'd see them before (a haircut), and see them when I'm finished, it's a humbling experience.\n\nHer motivation\n\nAs a Franciscan Sister of the Poor, our ministry is to care for our brothers and sisters who are less fortunate and give them a hand up, so they can improve their position in life. It's a healing ministry, because they are healed from the inside out with the kindness and love of God. I think receiving a haircut is one of the most powerful healing experiences.\n\nBest advice she ever received\n\nShe quotes \"The Hiding Place\" by author Corrie ten Boom, a Christian member of the Dutch underground during World War II whose family helped save 800 Jews: \"Every experience God gives us, every person he puts in our lives, is the perfect preparation for the future that only he can see.\"\n\n2014 LUNCHEON\n\nThe Enquirer Women of the Year will be honored at a luncheon at noon April 23 at the Hyatt Regency, Downtown Cincinnati.\n\nReservations are required; contact Mary Donaldson, 513-768-8112, mdonaldson@enquirer.com, or visit www.cincinnati.com/woy.

The investigation included six dioceses in the state - Allentown, Erie, Greensburg, Harrisburg, Pittsburgh and Scranton.\n\nBelow are the names listed in the grand jury report, along with where clergy members served and details of allegations.\n\nDiocese of Allentown\n\nThomas J.

Cofenas wrote: \"Yes, I have failed again, but my problem is not so totally out of hand that I cannot with God's help and Dr. Zanni, work to master my situation. Incidentally, prior to now, I had experienced no failure in this matter since 1978.\"\n\nCofenas went on to write: \"I am deeply sorry for letting you down again. You can imagine how hard it is for me to write this letter-especially when you trusted me and released me to the Mount.\" Before ending the letter, Cofenas wrote, \"I know you want to protect me and I appreciate your concern for me, but I ask you to consider the possibility of my staying at the Mount.\"\n\nFrancis J.

On June 12, 2016, the victims testified under oath before the grand jury that they were sexually abused by Fromholzer in 1965 when they were approximately 13 or 14 years old.\n\nOne victim was a female, now 68 years old. She recalled that, during a trip to the Poconos in 1964, Fromholzer took her and at least one other girl for a ride in his car. The trip was unsupervised and Julianne' s family was comfortable with the trip since Fromholzer was a trusted priest.

Because Royer was under the authority of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia at the time of the sexual abuse, the Diocese referred this victim to Monsignor William Lynn, Vicar for Clergy of the Archdiocese.\n\nThe Diocese of Allentown began paying for counseling then referred the costs to the Archdiocese of Philadelphia in June 2003.He was a fatherless, 12 -year -old boy.

Royer would abuse the child behind the airport in Allentown, in his home, and in the rectory.The child told a friend who did not believe him. During one abuse, the friend hid in the closet and watched Royer molest the victim.

In 1980, three separate complaints were made against him. The complaints asserted that Soderlund had engaged in sexual acts with three different children. The children were aged 12 to 13 years old. The Diocesan record, a \"summary of case\" relating to Soderlund, generalized the sexual conduct without referencing specific acts or crimes.\n\nOn June 11, 1980, a meeting was held at the Chancery during which photo albums were examined depicting nude photographs of a young boy engaged in sex acts with Soderlund. Soderlund admitted to Chancery officials that he engaged in sexual activity with the three young boys. While documents created at the time of the admission minimized the conduct, the facts became available through a detailed account of the abuse obtained from a victim in 1997 by the Diocese. The victim reported that: he was not a willing participant, but Soderlund threatened to harm or kill him.\n\nSoderlund also took pictures of the victim engaged in sexual acts and threatened to use them to embarrass him. Soderlund offered to leave the priesthood if the victim would go away with him. The victim then indicated that he knew of many other boys who were victimized by Soderlund.\n\nIn 2009, Soderlund, now living in Dubois, Wyoming, within the Diocese of Cheyenne was arrested, convicted, and sentenced to incarceration for two to five years for sexual exploitation of children and possession of child pornography on his computer.

On April 29, 2004, Yarrosh was removed from priestly ministry and entered St. John Vianney Hospital for evaluation and treatment. 2004, the Pennsylvania State Police filed charges against Yarrosh, specifically, 110 counts of sexual abuse of children after discovering hundreds of child pornography photos, books, magazines, videos, and DVD's in his possession. As law enforcement began its prosecution, Diocesan Support Services conducted an audit and determined that Yarrosh embezzled approximately $23,000.00 from the parish.\n\nCharges were filed related to this theft. On April 27, 2005, Yarrosh entered a plea of guilty to charges of theft and possession of child pornography. Yarrosh was sentenced pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement to imprisonment for three to 23 months, $250.00 in fines, and restitution to the parish.\n\nOn July 21, 2005, Yarrosh left St. Francis Villa and moved into a motel. Yarrosh continued in residence at the motel until August 8, 2005, at which time he was incarcerated in Schuylkill County Prison in Pottsville. Upon his release on November 31, 2005,\n\nYarrosh registered with the Pennsylvania State Police as a sexual offender. Upon his release from prison, Yarrosh was still a priest. On December 6, 2005, Yarrosh was released from prison as a convicted and registered sex offender. The Diocese granted him residence at St. Francis Villa in Orwigsburg. The Diocese's own designation of Yarrosh noted he was a \"moderate to high risk to again use pornography and/or consort with prostitutes.\"\n\nIn November 2006, it was discovered that Father Yarrosh had taken trips to New York City with a seven-year-old child. Yarrosh was also found to be in possession of pornography in violation of his court supervision. The Schuylkill County Court of Common Pleas subsequently sentenced Yarrosh to four to ten years in state prison for violating the terms of his supervision.\n\nFinally, in June 2007, the Diocese dismissed Yarrosh from the priesthood.\n\nJoseph A.

While in the ninth grade, the victim met Father Joseph A. Zmijewski. She was in a new school and was experiencing unhappiness. The victim began regular counseling sessions with Zmijewski.\n\nZmijewski proposed a course of alternative treatment. He directed the victim to come to his personal residence where he could help the victim through hypnosis. The victim complied and attended four hypnosis sessions with Zmijewski at his residence. After the first three attempts were unsuccessful by Zmijewski to hypnotize her, she agreed to a fourth session. In an effort to expedite her \"treatment,\" she faked hypnosis during her fourth session. While she pretended to be hypnotized, Zmijewski instructed her to take off one piece of clothing after another. The victim was scared and complied until she was nude. Zmijewski then left the room for a short period of time and upon his return, he instructed the victim to get dressed. The victim never returned for any further \"treatment\" and kept the incident to herself into adulthood.\n\nDavid Connell, Timothy Johnson, and Jim Gross\n\nNo further details of their employment history were listed.\n\nSummary: David Connell and Timothy Johnson were Carmelite priests and Jim Gross was a lay person. in September 2007, a known victim reported he had been sexually abused by Gross, a basketball coach at St. Patrick's in Pottsville. He reported that the abuse began in the 1970's while he was in sixth grade. In the summer of 1984, Gross resigned from teaching at St. Francis School in Minersville, Schuylkill County.\n\nIn the narrative of his last evaluation from June 1984, the victim also reported that he was sexually abused by a Carmelite priest named Father David Connell and physically abused by a Carmelite brother named Timothy Johnson while attending Nativity High School. The abuse was reported to the Provincial of the Carmelites, Father Michael Kissane, in October 2007. The victim stated that his family's house had burned down and the Carmelites took him and his brother in and had them live in a priory. During the time he was living in the priory, the victim was sexually abused by Connell. The victim remembered drinking juice that Connell gave him and the next memory the victim had was waking up in his own bed naked, with Connell in the room. The victim had no memory of the prior evening but, on waking, he was bleeding from his rectum.\n\nThe victim told Johnson he was going to also report the abuse to the police. Johnson told the victim not to report the abuse to the police but the victim insisted on reporting. At this point Johnson began to severely beat the victim with a big leather belt and told the victim that, if he reported the abuse to the police, he would beat him even worse.\n\nMichael S.

The victim told his father that he ha been in Lawrence's room for a tutoring session. At the end of the session, the talk between Lawrence and the victim turned to sex.

Father John Fischer testified that he walked in on Barletta and a young high school student in private chambers, and that the student was naked from the waist down, trying to pull up his underwear and pants as Barletta watched. Fischer recalled that Monsignor Hastings dismissed the report, and that fellow priests laughed it off.\n\nLater on, Bishop Trautman recorded details of a conversation that he had with Sister Donna Markham about Barletta. Trautman wrote that Barletta abused 5 children. Barletta was confronted with allegations of oral sex, naked messages, digital anal penetration and masturbation against a victim in 1994. When confronted, Barletta admitted his guilt to Trautman. The diocese paid for the victim’s counseling, but once the victim shared the story of abuse with a newspaper, Trautman advised that the victim should seek payment directly from Barletta.\n\nFrom 1975 though 1994 when he was dismissed from Erie Cathedral Prep, Barletta admitted abusing 25 children and young men. After 1994, there are documents that proved Barletta was still allowed to minister in the Diocese of Erie.\n\nDonald C. Bolton\n\n1952 -1954: Mt.

Her abuse began when she was 7 and continued until she was 11. Bolton came to her house to console the family over the death of a grandparent. The victim said held her on his lap and rubbed her back, legs, bottom and rear. Other instances of assault occurred when the victim was in confession, at ski resort and at a cottage in New York. At different times, Bolton fondled her, rubbed his penis against her and put his fingers in her vagina.\n\nIn another file, a mother of five children alleged that Bolton may have sexually assaulted four of them.

The grand jury has found documents that the Diocese of Hawaii and possibly the Diocese of Erie knew Father Hannon had admittedly abused at least twenty youths between ages 12 and 19.\n\nOf the eight victims acknowledged by the Diocese of Erie, one is categorized as \"claim denied, not verified\" based upon a denial by Hannon. This victim was abused in Hawaii and occurred when Hannon was visiting the victim’s parents. While tucking her into bed, he allegedly fondled her under her underpants.\n\nWhen the victim was interviewed in 2004, the Diocese of Hawaii found her “extremely credible.” But the Diocese of Erie sided with Hannan, as he had previously admitted to abusing only boys. Hannon denied abusing females stating, “they do not have a penis.”\n\nThere are eight known victims within the Diocese of Erie. It is unknown if the Diocese ever informed law enforcement officials about Hannon's conduct.\n\nJames P.

Bishop Trautman detailed that the victim was a junior at Mercyhurst Preparatory when she was targeted by Hudock. This sexual abuse occurred in several different locations within the victim's parish community. Trautman documented that Hudock and the victim had engaged in kissing prior to a trip to Wasington, D.C. Records revealed that Hudock groped and kissed the victim on numerous occasions, and it was reported he showed he pornography.\n\nIn 2008, the victim was having a difficult time dealing with the psychological issues from being victimized by Hudock. The Diocese agreed to pay for her medical bills and provided her with airfare to be seen at St. Luke's Institute in Suitland, Maryland.\n\nHudock' s current employment status is not known, but he operates his own religious website titled, \"Faith Meets World\" and has written religious books for Liturgical Press under his given name, as well as the pen name \"Barry Michaels.\"\n\nJoseph W.

He was placed back into ministry at St. John the Evangelist.\n\nIn 1991, Jerge had a meeting with several members of the clergy where concern was voiced about him violating his post-care contract. Bishop Trautman re -assigned Jerge to St. Francis Xavier parish.\n\nOne victim is well-documented by the ministry. He was a high school sophomore when Jerge took him on trips along and fondled him on multiple occasions. Later in the victim’s life, he was blackballed from employment and blocked from attempts to be admitted to seminary. The grand jury found documentation that Bishop Trautman personally instructed school administrators not to hire the victim, noting that he might be homosexual and might have attempted suicide. It is also noted that the Diocese paid at least $1,200 of the victim’s counseling fees.\n\nAnother victim stated that he was sexually abused by Jerge between approximately 1981 and 1985. He stated that all of the assaults took place in Jerge’s car. The victim made his history of abuse known to Trautman in 2003 and obtained an attorney.

He was also an altar server during early mass with Lorei. On one occasion, Lorei invited him into the rectory and into his bedroom. Lorei had the victim sit on the bed while Lorei sat next to him and hugged and kissed him on the lips. This would occur several days in a row, stop, and then begin again. The victim eventually refused to serve mass with Lorei.\n\nLorei was soon removed by then -Bishop Murphy. In his own handwritten words, Trautman expressed the personal belief that Lorei' s sudden departure may likely have been indicative of some kind of significant event. Trautman offered the victim counseling services. Financial assistance was also discussed. In a memorandum dated March 30, 2007, Hoffman also documented an additional victim of Lorei. Hoffman found out through the father of the second victim that his son was allegedly abused by Lorei. The victim reportedly described the incident during a United Methodist retreat in 2000.\n\nA small note in the file states \"Review Board found no merit in processing since supposed victim did not come forth even after requests.\"\n\nIt is unknown who the request refers to.\n\nSalvatore P. Luzzi\n\nWhere he served:\n\n6/09/1962 - 8/29/1968: Faculty, Venango Christian High. Residence at St. Joseph, Oil City, PA\n\n8/28/1968 - 8/28/1969: Sp.

Luzzi was moved to St. Mark's Seminary, where he filled several roles. Over the course of his 30 year ministry, he was accused of sexual misconduct by eight male victims ranging in age from early teens to early twenties. Some of these victims were groped, inappropriately kissed, hugged, and/or fondled. He also faced allegations of responsibility for the suicide of a former student/victim.\n\nLuzzi worked extensively with young would-be priests at St. Mark's where he and fellow priest Leon Muroski served as Spiritual Directors to the seminarians. Luzzi's inappropriate touching and fondling of at least two seminarians prompted the Diocese to settle with those seminarians for large sums of money. The first former Seminarian's case was settled in civil court for $34,500 and this individual received several thousand dollars over the course of the many years that the Diocese paid for his counseling and medication costs.\n\nSeveral other former juvenile victims of Luzzi received letters or phone calls of apology from the Diocese. These victims were counseled by the Diocese through correspondence or in person interviews wherein Luzzi's behavior was dismissed as \"Sal's way of expressing himself and his \"touching approach\" to ministry was attributed to his Italian upbringing.\n\nIn 1994, Bishop Trautman sent both Luzzi and Muroski to St. Luke's Institute for therapy. The Diocese publicly announced that Luzzi was going on an extended sabbatical for \"personal, spiritual and academic growth.\" Once Luzzi was discharged, the Bishop welcomed him back into pastoral ministry by letter on February 14, 1995. However, the welcome also came with several conditions and a Penial Precept, a formal notification in the church that restricts ministry.\n\nTrautman directed Luzzi to refrain from all contact with youth under 19 years of age and to avoid travel and social interaction with such parishioners. Later that same year, in September 1995, Trautman had Luzzi' s faculties as a priest removed and Luzzi began residing in a private residence, where he remains today.\n\nRicahrd D. Lynch\n\nWhere he served:\n\n6/01/1963 - 5/26/1972: Secondary Education Bradford Central Christian High School, Bradford, PA\n\n5/26/1972 - 2/18/1983: Headmaster, Secondary Education Bradford Central Christian High School, Bradford, PA\n\n2/18/1983 - 8/30/1999: Pastor, Erie Holy Rosary, Erie, PA\n\n1984-1994:Dean, East Erie Deanery, Erie, PA\n\n8/31/1999 - Death: Pastor, St. Mark's the Evangelist, Erie, PA\n\nSummary: The victim claims Lynch slammed him into the wall and this resulted in a trauma to his head.\n\nIn a letter dated June 3, 2016, the victim stated that he wanted to write the Bishop to get some things off his chest. He alleged that Father Richard Lynch was responsible for the sexual abuse that he went through while attending Bradford Central Catholic Christian High School 1978-1979. He said he told Bishop Trautman about some physical abuse, but was too ashamed to talk about the sexual abuse.\n\nDaniel Martin\n\nWhere he served:\n\n1943 - 1945: Parochial Vicar, Sacred Heart, Sharon, PA\n\n1945 - 1962: Faculty, Erie Cathedral Preparatory High School, Erie, PA\n\n1948 - 1962: Assistant Headmaster, Erie Cathedral Preparatory, Erie, PA\n\n1950-1962: Chaplain, Mercyhurst College\n\n1962-1970: Pastor, St. Boniface, Kersey, PA\n\n1962-1970: Headmaster, Elk Co.

Calvary, Erie, PA\n\n1987: Chaplain, Mercyhurst College for Religious women\n\n2003: Blessed Sacrament, Residence\n\nSummary: Monsignor Daniel Martin was a priest the in the Diocese of Erie for 43 -three years who faced two known allegations of sexual abuse. The grand jury's review of his files found very little documented evidence of his abuse of a teenager who was an alter server in his parish. That victim would go on to become a priest himself and appeared in front of the grand jury to tell his story.\n\nHe reported that when he was upset over the troubles of his life, he would seek Martin's counsel. He testified that Martin sexually fondled him on at least sixteen occasions between the ages of sixteen and nineteen.\n\nOther victims came forward with similar encounters.\n\nRedacted – pending litigation\n\nThe name of the priest, where he served and the exact incident was entirely redacted in the grand jury report.\n\nLeon T. Muroski\n\nWhere he served:\n\n6/11/1960 - 9/01/1967: Parochial Vicar, St. Luke, Erie, PA\n\n3/30/1961 - N/A: Chaplain, Erie County T.B.

This ministry lasted from 1982 until1995, but was abruptly halted when in the early 1990s Muroski was accused of sexual misconduct while he was a Spiritual Director at the seminary. Muroski was sent to St. Luke's Institute in Suitland, Maryland, for individual psychotherapy in 1994 after he admitted to inappropriate contact with the seminarians under his watch. These seminarians were all male, eighteen to twenty-three-year olds, when Muroski would counsel them. This counselling included allegations of full body massages, kissing, masturbation and fondling of the seminarians' buttocks and genitals. Muroski would eventually be placed back into ministry after therapy at St. Luke's and served in the Diocese of Erie and in The Christophers program in New York City.\n\nIn 2001, Muroski returned to the Diocese of Erie from The Christophers and was retired. Muroski was permitted to move into the retired priest home in 2002, which is where he still resides. In 2016, the Diocese rostered a list of all the retired clergy living in the home and made it public. Muroski was not listed as a resident. It was at this residence that the grand jury found him living in 2017, however.\n\nEdmundus Murphy\n\nNo further details regarding where he served were provided.\n\nSummary: On December 21, 2007 an e-mail communication was sent to Monsignor Robert Smith, Vicar General of the Diocese of Erie from the Society of the Divine Word in Techny, Ilinois. The purpose of the e-mail was to inform Smith that a victim was sexually abused by a staff member while he was a minor at Sacred Heart High School in 1964. This school was operated by the Society of the Divine Word Missionaries in Girard.\n\nThe victim claimed that during the summer between his freshman and sophomore years of high school, Brother Edmundus Murphy, who was 33 years of age at this time, was the wrestling coach at the school. Murphy encouraged the victim to join the team and, under the pretense of teaching him some wrestling moves, the two wrestled naked \"as the ancient Greeks and Romans did.\" The victim alleged that during these \"wrestling\" sessions he was sodomized by Murphy.\n\nImmediately after the incident, the victim asked Murphy what he was doing and, according to the victim, Murphy sat on the floor and began to cry.\n\nThe grand jury investigation found no documentation that the Diocese notified local law enforcement or the District Attorney's Office about Murphy's behavior. The only note in the file was a handwritten notation on top of the printed out e-mail which read; \"not responsible-Priest/Deacon only.\"\n\nJohn L.

Kay Ivey said Wednesday that a proposed Mobile Bay toll bridge is “dead” after Baldwin County officials took a decisive stand against the controversial proposal to build one of the nation’s largest bridges. The Eastern Shore Metropolitan Planning Organization voted 8-1 on Wednesday night to remove the bridge from the area’s transportation plan. The project must be in the plan detailing the region’s transportation priorities to qualify for federal funding. The planning group’s decision came after a four-hour meeting in which some residents in Baldwin County expressed outrage over the tolls that could cost up to $6 each way. They described how the cost would make it a struggle to travel to jobs or care for aging relatives on the opposite side of the bay. The crowd applauded after the vote, according to video streamed by news outlets. The proposed Interstate 10 bridge across the Mobile River and Mobile Bay would have spanned about 10 miles and soared hundreds of feet above the water near downtown. State officials had said the tolls were needed to finance the proposed $2.1 billion bridge.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A state regulatory agency has proposed changes that would limit activities at city breweries and distilleries. The Juneau Empire reported Tuesday that the Alaska Alcoholic Beverage Control Board has proposed changes to a state statute that would further prohibit onsite activities at alcohol manufacturing businesses. Officials said the regulation includes prohibiting breweries and distilleries from allowing festivals, games and competitions, classes, public parties, presentations or performances and other social gatherings advertised to the general public. Officials said a regulation draft was discussed in June 2018, and the change being considered is a revised proposal. Some owners oppose the changes saying it prohibits them from creating a new social space for the community. Officials said the plan is open to public comment through Oct. 4.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:Severe weather roared back into the Phoenix area Wednesday night, bringing heavy rain to some areas, mostly on the Valley’s east side, along with wind, dust and lightning, which apparently triggered numerous tree fires. As of 9:30 p.m., the Phoenix Fire Department’s fire dispatch board showed more than 20 tree fire calls, most of them in the north or east Phoenix and Scottsdale, as storms converged into that area. In addition, at least three house fires in Phoenix were caused by lightning strikes. The National Weather Service said on Twitter that some of the storms were moving west and expected to converge over central or northern Phoenix as the night progresses. The storms began building late afternoon in areas of Gila County as they moved west through northwest Pinal County toward Maricopa County. Outflows from the storms began pushing their way into the far southeast Valley. The storms arrive amid one of the drier monsoon seasons in the Phoenix area in recent years. As of Wednesday, just .27 of an inch of rain had officially been recorded at Sky Harbor International Airport.\n\nArkansas\n\nHelena-West Helena: Authorities said a nearly seven-hour standoff at a home ended when state troopers shot and killed an armed man suspected of killing two women who were found dead in the front yard earlier that day. The State Police identified the man killed Tuesday night as 37-year-old Raymond Lewis Williams Jr. and the slain women as 40-year-old Christine Fulmer and 28-year-old Deanna Thomas Banks. Police said the women were found dead Tuesday in the front yard of Williams’ home in Helena-West Helena, about 100 miles east of Little Rock. The city’s police chief, James Patrick Smith, told Memphis, Tennessee, television station WMC that investigators believe Williams shot them before barricading himself inside. State Police said troopers tried to communicate with Williams for hours before they used tear gas in the home. They say Williams emerged from the home with a rifle and a shootout ensued, resulting in Williams’ death.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Coast Guard officials said they have seized $38.5 million worth of cocaine from suspected drug smugglers in the eastern Pacific Ocean. The crew of the Coast Guard Cutter Robert Ward and another cutter recovered more than 2,800 pounds of pure, uncut cocaine in their latest busts. The Robert Ward returned to the Port of Los Angeles on Thursday after 50 days patrolling the coast off Central and South America. Authorities believe cartels have been smuggling the narcotics and said seizing the cocaine will save lives because the drugs won’t reach the streets.\n\nColorado\n\nBoulder: City officials are moving forward with plans to ban the sale of flavored electronic cigarette products containing nicotine. The Daily Camera reported the City Council on Wednesday also completed plans to raise the minimum purchasing age to 21 for tobacco and nicotine products. Only tobacco-flavored vaping products will be allowed under the new rules. The city will also ask voters on the November ballot to approve a 40% sales tax on e-cigarette products. The town of Carbondale earlier this week also banned the sale of flavored e-cigarette and tobacco products. The town will require tobacco retailers to be licensed, and it will raise the minimum purchasing age to 21.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A report predicts a major increase in demand for home care for older residents and people with disabilities. The analysis was conducted by Mercer Human Services Consulting, a firm retained by the Department of Social Services to help plan for future Medicaid-funded services. It projects the growing demand for alternatives to institutional care will lead to excess capacity in nursing homes, reducing need by nearly 6,000 beds by 2040. Office of Policy and Management Secretary Melissa McCaw said Connecticut has been “moving in the right direction on long-term care for a number of years,” including various Medicaid-funded services to help people live at home. McCaw said the state must “continue to adapt” and make sure policies also address excess capacity at nursing facilities, which will still be needed.\n\nDelaware\n\nNew Castle: Authorities found no evidence of hazardous chemicals or substances at a bank that was evacuated after five people complained of headaches and a strong chemical smell. New Castle County Emergency Management coordinator Dave Carpenter Jr. told The News Journal of Wilmington that the manager of the PNC Bank in New Castle evacuated the building early Monday after the people developed headaches. Hazmat teams from local agencies and the state Department of Natural Resources responded to the scene. Carpenter said state and local authorities said they didn’t detect any harmful substances in the bank. No one was hospitalized, and state authorities said they planned to retest the building to determine the source of the strong chemical smell. It’s unclear if they found the source.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Two D.C., agencies knew a row house that appeared to be illegally rented had “life safety violations” for months before a fire killed two tenants last week. City Administrator Rashad M. Young told reporters Tuesday a police officer complained about the home to the city and fire department in March, prompting a city inspector to visit it. He said the inspector never gained entry and contacted the home’s owner, but neither agency fully probed the officer’s complaint. Four workers from the agencies are now on leave. The U.S. attorney’s office is investigating. The officer’s complaint “strongly recommended” inspectors investigate an apparently unlicensed rooming house with possible fire code violations. Authorities have said the house contained a deadly mixture of broken smoke detectors, narrow halls and barred exits.\n\nFlorida\n\nNew Smyrna Beach: Authorities said a surfer caught air on a wave and landed on a shark that, in turn, bit him on the hand and calf. Donald Walsh told The Daytona Beach News-Journal that he had been surfing at New Smyrna Beach for several hours Tuesday when he decided to try going airborne before leaving for the day. Ocean Rescue Capt. Tamra Malphurs said that’s when Walsh landed on the 6.5-foot shark in waist-deep water and suffered cuts that weren’t considered life-threatening. Walsh, 40, said he didn’t see the shark below him as he landed in the water, but the shark’s bite brought it into focus. Walsh said he will be back in the water as soon as his wounds heal a bit.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAugusta: A kayaker said he could only think of paddling faster after realizing he wasn’t alone in a pond. Bo Storey told WRDW-TV, “I just paddled and paddled. …” on Monday to get away from a 10-foot, 360-pound alligator that got as close as 5 feet from the back of his kayak. News outlets reported Richmond County deputies received a call from Storey saying he was being chased by the behemoth. Storey was practicing for a bass fishing tournament. Deputies arrived on the scene and wrestled the massive gator with help from hunter Trey Durant and his friend Robby Amerson. The alligator was clearly not afraid of humans and was deemed a nuisance so it was legally killed by Durant.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The reopening of the USS Arizona Memorial has been scheduled for Labor Day weekend following a 15-month closure. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported Wednesday that walk-on access to the memorial will begin Sunday. A malfunction with the concrete dock’s anchoring system forced the closure of the memorial to foot traffic beginning in May 2018. Exceptionally high tides in 2017 are believed to have dislodged concrete blocks sunk into the sediment of Pearl Harbor and connected by chains to the dock. Park employees last week installed a visitor ramp for walk-on visits to the 105-foot floating dock and reinstalled the memorial’s bridge spanning 30 feet and weighing 4 tons. Officials said the repair project has cost more than $2.1 million.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gallagher, a comedian known for smashing fruit and vegetables with giant wooden hammers, said he was escorted out of Idaho’s Statehouse when he entered the building carrying two of the hammers. Gallagher told the Idaho Statesman in a story Wednesday that he was looking for the state’s film office on Monday for a possible project. The state doesn’t have a film office. A person who answered the phone at the state agency that provides security said Wednesday that no one was available to comment. The 73-year-old comedian who rose to fame in the 1980s said he’s in Boise to scout locations for a film about an ancient poet. He also said he would like to build a retirement project in the area where old celebrities could live among regular folks.\n\nIllinois\n\nArlington Heights: The owner of Arlington International Racecourse has announced the company will not seek a license to add casino gambling at the track. Churchill Downs CEO Bill Carstanjen on Wednesday said state law requiring the track to dedicate a portion of casino earnings to racing purses makes placing casino games at the suburban Chicago track untenable. Carstanjen noted Arlington would enter the gambling market with a tax rate that would be approximately 17.5% to 20% higher than the existing Chicago-area casinos because of contributions to the thoroughbred purse account. Churchill Downs also owns a majority interest in Rivers Casino in nearby Des Plaines. Carstanjen also said horse racing at Arlington is guaranteed until 2021, after which the company might move to a track at another location in Illinois. The Illinois Thoroughbred Horsemen’s Association said the decision on casinos by Churchill Downs means the company is snubbing the men and women of thoroughbred horse racing.\n\nIndiana\n\nMadison:The Ku Klux Klan is planning a second annual “kookout” in Madison for Saturday, an event that was met last year with hundreds of protesters. The group plans to hold the event at Jaycee Park from 1-3 p.m. on Saturday on the riverfront, according to an event flier. The flyer for the event reads “Make America Safe! Make America Drug Free! Make America White! Make America Great! Take a Stand!!! Join the Klan!!!” And at the bottom of the page, “Never! Never! Apologize for Being White!” About 300 people protested last year’s event, saying the Klan’s message was divisive and not welcome in their town. Residents from surrounding towns have said they don’t want to be associated with the KKK. After World War I, Indiana was a platform for the “most powerful Ku Klux Klan,” according to the Indiana State Library’s website. Madison, named after the country’s fourth president, is about an hour’s drive northeast from Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nIowa\n\nClive:City officials now know what caused a portion of Walnut Creek to turn bright green. A water sample collected on Tuesday showed traces of cyanobacteria, which can produce the cyanotoxin microcystin, a news release said Thursday. However, the sample collected was within the allowable range for safe water recreation. The concentration of the microcystin was 2.9 ug/L. The Iowa Department of Natural Resources posts beach advisories for concentration levels greater than 20 ug/L and the Environmental Protection Agency's Health Advisory Level is 8 ug/L. Because the bloom is ongoing and there could be areas in the water where microcystin are more concentrated, the city recommends people and pets stay out of the discolored water until the algae bloom subsides.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: The Lawrence Humane Society has trapped the first feral cats under a program designed to manage the wild cat population. The Community Cat Program traps, neuters and vaccinates feral cats and returns them to the areas where they were found. As part of the program, the shelter clips the ear of a cat when it’s neutered so animal control will not pick it up again. Kirk Putman, the Humane Society’s interim director, said that the shelter trapped a total of 15 cats in two separate efforts in the last week. The organization is asking for volunteers and donations to help with the program. Previously, the city had not allowed cats to roam free. The Lawrence Journal-World reported the program went into effect May 1, despite opposition from some citizens.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A U.S. sailor from Kentucky who died at Pearl Harbor will be buried in his hometown this fall. The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency said 25-year-old Navy Machinist’s Mate 1st Class Ulis C. Steely of Corbin was assigned to the USS Oklahoma battleship when it was attacked by Japanese aircraft on Dec. 7, 1941. He was among 429 crewmen killed. Most of the remains were not identified at the time. Unidentified remains have been buried in Hawaii. The agency said in 2015 it exhumed unknown remains from the USS Oklahoma for analysis. Using dental and anthropological analysis, as well as DNA, Steely’s remains were identified last fall. Gov. Matt Bevin’s office said he would order flags lowered to half-staff in Steely’s honor on Oct. 5, the date of his funeral.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The police department has authorized a minor uniform change as the city prepares for an annual festival of gay culture in the French Quarter. A department news release said that some officers will be sporting “Pride Edition Badges” during Southern Decadence, which began Thursday and runs through the Labor Day weekend. The special badge is designed like the department’s traditional badge, a star framed by a crescent. But this star is rainbow-striped. The department said the badge was introduced in June to mark Pride Month when it was made available as an option for officers to purchase and wear. It can be worn again during the weekend Southern Decadence Festival. The department said it will also be an option during future Pride Month and Southern Decadence celebrations.\n\nMaine\n\nWaldoboro: Fishery regulators are postponing a round of meetings with lobstermen in the state aimed at preparing for potential new restrictions designed to protect endangered whales. Department of Marine Resources spokesman Jeff Nichols said the department hasn’t set dates yet for any new meetings. The meetings were set to start in September. A federal government team called for the removal of many vertical trap lines from the Gulf of Maine to reduce risk to North Atlantic right whales, which number about 400. The state held a series of meetings with lobstermen about the new rules earlier this year. The last took place in late June. Nicholas said the commissioner wants to do another review of right whale and lobster industry data before presenting a plan about the next steps to the industry.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: City officials have decided to use $6 million in park and public facility funds to help pay for the recovery of a ransomware attack that crippled the city for weeks. The Baltimore Sun reported the city’s spending panel voted Wednesday to use the funds for recovery and “hardening of the environment.” A May ransomware attack on city computer servers is estimated to have cost Baltimore about $18.2 million in restoration costs and delayed or lost revenue. The attack came about a year after one hit Baltimore’s 911 system. Mayor Bernard C. Young has said Baltimore might purchase insurance against hackers. The spending panel delayed a vote Wednesday on an $835,000 contract for $20 million in cyber liability coverage. Young said the two panel members need to be briefed on the proposal.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The governors of five East Coast states, including Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, are urging federal regulators not to put any additional roadblocks in the way of the country’s nascent offshore wind industry. The governors of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire and Virginia said in a letter Tuesday to Interior Secretary David Bernhardt and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that offshore wind power will help strengthen America’s energy independence while creating thousands of jobs. The group said they’re disappointed by a recent decision to delay final permitting of the planned 84-turbine Vineyard Wind project. The group urged federal overseers to give the project a green light by next March. An Interior Department spokeswoman said the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management is working to develop a permitting timeline for the project.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: State regulators and Native American tribes are temporarily removing juvenile lake sturgeon from two Michigan rivers to protect them from chemical treatments targeting sea lampreys. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service treats rivers in the Great Lakes region to kill invasive lampreys. It doesn’t harm most fish. But when the treatments are applied in the Big Manistee and Muskegon rivers, lake sturgeon are at risk. Over the next two months, the Little River Band of Ottawa Indians and the Gun Lake Tribe will join the state Department of Natural Resources to catch juvenile sturgeon and keep them in rearing facilities until the treatments are completed. Afterward, they’ll be released. During the last sea lamprey treatment on the Big Manistee River three years ago, 117 lake sturgeon were collected and released.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud:Clean-up after a July fire at St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Catholic School will delay the start of the school year. “The turnaround time is just not fast enough,” said Kelly Vangsness, principal at the south side parochial school. The first day of school was scheduled for Aug. 26, but in early August, the administration pushed the first day to Sept. 4, which is the first day of school for most students in the St. Cloud school district. Continued clean-up has delayed the first day – again – to Monday, Sept. 9, Vangsness said Tuesday. The school was damaged by a July 4 fire that started in a light fixture that had been updated with LED bulbs, according to St. Cloud police. No one was inside the building at the time and the fire was isolated to the vestibule area and adjoining hallway, including the ceiling above that area. Painting and carpet installation is expected to be completed by Sept. 4, Vangsness said, but the administration is waiting for the installation of the fire system and for state officials to sign off on an asbestos abatement.\n\nMississippi\n\nOxford: The University of Mississippi said it’s moving ahead with plans to transfer a Confederate soldier monument from its central location on campus to a spot near a secluded Confederate cemetery. In an email sent to students, faculty and staff, interim Chancellor Larry Sparks wrote that the university submitted plans Tuesday to take down, move and reassemble the monument. The Mississippi Department of Archives and History must review and approve the university’s plans. College Board trustees, who govern Mississippi’s eight public universities, must also approve the move. Sparks agreed in March to calls from faculty, students and staff to move the marble soldier and base from near the school’s historic heart. The monument has stood sentry there since 1906, when the United Daughters of the Confederacy commissioned it. The monument is 29 feet tall and weighs 40,000 pounds. Plans call for moving it outside a cemetery in a less prominent area of the campus that holds graves of Confederate soldiers killed in the battle of Shiloh. A new concrete walkway would be built leading to the cemetery, with the monument installed along with it.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Commuters who prefer to cross the Mississippi River on the Martin Luther King Bridge will have to wait quite a while longer for the bridge to reopen. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that flooding this spring and summer has delayed a construction project on the bridge that closed in August of last year. It was originally expected to reopen this fall. Now, according to the Illinois Department of Transportation, the bridgework won’t be complete until next summer. IDOT spokesman Guy Tridgell said the flooding impacted train routes. He said the diverted trains were rerouted to tracks under the bridge project, preventing IDOT from being able to safely remove a section of the existing bridge. The construction work is on the Illinois side.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A fire burning in grass and shrubs northwest of Billings has led to the evacuation of about 15 residences near the community of Molt. The Billings Gazette reported the fire started Wednesday and had burned up to an estimated 15 square miles by Thursday morning. Yellowstone County Commissioner Dennis Pitman said residents were watching the fire Wednesday night when the wind changed direction, sending the flames toward homes and prompting the evacuations. No structures have been damaged and fire crews were protecting homes. The cause of the fire is still under investigation.\n\nNebraska\n\nSpencer: Drinking water is being restored in Boyd County after a disastrous flood washed out a water main in March. The Omaha World-Herald reported that workers began installing a new pipe beneath the Niobrara River on Tuesday. Boyd County Rural Water District officials said water could be provided to Spencer, Lynch, Anoka and nearby farms in about two weeks. Potable water will not be available until testing and sanitation work is complete. The district has provided no timeline. The water district has refurbished three irrigation wells to provide water temporarily for showering, washing and toilets, and it has been distributing free bottled water. Rex Black, the water district board chairman, said restoring water service will cost about $2 million. The Federal Emergency Management Agency will cover 75% of that.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A Las Vegas-area teachers’ union has struck a teacher pay deal Wednesday with the country’s fifth-largest school district that organizers said will avert a threatened strike Sept. 10. Members of the Clark County Education Association threatened to walk off the job next month over a dispute about paying teachers more for continuing education. Union leaders and the Clark County School District announced at a news conference late Wednesday that the district will fund the salary increase for continuing education, in addition to honoring a commitment for 3% raises and more money for health insurance. The deal came days after the school district filed an emergency court motion to block the strike and have a judge issue an order against it. If the order was imposed, the striking union could have faced fines of up to $50,000 a day. The deal still needs to be ratified by the union’s executives and the school district’s trustees, but both sides say they expect that will happen soon.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nNew Castle Island: Some residents are protesting a plan to recruit archers to kill as many as 20 deer on New Castle Island. News outlets are reporting that nearly 2,000 residents have signed a petition opposing the plan proposed by condo managers of Wentworth by the Sea to stop deer from eating private gardens. Residents estimated there are about 24 deer total on the island. They said they like the animals and don’t want them killed. The Portsmouth Herald reported that some residents said the plan is not a hunt but “a kill” because the archers will take aim from tree stands while the deer feed. The condo association hasn’t responded to requests for comment.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nEwing Township: The state has honored a team that competed in the Little League World Series after winning the state and Mid-Atlantic championships. Gov. Phil Murphy and State Police Superintendent Col. Patrick Callahan hosted the Elmora Troopers and their families Thursday at the State Police Museum in Ewing. Elizabeth’s Elmora Youth League team is named in honor of Trooper Thomas Hanratty, who was struck and killed during a traffic stop in 1992. Hanratty played baseball for the league and players wear a patch with his badge number. The Troopers were knocked out of the double-elimination Little League World Series tournament last week by a team from Louisiana that went on to win the championship.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nRoswell: Investigators have determined a fireworks explosion that killed a firefighter and severely injured another was accidental. Roswell firefighters were packaging fireworks on June 5 for the city’s Independence Day celebration when the explosion happened, the Roswell Daily Record reported Wednesday. The city’s fire department has organized the event in recent years. The blast led to the death of Jeff Stroble, 46, on July 21. Hoby Bonham, 36, was sent home from the hospital in late June. Ten other firefighters were treated for minor injuries. The firefighters were handling the fireworks inside a concrete building at the Roswell International Air Center. They were fusing aerial shell fireworks with electric matches when one went off, the report from the state fire marshal’s office states. Investigators from state agencies and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives assisted in the investigation. The city declined to comment.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The second span of the new Kosciuszko Bridge between Brooklyn and Queens has opened to traffic. The span opened early Thursday. A ceremony on Wednesday night included a light show with music from Billy Joel via satellite from Madison Square Garden. The bridge features five Queens-bound traffic lanes and four Brooklyn-bound lanes, as well as a 20-foot-wide pedestrian and bicycle pathway. A 7-acre site beneath the bridge in Brooklyn will be turned into a public space and park. The first part of the new bridge was completed in April 2017. The $873 million project is the first major bridge built in New York City since the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge in 1964. The original Kosciuszko Bridge opened in 1939.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A man’s body has been exhumed from a gravesite on a court order after a funeral home discovered it mistakenly sold the same plot twice. WRAL reported Kizzie Sewell bought a plot at Montlawn Cemetery in Raleigh for her husband, Winfred Barnes, upon his death in 2014. But last year, Sewell said Montlawn informed her they realized they had sold her husband’s plot to another customer who started paying for it six months before Barnes was buried there. On Wednesday, Barnes’ body was dug up after five years in the plot. A judge ruled the man with the original contract was entitled to the site. Montlawn said in a statement to the outlet that they abided by the court order.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe filed a motion Wednesday to intervene on a proposed expansion of the Dakota Access pipeline that would double the line’s capacity. The tribe, which led original opposition to the crude oil pipeline, petitioned for status as an intervenor in the case before the Public Service Commission arguing its “interests … are not adequately represented.” North Dakota regulators have set a Nov. 13 public hearing on the proposed expansion. The public hearing, which was requested by the tribe and the Sierra Club, will be held in the south-central city of Linton, near where a pump station would go in to increase the line’s capacity.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati:Cincinnati Metro could be out of the streetcar business by New Year’s Day. On Wednesday, City Manager Patrick Duhaney released a 25-page “Cincinnati Streetcar Transition Plan” that details the timeline and who will be responsible for what during the separation. The target date is “on or around” Jan. 1, according to the plan. The separation is expected to cost around $553,000, which would come from the streetcar’s budget. As is, the Cincinnati Bell Connector has a complicated management structure. The city owns it, but Metro oversees it. Metro, in turn, contracts with a private company called Transdev to run the streetcar day-to-day. With the divorce, the city would take over complete management of the streetcar, cutting out Metro as a middleman. Transdev would carry on with day-to-day operations. The city administration is expected to present its financial plan for the separation during a city council meeting on Sept. 4.\n\nOklahoma\n\nWebber Falls: One of two runaway barges that crashed into a dam and sank on top of the other in the Arkansas River has been removed from the dam. The barges carrying a total of about 3,800 pounds of fertilizer sank May 23 after crashing into the lock and dam at Webbers Falls, about 70 miles southeast of Tulsa. They had broken free from their mooring at the Port of Muskogee during historic spring flooding that waterlogged much of the Midwest down into Arkansas. Port manager Fred Taylor said Tuesday it could take several weeks to completely remove both barges, which are to be used for scrap. The McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System runs from Tulsa to the Mississippi River and has been closed to barge traffic since the flooding began.\n\nOregon\n\nCoos Bay: A 6.3-magnitude earthquake struck Thursday off the Oregon coast but did not generate a tsunami or cause any damage or injuries, authorities said. The epicenter of the quake, which hit just after 8 a.m., was located about 150 miles from land at a depth of 7 miles in the Pacific Ocean. The quake was caused by slipping along an offshore fault called the Blanco Fracture Zone and has nothing to do with the more well-known Cascadia fault, which is believed to be overdue for a major earthquake in the Pacific Northwest, said Paul Bodin, manager of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network at the University of Washington. The event is also unrelated to a cluster of “episodic slips” along the Cascadia tectonic plate boundary that have been releasing energy across the coastal Pacific Northwest over the past week to 10 days, he said. Those slips are not felt by humans but have been picked up by monitoring devices around the Olympic Peninsula in northwest Washington state and also stretching from Eugene to the Siskiyou Mountains along the Oregon-California border, according to the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: State officials are hoping to lower the risk of lead poisoning through mandated blood testing for children and other measures. Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf is backing legislation to require testing that meets federal guidelines and is rolling out other strategies to address the problem. The administration is working on ways for regional response teams to care for children with dangerous amounts of lead in their system. There are also proposals to train more people in remediating lead and to provide more resources online about lead poisoning, testing and remediation. Officials said about 3 in 10 children in the state have been tested for lead exposure, and just under 5% had elevated lead levels.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Residents are facing about an 8% hike in their electricity bills beginning in October after state regulators approved a rate increase. WPRI-TV reported that the cost increase affects National Grid’s residential electricity customers, who on average will pay about $9 more per month for at least the next six months. The Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission, which decides whether to approve or deny rate changes, also approved rate increases for commercial and industrial customers on Wednesday. The higher costs are typical during the winter months when generating electricity becomes more expensive. The commission’s decision was made without objection or controversy.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nHilton Head Island: A group that monitors sea turtles has reported finding a two-headed loggerhead hatchling. News outlets reported Sea Turtle Patrol Hilton Head Island said the hatchling was found alive Tuesday and released into the ocean. The group’s leader, marine biologist Amber Kuehn, said a genetic mutation caused the second head on the turtle, since named Squirt and Crush. The group shared a picture of the turtle on Facebook on Wednesday that showed the creature’s small body partially eclipsed by a gloved hand. The post wished the turtle good luck. Kuehn said Crush and Squirt couldn’t really swim, as the heads controlled separate flippers and weren’t working together.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Gov. Kristi Noem and Oglala Lakota County school officials plan to partner on building the first local public high school on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Noem said Thursday that building a career and technical education high school in Oglala Lakota County “will bolster the area’s workforce” and “empower students with real-life skills and career opportunities.” The school district serves 22 communities and operates from virtual locations that can serve 50 to 250 students at a time. The only other high schools on the reservation are private or federal Bureau of Indian Education schools. District superintendent Anthony Fairbanks said building a physical high school will “create a launchpad for our students’ career development.” The school is scheduled to open in August 2020 and enroll about 400 students.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Former Gov. Bill Haslam isn’t ruling out a future run for office, though he said he isn’t planning on it. During an event alongside former GOP Sen. Bob Corker, Haslam said he would be sad if he never serves in some kind of public role again. Haslam told reporters it was a hard decision, but the right one, not to run to replace retiring Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander in 2020. President Donald Trump tweeted last month that former Ambassador to Japan Bill Hagerty would launch a Senate bid and endorsed him. Haslam said he’s “really excited” about the presumed Republican run by Hagerty, Haslam’s ex-economic development commissioner. Corker said he wants to let the race evolve, saying he’s friends with Hagerty and trauma surgeon Manny Sethi, another Republican who has launched a campaign.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: A nonprofit that advocates for children said the rate of student suspensions has fallen by nearly a third since the state implemented a law barring suspensions except in extreme circumstances. The 2017 Texas law permits suspensions for major violations such as assault or bringing a weapon or drugs to school. The Dallas Morning News reported that Texas public schools suspended more than 101,000 students in prekindergarten to second grade during the 2015-16 school year. Texans Care for Children released a report Wednesday revealing that those figures dropped by 31% to 70,197 in the 2017-18 school year. Youngsters in foster care, black children and those in special education are more likely to be suspended.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: State officials are unveiling a gun safety program aimed at preventing accidental shootings that will be optional for schools. The program had been mandated three years ago by state lawmakers who have consistently rejected gun-control measures. Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes said Thursday at a news conference that the program avoids the politically sensitive issues of gun policy and instead acknowledges that many children are bound to come across guns in a state where an estimated 4 in 10 households have a firearm. Utah is also one of several states that allow teachers with concealed carry permit holders to carry guns in schools. The program features a 5-minute video and would be taught to children in 5th through 12th grades by law enforcement officers who already work with students. School districts will have to approve the course, and parents will have to provide written permission.\n\nVermont\n\nOrange: A farmer said most of the 250 pigs that escaped from his fenced-in area earlier this month are back. Walter Jeffries of Sugar Mountain Farm in Orange said Thursday the fence has been fixed. Jeffries said roughly 50 adults and 200 piglets escaped after fencing was damaged by vandals. He said 99% of the pigs have been wrangled. He and workers placed a trail of hamburger and hot dog buns to lure the stragglers. Agriculture Secretary Anson Tebbetts said his agency provided Jeffries guidance on how to remedy the problem.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A power company is launching an initiative to provide electric school buses to school districts in Virginia. Dominion Energy said in a statement Thursday that electric buses will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and save school districts money. Dominion said the initial phase of the program aims to put 50 electric buses in its Virginia service territory by the end of 2020. The company hopes to expand the program with state approval to bring 1,000 electric school buses online by 2025. Dominion said it hopes to replace all diesel buses. It said replacing one is like taking 5.2 cars off the road. The company said bus manufacturers will be able to submit bids to build the buses. School districts will be able express interest in participating in the program.\n\nWashington\n\nYakima: A radio station has returned on air nearly a year after burglars robbed the station of essential production equipment. The Yakima Herald-Republic reported that KYNR 1490-AM station on the Yakama Indian Reservation hosted its first shows Thursday using a makeshift system. Authorities said burglars took the station’s control board, microphones, printers and the emergency alert system in October. Station hosts said they are still waiting for a replacement control board after the first new one had programming issues. Hosts said a mixing board that relies on analog radio transmission allowed the station to get back on the air for now, but with fewer channels. Authorities said the Federal Communications Commission wanted to know whether the theft was an attempt to impede the station’s ability to inform the public.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Marshall University will work with the investigative division of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to fight the opioid crisis. The Herald-Dispatch reported Sen. Shelley Moore Capito announced Wednesday the partnership between Marshall University and Homeland Security Investigations. Capito said the school will receive more than $4 million to develop a tool to disrupt and dismantle criminal activity related to opioids. John Sammons, director of Marshall University’s digital forensics and information assurance program, said students, faculty and staff are looking forward to the project because they’ve seen the impact of the epidemic in their community. Sammons said the partnership will focus on transnational criminal activity, including cybercrimes.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: State officials said the gray wolf population might have stabilized after nearing extinction decades ago. The state Department of Natural Resources said it counted from 914 to 978 wolves in the year to April 2019. The agency said that is a 1% increase from the last count. Wisconsin Public Radio reported that state data shows there were just 25 wolves in Wisconsin 1980. A federal judge placed the gray wolf on the endangered species list in 2014. The federal government this year launched an effort to delist it. Adrian Treves, a professor of environmental studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said Wisconsin hasn’t been transparent with its count and that the federal government shouldn’t rely on the state’s numbers. The DNR stands by the count.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A U.S. bankruptcy court has ruled that a coal company can sell two large Wyoming mines separately from one in West Virginia. Contura Energy originally sought to buy all three mines from Blackjewel in a deal held up while U.S. officials seek payment of federal royalties. Contura would have paid $9.7 million for the Belle Ayr and Eagle Butte mines in Wyoming and Pax Surface Mine in West Virginia. The Casper Star-Tribune reported that the court in West Virginia on Wednesday approved a deal in which Contura would pay $1.1 million to complete the sale of the West Virginia mine. The Wyoming mines have been shut down since Blackjewel declared bankruptcy July 1. Federal records show no production at the West Virginia mine since 2006.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/09/09/river-troll-cob-cornstalk-batman-escort-news-around-states/40100855/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: A memorial is being dedicated to two black men who were killed in what are described as racist lynchings near the city in the 1890s. The Jefferson County Memorial Project says it will dedicate a marker to Tom Redmond and Jake McKenzie at Sloss Furnaces on Monday night. An announcement says both men worked at mines owned by Sloss-Sheffield Iron and Steel, and both were killed in the old mining town of Brookside during confrontations with police. Redmond was killed during a shootout near a company store in 1890. McKenzie was fatally shot seven years later when a city marshal attempted to arrest a black man for abusive language. A statement by Mayor Randall Woodfin describes both men as victims of “unspeakable hate.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The state’s hot, dry summer has led to severe drought conditions in some communities, which are struggling to meet their water needs. The arid conditions are widespread but acutely felt in a handful of small communities that rely on snow melt and rain to fill their reserves. Among the worst hit have been the Alutiiq communities of Nanwalek and Seldovia in the Kenai Peninsula south of Anchorage. Their plight prompted regional officials to issue a disaster declaration. Nanwalek is shutting off the public water supply 12 hours each day and barging in jugs of water to deal with water shortages. In the Alutiiq community of Seldovia, automatic flush toilets have been switched to manual flushing, and restaurants are serving meals on paper plates.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Inmates have asked a federal judge to take over health care operations in all state-run prisons and appoint an official to run medical and mental health services due to Arizona’s repeated failure to improve the care. Attorneys representing 34,000 inmates said in a filing Friday that the state has failed to fulfill many of the improvements to inmate care that it promised nearly five years ago when the case was settled. The takeover request marks an escalation in the litigation in which the state has repeatedly been accused of dragging its feet. Previously, the state has been fined for failing to follow through on its promises. In the latest request, the inmates requested a receivership be ordered to run health care operations in prisons and asked the judge to follow through on her earlier threat to impose a second contempt-of-court fine against the state for noncompliance.\n\nArkansas\n\nHelena-West Helena: A newspaper that was expected to shut down Friday has a new owner. GateHouse Media said it has entered an agreement to sell the Helena-West Helena World to a pair of local entrepreneurs. The terms of the deal weren’t disclosed, but new owners Andrew Bagley and Chuck Davis said they intend to publish the newspaper weekly. Last week, GateHouse announced that the Helena-West Helena paper would shut down along with the Stuttgart Daily Leader. The Stuttgart newspaper reports that negotiations are underway for a new buyer there, but nothing has been finalized. GateHouse publishes 154 daily newspapers, most in small- and mid-sized towns. In August, GateHouse announced it was merging with fellow newspaper giant Gannett, USA TODAY’s parent company.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Homeowners forced to rebuild because of a wildfire won’t have to install solar panels under a new law signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom. New rules taking effect Jan. 1 make California the first state in the country to require solar panels on new homes. But thousands of homes across the Golden State have been damaged or destroyed in recent years because of wildfires and other natural disasters. Newsom signed a bill Friday that temporarily exempts homes from the rules in areas where the governor has declared a state of emergency prior to Jan. 1, 2020. The exemption would expire in 2023. Newsom said he supports efforts to rebuild communities as fast as possible. But he urged all Californians to consider installing solar panels.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state has taken the unusual step of inviting the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to downgrade the air quality rating of its biggest population center, and not everyone thinks that was a good idea. The EPA held a hearing Friday on whether to lower the ozone status of Denver and eight other northern Colorado counties from “moderate” to “serious.” That would force the state to work harder to reduce harmful pollution but also bring tougher and costly regulations for businesses. The agency expects to decide by the end of the year. The EPA acted after Democratic Gov. Jared Polis said in March that Colorado would no longer ask for an exemption from EPA standards by claiming some of the pollution was drifting into the state from elsewhere. It’s time to stop “sugar-coating” Colorado’s air problems, he said last month.\n\nConnecticut\n\nLedyard: The state’s hemp industry is beginning to take off. Gov. Ned Lamont announced last week that the state has licensed 82 hemp growers, two processors and 21 manufacturers under a pilot program the Democrat signed into law earlier this year. The law allows for the cultivation, harvesting, processing, and manufacturing of hemp plants and by-products in the state. In total, 294 acres of land are being used to grow hemp in Connecticut. Under the law, which created a new industrial hemp research project, anyone who plans to manufacture hemp products that are consumed in any way by people – such as food products, lotions or oils – must obtain a license from the state Department of Consumer Protection. Lamont said the program is creating more opportunities in the agricultural industry.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The first woman to lead Delaware State University as president has announced her retirement after a little more than a year in the role. News outlets report Wilma Mishoe announced Thursday that she’ll retire at the end of December. Tony Allen, the current executive vice president and provost of the university, will take over as president. Mishoe officially assumed her role in July 2018, having served as interim president since January 2018. She became the first woman to lead the state’s only historically black university. Mishoe had previously left retirement to lead Delaware State. Allen says it was Mishoe’s expectation that she’d help “stabilize” the school, then enter retirement again.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Two D.C. councilmembers have asked government officials to examine a local company that has no employees and yet was given the largest workload and payout from a $215 million no-bid sports gambling contract. The Washington Post reports Robert C. White Jr. and Elissa Silverman want an investigation into Veterans Services Corp., which is contracted by Intralot for sports betting and city lottery work. Their votes were crucial in awarding Intralot the sole-source contract, despite concerns about subcontractors, some of whom are connected to local officials. The newspaper says Veterans Services has no employees and lists executives on its website who don’t actually work there.\n\nFlorida\n\nCrystal River: It wasn’t Gotham City, but Batman descended on a local preschool to help a 3-year-old girl who was being bullied. When Erica Calculli’s daughter Lydia came home from school with bruises on her face, she chalked it up to regular kids’ play. But then Lydia came home with a swollen black eye last month. The little girl told her mother that her classmates hit her and threw a shoe at her. Calculli says she reported the incident to her daughter’s school, but nothing came of it. She turned to social media, where Batman impersonator Jack Asbury saw the post and offered to walk the little girl to school. Calculli posted an adorable photo of the shy girl holding the black-caped superhero’s hand in the classroom. WTSP reports the toddler has since been moved to an advanced learning class.\n\nGeorgia\n\nMarietta: Many Cobb County voters will cast hand-marked paper ballots in Nov. 5 municipal elections as a backup plan for the state’s election equipment ordered by a federal judge. News outlets report paper ballots will be trialed in Austell, Kennesaw, Powder Springs and Smyrna. U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg ordered a contingency plan be developed in case Georgia’s newly purchased touchscreen voting machines aren’t fully implemented by 2020. The new machines print a paper record of a voter’s selections. They’ll replace the state’s current outdated machines that don’t produce an auditable paper trail. Cobb County elections director Janine Eveler says she expects Cobb voters to be using the new machines by March, but the paper ballot test is a “fail safe” against any issues.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A federal agency has approved a rail recovery plan submitted by the Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation, officials said. U.S. Sen. Brian Schatz said the Federal Transit Administration approved the proposal submitted earlier this year, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The recovery plan was submitted by the city transportation authority to demonstrate Honolulu has a workable proposal for completing the 20-mile rail line. The line was originally estimated at $5.2 billion and was supposed to be completed next year, but the transit administration now projects completion in 2026 at a cost of $9.2 billion. The approval recognizes efforts by the city and state to improve accountability and control costs, Schatz said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: BNSF Railway’s plan to build two bridges as part of a second railroad line in northern Idaho to accommodate increased train traffic and future growth meets environmental requirements, federal officials said Thursday. The U.S. Coast Guard issued a final environmental assessment for the bridges across Lake Pend Oreille and Sand Creek at Sandpoint, finding no significant impact. An environmental group said it was disappointed the Coast Guard didn’t do a much lengthier environmental review called an environmental impact statement, saying an increase in crude oil and other hazardous materials crossing bridges could put the lake and residents at risk. The Coast Guard is involved because the structures are over navigable waters. Idaho officials, who have authority over the lake bottom, have already approved the bridges.\n\nIllinois\n\nDowners Grove: This year’s Illinois Tollway high school art contest will honor the Illinois State Police. Tollway officials announced last week that the winning design will appear on the cover of the 2020 tollway map. The art contest is presented with Blick Art Materials and MB Real Estate. Several Illinois State Police officers have been killed in the line of duty this year. Two died while working on the 294-mile tollway system. Officials say students who enter the contest should “illustrate the service and sacrifice” of state troopers. Artwork could focus on how the state police helps motorists through its principles of integrity, service and pride; how it promotes traffic safety; or how it serves the tollway with motorcycle, K-9 and detective units.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Ball State University will lead archaeological surveys at three state parks to locate possible prehistoric sites and homesteads from the early 1800s. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources says those surveys are among 15 projects around the state sharing in about $450,000 in federal grants for historic preservation and archaeology. The archaeology surveys are planned at Summit Lake State Park, the Wilbur Wright Fish and Wildlife Area, and Versailles State Park. About $150,000 was awarded toward the surveys. A variety of other projects received grants, including roof replacement at the former Peru High School gymnasium, which is now the Miami Nation’s tribal headquarters, and repairing the century-old entrance gate at St. Mary of the Woods College near Terre Haute.\n\nIowa\n\nFort Madison: Officials say the Sheaffer Pen Museum has reopened. The museum closed in May last year amid financial concerns and worries about the fate of company archives. The Fort Madison Daily Democrat reports the archives had been on loan from A.T. Cross, Sheaffer’s owner. The museum board president, Tim Gobble, says Cross has agreed to donate virtually all of the company archives to the museum. Grants and other financial pledges of support since have allowed the museum to reopen. Plans are being made for new and refreshed exhibits, as well as video from the company archives. The museum’s regular hours are 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday, Wednesday and Friday or by appointment for larger groups.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: The local zoo is beginning a 25-year process of rebuilding and expansion. The Wichita Eagle reports the next few weeks will bring moving day for animals large and small at the Sedgwick County Zoo. The first noticeable change will be the demolition of the second-oldest building at the zoo, a 47-year-old Asian-themed barn with a corrugated steel roof. It will be torn down to make way for a temporary entrance while the main entrance is rebuilt at twice its current size. During the process, a 1,400-pound Zebu bull named Milkdud that’s native to south Asia will be moved in with the Watusi cattle at the African Barn. Plans also are in the works for a new home for the Amur leopards, new office space and a solar-powered train.\n\nKentucky\n\nPikeville: Grants totaling $34.4 million have been announced in an effort to spur economic development and job creation in eastern Kentucky – a region hard-hit by the coal sector’s downturn. Officials say the grants will support projects affecting 14 counties. The support includes nearly $4.8 million for Pikeville Medical Center to develop a children’s hospital and pediatric clinic expected to provide health care services for more than 100,000 children. Leslie County will receive more than $2 million to develop a program expanding internet connectivity and providing job training. U.S. Rep. Harold “Hal” Rogers says grants will help advance health care, enhance tourism, improve infrastructure and create jobs.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The city is closing a historic cemetery in the Garden District for maintenance and repairs. Tours and public visits won’t be allowed until the work is complete at Lafayette Cemetery No. 1. Appointments will be needed for funerals or visits to family tombs. The work starts Monday. A news release says tomb owners can call the property management department for appointments. The area was a separate city, Lafayette, when the cemetery was founded in 1833. Novelist Anne Rice used the cemetery as the setting for her fictional Mayfair witches’ family tomb. Planned work includes fixing a water line, improving drainage, removing and repaving paths, fixing a brick wall and abandoned tombs, removing magnolia trees, and thoroughly cleaning up debris.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state moved ahead Friday with plans to become the first to allow voters to rank candidates in a general presidential election. Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, said she’ll allow a bill to become law in January without her signature. The legislation requires ranked choice voting in presidential elections and primaries. Ranked voting won’t be used in a planned presidential primary in March 2020, Mills’ office said. The bill won’t go into effect until 90 days after the Legislature is set to adjourn in April. But future presidential primaries would use ranked choice voting, according to the governor’s office. Maine voters in 2016 approved ranked voting, but the system was limited to federal races and primaries.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A two-year project to rehabilitate the westbound span of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge that’s expected to cause major delays will be getting underway this month. The Capital Gazette reports some work on the $27 million project was scheduled to start after Labor Day but was delayed. The westbound right lane will now be closed on weekdays starting Sept. 24. Then, starting in October, the right lane will be closed 24/7 through April 16, with restrictions lifted during Thanksgiving. From April 16 through May 20, the westbound right lane will be closed continuously during weekdays. All lanes are expected to be open during next summer’s travel season. The lane closures resume beginning in fall 2020 into spring 2021. The project, fully funded by tolls, is expected to be complete in August 2021.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: State transportation officials are restoring 21 historic road markers installed nearly 80 years ago to mark the 300th anniversary of the founding of the Massachusetts Bay Colony because they’ve grown weather-beaten over the decades. The cast iron markers, originally installed in 1930, feature black lettering and trim, plus the state’s coat of arms in blue and gold. They describe historic events and figures and provide facts and stories about their communities. All of the markers are 36 inches wide, between 35 and 45 inches high, and 165 to 200 pounds. The state Transportation Department says the markers being restored are in Bernardston, Brimfield, Deerfield, Greenfield, Hadley, Hatfield, New Braintree, Northfield, West Brookfield and Worcester. The project is expected to be completed this winter.\n\nMichigan\n\nIsle Royale: The second year of the National Park Service’s wolf relocation project has kicked off with a capture of a wolf on the state’s mainland and a flight to Isle Royale in Lake Superior. Mlive reports the 70-pound male that’s believed to be about 3 years old was captured last week. The wolf that was flown by seaplane joins 14 others already on Isle Royale, and officials hope to ultimately bring as many as 30 new wolves to the island that’s been overrun by more than 2,000 moose. Officials hope the new predators will be able to reduce the number of the leaf-eating moose before the latter eat their way through the island located about 60 miles northwest of the Upper Peninsula.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Gov. Tim Walz has finally made good on a long-held campaign promise. After “eight months of negotiations and dealmaking,” he signed off on adopting a new dog for the family. Scout is a 3-month-old black lab mix the Walzes adopted from Midwest Animal Rescue in the metro area. The governor said he had in March 2017 promised son Gus a dog if he won the 2018 election. Walz said his promise wasn’t brought up during the campaign trail, but Gus reminded Walz about the dog on election night once it became clear Walz would prevail. Scout comes as a bit of a surprise, as it wasn’t certain whether the Walzes would get a dog. Walz’s wife, Gwen, said Walz made that promise to Gus without consulting her first. And some of Walz’s family are allergic to certain dog breeds, to say nothing of how other pets would view a dog. “Afton the cat has not been happy,” Walz said.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state is considering new rules that let companies continue to use food-labeling terms such as “veggie burger” and “vegan bacon,” as long as the terms are prominently displayed so consumers understand the products are not meat. The state agriculture department on Thursday proposed new regulations for plant-based products that are sold as alternatives to meat. The regulations came in response to a lawsuit filed by a nonprofit organization advocating plant-based foods and an Illinois food company. The lawsuit was filed July 1, the same day the state enacted a law saying that “a plant-based or insect-based food product shall not be labeled as meat or a meat food product.” Meat producers have been trying to protect meat terminology by pushing for state laws that restrict labeling of products such as meatless meatballs.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: Critics say a loophole in a new law meant to ensure the safety of children in unlicensed child care homes has caused some children to be pushed out of licensed facilities. Before the law took effect Aug. 28, unlicensed, in-home child care providers could care for four or fewer unrelated children and an unlimited number of their own children. Under the new law, unlicensed providers may care for only six children, and no more than three under age 2. Day care operators’ children over age 5 are excluded in the count. The Columbia Missourian reports lawmakers inadvertently required licensed day care providers to count all their own children, regardless of age. That discrepancy has forced some licensed day care providers to refuse spots for unrelated children. A waiver process for licensed providers for their children over 5 is being used on a case-by-case basis to fix the loophole.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: State health officials are proposing new rules to regulate medical marijuana testing laboratories. A notice issued Friday by the state Department of Public Health and Human Services says a hearing will be held on the proposed rules Sept. 26 at its offices in Helena. The health department drafted the regulations after state lawmakers earlier this year put the agency’s state laboratory in charge of licensing and inspecting the marijuana testing labs. The proposal would set new rules by which the labs are licensed and accredited and how they operate. Existing licensing and accreditation regulations would be repealed. State law requires medical marijuana providers to test their products in a licensed lab for quality assurance before they can be sold.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Officials have unveiled a blue, 300-pound bronze statue of a troll that now sits below the popular Bob Kerrey Pedestrian Bridge spanning the Missouri River from Omaha to Council Bluffs, Iowa. Omar the Troll – short for Omaha Metro Area River – was introduced during a news conference Wednesday. The 4-foot troll with a toothy grin now greets visitors from atop a concrete cottage set up on a mulched area by one of the bridge’s pillars. The sculpture is the brainchild of tourism group Visit Omaha and has been in the works for three years. The idea behind his creation is to keep visitors excited about the riverfront bridge. Deborah Ward with Visit Omaha tells the Omaha World-Herald that “every bridge needs a troll.”\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A preservation group plans to use a grant to redevelop and preserve a historically black community. The Westside neighborhood, virtually the only area of the city where African Americans were permitted to live in the 1940s, saw hundreds of homes razed and thousands of people displaced, with residents not compensated for their destroyed dwellings, the Las Vegas Sun reports. Some vacant lots in the neighborhood just blocks northwest of downtown still date to that ugly period, says Heidi Swank, executive director of the Nevada Preservation Foundation. The foundation plans to use a $50,000 grant from the National Trust for Historic Preservation to identify and highlight Westside stories of triumph, innovation and success. Frank Woodbeck, a foundation board member, says that unlike in traditional redevelopment, the foundation aims to keep people in the neighborhood or even bring back former residents.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLincoln: This year’s New Hampshire Highland Games is hosting the World Championship in Heavy Athletics, where athletes from seven countries will compete in traditional Scottish events to test strength and agility. The competition will feature the stone throw, hammer throw and caber toss. The games are scheduled for Sept. 20-22 at the Loon Mountain Resort in Lincoln. Chuck Kasson, the reigning world champion and winner of the 2018 New Hampshire Highland Games, is among those scheduled to compete. Also featured will be a performance of the bagpipe band The Red Hot Chili Pipers on Sept. 21.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nDeptford: A cornstalk that was planted by accident has now shattered a Guinness world record. The record belongs to Matt Jacovelli, a Deptford retiree who noticed the unusually abundant cornstalk over the summer. “I started counting and got up to 12, 13 and 14 cobs and couldn’t believe it,” he said. The final tally was 29 cobs, verified by Rutgers agricultural agent Michelle Infante-Casella on Aug. 30. Jacovelli submitted the official count to Guinness and received a quick ruling. On Thursday, he learned he now holds the Guinness record for “most corn cobs on a single plant.” The previous world record was held by another place known for corn: Iowa. But Jacovelli nearly doubled that 2009 record, which was for 16 cobs. A typical cornstalk yields two cobs.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nWhite Sands Missile Range: White Sands Missile Range in southern New Mexico has scheduled an Oct. 5 open house at Trinity Site, the second of two such events planned this year. Trinity Site is where the world’s first atomic bomb was detonated July 16, 1945. Range officials said the open house is free, and no reservations are required. Entry will be allowed from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. Visitors can walk to ground zero, where a small obelisk marks the spot where the bomb was detonated. Historical photos are mounted on the fence surrounding the area. Visitors can also ride a shuttle bus to travel the 2 miles from ground zero to ranch houses where scientists assembled the bomb’s plutonium core.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The state has a new license plate that features several famous landmarks. The Department of Motor Vehicles announced the design Friday based on the results of a statewide survey. The winning plate showcases iconic settings like the Statue of Liberty, Niagara Falls and the Montauk Lighthouse. It also features the state motto “Excelsior,” a Latin word meaning “ever upward,” and a blue-and-yellow color scheme on a white background. DMV Commissioner Mark Schroeder says some 325,000 New Yorkers participated in the survey. About half of them selected the winning design over four other options. He said the design represents “what the Empire State is all about– our diversity, our unparalleled architecture and natural beauty.” The new license plate costs $25 and will be available to motorists in April.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s Historic Preservation Office has set up an online form so local governments and residents can report damage to historic properties caused by Hurricane Dorian. The office wants information about wind and flooding to historic structures, cemeteries and state highway historical markers. With that information in hand, the office can offer aid, technical expertise, and consultation with federal and state entities. The Historic Preservation Office offers technical advice and consultation for the restoration of damaged historic properties at no charge. A building must be at least 45 years old, but it doesn’t have to have any special historic designation. In addition, the office’s website offers tips for drying out flooded buildings, documenting damage for insurance purposes and other technical advice.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Authorities relying on DNA collected from a cigarette butt have charged a man with engaging in a riot for his involvement in a Dakota Access pipeline protest three years ago. The Bismarck Tribune reports Morton County prosecutors also charged 23-year-old Lawrence Malcolm Jr. with felony conspiracy to commit criminal mischief. An arrest warrant was issued Thursday. The charges relate to a Sept. 6, 2016, protest on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation. An affidavit says more than 100 demonstrators, many with their faces covered, halted construction and vandalized equipment. North Dakota crime lab officials notified investigators last month that DNA from a cigarette butt found at the scene was a match for Malcolm, whose DNA profile was on file from an earlier arrest.\n\nOhio\n\nSharonville: A man confused about state drug laws has called a police department demanding that officers return the small amount of marijuana they “stole” from him. WXIX-TV reports the man told a Sharonville police dispatcher in an expletive-laced call Tuesday that it’s legal to possess 100 grams of marijuana, and the amount officers seized was just 4 grams. Sharonville police posted a recording of the call on their Facebook page. The suburban Cincinnati department wryly noted: “People may be a bit in the weeds, so we would like to take this opportunity to clear the haze.” While some Ohio cities have decriminalized pot possession, it remains illegal in the state. Sharonville police said they “don’t make the rules” but must uphold them.\n\nOklahoma\n\nPerry: Hundreds of strangers have honored a 97-year-old World War II veteran who funeral home officials say died with no known surviving family. Motorcycles carrying U.S. flags were part of Wednesday’s service for Herman White, who died Aug. 11. White was buried next to his wife and son in Perry, 60 miles north of Oklahoma City. Funeral director Rebecca Raines, with Brown-Dugger Funeral Home, reached out to the community after learning White had no known surviving relatives. White married in 1941, joined the Navy in 1945 and served aboard the USS Muliphen in the Pacific. After the military, White returned to Oklahoma and worked in the oil and gas fields. The couple had a son in 1951. White’s wife died in 1998. Their son died in 1999.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Children with intellectual and developmental disabilities being attacked and locked up in isolation – this is what some kids from Oregon were subjected to after being sent to out-of-state facilities because of a lack of services in their home state. After investigations revealed deplorable conditions, Oregon is now bringing them back. A state senator at the forefront in the effort says it is critically important for Oregon to provide mental health services. Sen. Sara Gelser, a Democrat from Corvallis, says the Oregon Department of Human Services planned to have 120 children in out-of-state placements by the end of June. Instead, 37 children are in out-of-state facilities, down from as many as 88. Gelser said she wants the number at zero and for strong programs to be built in Oregon.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state will receive another $75 million in federal aid to fight the opioid-addiction crisis, money that Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration says will help with treatment, prevention and education. Wolf’s administration said Friday that about $56 million will go to the Department of Drug and Alcohol Programs. The money will also help extend programs designed to help people in addiction treatment find stable housing and to attract treatment professionals by helping repay their education loans. The state Department of Health received $8.4 million, a grant that is expected to repeat each of the next two years, while Philadelphia received $5.9 million, and Allegheny County received $5.2 million.\n\nRhode Island\n\nCranston: The organization that oversees high school sports in the state is asking overzealous parents to settle down because they are driving away qualified game officials. The executive director of the Rhode Island Interscholastic League tells WJAR-TV the primary reason the state has a shortage of referees and umpires is that officials don’t want to put up with obnoxious parents. In a letter to parents of high school athletes, Tom Mezzanotte wrote: “Yelling, screaming and berating the officials humiliates your child, annoys those sitting around you” and “embarrasses your child’s school.” He says the shortage of officials results in games being rescheduled, postponed or canceled. Softball umpire Susan Johnson says an angry parent drove toward a colleague’s car after a game before swerving away at the last second.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: An upstate school district has started work on a new $15 million building at its science center. WSPA-TV reports the Greenville County school district is constructing a building that will house exhibits on the water cycle and sustainable living, plus a cafeteria and several classrooms. The building is supposed to be complete in fall 2020 and replaces an unused outdoor amphitheater. The science center is owned by the school district, which is providing $12 million in funding. The Roper Mountain Science Center Association has raised the other $3 million privately. Exhibits were designed in collaboration with the Shi Center for Sustainability. The science center already has an observatory, planetarium, living history farm and other exhibit buildings.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPine Ridge: The Oglala Sioux Tribe has passed legislation aimed at hate crimes on the Pine Ridge reservation. The Rapid City Journal reports the law passed by the tribal council Wednesday makes hate crimes punishable with up to one year in jail, which is the maximum allowed under tribal law. The law defines a hate crime as one where the defendant intentionally targets a victim or property because of the actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability of any person. The law comes two months after the tribe legalized same-sex marriage on the reservation.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A priest who banned Harry Potter books from a Catholic school’s library was accused by parents of causing their children psychological and spiritual harm. A 2017 letter from 14 St. Edward Catholic School parents urged the Nashville diocese to remove the Rev. Dan Reehil. The letter, with 50 bullet points, said Reehil is a toxic narcissist who hates Pope Francis and views himself as “a soldier of God.” It said: “Our school, however, consists of children, not soldiers.” Diocesan spokesman Rick Musacchio said Reehil’s views, like that of the retired, more liberal pastor he replaced, both have homes in the church. Reehil didn’t respond to the Tennessean’s interview requests. In an email, he said he removed J.K. Rowling’s books because they contain “actual spells and curses.”\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A federal judge is expressing frustration that officials don’t seem to be honoring a settlement of a lawsuit over oppressive heat at some state prison facilities. During a court hearing Friday in Houston, U.S. District Judge Keith Ellison debated whether officials should be sanctioned by having them experience the same temperatures as inmates. Ellison delayed a ruling on possible sanctions until he’s heard from officials, including prison wardens, at a hearing Tuesday. Last year’s settlement resolved a lawsuit filed in 2014 over temperatures at the Wallace Pack Unit, about 95 miles northwest of Houston. Attorneys for the inmates say prison officials are not adhering to the settlement. A lawyer with the Texas Attorney General’s Office told Ellison officials are working to fix problems affecting the prisoners.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Conservative groups in the state have addressed school officials to disapprove of a new teacher instructional guide for sex education. The Deseret News reports Utah Eagle Forum was one of many groups that addressed the state Board of Education on Thursday criticizing the changes. Board officials say instructional guides were created addressing specific topics including sex education after new K-12 health standards were passed in April. Officials say teachers are now allowed to respond to student questions to provide medically accurate data and clarify or correct misinformation. Officials say the guide does not allow teachers to answer technique or how-to questions. Some parents say teachers should be encouraging students to speak to their parents, nurses or counselors and not expose other students to these types of questions or their answers.\n\nVermont\n\nStrafford: A river poisoned by a mine that dates to the United States’ early days is looking good two decades after cleanup began. Contractors working for the Environmental Protection Agency as part of the federal Superfund program are doing final work on the Elizabeth Mine in Strafford before turning it over to the state for long-term monitoring. The mine was once important enough to the economy of the young country that President James Monroe visited in 1817. It stayed in business for decades, feeding industrial, electrification and war efforts before closing in 1958. For decades, acid- and metal-contaminated water from the waste piles near the abandoned mine left local waterways almost dead. Now after the estimated $90 million cleanup, the state has changed the designation of the Ompompanoosuc River. It now supports aquatic life.\n\nVirginia\n\nAlexandria: Three couples planning to get married have filed a federal lawsuit challenging a state requirement that they disclose their race on their marriage application. Lawyer Victor Glasberg says that the requirement is a vestige of Jim Crow laws and that Virginia is one of only eight states requiring marriage applicants to disclose their race. According to the lawsuit, one Virginia county provided a list of more than 200 potential races to a couple who questioned the requirement. It included “American,” “Aryan,” “Moor” and “Mulatto.” A spokesman for Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring told the Richmond Times-Dispatch that the office will examine the complaint closely and determine how to proceed. Glasberg says he does not think Herring should defend the law.\n\nWashington\n\nColfax: The work of plowing, planting and harvesting is still done the old-fashioned way with teams of draft horses and mules on a parcel of farmland in eastern Washington. On Labor Day, several hundred spectators watched an annual, public demonstration of those methods near Colfax. A combine header pushed by a team of six Percheron draft mules fed cut grain into vintage wagons, each pulled by a pair of horses, as several acres of barley were harvested. Volunteers with the Palouse Empire Threshing Bee Association, a group dedicated to preserving the way land was farmed decades ago, took time away from their own harvest work to bring in the barley. Stan Riebold, a longtime member of the group, said it plans to continue preserving the old way of doing things.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nClarksburg: The city has approved an ordinance that would regulate a needle exchange run by the local health department. News outlets report the Clarksburg City Council voted Thursday to approve the final reading of the proposal, which would require those receiving needles to meet requirements that include submitting to blood tests and showing photo identification. Health department administrator Chad Bundy had expressed concerns with some of the ordinance’s provisions, including the photo ID requirement and limiting the program to Harrison County residents. City Attorney James Cann said prior to the meeting that he had reviewed the ordinance and found no legal problems. Clarksburg Mayor Ryan Kennedy has said the needle exchange program is “creating some negatives,” and officials want to eliminate those “while still retaining some positives.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Organizers say a campaign to encourage Midwestern millennials to move to the Badger State will continue despite a lack of funding from this year’s state budget. Democratic Gov. Tony Evers declined to grant the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp.’s request for $10 million over the next two years. The campaign that began in early 2018 was the brainchild of Evers’ Republican predecessor, Scott Walker. Wisconsin Public Radio reports WEDC officials say the organization has identified $4 million within its budget to fund the program this year and expects to do the same in 2020-21. Evers’ spokeswoman, Melissa Baldauff, says he is focused on developing infrastructure and communities to attract and retain a talented workforce. The campaign aims to attract workers ages 21 to 35 in science, technology, health care and financial services.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: The University of Wyoming has announced plans to honor the Black 14 after they were cut from the school’s football team for wanting to protest during the civil rights movement. The Casper Star-Tribune reports 14 student-athletes were dismissed for wanting to wear black armbands during a 1969 game against BYU in protest of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints’ then-policy barring black men from the priesthood. Athletic officials say nine of the living 11 members are expected back this week for the scheduled tribute. Officials say the weeklong commemoration includes a plaque presentation, football halftime recognition and a free public panel discussion. It could be the largest known contingent of the Black 14 on campus since they were dismissed 50 years ago.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/09/07/burlington-orphanage-abuse-police-investigate-survivors-stories/1225843002/", "title": "Orphanage abuse: Vermont authorities to investigate survivors' stories", "text": "READ THE LATEST HERE:St. Joseph's Orphanage abuse: Those 'responsible for the stewardship of this community failed,' Burlington mayor says\n\nLocal and state authorities plan to investigate the criminality of abuse against children at St. Joseph's Orphanage in Burlington that occurred decades ago.\n\nA joint state-local task force is to be announced 10 a.m. Monday at the Burlington Police Department, Vermont State Attorney General T.J. Donovan said Friday.\n\nThe probe, first reported by Seven Days, is planned in the wake of last week's massive Buzzfeed News article by reporter Christine Kenneally about child abuse at Roman Catholic orphanages during the 20th century.\n\nThe article, building on reporting done two decades ago by the Burlington Free Press, focused in large part on practices and incidents at the orphanage in Burlington, which closed in the 1970s. Survivors spoke of a boy thrown from a window to his death, of beatings by nuns, of a girl made to slap herself 50 times and of children being locked away for hours or days in the attic.\n\n\"I've driven by that place thousands of times,\" said Donovan, a native Burlingtonian. \"I went to Burlington High School a couple hundred yards away. This was a well-kept secret. I think we can say unequivocally that abuse occurred there.\"\n\nInvestigating allegations of murdered children \"is a priority,\" but it is not limited to those accusations, Donovan said.\n\n\"We will go where the evidence takes us,\" he said.\n\nWe Saw Nuns Kill Children: The Ghosts of St. Joseph's Catholic Orphanage\n\nAsked about a possible investigation Friday afternoon, Diocese of Burlington spokesperson Ellen Kane said this: “We have not been contacted. This is news to us.”\n\nShe referred a reporter to recent statements by Bishop Christopher Coyne, including one this week in which Coyne wrote that \"new revelations of scandalous and even criminal activity ... have deeply angered and shaken all of us.\"\n\nMore:3 takeaways from Bishop Coyne's blog about response to priest abuse scandal\n\nNo decisions have yet been made by officials including Mayor Miro Weinberger on how to proceed, Burlington Police Chief Brandon del Pozo said.\n\n\"Everything’s at its nascent stages,\" del Pozo said. \"The mayor has a real interest in making sure that if there were crimes that happened in his city, even decades ago, we do everything we can to account to victims and find out what actually happened.\"\n\nIn his own statement, Weinberger said, \"The allegations of abuse and violence at the former Burlington orphanage are horrific and demand investigation. The city has been reviewing options for formal action and we will be joining other civic leaders Monday morning to discuss our intentions with the public.\"\n\nCivil cases, but no prosecutions in 1990s\n\nSurvivors of abuse began to come forward a quarter-century ago, bringing court cases and speaking publicly about what they had suffered earlier in the 20th century at the hands of nuns and priests at the Roman Catholic facility on North Avenue.\n\nAs chronicled by Burlington Free Press reporter Sam Hemingway at the time, most of the court claims were quashed by judges because so many years had passed. A number of survivors did receive some level of monetary settlement and an apology from the Diocese of Burlington.\n\nBut no criminal investigations were opened in the 1990s, at a time years before the Boston Globe \"Spotlight\" investigation brought the realities of clergy sex abuse to the forefront of public awareness nationwide.\n\nNow, Donovan, Weinberger and del Pozo will pursue in some form the criminal investigation their predecessors chose not to two decades earlier.\n\n\"I think that we have to believe the victims, but we'll certainly do our job and look at the evidence,\" Donovan said.\n\nWhile Vermont authorities did not prosecute anyone associated with the St. Joseph's Orphanage abuse, they did prosecute some priests who in the early 2000s were accused of sexual abuse as the Catholic Church clergy abuse scandal unfolded.\n\nVermont and Pennsylvania attorneys general discuss grand jury report\n\nThat scandal came back into the limelight last month, when a Pennsylvania grand jury released a stunning report indicating some 300 priests in the state had abused about 1,000 people.\n\nDonovan said he's spoken to his Pennsylvania counterpart, Josh Shapiro, who oversaw the sending of subpoenas to Catholic dioceses in his state that fueled the grand jury's findings.\n\n\"I think there's a larger issue here of the Catholic Church being accountable for abusing vulnerable children,\" the Vermont attorney general said. \"Whether or not those cases can be proved, whether or not those cases can be prosecuted, certainly is one inquiry. But, the larger issue of accountability is something that needs to be addressed, and I look forward to working hopefully collaboratively with the church during this process.\"\n\nThe precise scope of the task force investigation -- and what subpoenas might be issued -- remains unclear, pending Monday's news conference in Burlington.\n\n\"I’m incredibly troubled by those allegations,\" Donovan said. \"We know that Vermont’s not immune from this. We’ve dealt with these issues in the past.”\n\nMore:Reporting on the St. Joseph's Orphanage abuse: 'It just cried out for attention'\n\n'Justice still hasn't been done'\n\nIn a video conversation between reporters Kenneally and Hemingway hosted by the Burlington Free Press, they talked of how St. Joseph's Orphanage abuse survivors were rebuffed for the most part after coming forward.\n\n\"It’s one of the great tragedies,\" Hemingway said of civil cases that the Diocese of Burlington successfully fended off. \"One, it didn’t settle anything for the diocese. They had suffered a wicked black eye in the process.\"\n\nAs for the survivors, \"These people brought forward these claims and wound up basically abused again, this time by the court system.\"\n\nSays Kenneally: \"Justice still hasn’t been done. Justice needs to be done for these people. The record is there.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/09/07"}]}

In the first four days of April, the US House of Representatives (once again and narrowly) passed a bill to decriminalize marijuana and then, days later, (overwhelmingly) approved legislation to ease barriers to cannabis research. In addition, Maryland lawmakers voted to put an adult-use cannabis measure on their state’s November ballot; New Mexico became the latest state to begin recreational sales; and this Thursday, New Jersey will start selling recreational cannabis.\n\nThe full-scale legalization of cannabis in America feels like it’s closer than ever: More states have passed recreational-use laws; comprehensive legislation is gaining attention – and votes – in Congress; and the industry continues to steamroll to maturity with a stream of mega-mergers, high value investments and steady sales.\n\nA worker trims leaves of young cannabis plants in a greenhouse at a Cresco Labs Inc. facility in Indiantown, Florida, on Monday, March 28, 2022. Eva Marie Uzcategui/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\n“The fact that the House of Representatives has passed [the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act] in two successive sessions of Congress really is a sign that the end of federal prohibition is drawing near,” said Steven Hawkins, president and chief executive officer of the US Cannabis Council, a trade and lobbying organization.\n\nHowever, while this is an industry that has long held a “not if, but when” belief toward legalization, what’s viewed as inevitable is not necessarily imminent. The MORE Act, which mustered only three Republican votes, is not expected to succeed in the Senate. Additionally, a separate legalization bill that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is expected to introduce this summer also might not garner the 60 votes needed to pass.\n\n“In terms of passage of either [bill], it’s still a tough path ahead in the Senate,” Hawkins said. “But we’re not ruling anything out.”\n\nA $27 billion industry\n\nThe absence of federal legalization has not slowed down one of the fastest-growing industries in the United States.\n\nThe cannabis industry reeled in an estimated $27 billion in sales in 2021, up 35% from 2020, according to data released earlier this month by MJBiz, a cannabis trade publication and events organizer. And in the next five years, it projects sales will nearly double.\n\n“Right now, over 425,000 jobs in the economy are tied to the cannabis industry. With that, we see the continued increase for public support for legalization,” Hawkins said. “And we continue to see both red and blue states pass laws to legalize cannabis for either adult or medical use.”\n\nAs more states allow for cannabis sales, companies within the budding industry aren’t waiting for federal law changes to stake their claim.\n\nCresco Labs' Sunnyside store in Buffalo Grove, IL. Daniel Pels/courtesy Cresco Labs\n\nIn the past year, there have been a couple of multibillion-dollar mergers. The latest: Cresco’s $2.1 billion acquisition of Columbia Care (CCHWF). If the deal closes as expected in the fourth quarter, the combined company would have upward of 120 retail locations and dozens of facilities in 17 states and Washington, D.C.\n\n“It sets us up very well if federal change happens any time soon,” Cresco CEO Charlie Batchell told CNN Business in an interview.\n\nOther paths to legal reform\n\nMore than two-thirds of US states have legalized cannabis in some capacity: Of the 37 that have medical marijuana laws, 18 of them have recreational cannabis laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. And more could be on the way. States such as Delaware, New Hampshire and Rhode Island are debating recreational cannabis legalization. Petition drives and legislative efforts for medical marijuana programs are also underway in states such as Kansas, Nebraska, North Carolina and South Carolina, said Karen O’Keefe, director of state policies for the Marijuana Policy Project, a lobbying and advocacy organization.\n\nOne huge step toward broader reform is the Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act, which would make it easier for cannabis businesses to access banking services. Because marijuana remains illegal in the eyes of the federal government, and despite 2014 guidance from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, some financial institutions have been wary of serving cannabis-related businesses for fear of violating anti-money laundering laws.\n\nThe SAFE Act bill is gaining momentum in Congress and is now in a good position to become law, Hawkins said.\n\nBeyond making it easier for financial institutions to work with cannabis businesses, the SAFE Banking Act has long been touted as a public safety measure.

Ed Perlmutter first introduced the legislation five years ago following deadly robberies at cash-only dispensaries.\n\nRe-upping those safety concerns after another recent stretch of criminal activity at dispensaries, Perlmutter asked Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to “put the muscle of the administration behind getting it passed.” Yellen responded that she was in support of the bill, in an exchange first reported by Marijuana Moment.\n\nPens featuring a marijuana leaf are pictured on a table at the Cannabis World Congress & Business Exposition (CWCBExpo) in New York City, November 5, 2021. Carlo Allegri/Reuters\n\nOther reforms, and even full-on legalization could come via other means, however, including the Farm Bill, said Rep. David Scott, chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, in a tweet last month. Scott pushed for the Farm Bill to include a provision that would “eliminate barriers for small businesses and Black entrepreneurs to start legal cannabis companies under state law.”\n\nBut all these piecemeal approaches to legalization could end up backfiring, said South Carolina Republican Representative Nancy Mace.\n\nMace last year introduced the States Reform Act, a bill that seeks to decriminalize cannabis, have it federally regulated like alcohol, impose a 3% excise tax, let states determine their own approaches and programs toward cannabis, and open up the doors to banking.\n\n“It’s bad enough you get a multibillion-dollar industry operating in cash. That’s dangerous,” she said.\n\nBills that approach a singular issue like banking or research risk not passing muster in court, she said.\n\n“That’s my fear. One, we do it right, constitutionally,” she said. “And, two, if we do a small piece of it, we’re not going to touch it for 20 years.”\n\nAn equitable industry\n\nPolicymakers and industry members also should not lose sight of how individuals, especially people of color, continue to be criminalized for activities that are now legal at the state level, said Amber Littlejohn, CEO of the Minority Cannabis Business Association.\n\n“First and foremost, we need to get people out of prison, and we need to stop arresting people for doing things that folks are making lots of money doing,” she said.\n\nNationwide, Black people are 3.6 times more likely than White people to be arrested for a cannabis-related reason, despite similar usage rates, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nPeople of color also face tremendous barriers operating within the industry. Attempts have been made to create paths into the industry for those with non-violent marijuana convictions whose communities were negatively impacted from the War on Drugs. But these efforts have largely been unsuccessful due to of state policies that limit licenses, fail to offer financial and business resources to people of color and that benefit deeper-pocketed multistate operators, Littlejohn said.\n\n“I think one of the biggest problems is there seems to be an incredible disconnect between what people say they support and believe in and what [becomes law],” she said. “It’s up to us, the collective us, to be holding folks accountable.”\n\nCannabis in the Land of Enchantment\n\nIn New Mexico, the cannabis industry could generate more than $300 million annually in sales and $50 million in tax revenue over the next 12 months, as well as create 11,000 new jobs within the state in the next five years, according to Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s office.\n\nBetween April 1-3, the first weekend of legal adult-use sales in New Mexico, cannabis retailers sold more than $5.2 million worth of recreational and medical products, Grisham said.\n\nParin Kumar, CEO and co-owner of the newly opened Vana Society cannabis store in Clovis, on the state’s eastern border, said she has been seeing a steady stream of customers.\n\nA Vana Society cannabis retail store in New Mexico. Courtesy Vana Society\n\nFor small towns like Clovis that have been looking to diversify their economy, the burgeoning industry is a boon, expected to bring new jobs and tax revenue.\n\n“Especially in communities like Clovis, the buildings, the infrastructure, the school need help, this definitely can do a lot for the community economically, ” Kumar said. “It feels like we’re giving back.”", "authors": ["Alicia Wallace"], "publish_date": "2022/04/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/crime/2015/11/07/doing-away-cash-bail/74619298/", "title": "Will Delaware end cash bail?", "text": "Jessica Masulli Reyes\n\nThe News Journal\n\nAbout 60 men and women, wearing the clothes they were arrested in hours earlier and shackled at their ankles and wrists, shuffled one at a time up to the judge who would decide whether they should be released from the Washington, D.C., jail.\n\nA new case was heard every three minutes. And cash bail had nothing to do with defendants' ticket to freedom.\n\nThose charged with nonviolent crimes were set free on the promise they would appear at the next court hearing – including an accused drug dealer, a cocaine user, a thief and a string of others.\n\nThose considered the most dangerous – such as a man arrested for not having a license for the .42-caliber pistol in his car – were sent back to jail to await trial.\n\nThis is the changing face of American jurisprudence, where releasing a defendant from jail is not based on how much money he or she can pay. The movement stands on the notion that cash bail punishes the poor, who end up spending more time behind bars than those with the means to pay for their release.\n\nWashington, D.C., eliminated bail two decades ago, and other jurisdictions may soon follow – either by choice or as a result of federal lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of incarcerating poor defendants who cannot afford bail.\n\nThe bail system in Delaware is now under scrutiny as Delaware's Supreme Court Chief Justice Leo E. Strine Jr. shines a light on the disproportionate number of African-Americans incarcerated and Gov. Jack Markell calls for criminal justice reform while examining ways to reduce prison overcrowding.\n\n\"It's not working when a single mom gets stuck in detention because she can't come up with a hundred bucks and has little to no family support, but a dangerous drug dealer can get his minions to bail him out,\" Markell said during a speech on criminal justice reform Thursday in New Orleans. \"Our bail process needs to change, and it can be done, but only if we're cognizant of the full extent to which everyone involved in our criminal justice system must adjust their thinking.\"\n\nAt a hearing in Wilmington on Friday for the Access to Justice Commission's Committee on Fairness, experts in criminal law will push for Delaware to adopt Washington, D.C.'s strategy.\n\nAbout 88 percent of the District of Columbia's released defendants return for their trials – partially because of an elaborate pretrial services system where defendants are required to frequently check in, undergo drug tests and, in some cases, wear GPS ankle monitors.\n\nCourt officials in Delaware could not provide statistics on the number of defendants who show up for court cases after being released. But commercial bail bondsman say eliminating bail here would be disastrous. A defendant who makes bail is able to quickly get back to his or her daily routine, bail bondsmen say. And if a defendant doesn't show up for court, the bail bondsman has a financial incentive to find the defendant without cost to taxpayers, they say.\n\n\"We have check-ins; we make sure our clients are working,\" said Wilmington bail bondsman Robert Bovell. \"That is something the court wouldn't have the manpower or the time to do. You'd have to start to worry about who is really watching over these individuals.\"\n\nSupporters of bail reform say only the most dangerous defendants should be held for trial. Delaware has a unified prison system, which means inmates who cannot post bail are housed in the same prisons as those who are convicted.\n\nMarkell and Department of Corrections Commissioner Robert Coupe say releasing low-risk defendants into community supervision is a way to ease prison overcrowding, noting that last year Wilmington's Howard R. Young Correctional Institution had to house inmates in its gymnasium.\n\nThe number of people being held in Delaware prisons while awaiting trial has skyrocketed since the early 1980s. There were 300 held in 1983 – and 1,339 held in 2014.\n\nCurrently, about 23 percent of the state's prisoners are held while cases are pending. The number jumps to 40 percent at the Baylor Women's Correctional Institution.\n\nBail reform efforts started in 2011 have contributed to a 3 percent reduction in the total prison population since last year, Markell said. Efforts include determining which defendants in custody on less than $10,000 bail could be safely released.\n\n\"I believe our judges and our prosecutors recognize the big-picture criminal justice challenges we face and the need for change,\" Markell said. \"But it will take time to shift the long-standing practices of defaulting to setting secured or cash bail in too many cases.\"\n\nLawsuits prompt reform\n\nThe American bail system is firmly rooted in court systems nationwide, but a reform movement is advocating for an ambitious overhaul. Four states have already gotten rid of the for-profit bail industry, including Kentucky where judges are now limited to the amount of bail they can set for crimes that would likely result only in a probationary sentence. Bail is administered through the court system there.\n\nNew Jersey voters last year approved a constitutional amendment that allows judges to deny release to some defendants considered dangerous or a flight risk and makes release the default for all others.\n\nIn October, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio launched \"Bail Lab,\" a program aimed at testing alternatives to bail and pushing for reform.\n\nIn Delaware, legislation is pending that could add to the list of serious felony crimes for which a defendant can be denied bail – a move advocates say can, if done correctly, ensures high-risk defendants are not getting out on low bails. Other legislative proposals could be coming next year.\n\nBut, some civil rights lawyers are not leaving bail reform to chance.\n\nClanton, Alabama, was hit in January with a federal lawsuit challenging money bail as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The case drew widespread attention when the U.S. Department of Justice filed a brief saying holding people solely because they are poor is unconstitutional.\n\nRather than fight, the city agreed to release most misdemeanor defendants without them posting bail.\n\nAlec Karakatsanis – a Harvard Law School graduate and co-founder of Equal Justice Under Law – has since filed eight more class-action suits that have led to similar changes in Missouri, Mississippi and Louisiana.\n\n\"We are prepared, of course, to go around the country and sue city after city, county after county, but I prefer not to do that, but these systems are tremendously powerful,\" Karakatsanis said during a recent speaking engagement in Delaware.\n\nSimilar cases challenging the bail system could easily go to the U.S. Supreme Court, said Gloria J. Browne-Marshall, an associate professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City.\n\n\"There hasn't been a case regarding bail, and what excessive bail means, for decades,\" she said. \"This is a prime time for a case to be brought to the Supreme Court.\"\n\nTaken out of circulation\n\nData from 2010 shows that about 40 percent of those held in Delaware prisons awaiting trial are there for nonviolent felonies, and about 12 percent have a main charge that is a drug offense.\n\nAdvocates for bail reform say many of these individuals could be released, and if necessary, monitored by the state's pretrial services to ensure they return to court. For defendants being held on bail, sometimes the fastest way to get out of prison is often to plead guilty, which puts them at a disadvantage in their cases, advocates say.\n\n\"There are real problems with depending as heavily as most states do on money bail,\" said Stephanos Bibas, a professor of law and criminology at Penn Law, who will testify at the Access to Justice hearing.\n\nJonathan Wilson, 44, has seen firsthand – both in his own life and in the lives of men he counsels – the struggles of not being able to afford bail.\n\nHe is now a doctoral student at Wilmington University and founder of the Fathership Foundation. He has been arrested over a dozen times, he said, on charges such as robbery and drug offenses. One time more than a decade ago he was arrested in Philadelphia.\n\n\"I had a bail that was $1,500,\" he said. \"I had the money at home, but my mother said, 'No, I'm not going down there.' I sat there for three months until I could get somebody to go to my mother's house to get the money, go down to court and pay the bail.\"\n\nWilson believes detainees who are not dangerous should be released.\n\n\"Every day, every hour you are in there, something is going downhill on the outside,\" he said. \"You are taken out of circulation. If you have to pick up your kids every day at 4, that isn't going to happen. If you have bills to pay, it isn't going to happen.\"\n\nThe price of freedom\n\nDelaware's bail system is grounded in the state's Constitution. Only defendants charged with capital murder can be held without bail; all others are left to the judge's discretion.\n\nThose choices play out every day in Delaware courtrooms. The price of freedom this past week was $410,000 cash bail for a man accused of accidentally shooting of a 6-year-old girl, $30,000 cash bail for a man accused of having a loaded handgun under his hotel room mattress and $27,500 cash bail for a 20-year-old Bear man accused of having 40 grams of marijuana and other drugs. The Bear man is the only one who has been released.\n\n\"Bail is not about punishment,\" Delaware Chief Magistrate Alan Davis said. \"We are prohibited by U.S. Supreme Court decisions from making bail excessive.\"\n\nThere are four types of bail. Two of the least restrictive options allow a defendant to be released on their promise to come back or to pay only if they do not show up for future court appearances.\n\nSecured bail requires a defendant or someone on their behalf to post either cash or property for the dollar amount of bail. In most cases, a relative pays a bail bondsman a small percent of the bail amount, and the bondsman then pays an insurance company to post the bond. Bondsmen typically charge 10 percent of the bail amount to post the bond.\n\nCash bail requires a person post only cash, and the bondsman typically charges the defendant 20 to 30 percent of the bond amount.\n\nBail money is returned to an individual at the conclusion of a case as long as he or she appeared for court. If not, the court can cash in the insurance policy.\n\n85 percent are released\n\nThe concept of bail does not exist in any D.C. courtroom or federal courtrooms in Delaware and around the nation.\n\n\"If they are not a risk, if they are not charged with a dangerous offense, then they shouldn't be held, even pending the first court appearance,\" said Cliff Keenan, the director of pretrial services in Washington, D.C. \"The judges, the prosecutors, the community, by and large, all agree that this is the better way to do business, rather than relying on commercial bail as a condition of release.\"\n\nThe result is that cases move swiftly once someone is arrested in Washington.\n\nCertain minor offenses, including urinating in public and disorderly conduct, do not require an appearance before a judge. All other defendants are transported to the lockup in the district's bustling Superior Court building just blocks away from the Washington Monument.\n\nThere they meet any time – day or night – with a pretrial services employee who gathers information that will be used by the judge to make a decision on their release. At the same time, a prosecutor reviews the facts of the case to see if the charge will stick.\n\nFor those cases prosecutors decide can go forward, the defendant goes before a judge who determines release or detention. About 85 percent of those arrested are released. The D.C. Pretrial Services Agency supervised 13,850 defendants in 2014 – about 4,100 on any given day.\n\nUnlike in Delaware, a prosecutor and defense attorney are present for the initial hearing.\n\nLast week in Washington, an African-American man stood in a white hoodie and sagging jeans to ask for his release. Just hours earlier, he was arrested for possessing cocaine and paraphernalia.\n\n\"If I release you, you have to report, or we will have to hold you,\" the judge said as he ordered the man to report to pretrial services once a week, and to undergo regular drug tests until the conclusion of his case.\n\nThe man nodded, and was whisked aside to have his handcuffs removed.\n\n'We are not superstars'\n\nThose opposed to changing the bail system say the District of Columbia should not be seen as a model. That is because the district spends about $60 million per year on pretrial services and employs 350 people – an unrealistic expenditure for a state like Delaware that does not have the same level of federal funding.\n\nKeenan said cost savings associated with having less people in prison can be rolled over into pretrial services.\n\nCoupe, who runs Delaware's prison system that spends $277 million annually, said the state could save money by reducing the overall population. Taxpayers spend $99 per day, or $36,232 annually, to house each inmate.\n\nNicholas Wachinski, the chief executive officer of Lexington National, an insurance company that underwrites bail bonds, said the D.C. system is costly and does not lead to prison population reductions. He said low-end defendants released are the most likely to skip court appearances.\n\nBail bondsman are on the front lines of community corrections, Wachinski said.\n\n\"Their offices are in the community; they live in the communities they serve. That is why they work so well with the people they bail out. We will lose that for the replacement of a governmental agency taking that over.\"\n\nChristina Brigandi of Dover, a bail bondsman at 1st Choice Bail Bonds in Delaware, agrees.\n\nHer phone rings constantly, often with panicked parents calling to get their children who were just arrested out of prison – or to retrieve kids still sitting at police headquarters, before they go into a cell at a state institution.\n\nWhen she's not on the phone, Brigandi is driving between courthouses in Georgetown, Dover and Wilmington to meet clients – or searching streets for defendants on the run from the law.\n\n\"It's not like what you see on TV,\" she said. \"We are not superstars; we are just trying to get people out of jail on bail, and then we follow through to make sure they come back to court. It is costing nobody any money but us.\"\n\nThose who want change, though, say the true cost is borne by defendants who must scrape together their life savings to pay a bail bondsman – or who sit in prison awaiting a trial, only to eventually have the charges dropped.\n\n\"At this point in 2015, the only people significantly opposed to pretrial reform is the for-profit bail industry,\" said Cherise Fanno Burdeen, executive director of the Pretrial Justice Institute in Maryland. \"It is a lucrative business, but it can change if the public becomes educated.\"\n\nOn the cusp of change\n\nFanno Burdeen said she is confident Delaware is on the cusp of bail reform.\n\nPretrial services in Delaware are on the rise, but still have a ways to go. In New Castle County, there are 367 defendants being monitored – three times what it was seven years ago.\n\nStatewide, about 523 people are being monitored, putting a strain on the system.\n\n\"We are taxing them,\" said Judge Davis, who favors the change as long as Delaware's pretrial services are properly funded. \"If we implemented a system where we could use it as it should be used, how it is used in other jurisdictions, we could overwhelm them [pretrial services] in a weekend.\"\n\nBaylor prison: Women find new way in this cell block\n\nTo help with the burden, the state partnered with the Rick Van Story Resource Center in Wilmington, a mental health and substance abuse recovery facility. About 40 pretrial defendants have been sent there for monitoring since 2013, according to Heather Zwickert, supervisor of the Department of Correction's New Castle County Pretrial Services Unit.\n\nThe center is a place where defendants get assistance in dealing with their criminal case while also receiving help with other aspects of life – be it a hot meal or counseling.\n\nThe DOC is looking for even more defendants who could benefit from that type of setting. One pilot program is reviewing non-violent defendants in New Castle County who are in custody on less than $10,000 bail to see if any can be safely released into the community.\n\n\"The target audience that we are looking for is individuals whose needs outweigh the risk to the community,\" Coupe said. \"I see the future of pretrial continuing to grow.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the nonprofit Delaware Center for Justice won a two-year federal grant called Smart Pretrial Demonstration Initiative. The initiative, which has brought together prosecutors, public defenders, judges and others in the criminal justice system, is currently gathering and analyzing Delaware data that will then be used to guide the path of pretrial services.\n\n\"The challenge that every pretrial system faces is making sure the right people are being detained and that the right people are being released with effective monitoring,\" said Kate Parker West, coordinator for Smart Pretrial at the Delaware Center for Justice.\n\nAdvocates in Delaware and nationwide say that bail review isn't just about cost savings, but is about restoring faith in the criminal justice system.\n\n\"There is a tremendous sense that the legal system is not there to do justice; it is there to do injustice, to control people, to oppress people,\" said Karakatsanis, the civil rights lawyer. \"We have a lot of work to do in our communities to make our courts somewhere where justice is done, as opposed to places where trauma, pain and injustice are inflicted.\"\n\nContact Jessica Masulli Reyes at 302-324-2777, jmreyes@delawareonline.com or Twitter @JessicaMasulli.\n\nEfforts in Delaware to reform pretrial detention:\n\n• Pretrial risk assessment – a tool to help judges gauge defendants' flight risk and likelihood of re-arrest when deciding on release – was implemented statewide in 2013. State officials are working to validate the assessment.\n\n• Another pilot program is reviewing non-violent defendants in New Castle County who are in custody on less than $10,000 bail to see if any can be safely released into the community.\n\n• The nonprofit Delaware Center for Justice won a two-year federal grant called Smart Pretrial Demonstration Initiative. They are spearheading a group of prosecutors, public defenders, judges and others in the criminal justice system to gather data that will then be used to help make decisions about releasing defendants.\n\n• Pretrial services, which provides information about defendants to the judge to use in making risk determinations and supervises defendants who are released, is expanding under the Department of Correction. The number of defendants being monitored in New Castle County is 367 – three times what it was seven years ago.\n\nHearing schedule\n\nThe Access to Justice Commission's Committee on Fairness in the Criminal Justice System will conduct a series of informational hearings and public forums. They will be held:\n\n• Nov. 13 at the Chase Center on the Riverfront, 815 Justison St. in Wilmington. Experts will focus on bail and pretrial detention from 9:30 to 11:30 a.m.; charging, plea bargaining decisions and sentencing from 12:30 to 2:30 p.m.; and policing strategies that have worked elsewhere from 3 to 5 p.m. Public comment will not be accepted.\n\n• Public comment will be accepted from 6:30 to 8 p.m. at four locations: Dec. 1 at First State Community Action Agency, 308 N. Railroad Avenue in Georgetown; Dec. 2 at Middletown High, 120 Silver Lake Road in Middletown; Dec. 8 at Howard High, 401 E. 12th St. in Wilmington; Dec. 9 at William Henry Middle School, 65 Carver Road in Dover.\n\nThose interested in offering comment at the public forums can preregister at courts.delaware.gov/supreme/accessform.stm.

Mayor Randall Woodfin and community leaders in the Bush Hills neighborhood on Tuesday announced the Don’t be a D.U.M.M.Y. campaign – “Dumping Ugly Mess in My Yard.” The mayor and people in various Birmingham communities are tired of illegal trash dumping, WBRC-TV reports. “People are too comfortable dumping in our city. Whether they live here or bring it into the city, we want to make something clear and simple for folks: That is illegal,” Woodfin said. He wants residents to report any illegal dumping by calling 311. They can take video or pictures of people or their vehicles and go to the city magistrate’s office to sign out warrants for their arrest, he urged. First-time offenders will face a $500 fine. For a second or subsequent offense, it doubles to $1,000.\n\nAlaska\n\nFairbanks: A federal appeals court has reversed the dismissal of a lawsuit filed by four men who contend they were illegally imprisoned for nearly two decades. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday overturned a lower court ruling that dismissed a lawsuit by the “Fairbanks Four” against the city, KTVF-television reports. George Frese, Kevin Pease, Marvin Roberts and Eugene Vent were convicted of murder in the 1997 death of Fairbanks teenager John Hartman. The men spent 18 years in prison while they asserted their innocence and appealed their convictions. After a five-week hearing that re-examined the cases in detail and presented the case that others killed Hartman, the convictions were vacated in December 2015. The four men sued the city for wrongful imprisonment and said an agreement that led to their release, in which they agreed not to sue, was not legally binding because they were coerced.\n\nArizona\n\nMesa: Alice Cooper’s Solid Rock Teen Center is expanding into the city. The legendary rocker and his wife, Sheryl Cooper, were at Westwood High School on Wednesday to announce a partnership with Mesa Public Schools. They projected a summer 2020 opening of a second Solid Rock Teen Center in a former elementary school downtown. Alice Cooper’s Solid Rock Teen Centers will fund the renovations and provide more than $100,000 worth of music, arts and dance programming to youth ages 12 to 20 and the local community. The Mesa center grew out of the Hall of Famer’s annual Rock & Roll Fundraising Bash at Las Sendas Golf Club in east Mesa. The original Solid Rock Teen Center opened in 2012 in Phoenix, built in partnership with Genesis Church and Cooper’s Solid Rock Foundation after more than a decade of fundraising.\n\nArkansas\n\nJonesboro: Residents celebrated a street being renamed in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. this week after months of contentious debate. About 100 people gathered Monday at the intersection of Commerce and Highland Drives to witness a new street sign’s unveiling after a parade and program on Arkansas State University’s campus to commemorate King’s legacy. “The question is asked occasionally, do we still need to celebrate Dr. King’s holiday? If you followed the efforts this year to get a street name in the honor of Dr. King in Jonesboro and some of the language used in the debate and editorials, you realize there still remains a need for programs like this,” the Rev. Ray Scales said. Emma Agnew, president of Craighead County’s National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, encouraged the audience to register to vote at the event, asking them to consider those who died fighting for the right to vote and to take their legacy seriously.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: A push to pass first-in-the-nation proposals to limit single-use plastic containers and other items drew support from actor Jeff Goldblum on Wednesday. Environmental groups hail California’s proposal as a landmark attempt to cut down on 75% of waste from plastic items like takeout boxes, food containers and utensils. The bills aim to achieve the target within a decade. “I feel like we’re on the brink of accomplishing something,” Goldblum said, likening the proposal to President John F. Kennedy’s 1961 moon-shot speech. The two bills, one in the Assembly and another in the Senate, would require companies to reduce single-use packaging as much as possible by 2024 and ensure products made or imported into California after 2030 are recyclable or can be composted. Goldblum and advocates met with representatives from Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office and lawmakers at the Capitol. They delivered signed letters of support from January Jones, Ted Danson, and other actors and activists.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Immigration and customs officials violated federal law by refusing to release documents about people who are not citizens, a Colorado federal court judge said. The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement used the rule to deny the release of records at least 333 times between July 2017 and April 2019, The Denver Post reports. The court ordered ICE to change its nationwide standard operating procedure and comply with the Freedom of Information Act. The case started in 2013 in Glenwood Springs when attorney Jennifer Smith requested documents about her client, but ICE refused to release them because the client was deemed a fugitive, authorities said. Releasing the documents could help people evade immigration enforcement, ICE officials said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A new economic action plan will be rolled out in the state that will include incentives to attract employers to its cities and promote the growth of women- and minority-owned businesses, according to a top state official. David Lehman, commissioner of economic and community development, announced a strong push will be coming to create hubs of innovation in the manufacturing, health care, insurance and bio-science industries, the Hartford Courant reports. Lehman said there is an effort to focus these innovations in cities and strengthen networks that will be enough for Connecticut to become competitive among larger cities like Boston and New York. Since the last recession, the state has struggled to regain jobs, with the latest count showing just 85% have been added back. Lehman said Gov. Ned Lamont will roll out a plan in the coming weeks that he hopes will answer and resolve a lot of the state’s economic and development issues.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A proposal by Democratic state lawmakers to outlaw homemade “ghost guns,” which can’t be traced by law enforcement agents because they don’t have serial numbers or are fashioned from parts created with 3D printers, has cleared its first legislative hurdle. A Democrat-led House committee voted to release the bill Wednesday after an hourlong public hearing, although its chief sponsor, House Majority Leader Valerie Longhurst, said she plans to amend the bill after meeting Tuesday with representatives of the National Rifle Association. Longhurst said her amendments would include a phase-in date by which owners of existing guns would have to obtain serial numbers for their weapons, exempting muzzle loaders and replicas of antique firearms, and allowing licensed firearms dealers to legally handle gun parts that do not have serial numbers.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Despite months of protest from students, faculty and parents, the chancellor for D.C. Public Schools announced Thursday that Washington Met will close at the end of the school year, WUSA-TV reports. The news prompted a group of students to walk out of class Thursday morning in protest, chanting “Save Washington Met!” and carrying signs noting, “School closures disproportionately happen to black and brown communities.” Chancellor Lewis Ferebee’s originally announcement Nov. 26 of a proposal to close the school was met with outrage from some stakeholders. He cited low enrollment and achievement compared to DCPS’ three other opportunity academies. The district hosted two community forums to gather feedback and gave the public a chance to provide input until Dec. 20, which critics said was not nearly enough time.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The state House on Wednesday moved to repeal a powerful commission charged with placing constitutional amendments before voters. On a 93-25 vote, the House sent the joint resolution to the Senate. If the Senate also approves, it would send the matter to voters in November. The Constitution Revision Commission was established in 1968 and meets once every 20 years to consider measures to put before the state’s electorate. “Maybe it served a valid purpose at one time,” said Rep. Brad Drake, a Republican. “Their purpose was to make revisions to the constitution, not to become policy makers – that’s our job.” The commission last met in 2018 and placed seven measures on the ballot – all of which were approved by voters. Among those was a ban on offshore oil and gas drilling and vaping in enclosed indoor workplaces. Another measure barred public officials from lobbying for compensation while in office and six years thereafter.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Proposed budget cuts could mean fewer state troopers on the road, fewer lawyers defending poor people and fewer probation officers, state agency heads told lawmakers Wednesday as budget hearings continued. Gov. Brian Kemp has proposed overall increases to the state budget, mostly based on higher pay for teachers; increased funding for K-12 schools, colleges and universities; and higher spending on the state-federal Medicaid health insurance program. But Kemp has proposed more than $200 million in cuts to other agencies for the remainder of the current budget year and more for the budget year beginning July 1. Department of Public Safety Commissioner Col. Mark McDonough told lawmakers he would leave 55 trooper positions open in the 2021 budget year and warned that “a reduction in troopers on the roadways equates to an increase in fatalities.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: The Solid Waste Advisory Committee in the state has proposed a plan that includes 82 waste management recommendations covering nine programs. The committee also heard recommendations at a public hearing in Hilo on Tuesday, West Hawaii Today reports. The committee made recommendations including to conduct public awareness campaigns, regularly review the West Hawaii Sanitary Landfill contract and conduct more household hazardous waste collection events, officials said. Some residents also made recommendations to the committee. “The key approach to landfill reduction is public education,” said Melody Euaparadorn of Zero Waste Big Island. Members of the Sierra Club’s Hawaii Island Group said the committee should enact a disposal fee on all purchased products at the point of purchase, an environmental impact fee on tourists and negotiations for an end date with Waste Management Inc., which operates the West Hawaii landfill.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state’s residents wouldn’t have to fall back or spring ahead for daylight saving time under legislation introduced Thursday. The House State Affairs Committee voted to introduce the measure brought forward by Republican Rep. Christy Zito. She said the twice-a-year time change was a safety hazard that caused temporary jet lag leading to injuries among motorists and pedestrians. She said it also increased the chances of strokes and heart attacks. Zito introduced similar legislation last year, but it failed in the full House on a 55-15 vote. A similar fate is expected this year, and there was some mirth among lawmakers on the committee. “At this point, it seems like the only one who can mess with time is God,” said Rep. Vito Barbieri, who is in favor of ending daylight saving time and moved to approve introducing the bill. “We’re going to try again.” Zito acknowledged getting the bill signed is a long shot but said it’s high on the list of what her roral constituents want.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Grant funds will provide nearly $30 million for efforts across the state to acquire open spaces and develop and improve recreational facilities. Gov. J.B. Pritzker released the list of 85 projects late last week. They will receive $29.7 million from the Open Space Land Acquisition and Development program through the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. “Investments in local park projects are good for families and recreation enthusiasts, helping them enjoy outdoor activities and making Illinois communities better places to live and work,” Pritzker said in a statement. OSLAD money supports up to half of a project’s cost. With local matching funds, the grant awards will cover $56 million in park developments and open-space land purchases. OSLAD, begun in 1987, receives funding from a portion of the state’s Real Estate Transfer Tax.\n\nIndiana\n\nCrown Point: Work is underway for a war memorial that was delayed for years by the Great Recession after the 2008 financial crisis. Crews began clearing trees last week in Crown Point for the memorial, which will feature three separate monuments: one for World War I veterans, another for World War II veterans and one for victims of the Holocaust. The two war memorials will be placed at opposite ends of a long walkway lined with plaques with information giving visitors a clearer understanding of the events between the two wars, The (Northwest Indiana) Times reports. Mitch Barloga, president of the Friends of Veterans Memorial Parkway, says the goal is to have the memorial finished by 2021 or no later than 2022.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state will become the latest to create an organization within state government designed to prevent school shootings under a plan announced Tuesday by Gov. Kim Reynolds. Reynolds said she’s creating a Governor’s School Safety Bureau within the Iowa Department of Public Safety. It would cost $2 million to start and $1.5 million annually to operate, and Reynolds said she’s included needed funding in her legislative budget request. “News headlines about school shootings and threats at unsuspecting communities across America are becoming all too common,” she said. “Although those headlines don’t often involve schools in Iowa, we can’t wait until they do to act.” Full-time bureau instructors will train local law enforcement officers and school staff in identifying and responding quickly in a consistent way. Reynolds’ plan calls for hiring two additional state agents with cyber training to identify and address early threats.\n\nKansas\n\nHutchinson: The family of astronaut Neil Armstrong, the first man to step on the moon, has donated two items that were aboard the Apollo 11 mission in 1969 to the Cosmosphere space museum in Hutchinson. Armstrong’s two sons donated a 4-by-6-inch U.S. flag and a small piece of fabric from the wing of the Wright Flyer, the first flying machine built by the Wright brothers, the museum announced Wednesday. The piece of fabric was in the lunar module when it touched down on the moon, the museum said. Neil Armstrong died in 2012. “When I visited the Cosmosphere in 2019, it was clearly a world-class space museum, but I didn’t see anything from Apollo 11 (mission) on exhibit, and it seemed obvious to me that they should have something from the flight,” Rick Armstrong said in a news release. The new donations will be put on display later this year.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: People passing by the gym where Muhammad Ali learned to box can see a new historical marker that has been placed there. The Columbia Gym at Spalding University also has a red bicycle hanging over the entrance to the gym. Ali’s red bike was stolen when he was young, leading him to a police officer who trained at the gym. Officer Joe Martin told Ali, then known as Cassius Clay, that he would have to learn to fight, and Clay started training at the same gym. News outlets report the marker was unveiled last week, the day before Ali would have turned 78. He died in 2016. Ali’s brother, Rahman Ali, helped unveil the marker. He said his brother’s “whole life” started at Columbia Gym.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A historic brewery that’s been shuttered since Hurricane Katrina will officially reopen in a new location this weekend. Dixie Brewery plans to hold a grand opening Saturday, news outlets report. It originally opened in 1907. Floods and looting after the hurricane contributed to its closure, The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports. The new facility is open to the public and boasts a bar, cafe, outdoor space, museum and games. The brewery will also offer tours showing parts of the production process, according to news outlets. The brewery has created jobs for more than 40 people, WVUE-TV reports. The general manager said he hopes the facility becomes a landmark for people visiting New Orleans. “I mean, if you go to Cafe Du Monde for a beignet, you have to come to Dixie for a beer,” Jim Birch said.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The governor used her first State of the State address this week to paint a picture of the Pine Tree State as a home of compromise and bipartisanship in an era marked by political gridlock elsewhere. Democratic Gov. Janet Mills themed Tuesday’s address “We are not Washington; we are Maine” and stuck to a theme of working together to improve health care access, protect the environment and grow the economy. Mills, who has used her first year in office to focus on issues such as Medicaid expansion, tackling climate change and solving the state’s opioid crisis, also ticked off accomplishments that she said show Maine is in good hands. “We have made progress, and we have done so without rancor or bitterness,” Mills told the crowd in the Maine House of Representatives chambers, also touting “the security and saneness of our own small outpost” during the state’s bicentennial year.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A new report says a critical shortage of police officers in the city is delaying many of the reforms that are required under a federal consent decree. The report was authored by an independent monitoring team of policing and civil rights experts, according to the Baltimore Sun. The team wrote that staffing challenges will have staggering effects on overall reforms. The department finished 2019 with 31 fewer officers than it had when the year began. A consultant recently concluded the department needs to hire 300 more officers and 100 civilians to adequately staff areas such as patrol and internal affairs. The consent decree – which followed a federal investigation that found officers routinely violated residents’ civil rights, particularly in black neighborhoods – requires improvements in how police interact with youths and respond to residents with mental disabilities as well as sexual assault victims.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSwansea: A Target employee who faced criticism by a customer upset over the price of a toothbrush received more than $30,000 in donations for a vacation fund. Tori Perotti was overwhelmed with support from social media users after a customer took to Twitter to call her out for the price of an electric toothbrush last week, news outlets report. The manager at the Swansea Target was approached by David Leavitt when he tried to purchase an electric toothbrush that he said was marked on sale for $0.01 but was actually $89.99. When Perotti refused to sell the toothbrush to Leavitt for a cent, he turned to his more than 200,000 Twitter followers to write that Perotti “is not honoring the price of their items,” in accordance to state law. He added in another tweet that he was going to call 911 over the incident. Social media users came to Perrotti’s defense shortly after, with one person going as far as starting a GoFundMe page.\n\nMichigan\n\nGrand Haven: Record-high water levels on the Great Lakes are wreaking havoc along the state’s coastlines, swallowing beaches and houses, swamping sewer systems, flooding roads and public buildings, and turning farm fields into lakes. And it’s only expected to get worse this year, state lawmakers were told Thursday. “We won’t have much of a beach this summer. We’re telling people to plan on getting your feet wet if you come here,” said Pat McGinnis, city manager of Grand Haven, which sits on the shores of Lake Michigan. “We had to close a public building because of mold issues from the higher water. We’re shutting them down and tearing them down, and there is no insurance coverage.” In Saginaw County, where the Saginaw River leads into Lake Huron, Public Works Commissioner Brian Wendling said there’s no place for the water to go anymore.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state Supreme Court has upheld the city’s authority to impose a minimum wage that’s higher than the state’s. The ruling follows three years of legal fighting over the $15 minimum wage as is seen as a victory for laborers and the city. The manufacturing and supplies company Graco Inc. sued in 2017 to try to block the $15 wage from taking effect, according to the Star Tribune. Graco argued it would create a patchwork of compensation standards because of the state’s $10 minimum wage for large businesses. The Supreme Court said in its ruling that the “Legislature did not intend to occupy the field of minimum-wage rates,” and because the city’s rate would not prevent employers from complying with the lower state rate, Minneapolis’ ordinance could stand. Minneapolis was the first Midwestern city to adopt a $15-per-hour minimum wage, which will be phased in gradually until it peaks in 2024.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Belhaven University is creating scholarships to honor one of its graduates who is the author of bestselling young adult novels. The Angie Thomas Writers Scholarship program will be based at the Jackson school. Thomas wrote “The Hate U Give,” about an African American teenager who sees a police officer shoot and kill her best friend, and “On the Come Up,” about a young rapper who finds her identity and confronts stereotypes through music. One creative writing major at Belhaven will receive a scholarship to cover all expenses for tuition, room and board for four years, the university said in a news release Thursday. Other top applicants may receive smaller awards. Thomas graduated from Belhaven with a bachelor of fine arts degree in 2011. “The Hate U Give” was published in 2017 and was released as a movie in 2018. “On the Come Up” was published in 2019, and Thomas is working as a producer of the movie that is in development. The deadline to apply for the scholarship is March 1.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Lawmakers are considering whether to allow police in all of the state’s municipalities to reside outside the cities where they work. A House bill initially introduced to lift the residency requirements for officers in St. Louis was expanded Tuesday to include all Missouri cities, despite opposition from Kansas City leaders, The Kansas City Star reports. Many cities currently require all law enforcement officers to live within city limits. St. Louis supports lifting the residency requirements, in part because the police department is 100 officers short. In Kansas City, officers must live in the city one year before beginning employment, and civilian workers have nine months to move into the city. Attorney General Eric Schmitt supports lifting residency requirements, contending it would help recruit and retain officers and help fight violent crime. The mayor and police chief of St. Louis also support the bill.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: An oil-drilling lease dispute has continued in federal court over whether to cancel the lease near Glacier National Park on land considered sacred by the Blackfeet tribe. The U.S. Court of Appeals heard arguments Monday from lawyers for leaseholder Solenex LLC and EarthJustice, which is representing the Blackfeet Nation and some environmental groups, the Missoulian reported Tuesday. Drilling leases in Badger-Two Medicine have been a point of contention for years, court officials said. The Bureau of Land Management in 2016 canceled the oil and gas leases held by Moncrief Oil and Solenex LLC, drawing a lawsuit from the two firms. A U.S. district court later reinstated the leases. Moncrief reached a settlement with environmental groups, but Solenex is still defending its lease, company officials said.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state’s attorney general filed a lawsuit Wednesday against a commission that voted to allow machine bets on previously run horse races despite the attorney general’s warnings that the machines are illegal. The lawsuit alleges that the Nebraska State Racing Commission approved so-called historical horse racing even after state lawyers advised the commission that the machines violate state law and the Nebraska Constitution’s prohibition of casino gambling. The attorney general’s office said the commission’s vote amounted to a “unilateral decision to expand gambling without action by the Legislature or the citizens of Nebraska.” The commission voted 3-2 in July to allow the terminals at Fonner Park in Grand Island. Lawmakers have considered measures to legalize the machines in the past but rejected them amid arguments that they’re too similar to casino slots.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The Silver State will be joining Iowa in using mobile apps to gather results from thousands of caucus sites, amid heightened worries about election hacking. The decision to use the apps was made to increase transparency and help run the caucuses more smoothly, says Shelby Wiltz, director of the Nevada State Democratic Party Caucus. Although the technology is intended to make counting easier, it also raises concerns about the potential for hacking or glitches. Party officials say they worked closely with the Democratic National Committee and security experts while picking and vetting the app vendor that was chosen. They declined to name the vendor, citing security reasons. Wiltz says the app has been thoroughly tested. Democratic Party activists in the two states will use programs downloaded to their personal phones to report the results of caucus gatherings to the state headquarters. That data will then be used to announce the unofficial winners.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Sexual assault survivors, parents and other advocates urged lawmakers Thursday to close a loophole in state law they argue enabled a Concord High School teacher accused of abuse. Primo “Howie” Leung was charged in April with sexually assaulting a student off school property in Massachusetts in 2015 and 2016. But school officials did not report him to police after he was seen kissing a different student in 2018 because state law allows teenagers 16 and older to consent to such contact if they are not being coerced. The Senate Judiciary Committee heard testimony on a pair of bills filed in response to the school district’s handling of Leung, who has pleaded not guilty. But both sponsors, Sen. Martha Hennessey, D-Hanover, and Sen. Jeb Bradley, R-Wolfeboro, said they back an amendment offered by the New Hampshire Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence combining elements of their proposed legislation.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nFreehold: A ham-handed attempt to steal organ pipes has left a township church facing extensive damage. The burglary occurred overnight Tuesday at First United Methodist Church of Freehold, according to a post on the church’s Facebook page. A bid to steal the large decorative pipes caused a collapse that damaged the organ, according to the post. A picture showed the pipes arrayed like pick-up sticks. “At this time, we do not know,” the church’s pastor, the Rev. Wil Wilson, said of the cost of the damage. “Just taking it a day at a time, but costs will be assessed soon.” The post said: “While the damage is shocking and disturbing, we thank God that no one was injured and nothing was stolen. ... We will not let this crush our spirits.” Business will go on as usual. The pastor wrote that Sunday services will be held at 10 a.m.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The state’s largest university is asking students to help with picking a new school seal to replace one that had sparked protests. The University of New Mexico is allowing students to vote on five options. One has a howling Lobo and the Sandia Mountains in the background. Others have the names of the school around various designs. The move comes after the University of New Mexico began looking for a new design for its official seal following protests from Native Americans over concerns about the seal that featured a sword-carrying Spanish conquistador and a rifle-toting frontiersman. The Native American student groups Kiva Club and The Red Nation had been pressuring the university to drop the seal. “If you want to go to a school, and there is an image of a group of people who killed your ancestors on the logo, then it might deter you from going there,” student Cara Greene told TV station KRQE.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The president of the city’s subways announced his resignation Thursday, two years after being brought in to help turn around the beleaguered system. No reason was given for the unexpected departure of Andy Byford, a British executive with experience in transit systems all over the world. But there had also been tensions, notably with Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who largely controls the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the agency that includes the subways that Byford oversaw. In a statement on his resignation, Byford said he was “very proud” of what had been accomplished during his tenure. Speaking briefly at a board meeting Thursday after his resignation became public, Byford thanked Cuomo for giving him the opportunity and gave him credit for the efforts he and the Legislature made in securing capital funds for system improvements.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nHatteras: More than 100 sea turtles stunned by recent cold temperatures have washed up on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, the National Park Service said. The agency wrote on its Facebook page Wednesday that approximately 95 green and Kemp’s ridley turtles washed ashore Tuesday on the south side of Hatteras Island. Of that total, 35 washed up onto the Cape Hatteras National Seashore, the agency said. In addition, the park service says another 10 turtles were found Wednesday morning on the seashore. The turtles were taken to the N.C. Aquarium on Roanoke Island for rehabilitation. Many are expected to be released by the end of the week. The majority of the cold-stunned turtles have been found from Buxton to Hatteras, and seashore biotechs and multiple volunteer organizations continued searching for cold-stunned turtles Wednesday.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Hundreds of electronic devices aimed at adding speed and security at the voting polls will be distributed to the state’s 53 counties in the coming weeks. The 990 poll books replace the paper process to check in voters that are used in most counties. North Dakota has no voter registration but maintains a central voter file, which is a database of who has voted. “One of the things when it comes to election integrity is that once you come in and show your ID, that automatically goes back into our central voter file, and so if you attempted to vote, let’s say, in Minot or drive up to Killdeer or some other place, they would know that you voted already,” Secretary of State Al Jaeger said Monday. The state’s six or seven larger counties have been using the poll books already, and by February every county will have them, the Bismarck Tribune reports.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The Cincinnati Zoo is using the third birthday of its beloved premature hippo as a way to raise money for Australian wildlife affected by the recent bushfires. Instead of sending birthday gifts, the zoo is asking people to buy T-shirts that will directly benefit the Bushfire Emergency Wildlife Fund. The shirt features a koala and kangaroo giving Fiona a hug and says “Supporting Our Friends Down Under.” All proceeds from sales will be sent to Zoos Victoria to help them care for the animals that are suffering. The zoo will add $5,000 to the total amount raised. Fiona became a global celebrity after she was born Jan. 24, 2017, weighing in at just 29 pounds. The normal range for a hippo’s birth weight is 55 to 120 pounds. Fiona now weighs a healthy 1,300 pounds, according to the zoo.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A former zookeeper and one-time candidate for governor was sentenced Wednesday to 22 years in prison for his role in a murder-for-hire plot and violating federal wildlife laws. A federal judge in Oklahoma City sentenced 56-year-old Joseph Allen Maldonado-Passage – also known as “Joe Exotic” – for trying to arrange the killing of a Florida animal sanctuary founder who criticized his treatment of animals. The woman, Carole Baskin, wasn’t harmed. Maldonado, who maintained his innocence, also was sentenced for killing five tigers, selling tiger cubs and falsifying wildlife records. A jury convicted him last April. “I still maintain my innocence and looking forward in the upcoming days to my attorneys filing my appeal and moving onto the next step in this nightmare,” he said in a statement posted to his Facebook page.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Schools raised the statewide high school graduation rate for the class of 2019 to 80% and slightly narrowed racial and economic inequities, according to figures made public early Thursday. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports the biggest gains were among low-income students, whose on-time graduation rate rose 2 percentage points; students with disabilities, whose rate rose 3 percentage points; and students who were still learning English as their second language while in high school. The on-time graduation rate for that third group surged more than 4 percentage points to 60%. In 2018, the overall graduation rate was 78.7%. State schools chief Colt Gill hailed what he called an “historic” achievement. He credited hard work in local school districts as well as a half-dozen statewide initiatives for the widespread improvement and the narrowing of racial and other gaps. Oregon’s graduation rate has been considered an embarrassment for many years, with it typically ranking in the very bottom tier of states.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Philadelphia Flyers mascot Gritty is under investigation for allegedly assaulting a 13-year-old boy during a photo shoot, police said. Chris Greenwell and his son Brandon met the hairy, googly-eyed mascot at a November event for season ticket holders. Brandon patted Gritty on the head after he and his father posed for a photo with him at the Wells Fargo Center, Greenwell told The Philadelphia Inquirer. Greenwell said that as Brandon walked away, Gritty ran out of his chair and “punched my son as hard as he could.” Greenwell, who told the newspaper he only wanted an apology and something special for his son, filed a complaint with police Dec. 21. A police spokesperson said Tuesday that the investigation is “active and ongoing.” Officials at Comcast Spectacor, the company that owns the Flyers, said it conducted an investigation but couldn’t verify whether the alleged assault happened.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: State lawmakers are considering a bill that would ban 3D guns. The measure would make it illegal for anyone in Rhode Island to manufacture, import, sell, ship, deliver, possess, transfer or receive any firearm that is made from plastic, fiberglass or through a 3D-printing process. The proposal received unanimous approval from the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday night. The guns, also referred to as “ghost guns,” are especially dangerous because they can pass through metal detectors and be obtained by people who wouldn’t otherwise pass background checks, supporters have argued. Critics of the bill contend that the ban is unnecessary and that existing laws tackle undetectable firearms.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGeorgetown: A sheriff’s deputy responding to a burglary call was forced to settle a beef between his K9 and a spooked cow by using a stun gun. Georgetown County sheriff’s deputies were dispatched to the Pleasant Hill community Wednesday when a K9 that was brought to the scene reportedly became “distracted” and bit a cow belonging to the property owners, a statement from the agency said. The officer was forced to stun the dog to prevent the cow from being seriously injured, the office said. Reacting to the bite, the cow charged at the deputy and property owner, hitting them and causing minor injuries. After taking stock of the situation, the deputy placed the dog in his cruiser. None of the people or animals involved appeared to be seriously hurt. At the end of it all, the sheriff’s office determined the original burglary call was unfounded.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Twenty-one state legislators have signed on in support of a bill that would prohibit local governments from banning plastic bags, straws and other products. Eight states have banned single-use plastic bags, and 15 states, including Minnesota and North Dakota, have adopted laws prohibiting government entities from banning plastic bags, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Republican Sen. John Wiik says he decided to introduce the legislation after working with retailers on the issue and seeing neighboring states attempt similar legislation. “I just thought it was time to move ahead and give the small businesses, your mom-and-pop convenience stores and small town businesses, a little more solid footing going into the future,” Wiik says. The question of a ban rose to the surface in Sioux Falls last year after the flooded Big Sioux River left thousands of plastic bags stuck in the trees along the river banks as the water receded.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The city says it has emergency, private garbage crews on standby in case of a “wildcat” work stoppage this weekend. “They are operating outside of their leadership. Should this stoppage occur, it’s in breach of the memorandum of understanding with the city and also the ordinance,” city spokesman Dan Springer said. he said any worker who participates in an unauthorized work stoppage technically resigns their position under the city charter. How large of a work stoppage is planned for Saturday or if it will happen at all is unclear. Any potential stoppage could delay trash pickup scheduled for this weekend after being pushed back for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. The head of AFSCME Local 1733, the Memphis sanitation workers union, wrote a letter to Mayor Jim Strickland last week disavowing a planned, “unsanctioned” strike.\n\nTexas\n\nTomball: A teacher who authorities say brought a handgun to school and made threatening comments about colleagues has been arrested. Mark Davis, a history and geography teacher at Concordia Lutheran High School, was arrested Wednesday. Tomball police say he’s charged with possessing a weapon in a prohibited place and threatening to exhibit or use a firearm at a school. According to a criminal complaint, a teacher who encountered Davis, 62, on Tuesday in a first-floor common area at the private school said he “appeared to be more angry than usual.” Davis told the teacher he felt the principal gave another school a bad reference regarding his time at Concordia, and he complained the school’s baseball coach hadn’t picked him for an assistant coaching position. The teacher told police Davis said he would buy an automatic rifle and had a handgun upstairs, according to the complaint, and he told school officials he brought it to campus to “protect the kids.”\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A contentious state tax overhaul will be repealed amid growing voter backlash to the plan that would raise taxes on food and groceries while cutting income tax, Republican legislative leaders said Thursday. The repeal was announced after an effort to challenge it through a citizen referendum appeared to have succeeded in getting a spot on the November ballot, the Deseret News reports. Gov. Gary Herbert told reporters during his regular monthly news conference on PBS Utah that an overhaul is still needed, but lawmakers will likely wait to take up the issue until next year. The legislative session begins Monday. “I think we’re accommodating the will of the people,” Herbert said about the repeal. “The fact that we have pushback means we have not done our job as far as convincing the people this is the right thing to do or the right way to do it.”\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state is looking to award $2 million to help construct fast vehicle charging stations along highway corridors. The state is requesting proposals for a third round of grant funding to build Direct Current Fast Charging stations at eleven priority locations along Vermont’s major arteries. As of last October, there were more than 3,500 electric vehicles registered with the Department of Motor Vehicles, up 154% since 2016. The third round of funding will ensure charging stations are available along interstate and other priority highway corridors such as interstates 89 and 91, U.S. Route 4 and Vermont Route 100. “Electric car owners often charge at home, but increased availability and speed of public charging are critical to advancing transportation electrification in Vermont,” said David Roberts, the Drive Electric Vermont coordinator.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: An event considered the world’s leading international competition for young violinists will feature a Virginia competitor when it comes to the city this spring. The Menuhin Competition Richmond 2020 on Wednesday announced the 44 competitors who had been selected from a pool of 321 applicants for the May event. The Menuhin Competition, which is held every two years in a different location, is known as “Olympics of the Violin.” The competitors represent 16 countries of residence across North and South America, Europe, Asia and Australia, and 13 U.S. states, according to a press release from event organizers. Kayleigh Kim, a 15-year-old from northern Virginia, will compete in the junior level of the competition, for ages 15 and under. The senior level features musicians 21 and under. The event was founded in 1983 by violinist Yehudi Menuhin, one of the great musical talents of the 20th century.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Middle and high school students joined administrators, parents and doctors Wednesday in urging a state Senate committee to pass severe restrictions on nicotine vaping products, decrying how some of their peers leave class to vape in the bathroom or even use the products during class by exhaling into their sleeve. Washington adopted a temporary ban on flavored e-cigarette juice in October as the nation grappled with a mysterious, sometimes fatal lung illness that appeared linked to vaping. Since then, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control has said the outbreak appears to have been linked mostly to vitamin E acetate in vaping products containing THC, the main active ingredient in cannabis. The bill considered by the Senate Health and Long Term Care Committee on Wednesday would make the flavor ban permanent, while also limiting the nicotine content and size of each vaping juice cartridge.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state’s public schools superintendent wants the state Board of Education not to reduce the number of social studies courses required for high school graduation. Superintendent Steve Paine said in a statement that he will make the recommendation based on an overwhelming response to the proposal. Last month the Board of Education placed the overall high school credits proposal up for public comment through Jan. 24. It would reduce the number of required social studies courses in favor of other courses such as career technical education and computer science. Meanwhile, a new class on cooking, cleaning and budgeting could be coming to schools under a bill passed Thursday by the Senate. Lawmakers voted 33-0 to approve the proposal to have the state education board come up with a home economics course that would also include training on sewing, minor home repair and time management.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The Milwaukee Brewers home ballpark will have a new name next year after a 20-year deal with Miller comes to an end. American Family Insurance announced this week that Miller Park will become American Family Field next Jan. 1. A new logo and other branding elements will be revealed later this year. The Brewers a year ago announced the 15-year naming rights deal with American Family, but the name of the ballpark was not known until now. No terms of the agreement were announced. The deal with Miller was worth $40 million. The brewing company, now MillerCoors, showed little or no interest in extending the naming rights. The insurance company also has the naming rights to the main amphitheater at Summerfest, the music festival along Milwaukee’s lakefront.\n\nWyoming\n\nCody: Sleeping Giant Ski Area in northwest Wyoming is suspending winter operations after this season because of financial problems. Amy Woods, manager of the Yellowstone Recreations Foundation, announced the board of directors’ decision this week, saying that “the number of skiers and snowboarders we currently attract does not make winter operations financially feasible as we run a deficit of over $200,000 per year.” She said the decision is “agonizing but necessary.” The Cody Enterprise reports the zipline will not be affected and will start running again in the summer. In 2007, a local group launched a plan to acquire Sleeping Giant, which had shuttered three years earlier. The Yellowstone Recreations Foundation was established to reopen the ski area.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/01/26/transit-memorial-pen-pals-white-house-doctor-news-around-states/115362570/", "title": "Transit memorial, pen pals, White House doctor: News from around ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: The Birmingham VA Health Care System is expanding its ability to vaccinate veterans against COVID-19, provided it can get enough doses. A partnership with the United Way of Central Alabama will allow the agency to provide as many as 1,000 shots a day beginning this week to veterans who are at least 65 years old, the VA said. That’s up from the current daily total of 300 people. The change comes because the VA’s vaccine clinic is moving into a United Way building in downtown Birmingham. Chief executive Stacy Vasquez said the system will schedule as many veterans as it can for shots, but obtaining additional vaccine is key. “Right now, I have enough vaccine to take care of 5,000 people next week. But then after that, unless I get another shipment, I don’t know,” Vasquez told WBRC-TV last week. The VA’s vaccination program operates on a separate track from the one administered by the Alabama Department of Public Health, which is offering vaccines for people 75 and older. It, too, is in need of additional vaccine.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state held the enviable position of having the highest rate of COVID-19 vaccinations per capita in the nation as of last week, its top health official said. Alaska Chief Medical Officer Anne Zink said Thursday that the progress was the result of community efforts to quickly distribute vaccinations and additional allotments for federal agencies within the state, KTOO-FM reports. Zink told the Greater Juneau Chamber of Commerce that Alaska receives more doses of vaccine because of allowances above the state’s share for the Department of Defense, the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Indian Health Service. “We have the highest veterans per capita population. We have a large military presence. And we have a large Indigenous population with over 229 sovereign tribes,” Zink said. “And so, because of those reasons, we did get some additional vaccine in the state via those federal partnerships.” More than 14,000 people in Alaska had received both required doses of a vaccine cycle as of last Thursday, while more than 67,000 people had received at least one of the shots in the series, in a state with roughly 730,000 residents.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: With less than 1% of the population fully vaccinated against COVID-19, a study issued Thursday found Arizona the least safe state in the country in regard to COVID-19, aligning with other indicators from national databanks. WalletHub compared all 50 states and the District of Columbia across five key metrics: the rates of COVID-19 transmission, positive testing, hospitalizations, deaths and the share of the eligible population getting vaccinated. Some statistics referred to the pandemic as a whole, while deaths and positive testing rates only refer to Arizona’s status for the prior week. The study utilized data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the COVID Tracking Project, and rt.live, according to WalletHub. Arizona came in 42nd for its vaccination rate, 51st for test positivity, 51st for hospitalizations, 50th for death rate and 49th for transmission rate. According to testing data from John Hopkins University, the last-place spot for positive testing rates is well-deserved for the past week. Arizona has tallied 129 new positive cases per 100,000 people, the highest rate in the United States.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state had the eighth-highest rate of new coronavirus cases per capita in the United States at 1,036.86 per 100,000 population, according to data from Johns Hopkins University on Sunday. The seven-day rolling average of new cases in Arkansas declined during the past two weeks from 2,900.57 per day Jan. 9 to 1,831 new cases per day Saturday, according to the Johns Hopkins data, and the rolling average of daily deaths in the state was also down slightly, from 40.14 to 38.57 deaths per day during the same time frame. The Arkansas Department of Health on Sunday reported totals of 284,066 coronavirus cases and 4,606 deaths due to COVID-19 since the pandemic began, increases of 1,071 cases and 43 more deaths than Friday. The health department also reported a decline of 14 in the number of people hospitalized due to the illness, to a total of 1,080 across the state.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Advocates for farmworkers, teachers, grocery store clerks and other essential workers are worried they’ll have to wait until this summer to be vaccinated against COVID-19 as the state considers giving priority to older residents. State officials said the move makes sense given that older people have a much higher rate of hospitalization and death from COVID-19. But with California struggling to get and give the vaccine, it could take until June to vaccinate all residents 65 and older, the Sacramento Bee reports. That could mean teachers and school workers will probably not be vaccinated until this summer, said Debra Schade, a school board member at the Solana Beach School District in San Diego County and a director at the California School Boards Association. Some local governments have already started vaccinating essential workers, and Fresno County said it would begin offering vaccines Monday to about 3,000 farmworkers. By vaccinating older adults first, the state could push down the number of those hospitalized, which could benefit the community as a whole, California Department of Public Health Director Dr. Tomas J. Aragon has said.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Wesley Morgan has been sending Snoopy-themed cards and letters across the country to ease the solitude of older adults in isolation due to the coronavirus. “He’s kept me from being lonely,” said Nancy Sloane, 67, a retired teacher now quarantined at the Brookdale Senior Living Community in Denver. “I look forward to his letters.” After Morgan, 32, was furloughed from his job at the Denver International Airport in March, he soon ran out of shows to stream and items to craft. “The house was always clean, and I did ‘Tiger King,’ like the rest of the world,” he said. “And then what?” Morgan learned of a friend’s efforts to write to people at a Denver nursing home and felt called to do the same, putting to use his beloved “Peanuts” cards and stationery sets, collected and hoarded over many years. “I couldn’t think of a better way to use this collection,” he said. “It was something I could do from home. I didn’t have to leave.” He has sent over 500 letters and heard back from 142 people. Many have become regular correspondents – his “Peanuts” pen pals, as he calls them. “Almost every time I receive anything back, it is pages,” he said, smiling. “They just have so much to share and talk about.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nWilton: Local health officials have ordered a home for retired nuns closed to visitors and the public because of a coronavirus outbreak that has infected nearly half of the more than 70 residents there, just as vaccinations were underway. The restrictions on the School Sisters of Notre Dame home in Wilton were ordered by town Director of Health Barrington Bogle, and state health officials were expected to visit the property Monday to help with the outbreak, First Selectwoman Lynne Vanderslice said in a statement Sunday. Vanderslice said 30 residents recently tested positive for the virus, as did a number of staff members. Affected residents are being quarantined at a former skilled nursing facility on the property, said Caelie Haines, a spokeswoman for School Sisters of Notre Dame. Any resident who needs more acute care will be taken to a hospital, she said. Fifteen retired nuns recently received COVID-19 vaccinations. The remaining residents and staff were scheduled to be vaccinated Monday. “We are all saddened the outbreak happened prior to those vaccinations,” Vanderslice said. “Please keep this special community of nuns in your thoughts.”\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Health officials say they vaccinated 11,154 people over the weekend at events that were held in Delaware City and Georgetown. The Delaware State News reports some of the people who received shots were in the Phase IB group. That group includes seniors who are 65 years old and older as well as Phase 1A health care personnel. Delays and confusion had plagued vaccination efforts earlier in the weekend. Some people said they had waited in their cars for several hours to get a shot. The Delaware Division of Public Health said some of the delays were caused by people arriving without an appointment, or those who had appointments had failed to complete their pre-vaccination screening online before arriving. State health officials said they implemented improvements to the process Sunday that included separate lanes for Phase 1A health care workers. More personnel and laptops were also employed at one of the sites.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: President Joe Biden has brought back Dr. Kevin O’Connor as his physician, replacing President Donald Trump’s doctor with the one who oversaw his care when he was vice president. The White House confirmed that Dr. Sean Conley, the Navy commander who served as the head of the White House Medical Unit under Trump and oversaw his treatment when he was hospitalized with COVID-19, will assume a teaching role at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences. O’Connor, a retired Army colonel, was Biden’s doctor during his entire tenure as vice president, having remained in the role at Biden’s request. He remained Biden’s physician while assuming a role on the faculty of George Washington University. The White House said O’Connor was being commissioned by the president but was not rejoining the military. He is the first non-active-duty doctor to serve as physician to the president in almost three decades. Conley faced intense scrutiny over his lack of transparency during Trump’s illness with COVID-19. Then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said at the time that Trump’s condition was worse than Conley had let on.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: Gov. Ron DeSantis says the flow of COVID-19 vaccines has been stagnant, and the state needs more to meet the increasing demand from residents. In a news conference at a nursing home in Jacksonville, DeSantis said officials in Washington said the state would start to see its supply increase around this time, but that hasn’t happened. “We are at the mercy of what the federal government sends us, and right now we are able to go through it quicker than what we are receiving,” DeSantis said. At a White House briefing, press secretary Jen Psaki pushed back against DeSantis’ comments criticizing the federal government, saying Florida has only administered about half of the vaccines it has been given. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows 53% of the doses the state has been supplied so far have been administered. But there can be a lag in the federal data, as health care providers report doses up to 72 hours after they have been administered. Some in Florida have grown frustrated with online platforms that crash or run out of appointments and phone lines that ring unanswered or have no availability. Hospitals have been forced to cancel appointments because of limited supply.\n\nGeorgia\n\nConyers: A suburban Atlanta nursing home where 22 people died from COVID-19 has been faulted by state inspectors for failing to control infections, but relatives of people who died say they can’t sue because state lawmakers last year blocked lawsuits unless plaintiffs can prove the difficult-to-meet standard of gross negligence. Multiple state reports faulted infection control at Westbury Nursing Home in Conyers, where at least 85 residents have been infected, WXIA-TV reports. That includes an October inspection where Georgia Department of Community Health inspectors found Westbury put residents in immediate jeopardy by keeping coronavirus-positive and -negative residents in the same rooms, improperly performing tests, and failing to notify state officials. In April, Gov. Brian Kemp signed an executive order limiting the liability of employees, staff and contractors of health care institutions and medical facilities during the pandemic, even if they admit to making a mistake. About five months later, the Legislature passed a temporary law preventing many lawsuits against health care facilities and other businesses, as long as owners post signs outside facilities alerting the public they assume the risk if they enter.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: About half of the state’s supply of 186,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccine had been distributed through last week, officials said. Hawaii has more than 40 distribution sites for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, KITV-TV reports. Democratic Lt. Gov. Josh Green said state leaders have pressed the federal government to continue supplying doses. “We now have another 50,000 or 60,000 scheduled appointments for people getting their either first shot or second shot,” Green said. “We didn’t want to leave people in the lurch.” Officials remain aware of the ongoing transition between presidential administrations while focusing on the need for each patient to receive two shots spaced weeks apart to receive full vaccine cycles, Green said. “We don’t want people to come get vaccinated and then find out three weeks later, sorry, we can’t complete the series.” More than 5,500 people were scheduled to receive shots at Honolulu’s Blaisdell Center mass vaccination site Monday. Green said he asked Gov. David Ige to allow residents who have received a full vaccine series to be allowed to bypass the state’s mandated quarantine for inter-island travel beginning in mid- to late February.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Limited availability, confusion over which residents should be vaccinated first and rumors of line-jumpers are all complicating the state’s vaccine rollout. Members of Idaho’s COVID-19 Vaccine Advisory Committee met Friday to help clarify exactly who should have first dibs on the state’s vaccine doses. On average, Idaho is shipped about 21,000 vaccine doses each week. Those shipments are earmarked as “first doses,” with the federal government automatically shipping the second dose for each individual vaccine recipient about three weeks later. So far, the federal government has distributed 178,175 doses to Idaho, according to the latest numbers from the U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention. That’s a rate of 9,970 doses for every 100,000 residents, putting Idaho near the bottom of the list compared to the allotment given other states. Only California, South Carolina, Missouri, Nevada and Alabama have received fewer doses per capita. Idaho is also trailing other states – coming in 46th in the nation – at getting shots into residents’ arms, with about 3.4% of residents having received at least one dose so far. Roughly 0.7% of Idaho residents are now fully vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Mayor Lori Lightfoot received a COVID-19 vaccine shot Monday as Illinois touted online signups and efforts to address racial equity at the start of its latest vaccination phase covering essential workers and residents age 65 and older. The newest round of vaccinations, following health care workers and nursing home residents, covers about 3.2 million people including grocery store workers, teachers and public transit employees. Health officials unveiled a new state website for online signups but cautioned that Illinoisans will face wait times due to limited supplies. The next phase is expected to last about two months. Chicago public health officials said early vaccination data shows alarming racial disparities. In response, Lightfoot announced that Chicago would focus outreach on 15 communities with large Black and Latino populations that have been particularly vulnerable, including by working with community groups. As Illinois’ coronavirus test positivity rate falls, state officials have announced further loosening of restrictions. State officials announced Monday that dozens of counties in northwestern Illinois will be allowed to offer limited indoor dining, among other things, after the Chicago area began allowing it over the weekend.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Nearly a dozen bills drafted by GOP legislators have sparked debate in the Statehouse over where to draw the line between public health and personal freedom. In the midst of a pandemic that has killed more than 9,000 Hoosiers, lawmakers face contention over emergency health orders, school and business closures, vaccine requirements, and other protocols spurred by COVID-19. In question is whether such precautions are necessary to stem the spread of the coronavirus or infringements on rights. “There’s a majority of the House and Senate in Indiana that like personal freedom and personal choice,” said Republican Sen. Dennis Kruse, who has authored or co-authored three bills. One measure he introduced would prohibit employers from requiring workers to get immunizations against COVID-19 or any other disease. They could decline for medical, religious or reasons of personal “conscience.” They would also be allowed to sue an employer that required immunizations as a condition of employment. But several health and business organizations, including the Indiana Chamber of Commerce, have spoken against the bill, saying it could make workplaces unsafe, including hospitals and nursing homes, where people work closely together and people’s immunization systems are at risk.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Vaccination teams have reached nearly all the state’s nursing homes, giving at least one round of shots to thousands of the most vulnerable residents, an industry leader said Monday. Brent Willett, president of the Iowa Health Care Association, said 98% of nursing homes had been visited at least once by COVID-19 vaccination teams, mostly from CVS or Walgreens. The teams are set to reach the few remaining nursing homes this week, and they also have reached most of Iowa’s assisted living centers, he said. Nursing home residents, most of whom are frail and elderly, are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, the disease the coronavirus causes. Nursing home residents make up less than 1% of Iowa’s population, but they have accounted for more than 40% of Iowa’s COVID-19 deaths, according to the Iowa Department of Public Health. Assisted living facilities are also a high priority for vaccination, although their residents tend to be less frail and live more independently than nursing home residents.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly on Monday proposed moving the state’s tourism division into the Department of Commerce, in an effort to boost an economy that has suffered a downturn amid the coronavirus pandemic. The tourism division is currently part of the Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism. The Travel Industry Association of Kansas, the Kansas Restaurant & Hospitality Association and the Kansas Economic Development Alliance all support the move’s potential to promote tourism as an economic development tool, Kelly said in a news release. The plan would take effect July 1 unless the Legislature opposes it. Adam Mills, president of the Kansas Restaurant & Hospitality Association, said his group will be helped by the changes. “At a time when hospitality needs every reform possible, this reorganization will reposition us as we grow out of the recent strains of the pandemic,” Mills said in a statement. Jim Zaleski, president of the Travel Industry Association of Kansas, said it’s the right time to make the change. “Kansas Tourism and the Department of Commerce have a shared goal of bringing revenue into the state,” he said.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: City officials and local utility companies are now accepting debt relief applications for residents who have fallen behind on their bills during the coronavirus pandemic. The Metro COVID-19 Utility Relief Funds are available immediately for customers who were hit with a “financial hardship” as a result of COVID-19 in 2020, Mayor Greg Fischer and representatives from Louisville Gas & Electric, Louisville Water and the Metropolitan Sewer District said Monday morning. The fund contains $10 million that will be distributed to customers who have outstanding balances on energy and water bills. “This pandemic wasn’t caused by any one of us, so it’s up to all of us and it’s up to Metro government to help the people of our city address their most basic needs,” Fischer said at a press briefing. Anyone, regardless of income level, is eligible to apply, city and utility company officials said. Applications for money to pay off an LG&E bill can be filed through the local Association of Community Ministries or by calling Neighborhood Place at 502-977-6636, while those looking for assistance to pay off a Louisville Water bill can find the application on the water company’s website.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state has confirmed a coronavirus outbreak connected to a wrestling tournament held earlier this month in Ascension Parish, with more than 20 people tied to the event testing positive for the virus. The state Department of Health said athletes, staff and attendees at the Louisiana Classic Wrestling Tournament, which was held at the Lamar Dixon Expo Center in Gonzales on Jan. 15-16, have tested positive. The agency said anyone who attended the tournament should immediately get tested for the coronavirus, even if not experiencing symptoms – and should quarantine for 10 days since exposure to prevent the risk of further spread. Tournament attendees also should monitor for fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, body aches, loss of taste or smell, and other symptoms related to COVID-19, the department said.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: School districts across the state are cutting back on in-person classes in response to staffing shortages in a number of critical areas as a result of a statewide surge in COVID-19 cases that began more than two months ago. The shortages are affecting not just teachers but also transportation and custodial staff, The Portland Press Herald reports. The Maine Department of Education doesn’t track the number of open positions in schools but is responding to feedback from school districts about staff shortages. More than 600 reciprocal and one-year emergency certifications have been issued to date under an executive order from Gov. Janet Mills to provide more flexibility for certifying education professionals. Nearly 2,800 educators have been certified without taking a standardized test that is normally part of the process but was also waived by the executive order. The department is working with Eastern Maine Community College in Bangor to provide free “learning facilitator” training to students who can serve as substitutes or paraprofessionals in schools after a one-week boot camp.\n\nMaryland\n\nHagerstown: Three state employees have died of COVID-19 in recent weeks, according to union officials, including a correctional officer who worked at the Maryland Correctional Training Center in Hagerstown. Mark Renner is believed to be the first correctional employee at the Hagerstown prison complex to die of the disease caused by the coronavirus. Leaders with the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Maryland Council 3 said they did not know whether Renner contracted COVID-19 at the prison, but as a front-line employee working in a congregate setting, he was at increased risk. The union on Friday also reported the death of Jimmy Williams, a correctional maintenance officer at the Baltimore City Correctional Center, and an employee at the University of Maryland College Park who died in December. The union said more than 3,000 state employees have been sickened with COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic, and 10 have died. Council 3 President Patrick Moran blamed state leaders for failing to protect employees who have been working throughout the pandemic.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state relaxed some coronavirus restrictions Monday as several key metrics used to measure the spread of the pandemic trend in the right direction. Restaurants, movie theaters and many other businesses will now be allowed to remain open past 9:30 p.m. Also, a rule that required people to stay at home from 10 p.m. until 5 p.m. except for work or other essential travel has been lifted. The restrictions were adopted in November as new cases surged. The latest seven-day average positivity rate in Massachusetts has dropped to 4.83% as of Sunday, down from 7.2% on Jan. 10. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Massachusetts is also on the decline, at more than 4,200 on Sunday, down from at least 6,400 on Jan. 10, according to the COVID Tracking Project. And hospitalizations are falling. Some safety measures remain in place, including a 25% capacity limit for many businesses, including restaurants and casinos. The state Department of Public Health reported 3,750 new confirmed cases and 67 new virus-related deaths Sunday.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: If the state could administer 50,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses a day, it could hit its goal of inoculating 70% of people age 16 and older by August. At the current rate, about 29,000 per day, it would not finish until a year from now. The issue is limited supply – something Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and health officials hope can be addressed as new President Joe Biden takes the helm amid the largest vaccination effort in U.S. history and as more contagious virus variants spread. “That’s our universal frustration,” the Democratic governor said. “We have the capacity and the plan to do a lot more vaccinations quicker. But the federal government … it’s been hard. They have not gotten us what we need.” Whitmer said she is confident Michigan can carry out 50,000 vaccinations a day, but it’s only getting about 60,000 doses a week of the Pfizer vaccine. The other COVID-19 vaccine, from Moderna, is going to residents and staff in long-term care facilities through a federal program. The state received permission to instead send 120,000 Moderna doses to hospitals and local health departments over this past week and the coming week.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Gov. Tim Walz on Monday announced changes in the sign-up process for a community vaccine program for seniors, teachers and child care workers after heavy demand last week crashed a website and angered many people who could not get through. State officials have shifted from a first-come, first-served system to a lottery that allows 24 hours to sign up, beginning at 5 a.m. on Tuesday, for Minnesotans over 65 for a chance to be randomly selected for an appointment. The registration system just launched last week, only to be clogged with calls and the website to crash due to significant demand. The state will also hold a mass vaccination event for teachers, school staff and child care workers in the metro area at the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul starting Thursday and continuing through Feb. 1. State officials are reserving 15,000 Moderna doses for the event, which will free up the sites in Brooklyn Center and Blaine to exclusively serve seniors this week. The program, which began last week, has administered first doses to more than 13,300 individuals at the nine sites across the state.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Because of disruptions caused by the pandemic, Mississippi third graders and high school students will still take state-mandated exams this semester but will not be penalized for poor performance. And although schools will be assessed based on their performance, they will not be assigned new A through F “report card” grades this academic year. The state Board of Education decided Thursday to set aside the new report card grades for schools and the requirement for students to earn passing grades on the third grade reading assessment and high school end-of-course exams. “This year’s statewide assessments will provide valuable information about the impact of COVID-19 on learning and will help identify where accelerated learning opportunities for students are most needed,” Superintendent of Education Carey Wright said in a news release. “The policy suspensions are intended to support schools through this intensely challenging year for educators and students.” Schools will keep the report card grades they earned in the 2018-19 school year. The school assessments were not done for 2019-20 because of the pandemic.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Health experts say the state isn’t vaccinating people quickly enough to create widespread immunity by this summer. To create enough immunity to COVID-19 to make the coronavirus unlikely to spread widely, officials want to inoculate between 70% and 85% of the state’s residents. That means getting 4.3 million to 5.2 million people immunized. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday that just 205,000 Missourians have received the first doses of vaccine, or about 3% of the population. “We need more,” said Dr. Steven Lawrence, an infectious disease expert at Washington University. “We need speed.” BJC HealthCare’s Chief Clinical Officer Dr. Clay Dunagan estimated that vaccinating 5 million residents by the end of June would require 25,000 to 30,000 shots per day. Over the past week, Missouri has been averaging almost 11,000 per day, according to the state. Dr. Alex Garza, chief community health officer at SSM Health and incident commander of the St. Louis Metropolitan Pandemic Task Force, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch it doesn’t seem realistic right now for the state to administer roughly 30,000 vaccine doses a day.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte will deliver his first State of the State address to a joint session of the Legislature on Thursday evening, with some modifications to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Gianforte will outline his legislative priorities in a speech in the House chambers at 7 p.m. In past years, all 150 lawmakers gathered on the House floor, and guests filled the gallery. This year, members of the Legislature who would be uncomfortable crowded into the House will also be able to watch the speech via streaming in the Senate chambers or the Old Supreme Court chambers at the Capitol, as well as online. The Legislature is strongly recommending, but not requiring, lawmakers to wear masks at the Capitol. Gianforte is Montana’s first Republican governor in 16 years.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Gov. Pete Ricketts on Monday defended the state’s approach to distributing COVID-19 vaccines, saying it won’t redirect doses away from rural areas that are outpacing Omaha and Lincoln with vaccinations. Ricketts made the comments after state officials reported Friday that 15 rural public health districts in Nebraska have already finished the first phase of the state vaccination plan, which focused on front-line health workers. Those districts have since moved on to the next high-priority group, consisting largely of residents who are at least 65 years old and those who are vulnerable because of health conditions. Meanwhile, the public health districts encompassing Omaha and Lincoln are still working through the initial phase and won’t shift to the next group until next week, primarily because they have much larger populations and more medical workers. Ricketts said Nebraska distributed vaccines based on the populations that are most affected by the pandemic. State officials said last week that young, healthy residents who don’t fit into one of the high-priority groups may have to wait four months until they’re eligible to get vaccinated.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The U.S. Supreme Court refused a rural church’s request Monday to step into a legal battle over the government’s authority to limit the size of religious gatherings amid the COVID-19 pandemic even after the church won an appeals court ruling last month that found Nevada’s restrictions unconstitutional. Attorneys general from 19 other states had recently joined in support of Calvary Chapel Dayton Valley east of Reno. They were urging the Supreme Court to rule on the merits of the Nevada case to help bring uniformity to various standards that courts across the country have used to balance the interests of public safety and freedom of religion. The Supreme Court rejected the church’s request for an emergency injunction last summer. The church’s latest plea for relief was in the form of a petition for a review of the case on its merits despite the recent ruling by the 9th Circuit and ongoing litigation in district court. Such petitions are rare, and their approval is even rarer, even though they require approval by only four justices. Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford argued the justices should let the federal court in Reno sort out the details before taking the extraordinary step of wading into the case.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Anyone who owns property in the Granite State will be allowed to get the COVID-19 vaccine in the state, regardless of where they actually live. Property owners, including second homeowners or out-of-state landlords, need only provide proof of property ownership to get vaccinated in New Hampshire. That could include a property tax bill, mortgage statement, utility bill or other documentation. “The intent of the vaccination plan is to make it as easily and efficiently as possible for people in New Hampshire to get vaccinated, not to throw up barriers,” Department of Health and Human Services spokesman Jake Leon told New Hampshire Public Radio. In neighboring states, Maine is limiting vaccines to residents, while Vermont is administering vaccines to residents and those who work in the state. Vaccinations began Saturday for the more than 300,000 people in Phase 1B, which includes those age 65 and older, people with multiple qualifying medical conditions, corrections workers, and those living and working in residential facilities for people with developmental disabilities.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state launched a staffed COVID-19 vaccine hotline Monday, Gov. Phil Murphy said. People with questions about the vaccine can call 855-568-0545 from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. to reach one of 250 New Jersey-based operators. Murphy said the phone line had 17,000 calls in the first hour it was operating. The line is aimed at helping answering questions about appointments and registration. But it comes as the state’s supply of the vaccine, as in much of the country, is below what is needed. Currently, New Jersey receives about 100,000 vaccine doses a week, but it would need closer to 500,000 to meet demand, health officials have said. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in New Jersey fell from from 6,005 new cases per day on Jan. 10 to 5,084 new cases Sunday, according to Johns Hopkins University.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state has surpassed all others in its reliance on Medicaid as the coronavirus wreaks economic havoc and shifts the way people receive health care, New Mexico’s Medicaid director told a panel of lawmakers Friday. Residents have flocked to the federal- and state-subsidized health care program for people living in poverty or on the cusp, with 43% enrollment statewide as of November. Nicole Comeaux, director of the state Medicaid Assistance Division, said enrollment has grown by about 1.5% a month since the outset of the pandemic. That has helped deliver a windfall of federal contributions to Medicaid spending in New Mexico. The federal government provides $4.76 for every dollar in state general funds spent on the program, up from $3.65 pre-pandemic. That equation is providing the state with an additional $385 million, under the condition that it keep Medicaid patients enrolled even as they climb into jobs and out of poverty. The recent expansion could be costly if bonus federal matching funds expire as scheduled in April. Comeaux said the state could see a $170 million shortfall for the coming fiscal year that starts July 1.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is honoring its 136 employees who have died of COVID-19 since the pandemic began with a digital memorial at 107 subway stations, the authority announced Monday. The tribute features photos of the fallen transit workers accompanied by a poem titled “Travels Far” by former U.S. poet laureate Tracy K. Smith. The poem was commissioned by the MTA and will appear in multiple languages at the designated stations. The video tribute will play three times a day through Feb. 7, transit officials said. An online version is accompanied by an original score by composer Christopher Thompson. “COVID-19 has been a devastating scourge on our entire country, and, tragically, that includes the MTA’s workforce,” said MTA Chairman and CEO Patrick Foye, who recovered from his own bout with the coronavirus last spring. “We quickly made sure that those families who lost an MTA worker to COVID were taken care of financially, but the launch of today’s memorial is aimed at personalizing the legacies of those who died during the pandemic.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s Department of Health and Human Services said Friday that North Carolina has seen 1,280 of its COVID-19 vaccine doses get discarded. “Only 0.1% (or 1,280) of the 1.1 million doses which have entered the state thus far have become unusable for any reason and we have not received reports of significant batches being lost,” the department said in a statement to the Associated Press. In a Thursday afternoon news conference, the state’s top public health official, Dr. Mandy Cohen, estimated the waste to be “in the tens of doses.” Doses being administered at county health departments, clinics, hospitals and other places could be tossed out due to a vaccine being stored too long in a freezer or not being administered in a timely manner once it has been taken out of a freezer. There are currently 136 different vaccine providers in the state. The health department said some providers are working to extract as many doses as they can out of multi-dose vials. Low dead-volume syringes allow for a sixth dose to be taken out of a vial of the Pfizer vaccine. North Carolina expects to continue getting about 120,000 new first doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines each week.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Hospitalizations due to the coronavirus have fallen to their lowest total since Aug. 20, with Sunday’s update by the North Dakota Department of Health showing 49 people being treated in medical facilities, down one from Saturday’s report. The state’s hospital tracker showed 38 staffed intensive care unit beds and 421 staffed inpatient beds available throughout North Dakota. Officials confirmed 99 new COVID-19 cases out of 3,079 tests that were processed in the prior day, for a positivity rate of 3.7%. A total of 96,817 people in North Dakota have tested positive since the start of the pandemic. No new deaths were listed in Sunday’s report. There were about 284 new cases per 100,000 people over the past two weeks in North Dakota, which now ranks 50th in the country for new cases per capita, according to the COVID Tracking Project. One in every 756 people in North Dakota tested positive in the past week.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The state reported 4,334 new coronavirus cases and 57 COVID-19 deaths Monday, continuing a trend of declining infections and hospitalizations in recent weeks. Virus numbers tend to be lower on Mondays, due to lab closures and reporting delays over the weekend. But newly reported cases have fallen in recent weeks, averaging 5,366 per day last week compared to 7,098 the week before and 7,941 during the first week of January. In total, 44,981 Ohioans have been hospitalized with COVID-19 at some point during the pandemic, with 198 newly reported since Sunday. On Monday, 3,037 COVID-19 patients occupied hospital beds statewide, including 760 in intensive care, the Ohio Hospital Association reported. That’s below the seven-day moving average of 3,381 hospitalized. The number of coronavirus tests given each week has declined in recent weeks, but so has the percentage returning positive. Ohio’s average positivity rate dropped below 10% last week for the first time since Nov. 8. The seven-day moving average was 8.9% on Saturday, the most recent day that information is available.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Health officials have stopped sending a portion of the state’s COVID-19 vaccines to pharmacies contracted to administer doses to some of the most vulnerable residents. Keith Reed, Oklahoma’s deputy commissioner of health, said the temporary pause in vaccine allocations is meant to allow CVS Health and Walgreens to catch up on the doses set aside for residents and staff in long-term care facilities. In a legislative budget hearing last week, state health officials blasted the pharmacy chains for the pace at which long-term care residents have been vaccinated as lawmakers questioned why the vaccine rollout to vulnerable communities is taking longer than expected. Neither CVS nor Walgreens responded to requests for comment or questions about how far along the companies are in vaccinating Oklahoma’s long-term care residents and staff. Health Commissioner Dr. Lance Frye on Wednesday said the pharmacy chains are not providing much information on how many Oklahomans they’ve vaccinated. “We have not been satisfied with CVS and Walgreens,” he told members of the House Appropriations and Budget Subcommittee on Health.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state Department of Corrections has reported the 39th COVID-19 death among adults in custody. The man, who was not identified, was incarcerated at Two Rivers Correctional Institution and died in the infirmary Saturday, corrections officials said Sunday. He had tested positive for the coronavirus and was between 75 and 85 years old. Last week, Santiam Correctional Institution, a minimum-security prison in Salem, reported an outbreak of COVID-19, prompting a 14-day quarantine of the entire facility. Oregon DOC is responsible for the care and custody of 13,000 adults in custody who are incarcerated in 14 institutions across the state. More than half of the incarcerated population has been identified as COVID-19-vulnerable, based on community standard criteria, according to a release from the corrections department.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A Democratic lawmaker criticized the state’s vaccine rollout as muddled Friday, saying other states are doing a much better job at distribution and communication, while unions representing police and prison guards expressed outrage at having been shoved farther back in line for COVID-19 shots. Although Republicans have been more than happy to attack Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf over his handling of the pandemic, the scolding from a fellow Democrat was remarkable – and a sign of mounting frustration over the stubbornly slow pace of vaccinations in Pennsylvania and shifting guidance about who is eligible to get them. “Pennsylvanians are confused and anxious to receive a vaccine, and they deserve clearer communication and more concrete answers,” wrote Sen. Lindsey Williams of Allegheny County. “I am asking the Department of Health for a transparent, clearly communicated, and efficient vaccine distribution plan for Pennsylvanians.” In Pennsylvania, as elsewhere, demand for shots has overwhelmed supply, and residents have been forced to navigate a patchwork distribution system involving hospitals, pharmacy chains, municipal health departments and even grocery stores.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state has received an infusion of more than $70 million in federal funding to bolster its coronavirus testing and vaccination programs, U.S. Sen. Jack Reed announced Monday. The money from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will be used to expand testing and COVID-19 vaccine distribution across the state, the Democrat said in a statement. Nearly $61 million is allocated to support the state’s COVID-19 testing capacities, contact tracing, and containment and mitigation efforts, while an additional $9.5 million will enhance vaccine distribution. The money comes from a $900 billion emergency COVID-19 relief and rescue measure passed and signed into law in December. More than 59,000 Rhode Islanders have received their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and nearly 15,000 have received their second dose, the state Department of Health said Monday.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Students’ fall test results showed lower scores in both English language arts and math, with young students sliding the most in math. But the results also showed student scores might not have dropped as much as other states did so far this academic year. South Carolina officials are looking at these early test results to see how remote learning could have affected student performance this past fall. The scores are based on benchmark tests given to students to show teachers what areas students need help in and to get an idea of how well they will do on end-of-year standardized tests. When schools closed last March, South Carolina’s nearly 800,000 students were sent to learn from home indefinitely to help mitigate COVID-19. Students completed lessons online, others picked up paper packets from schools, and a small number went silent as the shutdown stretched through the end of the school year. The Education Oversight Committee’s report did show some glimmers of hope – in most grades and subject areas, South Carolina test scores did not decline as much as students in other states this fall. But South Carolina typically lags the nation in test scores.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: State health officials on Monday reported 32 new cases of the coronavirus, the lowest daily total since late July. The results came on a light day of processed tests, with 832, but continued a downward trend that began in mid-November. Over the past two weeks, the rolling average number of daily new cases has decreased by 42.4%, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers. There were about 434 new cases per 100,000 people in South Dakota over the past two weeks, which ranks 43rd in the country for new cases per capita. One in every 550 people in South Dakota tested positive in the past week, researchers said. No new deaths were listed in Monday’s update, keeping the fatality count at 1,705. There were 161 people hospitalized with COVID-19, one fewer than Sunday. Of those patients, 37 required intensive care, and 26 were on ventilators. Health officials say 43% of staffed hospital beds are available in South Dakota, with 5.8% occupied by COVID-19 patients. A total of 107,180 COVID-19 cases have been reported across the state since the start of the pandemic.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The B.1.1.7 variant strain of the coronavirus, which is believed to be more contagious than the common strain, has been detected in the state and is expected to be the “dominant” strain in Tennessee by March, Health Commissioner Lisa Piercey said Friday. Tennesseans should continue the same precautions they are taking now – social distancing, handwashing and mask-wearing – to prevent the spread of the new strain, Piercey said. It is believed the COVID-19 vaccines being distributed across the state are also effective at warding off the new strain. “If it transmits more easily, it is more likely there will be bigger case numbers and wider case spread, and the more cases you have, ostensibly the more hospitalizations and deaths that you have; I don’t want to downplay what could happen,” Piercey said. “But it doesn’t change anything we are doing. We need to remind people that the same thing that prevented them from getting the current strain are the same things that will prevent them from getting the new strain.” The detection of the B.1.1.7 strain comes just as Tennessee is gaining ground on the coronavirus for the first time in months.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state has seen a decrease in the number of reported new deaths due to COVID-19, according to the state health department. There were 208 additional deaths reported across Texas on Sunday after 407 new deaths were reported Saturday following three consecutive days of more than 1,200 new deaths, according to the department. The death toll stands at 34,322. The health department reported more than 11,000 new virus cases for a total of 1.96 million since the pandemic began. The number of COVID-19 patients hospitalized decline from 13,309 to 12,899. The seven-day rolling average of deaths in Texas has risen during the past two weeks from 260.57 per day to 326.14, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The state ranked ninth in the United States in the number of new cases per capita with 1,012.33 per 100,000 residents, according to the Johns Hopkins data. The Johns Hopkins information also shows the positivity rate in Texas has declined from 24.89% to 16%, and the seven-day rolling average of new cases fell from 23,043.57 per day to 18,771.57.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state Capitol building has reopened to the public after being closed for the first four days of the legislative session due to concerns about potential protests following the deadly breach of the U.S. Capitol. Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, said Friday that public input is essential in maintaining the legislative process. Only a handful of protesters showed up at the Capitol last week. Residents are still encouraged to participate in committee hearings virtually. Masks and physical distancing will be required in the Capitol, where three cases of the coronavirus were identified in staffers and an intern early last week, the Deseret News reports. No lawmakers have tested positive, Senate leaders said. Lawmakers are also recommending that people who want to come to the Capitol first get a rapid coronavirus test at the Utah State Fairgrounds. Testing is not required. Utah Highway Patrol troopers will be stationed at the four public entrances to the Capitol conduct bag checks, lawmakers said in a statement.\n\nVermont\n\nBrattleboro: Amid the coronavirus pandemic, the Brattleboro Area Chamber of Commerce has named the whole community as its 2020 person of the year. “All of you probably know an individual or an organization, an unsung hero who has gone above and beyond to take the sting out of the pandemic,” Tracey John, past president of the chamber’s board of directors, said at the chamber’s annual meeting held remotely Thursday, the Brattleboro Reformer reports. So the chamber “is proud to salute all of the unsung heroes in our corner of southern Vermont who rose up to support their neighbors and keeping our community moving forward by naming them and each of you our 2020 Person of the Year,” he said. Each year since 1954, the chamber has recognized someone for having a positive impact on the community. It would be impossible to pick just one for last year, John said. “We’ve all been challenged, and more lies ahead, but over the last year – with ingenuity, perseverance, acts of kindness and by coming together – our community has demonstrated that we can rise to and meet the challenge,” John said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: State officials announced Monday that the first case of a new variant of the coronavirus has been identified in Virginia. The variant was identified in a sample from an adult resident of northern Virginia who had no reported recent travel history, the Department of Health and Department of General Services said in a news release. Health experts have warned that the more contagious and possibly more deadly variant sweeping through Britain will probably become the dominant source of infection in the U.S. by March. It has been reported in over 20 states so far. Another mutant version is circulating in South Africa. “We know this variant strain spreads more quickly between people than other strains currently circulating in our communities, but we still have more to learn about whether it causes more severe illness. As our state public health officials closely monitor the emergence of the B.1.1.7 variant in our Commonwealth, it is important that all Virginians continue following mitigation measures,” State Health Commissioner Dr. M. Norman Oliver said in a statement.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: State House and Senate Democrats on Friday released a plan that looks to spend $2.2 billion in federal aid money on COVID-19 relief efforts. The Seattle Times reports the plan includes $618 million to boost vaccination efforts and contact tracing. It also includes $668 million for school assistance, $365 million to aid renters and landlords, and $240 million for grants to businesses. The bill also looks to spend $50 million for emergency child care funding and $65 million for the Immigrant Relief Fund. House Majority Leader Pat Sullivan said in a statement that by working with Senate lawmakers and figuring out how best to use the federal aid, “we have developed a great first step that pushes dollars out the door to communities and businesses in need.” The new legislation is one a series of bills being fast-tracked in the Legislature to provide different types of relief. A measure that would exempt businesses from paying taxes on COVID-19 aid they received by the government, such as the Paycheck Protection Program or grant money distributed by Gov. Jay Inslee, was unanimously passed by the House on Friday.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The numbers of deaths, people hospitalized and confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the state trended downward last week as vaccinations continue apace. The 119 virus-related deaths recorded last week were a 41% drop from the previous week and the lowest since 109 deaths were reported in the week ending Dec. 6. The 597 people in the hospital for the virus Sunday were the fewest since 595 were hospitalized Nov. 30. The 4,090 confirmed virus cases last week were the lowest since early November. In addition, last week marked the first time there has not been a record-high number of weekly cases in successive weeks since early October. “We are surprised that they are low,” said State Health Officer Dr. Ayne Amjad. “We like to be hopeful. But, West Virginians, we still need to wear our masks, even after you’ve been vaccinated.” Gov. Jim Justice said it would likely take 80% of the state’s 1.78 million population to be vaccinated and some time for the nation to catch up to achieve herd immunity. About 9.3% of West Virginia’s population has received at least one of the two doses from the vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The Wisconsin Medical Society on Monday announced its opposition to a Republican-authored resolution that would overturn the statewide mask mandate put in place by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The board of directors for the medical society, which represents doctors and advocates on their behalf, voted Saturday to support continuation of the mask mandate issued by Evers and oppose the GOP resolution. The group, the state’s largest for individual doctors, announced the action Monday. “Other than vaccines, mask-wearing is one of the few tools we have in our arsenal to help prevent spreading COVID-19 even further than it already has,” Dr. Bud Chumbley, chief operating officer of the medical society, said in a statement. “We ask all of our government leaders to support physicians and other front-line health care workers by promoting mask-wearing as an effective tool against COVID-19.” The resolution overturning the mask order has nine co-sponsors in the Senate and 19 in the Assembly, all Republicans. Neither Assembly Speaker Robin Vos nor GOP Majority Leader Jim Steineke has co-sponsored the resolution or said if the Assembly would take it up.\n\nWyoming\n\nBondurant: The coldest town in the state now contains another curiosity: the only free-standing ice bar in America. The Ice Bar at Jackson Fork Ranch was built at the direction of ranch owner Joe Ricketts, who had seen ice structures on his travels and always wanted to create one on his working bison ranch in Bondurant, said representative Morgan Fischer. The outside of the snow-and-ice structure is nondescript, blending in with small ranch outbuildings. Once visitors pull on the bison horn door handle and step inside, wonder awaits. Glistening blocks of ice form a service bar, cocktail tables and couches. Seating is covered in elk hides with coyote fur armrests. Sitting at about 6,600 feet of elevation, 400 feet higher than Jackson, Bondurant is the coldest place in Wyoming, with an average low January temperature of 5 degrees below zero. It’s surrounded by mountains and is a “cold sink,” according to Mountain Weather columnist and meteorologist Jim Woodmencey.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/01/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/04/08/disney-smiles-boardwalk-shots-parklet-program-news-around-states/115680484/", "title": "Disney smiles, boardwalk shots: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Gov. Kay Ivey said Wednesday that the state is shifting to personal responsibility in the fight against COVID-19, keeping her promise to let a statewide face mask order expire Friday. Ivey said she’s issuing a “greatly slimmed down” health order that has few restrictions. It encourages people to keep taking precautions such as voluntarily wearing masks but no longer includes a statewide mask order. Alabama opened vaccine eligibility to anyone 16 and older two days ago, and state health officials said virus hospitalizations, percentage of positive tests and daily case numbers are hitting some of the lowest numbers in a year. But Alabama also ranks last in the country for the percentage of people who have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “We are finally rounding the corner. While we haven’t whipped this deadly disease just yet, it appears that, thank the good Lord, we are in the home stretch. Please, please continue to use good common sense, and we will see the end of COVID-19 soon,” Ivey said. The Republican governor said she’ll keep wearing a mask around others after Friday and urged other Alabamians to do the same. She also urged people to respect businesses who require customers to wear masks.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Anchorage School District will implement weekly coronavirus tests for high school hockey players after at least 64 students either tested positive for the virus or were told to quarantine because they were in close contact with someone who had. The district said all the cases can be linked to two recent competitive hockey tournaments, Alaska’s News Source reports. “Unfortunately, we’ve gotten to the point where we have enough positive cases related to hockey that we are having to take extra precautions to keep schools open and keep kids safe while they are participating in ASD hockey,” said Kersten Johnson, the Anchorage School District’s senior director of secondary education. Johnson said the district will pay for the tests, and starting next week they will test for the virus until the end of the season. Players who have received the vaccine do not have to test, nor those who have tested positive in the past 90 days. The school district is also testing high school wrestlers every week as required by an executive order by the mayor. “For hockey, it is a little bit different. We’ve seen a rise in cases that are associated with hockey and felt the need to take that precaution,” Johnson said. The district’s high school hockey season was pushed back to the spring because of public health orders that deemed indoor gatherings inappropriate.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Pima County can continue to enforce its face-mask mandates to reduce the spread of the coronavirus in spite of an executive order issued by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey that bars local orders, according to an informal opinion issued by Arizona’s attorney general Tuesday. However, the opinion issued by Attorney General Mark Brnovich’s office said the governor could order the state health department to issue rules barring local mandates or ignore the opinion and try to enforce his executive order on his own. Three Republican lawmakers sought the opinion late last month after Pima County’s health department said it would continue to enforce its mask mandate despite Ducey’s new order barring local rules. Ducey cited lower COVID-19 cases and rising vaccination rates to end most business restrictions and revoke the ability of cities and counties to issue mask mandates. The opinion came on the same day Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego said she would keep the city’s mask mandate in place. “I stand with the majority of the Phoenix City Council who agree that the governor’s unilateral decision to order cities to abandon mask requirements is a case of significant government overreach,” Gallego said in a statement. “The governor’s authority is not without limits.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Tuesday that he opposes government-mandated COVID-19 “vaccine passports” to access services, but he also said private businesses should have the right to require vaccinations. The governor echoed other Republicans’ opposition to state-required proof of vaccination. However, he said he favored giving employers latitude to require vaccinations, comparing them to drug tests. “I think you have to give latitude to the private sector,” Hutchinson said, saying some venues may want to make vaccinations a requirement to enter. “As a government, no, the state is not going to be requiring or mandating vaccinations.” A state bill filed last week would prohibit government-mandated vaccine passports. The Department of Health said Arkansas’ coronavirus cases rose by 163 to 331,261 total since the pandemic began last year. The state’s COVID-19 deaths grew by five to 5,653. The state’s active cases, meaning ones that don’t include people who have died or recovered, dropped by five to 1,602. COVID-19 hospitalizations rose by seven to 152. More than 1.2 million of the nearly 1.9 million vaccine doses allocated to the state have been administered so far, the department said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nOxnard: A gym owner is protesting a Ventura County panel’s vote to drop lawsuits against businesses that violated COVID-19 health orders while she could be forced to close over the high costs of obeying the rules. “It felt like a punch to the gut,” said Vanessa White, who with her husband, Kevin, co-owns Santa Paula Fitness. The Board of Supervisors unanimously decided in mid-March to dismiss suits against three gyms and two restaurants that allegedly refused to close their indoor operations as required by the state’s purple-tier limits. The establishments were the lone holdouts after county officials settled with the other 13 businesses the board sued over the issue, attorneys said. After voting in a closed session devoted to litigation, supervisors described the decision as an “act of goodwill” that came in concert with the state’s loosening of indoor restrictions under the more permissive red tier. Since then, they have acknowledged that the suits became moot after the state relaxed the rules. It’s not clear how many fines have been levied against the businesses, but penalties appear to be minimal. Only two citations amounting to $500 could be substantiated Friday. White said she applied for every form of aid she could for her business over the past year but owes $75,000 in back rent.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state has reported its first two cases of a coronavirus variant first found in Brazil that has proven adept at infecting people who previously contracted the virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notified the state health department that two Boulder County residents tested positive for the variant, The Denver Post reports. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said it is investigating whether they traveled to other countries or states where the variant is spreading and is also attempting to find other people who were potentially exposed. Officials did not identify the two people or say whether they lived in the same household. It was not immediately known if they had symptoms. The CDC has reported 289 cases of the same variant in 25 states across the U.S. Health officials in Colorado have collected a sample in all coronavirus cases for genetic sequencing tests to determine which variants are spreading and where. Officials have found 1,268 cases linked to “variants of concern,” versions of the virus believed to be more contagious, more severe, and more difficult for immune systems to identify and destroy. The state health department has urged residents to continue following safety guidelines, including wearing masks and social distancing.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: State officials are looking into the possibility of eventually having to administer booster shots of COVID-19 vaccines in nursing homes, while also vaccinating new residents and staff who are coming into the facilities without having had a shot, Gov. Ned Lamont said Monday. About 5% of the nursing home population has been turning over each week in Connecticut. The newcomers are overwhelmingly not vaccinated, said Josh Geballe, Lamont’s chief operating officer. As a short-term fix, the state has asked the Connecticut National Guard to vaccinate those new admissions. “But in the meantime, we’ve also been working with our acute care hospitals to make sure that they’re vaccinating on discharge,” Geballe said, adding that nursing homes have been told they need to have a “vaccination partner” established with a pharmacy or other organization. Lamont told reporters his administration has been “thinking about” the possibility of having to administer booster shots to nursing home residents, a segment of the population that was hit especially hard by the pandemic. Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration and a Connecticut resident, said it’s a “an open question” whether younger people will get a booster shot.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth: From frying french fries to greeting guests, the state’s coastal businesses rely on a strong workforce to meet the tourists and residents who flock to their favorite restaurants, hotels and shops in the summer. But as more people get vaccinated against COVID-19 and make plans to hit the beaches, “help wanted” signs remain in many windows up and down the coast. Some business owners have called this year’s hiring season a “nightmare,” while others in the hospitality industry worry an employee shortage may worsen if the state further lifts pandemic-related restrictions and capacity limits. Especially after a winter that has been one of the busiest on the books for many businesses in Delaware’s resort towns, owners and managers are bracing for a busy summer season and hoping they have enough staff to ride the wave. While some beach businesses hire employees year-round, and others quadruple their staff during the summer, employers consistently say they’re feeling the pressure this year. Some are getting creative, calling local schools in hopes of finding students on summer break or flagging people down on the street as they walk by the restaurant. The Rehoboth Beach-Dewey Beach Chamber of Commerce heard from enough businesses that it plans to host a job fair for the first time in years.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: In another sign of a return to pre-pandemic normalcy, the John F. Kennedy Center for Performing Arts has announced plans for its 50th anniversary season, including a September grand reopening, WUSA-TV reports. The Kennedy Center canceled its season last year but began welcoming some people back for performances in September 2020 as part of a D.C. pilot program. The mid-September reactivation of the Kennedy Center campus will include an opening curated and hosted by Michael Tilson Thomas and the unveiling of two immersive, interactive exhibits, plus a new life-size statue of John F. Kennedy on the grounds of the REACH, the Kennedy Center said in a release. The new season will include four artist residencies – including from The Roots and jazz artist Robert Glaspar – and numerous new works. “I can think of no better way to reemerge from the darkness of these last many months than to reopen with a vibrant, season-long celebration of the center’s rich history and the bright future of the arts in our nation,” Kennedy Center President Deborah F. Rutter said.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: At Walt Disney World, the smiles won’t have to be hidden for much longer. Starting Thursday, visitors to the theme park resort will be able to remove their masks temporarily for outdoor photos, the company said on its website. The change tweaks a requirement that all workers and visitors age 2 and up wear masks except when they are actively eating or drinking, provided they are socially distanced and not moving about. The mask mandate includes those who already have been vaccinated. Workers and visitors have been required to wear masks, get temperature checks upon arriving and follow social distancing markers while in line ever since the Florida theme park resort reopened last summer after closing for more than two months because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens: The Athens-Clarke parklet program was extended Tuesday, and the College Square outdoor dining plaza is now permanent. The parklet program was introduced at the start of the pandemic when the need arose for safe outdoor dining. Parklets were created by converting business-adjacent parking spaces or small sections of road into mini-parks with small dining areas. Tuesday’s commission vote extended the program, as well as the outdoor retail areas pilot program. The Washington Street outdoor retail program permits outdoor dining space and alcohol service for restaurants and retail stores in the area. The parklet program is tied to the COVID-19 local emergency ordinance currently in place, so the program will be extended for as long as that order is active. As a part of the extension, commissioners voted to have the Government Operations Committee develop plans for an ongoing parklet program that would continue past the emergency ordinance. Once that plan is developed, commissioners would vote on whether to make the parklets permanent sometime this summer, which would allow for a smooth transition from the temporary program.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The island of Kauai has rejoined the state’s Safe Travels program, which means out-of-state visitors can skip quarantining if they test negative for the coronavirus up to 72 hours before their flight. As of Monday, travelers to Kauai were allowed to bypass a 10-day quarantine by presenting pre-travel negative coronavirus tests, Hawaii News Now reports. The county had opted out of the program in December because of the global rise in virus infections. “We are now in a much better place today to have travelers coming in, and I think as more vaccines get out, generally speaking, the entire world will be in a better place,” Kauai Mayor Derek Kawakami said. The island since December welcomed back some interisland travelers and adopted “resort bubbles.” The county’s resort bubble program, or Enhanced Movement Quarantine, allowed visitors to travel to Kauai if they got two negative coronavirus tests and spent three days either on another island or at a county-approved resort property. If they stayed at one of the resorts, they wore monitoring devices but could roam the resorts’ grounds and use amenities. Kawakami said rejoining the Safe Travels program will help buoy local businesses that struggled because of the public health restrictions.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little issued an executive order Wednesday banning state government from requiring or issuing COVID-19 “vaccine passports.” The Republican governor is also preventing state agencies from providing information on a person’s vaccine status to individuals, companies or government entities. Little, who has gotten the vaccine, said he strongly encourages others to get vaccinated as well. But he said he has serious concerns that a vaccine passport requirement will violate medical privacy rights. The White House has ruled out a national “vaccine passport,” saying it is leaving it to up the private sector if companies want to develop a system for people to show they’ve been vaccinated. All Idaho residents age 16 and older are now eligible to get a vaccine. About 70% of residents age 65 and over have already opted to get a shot. State officials say more than 325,000 Idahoans are fully vaccinated, and an additional 170,000 have received one dose of vaccines requiring two doses. More than 180,000 people in Idaho have been infected with COVID-19, and nearly 2,000 have died. About 1.8 million people live in the state.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday urged Chicago union members to share their experience receiving a COVID-19 vaccine and act as “role models” for family and friends who may be reluctant even as the state prepares to open access to all adults. Harris visited a vaccination site in the city that opened last week for union workers. Chicago officials also hope the dedicated site will improve vaccination rates among Black and Latino city residents. After touring the site, Harris spoke to union members and said the site was “a model for the country” and told a group that their next task is encouraging others to receive a vaccine once eligible. “We’re all here to make a statement we understand the significance of getting vaccinated, that it’s bigger than us,” she said. “We are doing it because we know this is a room of role models, and people look to you to see how things should be done.” Illinois health authorities reported 2,931 confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19 on Tuesday and 13 additional deaths. Since the start of the pandemic, Illinois has reported more than 1.2 million cases and 21,395 deaths. The state plans to open vaccine access to everyone 16 and older starting Monday.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Bars and restaurants say they have not heard from public health officials after reports that an NCAA fan who visited a number of local restaurants died of complications from COVID-19 after leaving the city. Shapiro’s Delicatessen was one of the restaurants University of Alabama student Luke Ratliff visited while in Indianapolis to watch the Crimson Tide basketball team compete. On March 20, Ratliff tweeted a picture of a Shapiro’s pastrami on rye piled high on a plate and a bowl of mac and cheese, both sitting on a blue tray. Owner Brian Shapiro said an employee confirmed Ratliff’s visit, and it was his understanding the 23-year-old wore a mask, picked up a takeout order and left. But after seeing the picture from Ratliff’s Twitter account, Shapiro said it does appear Ratliff dined in. “The contact tracers should have been on top of this,” he said, adding that he blames Alabama “for not being proactive enough” more than local and state health officials. “The bigger question is why didn’t Alabama be more proactive with our board of health?” Shapiro said. Neither health officials nor contact tracers have reached out to his restaurant. Restaurants have a particular reason to be on edge after at least nine employees of the renowned St. Elmo Steak House contracted the coronavirus, and a longtime bartender died.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: Coronavirus cases are on the rise again this week in city schools, resulting in 12 classrooms being temporarily closed due to exposure and more than 500 children in quarantine. Among those quarantined are 564 students and 22 staff, while 99 students and four staff tested positive for the virus, according to the school district’s data dashboard. Staff in the district of roughly 14,000 students have been vaccinated against COVID-19. The district follows the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for close-contact quarantine after exposure to the virus. Students and employees will be asked to quarantine if they spend 15 cumulative minutes within 6 feet of someone positive for the virus over a 24-hour period. If that happens in a classroom, students and staff may be asked to quarantine, resulting in a temporary classroom closure. Earlier this school year, the state of Iowa broke with the CDC’s guidance and said quarantine isn’t necessary if masks were worn at the time of the exposure. Iowa City schools sided with the CDC and still require quarantine regardless of mask usage. Iowa City’s rise in cases is mirrored across the state. At a news conference last week, Gov. Kim Reynolds acknowledged that cases have been rising but said she has “not seen evidence to suggest it’s leading down a concerning path.”\n\nKansas\n\nValley Center: The city’s school district is considering dropping its mask mandates and social distancing rules after a former Sedgwick County commissioner complained the policies are “irrational” because the number of COVID-19 cases is declining. The school board held a special meeting Monday in response to the complaint from former commissioner Richard Ranzau, who invoked a new state law that requires a school board hearing within three days of a complaint being filed and a final decision within a week of the hearing. On Tuesday, the Blue Valley School District in Overland Park canceled a similar hearing after a man who attended refused to wear a mask or leave. The Valley Center board decided to meet again Thursday to vote on the objection. The district had planned to keep the restrictions in place for the final weeks of the school year, The Wichita Eagle reports. Ranzau, whose son attends Valley Center High School, said the restrictions implemented in August are no longer valid because COVID-19 infection rates in Sedgwick County have dropped to between 3% and 4%, and school employees now all have access to vaccinations. The district, however, estimated only about half of its 550 total staff have been vaccinated.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear signed bills Wednesday directing more than $1billion in federal relief money for big-ticket items including broadband expansion, school construction and water projects. The infusion of federal money offers a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” for long-term investments to attract businesses, create thousands of jobs and improve quality of life, the Democratic governor said. It will also strengthen the state’s competitiveness in the post-pandemic economy, he said. A bipartisan group of lawmakers joined Beshear as he signed bills appropriating money flowing from the pandemic aid package championed by President Joe Biden and passed by congressional Democrats – including Kentucky’s lone Democratic congressman, John Yarmuth. State government in Kentucky is expected to eventually receive about $2.4 billion. Bills appropriating chunks of the aid passed shortly before Kentucky’s legislative session ended. “Everyone saw the potential,” Beshear said. “Everyone agreed that it was the right thing to do. And that now is the time to capitalize on this once-in-a-lifetime chance – a chance to invest in our people and a chance to rocket forward into our future.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport: A teachers union has sued a northwest Louisiana school system, saying a $1,000 bonus discriminates against women, older workers and disabled people. The Caddo Parish School Board approved the “Caddo Heroes Stipend Allocation” for full-time employees who were present for at least 90% of their scheduled workdays during the 2020-21 school year. Red River United, a local of the American Federation of Teachers, filed its lawsuit Monday and announced it at a news conference the same day, news outlets report. “This year has been grueling, and every employee who has shown up for our students is a hero. That doesn’t change just because someone had to take time off to have a baby or went in for emergency surgery,” union President Jackie Lansdale said, according to KSLA-TV. Lansdale said Tuesday that with 3,000 members in Bossier, Caddo and Red River parishes, Red River United is the state’s largest local representing teachers and other school workers. Teacher aide Amanda Lowery told the news conference she can’t get the supplement because, as a paraprofessional, she does not get maternity leave and had to take extended sick leave, at 65% pay, after having a baby in February, The Times reports. “I was excited when I heard about the heroes pay, but then once they said I can’t get it, it’s like, well, what am I going to do now?” Lowrey said.\n\nMaine\n\nCalais: The state will work with the Federal Emergency Management Agency to get COVID-19 vaccines to residents in rural and underserved communities, officials with the state said Tuesday. The administration of Democratic Gov. Janet Mills said the state and FEMA will partner on a mobile vaccination unit, only the second of its kind in New England. The unit will start by bringing vaccines to Oxford on Monday, the governor’s office said. It will then go to 10 other communities in Maine, including Fryeburg, Calais and Madawaska, the office said. “The clinic will complement our existing vaccination efforts well and allow people in rural communities to more easily get the vaccine, protecting their health and that of their loved ones and helping us to win the fight against COVID-19,” Mills said in a statement. The governor’s office said the unit is expected to vaccinate at least 250 people per day. It will use the one-shot vaccine from Johnson & Johnson, the office said. Appointments will be required, Maine Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Jeanne Lambrew said. Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, called the use of the unit “a major step forward” for Maine’s vaccination effort. Maine is one of the most rural states in the U.S.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan continues to back his administration’s purchase of 500,000 coronavirus tests from South Korea, even after a blistering legislative audit last week concluded that the procurement process was deeply flawed. At a news conference Monday, Hogan called the audit report “partisan nonsense” and said he “wouldn’t change a single thing.” “I’m still very happy with the tremendous success of acquiring these test kits,” he said. “It was probably one of the biggest accomplishments throughout this pandemic.” Hogan has lauded the purchase of the tests as an example of international cooperation in the early days of the pandemic, when testing and other resources were scarce. But the tests have since become a thorn in the Republican governor’s side, creating fodder for critics who say the purchase was little more than an expensive spectacle. The half-million virus tests had to be returned, largely unused, and replaced with new ones after a Maryland laboratory found they did not comply with federal regulations. The combined cost of both batches, plus a chartered flight for the first set of tests, came in at about $12 million, according to the legislative audit released Friday.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Gov. Charlie Baker received his COVID-19 vaccine Tuesday. The Republican governor got his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine at the Hynes Convention Center in Boston. Baker, 64, has repeatedly said he would not move to the head of the vaccination line but would instead wait until he was eligible under federal guidelines. Massachusetts on Monday opened vaccine eligibility to residents 55 and older, as well as to all adults with one of several medical conditions that put them at greater risk from the disease. Baker said he preregistered and was notified last week that he could receive the vaccine. “So far I feel great,” the Republican told reporters. “This vaccine is a critical tool to end the pandemic. It’s also a critical tool to help people feel safe and to help them protect themselves, their families, their friends, their co-workers, their neighbors.” The Hynes site opened last month to replace a mass vaccination site at Fenway Park, which closed because it was needed for the 2021 Red Sox season. CIC Health, which is running the site, said last month that the two-shot Pfizer vaccine will be administered at the Hynes, subject to change depending on vaccine availability.\n\nMichigan\n\nAnn Arbor: The University of Michigan will stick to a virtual graduation ceremony but allow graduates to at least watch the event on screens inside the football stadium, officials said. The university has been criticized by some parents and students for not having a traditional graduation in the stadium even as COVID-19 vaccines become widely available and as restrictions on large gatherings are eased. The football stadium now can be opened at 20% capacity, a reason that was given Thursday for opening it to graduates May 1. The commencement speakers will be elsewhere but visible on screens at the Big House. Family members cannot be inside the stadium. “We’re grateful that changes in public health guidelines and conditions in our student community now allow us to offer the experience of being together in Michigan Stadium when their hard-earned degrees are conferred,” President Mark Schlissel said. It’s the second year that a traditional graduation has been canceled at U-M because of the coronavirus.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: State health officials on Tuesday reported nearly 500 residents are hospitalized due to the coronavirus as case numbers continue to rise despite the state’s vaccination campaign. The Minnesota Department of Health on Tuesday reported 3,014 new confirmed cases and four more deaths over the past three days. Reporting had been delayed due to a technical issue on Saturday and the Easter holiday Sunday. Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm expressed concern at the growing number of cases, citing a seven-day test positivity rate of 6% that continues to show signs of increasing after climbing above the caution threshold of 5% last week. “You’ve heard us mention a number of times, especially in the recent couple of weeks, that we’re definitely not out of the woods yet with this pandemic,” Malcolm said during a news conference. She said hospital bed use due to COVID-19 has increased 40% in the past 10 days, and 497 Minnesotans were hospitalized Tuesday, including 114 in intensive care. Malcolm said the state’s efforts to prioritize vaccinations in populations most vulnerable to the virus could prevent a spike in cases, hospitalizations and deaths as seen during a surge late last year.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state is receiving about $29.7 million from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to support COVID-19 vaccination efforts. The award is part of $3 billion in coronavirus relief funding approved by Congress to bolster vaccinations, particularly among minority populations. “We are doing everything we can to expand access to vaccinations,” CDC Director Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky said Tuesday. “Millions of Americans are getting vaccinated every day, but we need to ensure that we are reaching those in the communities hit hardest by this pandemic.” About 75% of the total funding must focus on specific initiatives intended to increase vaccine access and acceptance among racial and ethnic minority communities. At least 60% must go to support local health departments, community-based organizations and community health centers. Funds can be used to train trusted community members to conduct door-to-door outreach to raise awareness about COVID-19 vaccines and help individuals sign up for appointments, according to the CDC. Money can also be used to hire community health workers who perform culturally competent bilingual health outreach.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: The health department on Tuesday announced it identified the state’s first case of a new coronavirus variant. Missouri’s Department of Health and Senior Services announced a Jackson County resident tested positive for a variant first identified in South Africa. The agency said a commercial lab identified the variant during genome sequencing. Health department Director Dr. Randall Williams in a statement urged people to continue taking preventative measures, such as wearing a mask and social distancing, as new variants spread to Missouri. “We also continue to ask that individuals consider getting vaccinated when they are able,” Williams said. “The vaccines that are currently available in the United States appear to be effective against these variant viruses.” Missouri found cases of another variant, this one first identified in the United Kingdom, back in February. The agency said there are at least 35 active cases of that faster-spreading variant in the state.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state has a new program to provide rental assistance for people who have lost income and are at risk of housing instability due to the pandemic, Gov. Greg Gianforte said Tuesday. The Legislature has appropriated $17 million in federal funding for the Montana Emergency Rental Assistance program. State officials estimate it will help about 8,000 renters stay in their homes. “The last year has brought real, serious challenges to hardworking Montana families through no fault of their own,” Gianforte said in a statement. “Emergency rental assistance will help Montanans, who have struggled financially through this pandemic, get back on their feet and remain secure in their homes.” Gross household income cannot exceed 80% of the area median income for renters to be eligible for the program. For example, income for a family of four in Missoula County cannot exceed $60,150, while income for a family of three in Yellowstone County cannot exceed $57,600. Renters can receive a monthly maximum of $2,200 for past-due and future rent payments, up to $300 for past-due and future utilities including gas and electric, and $50 per month for internet. Households can access assistance dating back to April 1, 2020.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Residents who stop working temporarily to care for a family member with a serious health condition could claim unemployment benefits under a bill that state lawmakers advanced Tuesday. Legislators gave the measure first-round approval with a 27-11 vote. The proposal by Sen. Megan Hunt, of Omaha, would allow workers to collect benefits if they left a job due to family caregiving needs but are planning to return to work. Hunt said the bill will help caregivers who might otherwise struggle financially while caring for a loved one and will help the state avoid costly long-term care services in cases where no one else is available to take care of the person with a health condition. Some senators objected to the cost. The Nebraska Department of Labor estimates that, based on 2020 data, the state will pay out $749,927 in unemployment benefits each year. Hunt argued that 2020 is a bad year to use as a measurement because of the coronavirus pandemic, which left many people severely ill and caused unemployment to surge.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: State and federal health officials are taking mobile COVID-19 vaccination units this week to the Nye County community of Pahrump and a northern Nevada tribal site in Carson City. In Las Vegas, a drive-thru COVID-19 testing site was open Wednesday at Allegiant Stadium. The Southern Nevada Health District reported Tuesday that it had more vaccination slots available than people booking appointments at its biggest shot sites. The Cashman Center conference hall near downtown has not reached its capacity of 7,000 appointments a day, district official JoAnn Rupiper said. Sites also are open at the Las Vegas Convention Center and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas student union. Everyone 16 and older in Nevada became eligible to receive the vaccine Monday, and officials on Tuesday reported the percentage of the state population fully vaccinated topped 21%. Two Federal Emergency Management Agency mobile vaccination units are traveling the state for 30 days to offer shots to people in places where medical facilities are otherwise limited. Officials aim to provide at least 250 shots a day of the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine to walk-up registrants ages 18 and older.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan says state residents have lost more than $950,000 to pandemic-related fraud, identity theft and other scams, and she’s pushing federal officials to do more to stop it. Hassan, a Democrat, wrote to the Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday asking how it plans to use $30.4 million in pandemic relief funding to combat scammers she called “a danger to the health and financial security of Americans.” As of Monday, the commission had received more than 425,000 reports of such scams, Hassan said, including 1,461 from New Hampshire. The scams include offering quick access to stimulus payments and phony treatments to prevent or cure COVID-19. Meanwhile, more than 86,000 people have tested positive for the coronavirus in New Hampshire, including 402 cases announced Tuesday. No new deaths were announced, keeping the total at 1,249. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in New Hampshire has risen over the past two weeks from 295 new cases per day March 22 to 401 new cases per day Monday.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: An assemblyman wants extra coronavirus testing and vaccination sites at the Jersey Shore, perhaps along the boardwalk for the summer season. Assemblyman Ronald S. Dancer – a Republican who represents a district that includes Allentown, Englishtown, Manalapan, Matawan, Roosevelt, Upper Freehold, Jackson and Plumsted – called for the state Department of Health to send more COVID-19 resources toward the coast in anticipation of warm-weather crowds. “The state could help protect the health and safety of tourism and hospitality professionals, year-round coastal residents, and tourists considering vacations at the shore, by setting up mobile coronavirus testing and vaccination units along the boardwalk or other prominent locations,” Dancer said in a news release Tuesday. “This would support an economic recovery down the shore while responsibly addressing coronavirus concerns.” Tourism contributes about $41 billion toward the state’s economy each year, according to the New Jersey Tourism Industry Association. Tourism-related taxes save each household $1,545 in property taxes annually, according to the association. In Asbury Park, social distancing measures resulted in a $700,000 drop from previous years in beach badge revenue, Mayor John Moor said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The New Mexico National Guard and Civil Air Patrol have logged more than 1.6 million miles over the past year as part of the state’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, and officials say the work is not over as they try to get more people vaccinated. New Mexico on Monday made all residents 16 and older eligible for the vaccine. About 30% of the state’s eligible population already is fully vaccinated, and nearly half the population has received a first shot, according to the latest state data. Guard soldiers have been operating a vaccine distribution center in southeast Albuquerque, which U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich toured Tuesday. The effort will benefit from funding included in the federal government’s most recent pandemic relief package, specifically $20 billion that the New Mexico Democrat said will supercharge vaccine distributions nationwide. The recovery package also included $50 billion for testing, genomic sequencing of virus variants and contact tracing. New Mexico also will get nearly $7 million in grants from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, on top of nearly $21 million previously awarded to the state Department of Health, as a result of the U.S. government waiving all cost-sharing requirements related to the federal disaster declaration issued last year.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Lawmakers and Gov. Andrew Cuomo struck a budget deal that capped nursing home profits and established how much the long-term care facilities must spend on resident care and staffing. The nursing home industry reforms include a 5% cap on profits as well as requiring facilities to spend a minimum of 70% of revenue on direct resident care, according to budget documents released Tuesday. Nursing homes must also spend a minimum of 40% of revenue on resident-facing staffing, provided that the amount shall be included as part of the spending on resident care. The new provisions would take effect Jan. 1, 2022, the documents show. The reforms are part of the $212 billion budget on which state lawmakers were voting Tuesday night after missing the deadline to have a spending plan at the beginning of the fiscal year, which started April 1. “Every day, families across the state entrust the safety and health of their loved ones to nursing homes, and as this unprecedented public health crisis has shown, some performed admirably, but some did not,” Cuomo said in February, revealing some details of the reforms. Cuomo on Tuesday also signed a bill repealing COVID-19 legal liability protections granted to nursing homes and hospitals, under the Emergency Disaster Treatment Protection Act.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: Making shelter a right and boosting Buncombe County’s community paramedics, a program touted by police-defunding activists, are among priorities listed by City Council members for an expected $26million in federal pandemic aid. The money would come from the recently passed $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan whose details local governments are awaiting to understand how exactly they can spend the money. Council members talked about the massive aid injection – equal to about 13% of the city’s nearly $200 million budget – during a March 31-April 1 retreat. More recently, several council members responded to questions about their priorities for the money, noting those could change after they learn more about spending guidelines. Among priorities were focusing on rising homelessness, including making shelter a basic right; setting up a low-barrier shelter for people turned away from other places; and expanding on the county’s community paramedic program that seeks to address mental health, substance abuse and other issues without the need for law enforcement intervention. “I think it is pretty clear that cities have been experiencing an exponential increase in homeless,” Mayor Esther Manheimer said Friday, noting she has heard similar stories from other mayors.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state Supreme Court plans to resume in-person oral arguments in June. The Bismarck Tribune reports in-person arguments will be subject to parties agreeing to appear physically. If either party wants to appear remotely, the proceedings will be conducted entirely electronically. District courts will still have discretion to conduct proceedings remotely. Chief Justice Jon Jensen said some courts may decide to increase in-person appearances, but available facilities and local restrictions will dictate how proceedings are conducted. The Supreme Court also is considering making some pandemic protocols permanent, such as allowing defendants to plead guilty to Class C felonies in writing without appearing in court. The justices have met in person occasionally for case conferences, but they haven’t met for any hearings, according to State Court Administrator Sally Holewa. Justice Gerald VandeWalle, 87, was hospitalized due to COVID-19 twice last summer.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Several Republican lawmakers want to make sure those who don’t want a COVID-19 shot don’t face any penalties because of that decision. A state House bill introduced Wednesday would allow Ohioans to decline a COVID-19 shot – or any other vaccine – because of religious reasons, medical reasons or natural immunity. The proposal would prevent anyone who chooses not to be vaccinated from facing discrimination, being denied services or forced to require masks, or facing other penalties financial or social from businesses, schools or government. “This is a matter of freedom,” state Rep. Jennifer Gross, R-West Chester, said of her bill. “The purpose of this legislation is to allow people to choose to do what they feel is best for their own body and protect individuals from any consequences or hardships for choosing one way or the other.” Gross’ bill is backed by Ohio Advocates for Medical Freedom, an anti-vaccination group that advocates for the right to choose or refuse any medical treatment or procedure. The bill also is supported by 15 GOP lawmakers, several of whom told reporters they’d forgo the shot or wait to get one. Gross, a nurse practitioner who said she’s pro-vaccine, told the Dayton Daily News she would wait to get a COVID-19 vaccine, preferring “to watch it for a couple of years.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state will drop its residency requirement for COVID-19 vaccinations, the health department announced Wednesday. Beginning Thursday, the state will offer vaccines to people who reside in neighboring states and beyond. The Oklahoma State Department of Health said increasing supply and progress in the state’s vaccination efforts allowed for the change. Oklahoma is among the first states in the U.S. to openly offer its vaccines to nonresidents, according to the health department. Several Native American tribes also have been offering vaccinations to anyone old enough, regardless of affiliation or residence. So far, about 27% of adults in Oklahoma are fully vaccinated, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nearly 44% have had at least one dose. Deputy Commissioner of Health Keith Reed said in a statement that the state was happy to welcome its neighbors in an effort to put an end to COVID-19 in the region. He hoped other states that have fared well in vaccine administration would follow suit. “This virus does not adhere to boundaries drawn on a map, so by ensuring high vaccination rates across the region – not just Oklahoma – we are providing an extra layer of protection for our residents,” Reed said. Recently, Oklahoma has seen more appointments go unfilled.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A measure that would reinstate and extend a moratorium on foreclosures until Sept. 1 amid the COVID-19 pandemic passed the state’s House of Representatives on Tuesday. Unlike the bill that was passed by lawmakers last June, the new legislation would not protect commercial property owners – those who own more than five properties or properties with more than four housing units. The moratorium would be retroactive to Dec. 3 and could be extended until the end of 2021 by the governor. The latest bill, which passed in the House 38-21, moves to the state Senate. “I assure you that Oregonians need this sort of protection. Without it, I fear that we face even more economic distress,” said Rep. Paul Holvey, D-Eugene. “More Oregonians will become homeless if this bill does not pass.” In March, more than 6% of Oregon homeowners – more than 65,000 – said they were not caught up on their mortgage payments, based on the U.S. Census Bureau’s most recent Household Pulse Survey. Financial hardships during the pandemic have only exacerbated the state’s ongoing housing crisis, making the issue a top priority for lawmakers, even prior to this legislative session.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Vaccination appointments in the city will be open to anyone 16 and older starting April 19, but health officials are still asking younger, healthy adults to wait to schedule appointments. The city’s health commissioner, Dr. Thomas Farley, announced the moved-up date for opening vaccines to the general public Tuesday. Department officials had said in previous updates that they wanted to wait until May 1 because they were worried that younger, tech-savvy Philadelphians would schedule appointments quickly, making it more difficult for those at most risk of serious illness or death from COVID-19 to find appointments. Farley said President Joe Biden had asked Philadelphia and other cities around the country to move up their plans to open vaccines to anyone who wanted them to April 19. Philadelphia on Monday opened vaccine appointments to the last of its priority groups, which includes sanitation workers and postal workers. Farley said he has asked vaccine providers to keep making older people a priority, as well as those with health concerns. On Tuesday, he asked younger, healthier residents not to make a rush on the system when it opens appointments.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Opening regional vaccination sites is critical to helping make sure that everyone in the state who wants a COVID-19 shot has access, even if they can’t make it to a mass vaccination site, Gov. Daniel McKee said Wednesday. The Democrat, after touring new regional sites in Westerly and East Providence, said 97% of all Rhode Islanders have access to a vaccination site within a 15-minute drive. The East Providence site opened in collaboration with Barrington, Warren, Bristol, Pawtucket and Tiverton. The state currently has the capacity to administer 160,000 shots a week, something he expects will soon expand to 200,000 per week, accelerating the state’s economic reopening plan. “Every piece that we’re putting in place is critical,” he said. “Everywhere where we can get more and more people identified that they’re ready to get the shot, we’re going to be in a better spot when the supply starts meeting our demand.” The goal is to make it safe enough to have parades and fireworks on July Fourth and for the summer folk and jazz festivals in Newport. “We’ll get back to that kind of summer that we all want to enjoy,” he said. A little more than 25% of the state’s population has already been fully vaccinated, according to state Department of Health statistics released Wednesday.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: The American Civil Liberties Union sued Gov. Henry McMaster this week, arguing that his executive order requiring state agencies to “immediately expedite” employees’ return to the office amid the coronavirus pandemic exceeds the governor’s authority. The complaint, filed Monday in state court, asked that a judge halt McMaster’s order, which the ACLU said “is contrary to the safety, security, and welfare of the state.” “Governor McMaster’s return-to-in-person-work order ignores public health guidelines and the continuing serious health risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and people with disabilities, women, and caregivers will bear the brunt of the impact,” ACLU of South Carolina legal director Susan Dunn said in a statement. McMaster issued the order last month, as vaccinations ramped up and cases declined, advising state agencies to “immediately expedite” the return of nonessential state employees to in-person work. According to the lawsuit, the order, which affects more than 24,000 state employees, was issued on a day when there were 776 new COVID-19 cases in South Carolina, with a seven-day moving average of 1,224 cases per day. The plaintiff, an employee at the College of Charleston, said she has been working remotely for a year and also caring for her son while he does virtual learning at home.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson received a shot of a COVID-19 vaccine Tuesday as part of an effort to promote widespread vaccinations in order to extinguish the pandemic. “This is how we get back to normal,” Johnson, a Republican, said shortly after receiving the shot at a Sanford Health facility. South Dakota opened vaccine eligibility to anyone 16 and older Monday, and it has recorded one of the nation’s highest rates of people fully vaccinated. But the congressman noted that as a man in his 40s, he represented a demographic that has been hesitant to get a vaccine. Although Johnson had an opportunity to get the vaccine when members of Congress received early access, he decided to wait until it was widely available. “Now is the time for people to step up, even if they’re young, even if they’re healthy,” he said. The state reported no new deaths Wednesday for a sixth day in a row, leaving the total pandemic death count in the state at 1,938. That’s the longest South Dakota has gone without recording a new death since this time last year. Nearly half of adult residents have gotten at least one dose of a vaccine.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee on Tuesday joined fellow Republicans nationwide in advocating against COVID-19 vaccine passports, which are being developed in some areas of the world to let inoculated people travel, shop and dine more freely. No city, county or government entity in Tennessee appears to have suggested forcing businesses to require patrons to show a vaccine passport. The legislation Lee is supporting, brought this week in the General Assembly, raises questions about existing vaccination requirements in public schools. The bill moving through the Legislature would not prevent a private business from instituting its own vaccine requirements, according to a copy of the proposed amendment. It passed the House health subcommittee Tuesday. “I think vaccine passports are a bad idea. I do not believe that government should impose vaccine requirements or mandates in any way,” Lee told reporters, while urging the GOP-controlled General Assembly to advance the legislation. Lee said he hoped private businesses also don’t impose vaccine passport mandates but said he doesn’t believe “that government should impose itself in the private affairs of business practices.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Fed up with difficulties related to COVID-19 vaccine access, multiple Vietnamese American organizations in the city say they’re taking it upon themselves to help vulnerable populations within their community. While Austin Public Health has distributed translated information regarding COVID-19 vaccines, those who work directly with the local Vietnamese community say the resources are not reaching people, namely those who are older in age, because of barriers related to language, culture and technology. “We have older people who do not speak English, who don’t know how to get on to the website; they don’t know how to register,” said Tony Pham, 67, a member of the Austin Vietnamese Senior Citizens Association. The channels through which seniors in the Vietnamese community get their information are disconnected from social media platforms like Twitter. Many in the older Vietnamese population also do not use email. To dispel some fears related to the vaccine, a local organization called Open Eyes Beyond Border worked with the senior association in late March to hold a vaccine information session, where medical professionals from the area answered questions in Vietnamese. The organization will work with a local pharmacy to hold a pop-up vaccination event this weekend in North Austin.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Intermountain Healthcare, which operates the major hospitals in southwestern Utah, announced Monday that it would be relaxing some of its visitor restrictions thanks to decreasing coronavirus case rates across the state. “As our understanding of the disease and transmission has evolved, we’ve decided to allow visitors for patients with COVID-19 for visitors at lowest risk of getting infected,” Kristin Dascomb, Intermountain Healthcare’s medical director for infection prevention for employee health, said in a press release. The new guidelines say for COVID-19 patients, visitors who have proven recovery from the disease in the past 90 days or have proof of completing a COVID-19 vaccination series at least 14 days prior to their visit will be allowed in most cases. In the case of a laboring mother, two visitors are allowed, with one visitor allowed to stay in the postpartum room. Children, infants and newborns in intensive care units are allowed two visitors in most cases. End-of-life patients can have up to eight visitors, with four visitors in the patient room at a time. All visitors must continue wearing face masks and must use hand sanitizer throughout their visits.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: As more residents get vaccinated, Gov. Phil Scott announced a three-month plan Tuesday for loosening COVID-19 restrictions, with a goal of being largely back to normal by July 4. “We’re in the last laps of this very long and difficult race, and this plan will show how we finish strong,” Scott, a Republican, said in his twice-weekly virus briefing. “But I want to be really clear: The key to getting there are vaccinations, which is why we’re laser-focused on making sure as many Vermonters as possible get them. And it’s why when you’re eligible, you need to sign up.” Vermont’s travel guidance will change Friday and be focused on testing rather than quarantining. Unvaccinated Vermonters returning to the state will be required to be tested for the coronavirus within three days, and visitors can come to Vermont without quarantining as long as they have a negative test within three days of arriving, Scott said. Vaccinated people can continue to travel without restrictions, he said. Mostly outdoor businesses, low- or no-contact professional services, retail operations, and farmers’ markets will move from sector-specific to universal guidance April 9. That will be followed by most other sectors May 1. Gatherings will be allowed to increase in size. Masking and physical distancing will still be required.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The Virginia Employment Commission says jobless workers collecting unemployment compensation will soon have to look for jobs again to receive benefits. The Virginian-Pilot reports the weekly job search, a requirement of state and federal law, was temporarily suspended during the pandemic. The commission said in a news release that the unemployed will be notified soon of its reinstatement. The requirement is to apply for two jobs each week. It also applies to people who get Pandemic Unemployment Assistance. People will be required to report information about their job searches to the state each week. Virginia Employment Commissioner Ellen Marie Hess said the requirement is coming back as demand for workers rises and as COVID-19 vaccines become more widely available.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A state senator has apologized after she participated in a legislative video hearing while she drove a car to the Capitol. The Seattle Times reports that Sen. Rebecca Saldana, D-Seattle, said her attempt to multitask Tuesday morning while driving to Olympia was “not in compliance with the law.” The Legislature passed a distracted-driving law in 2017, following testimony by families of people killed in vehicle crashes. Washington state code forbids several behaviors, among them “watching video on a personal electronic device.” Saldana, vice chair of the Senate Transportation Committee, appeared on TVW’s livestream behind the wheel, with a virtual Capitol as background. She fielded a question about clean fuels. Saldana said she meant to disable the video and only use audio functions. She also wore lightweight ear buds; the law forbids earphones if they block outside sounds such as ambulances. The standard citation fine is $136 for a first offense. “I have supported legislation about penalties for distracted driving, and like all drivers in Washington state, I must be subject and accountable to that law and all traffic laws,” Saldana said in a statement. “Accordingly, if I receive a citation for this driving infraction, I will pay the fine.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state will receive $3.3 million for affordable housing from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. West Virginia’s U.S. senators, Democrat Joe Manchin and Republican Shelley Moore Capito, announced the funding Tuesday. Most of the money, $3.1 million, will go to the housing trust fund, which gives grants to build and preserve affordable housing units for low-income earners. About $200,000 will go to the Charleston-Kanawha Housing Authority for programs to help public housing residents become self-sufficient and for homeless foster youth. “Many of our fellow West Virginians are currently experiencing homelessness, including children and families, and the COVID-19 pandemic has only worsened this heartbreaking issue,” Manchin said in a statement. Capito said that “providing access to affordable housing for West Virginians who have fallen on tough times is an essential part of our public housing sectors.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The Wisconsin State Fair wants public feedback on comfort levels toward large events, COVID-19 health safety measures and more ahead of this year’s fair. The fair linked a short survey – at bit.ly/39vLkDp – to posts on its social media channels that asks participants for information, such as whether they plan to attend, how they would view sponsoring companies and when they typically purchase tickets. Survey participants have a chance to win a $50 Visa gift card. The winner will be chosen and notified April 23. Last year, the Wisconsin State Fair was canceled for the first time in 75 years over the coronavirus pandemic. The 2021 fair is scheduled for Aug. 5-15.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The state Department of Health has announced multiple coronavirus variants were discovered in Wyoming over the past several months. The Wyoming Public Health Laboratory recently analyzed genetic sequencing from multiple samples collected from residents since November and found at least 40 cases involved the variant first found in the United Kingdom, more than 40 cases combined involved two variants found in California, and one case involved the variant found in South Africa, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. “Because this is far from a comprehensive review of all positive patient samples, the true number and geographical spread of variants of concern in Wyoming is likely greater than what has been identified,” state Epidemiologist Dr. Alexia Harrist said. Harrist said it is likely that all four of the variants have represented some of the virus transmission in Wyoming over the past several months, raising concerns because the variants have been shown to transmit more easily. “The best way for people to protect themselves from getting sick is to get a COVID-19 vaccine, which are available to the general public now throughout Wyoming,” Harrist said. “We still also recommend staying home when you are sick, avoiding large gatherings and wearing masks in most public settings.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/04/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/06/10/lobster-costs-roll-higher-beach-rentals-sell-skiing-ramps-news-around-states/116926698/", "title": "Lobster costs roll higher, beach rentals sell out: News from around ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Police Chief Ernest Finley has resigned after more than six years, with the mayor saying change was needed. The departure of Finley, who came to the capital city after nearly three decades with the Atlanta Police Department, was announced by Mayor Steven Reed on Tuesday. Montgomery has fared better than other cities its size as rates of violent crime rise nationwide, Reed said, and it didn’t suffer damage during civil unrest last year following the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota. Still, he said, “the situation and circumstances” have changed since Finley began in 2015. “I feel it is in the best interest of the men and women of the Montgomery Police Department, as well as the residents of Montgomery, to make a change in leadership,” Reed said in a statement. Finley, who was hired before Reed took office in the city of about 200,000, has not commented publicly on his departure.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Gov. Mike Dunleavy has signed legislation aimed at protecting the graves of Unangax people sent to internment camps in southeast Alaska during World War II. “We want their descendants to know it’s not been forgotten,” Dunleavy said at Tuesday’s bill signing. The measure expands the boundaries of Funter Bay State Marine Park to include the Admiralty Island cemetery site and directs that management of the area include protection of the cemetery. The cemetery holds the graves of people who died at Funter Bay during World War II. The U.S. government forced people from their homes in the Aleutian Islands more than 1,000 miles away to internment camps after Japanese troops invaded. According to the National Park Service, many of those taken from their homes were only allowed a suitcase to bring with them. Conditions at the relocation sites were poor, and medical care was “often nonexistent,” according to the agency, which has said 32 people died at the Funter Bay camp. Martin Stepetin Sr., whose grandparents were among those relocated, pushed for protections for the cemetery site, the Juneau Empire reports. He said it felt like a weight had been lifted off him with the bill becoming law.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Citing “significant” concerns, state health officials have barred Phoenix-based Embry Health from ordering more COVID-19 vaccine doses. Among the state’s concerns is the possibility that Embry Health may have administered as many as 370 expired doses, Arizona Department of Health Services spokesperson Steve Elliott confirmed Monday in an email – a contention officials with Embry Health dispute. The provider never administered any expired doses, “not accidentally, and certainly not purposefully,” Embry Health consultant and spokesperson Kevin DeMenna said Tuesday afternoon, adding that patient safety at Embry Health has not been affected. “We needed to do a better job of inputting the data,” DeMenna said. Embry Health has been active throughout the pandemic doing both coronavirus testing and vaccinations, though for now, it “has largely just stopped vaccinating,” he said. Expired doses are not the only problem the state raised with Embry Health. Another is the people the company has used to administer COVID-19 vaccines – state health officials say Embry is using staff who are “not permitted by state or federal regulation to administer vaccine,” such as phlebotomists rather than physicians or nurses.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state no longer requires students exposed to the coronavirus to quarantine so long as they’re fully vaccinated against COVID-19, Gov. Asa Hutchinson announced Tuesday. The Republican governor said the new quarantine policy aligns with guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after their second shot of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine or their only shot of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. About 40% of Arkansas’ population has received at least one dose of a vaccine, and nearly 32% are fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. Hutchinson announced the change as the state saw a jump in its coronavirus cases and hospitalizations. The state reported 231 new cases, bringing its total since the pandemic began to 342,726. The state’s COVID-19 hospitalizations increased by 29 to 204. Arkansas’ COVID-19 deaths rose by three to 5,852 since the beginning of the pandemic.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The sheriff of Los Angeles County dispatched deputies Tuesday to Venice Beach to assess the homelessness problem, a day after he called out city officials for failing to adequately address the growing number of people sleeping outdoors along the famous strand. Venice is the jurisdiction of the Los Angeles Police Department, not the sheriff’s department. But Sheriff Alex Villanueva said he was moved to act because of “the failures of local politicians in regard to the homelessness crisis.” He tweeted Monday that he was sending his department’s Homeless Outreach Services Team to the beach, where encampments have proliferated along the popular boardwalk and in surrounding neighborhoods. The sheriff said the goal was to clear the area of homeless encampments by July 4. “What we saw was human misery,” Lt. Geff Deedrick, head of the sheriff’s team, told KNBC-TV. Villaneuva told CBS 2 News that he was not trying to start a turf battle but simply trying to help. City Councilman Mike Bonin, who represents the district that includes the area, accused Villanueva of making political hay out of a serious problem. “He didn’t call to offer services or housing, which would help,” Bonin said in a tweet Tuesday. “He went on a PR blitz, promising his own notorious brand of justice.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Ski areas experienced a strong rebound this winter despite public health restrictions put in place amid the coronavirus pandemic. Skier visits to U.S. resorts totaled 59 million for the season, the fifth-best on record, according to the Colorado-based National Ski Areas Association. “What a year it has been,” said Kelly Pawlak, association president and CEO. “From utter uncertainty to a top-10 season in terms of participation, it shows the wide spectrum that our industry bridged this year.” Resorts across the country were forced to close in spring 2020, and many mountain communities were disproportionately affected by COVID-19 early in the pandemic. The U.S. ski industry lost at least $2 billion that winter, and skier visits fell 14% compared with the 2018-19 season. But about seven months later, chairlifts started turning again, and guests embraced a new normal while skiing and snowboarding. They wore masks, rode lifts only with their groups and stood 6 feet apart in lines, or about the length of a typical ski. There was no dine-in service and no large gatherings for apres-ski drinks. Katherine Fuller, a spokeswoman for Colorado’s Arapahoe Basin ski area, said the most recent season was “definitely a hard one for all of us ... but people wanted to ski and ride, and it felt kind of at times like one of the few things you could do because it was all outside.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: With the state House poised to take up a long-awaited bill that would legalize recreational marijuana for adults, the chamber’s Republican leader on Tuesday called for an investigation into how language was tucked into the legislation that could have intentionally benefited at least one individual. House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, said the closed-door process that led to the massive, nearly 300-page bill is “tainted,” and the House should not proceed with a vote during the remaining hours of the regular General Assembly session, which was set to adjourn at midnight Wednesday. The bill narrowly passed the Senate early Tuesday after the contentious provision was stripped. “It is so tarnished that the House of Representatives should not be taking up this bill,” Candelora said. “And frankly, there should be an investigation in the governor’s office and in the Democrats offices on how this provision came to be.” Candelora predicted if the Democrats who control the General Assembly decide to bring out the cannabis bill, the debate could last 12 hours, eating up valuable time on the final day of the regular legislative session.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth Beach: Many rental agencies in beach areas are almost completely booked – if not sold out – for the summer. “More units are booked for the duration of the summer than, I think, ever before,” said Grace Masten, broker owner of Sea Grace at North Beach, Realtors. With high demand sweeping the coast and a summer energized by eager vacationers and increased vaccination rates, renters looking to score a last-minute stay might expect to pay more or settle for a place farther from the beach this year. Stuck at home last year and possibly bummed out by canceled summer plans, many people booked their summer 2021 vacations earlier than usual. Typically, rental agencies will see bookings come in over the December holidays, Masten said, but rentals were starting to fill up as early as September, October and November, when much of the country remained closed. “I think if people thought back in September, October that they’d be flying to other resort areas, maybe that would be a little different,” Masten said. “But not really knowing what the future was holding at that point, I think they just made the reservations thinking, ‘You know what, let’s stay close to home.’ ” Other renters have taken advantage of flexible work-from-home schedules to take longer vacations or move their home office to a beach rental.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Fewer people are riding Metro than before the pandemic, even as many restrictions are being lifted, but the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority’s board is considering new ways to boost the transit system’s recovery, WUSA-TV reports. Potential solutions include more frequent all-day service, decreasing wait times to 12 minutes or less on six rail lines and 20 bus lines, and extending rail service to midnight seven days a week this summer, and lowering ticket prices. According to the Washington Post, officials are considering $2 flat rates during weekends and reducing prices for low-income riders. Early in the pandemic, Metro was forced to close stations and reduce hours as ridership on public transit plummeted. The new concepts are meant to address ridership and equity. The board is expected to vote on the ideas Thursday.\n\nFlorida\n\nJacksonville: The state reversed itself Wednesday and said a downtown bridge can be decorated in rainbow lights to celebrate gay rights, one day after it had ordered them doused. Taryn Fenske, a spokeswoman for Gov. Ron DeSantis, said she didn’t know why the Florida Department of Transportation had ordered the state-owned Acosta Bridge returned to its normal blue lighting Tuesday night, but the rainbow colors would be back Wednesday night. The Jacksonville Transportation Authority had planned to use rainbow lighting on the Acosta throughout the week in honor of Pride Month, which commemorates the struggle for gay rights. The state has allowed numerous celebratory lighting displays on the bridge to honor patriotic holidays, celebrate the Jacksonville Jaguars football team and raise disease awareness. It had been the second time this month the state rejected a rainbow lighting display for a bridge. “The bottom line is, (the rainbow) lights will be back” on the Acosta, Fenske said. The state transportation department said Tuesday that its original decision to shut off the rainbow lights was not motivated by anti-gay animus but regulations violated by the display. It said the Jacksonville authority’s permit for lighting the Acosta requires it to maintain a certain color scheme unless it receives state permission for a temporary change.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Black church leaders in the state vowed Tuesday to keep up their fight for federal voting rights legislation, with one pastor urging President Joe Biden to use his bully pulpit and strike deals with lawmakers to get the bills passed. “We need you to utilize every ounce of influence that you have,” Pastor Lee May, head of the Transforming Faith Church in Decatur, said in a plea to Biden at a rally outside the state Capitol in Atlanta. “We need you to not just say what you’re for but to do something about it.” Martin Luther King Jr.’s daughter, the Rev. Bernice King, said the “crown” of her father’s work – the 1965 Voting Rights Act – was under attack. Republican lawmakers in Georgia and other states have approved a slew of new restrictions on voting that experts have blasted as the greatest assault on voting rights in a generation. But a bill in Congress that Democrats view as an antidote to those state measures appears doomed in the narrowly divided Senate. Democrat Joe Manchin over the weekend expressed opposition to it and any effort to end the 60-vote requirement to break a filibuster in the chamber. “I call upon my brothers and sisters of the U.S. Senate to not allow filibuster to become your stumbling block to do what is just and what is right,” King said.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: A Maui resident has launched the only Hawaii-based, locally owned ride-share company in the state, officials say. Holoholo CEO Cecil Morton, who’s been in the transportation business for 20 years as owner of SpeediShuttle, told The Maui News his daughter came up with the name, which means “let’s go cruising.” “I just fell in love with the name,” Morton said. “And because we’re all about the community as well as welcoming visitors, I want them to love to use a local brand and support the community in that fashion because there is, of course, a movement these days to support local.” Holoholo – operating on Maui, Lanai, Oahu, Hawaii Island and Kauai – includes a community of drivers and vehicles that riders can request from their smartphones, viewing costs upfront and paying online. Transportation options are in high demand on the islands because of an increase in tourism at a time when many rental car companies have limited availability as a result of shipping their vehicles off the island during the coronavirus pandemic, The Maui News reports. There is already a growing demand for Holoholo from riders and drivers. “Maui requires a good roster of drivers, a big roster, in order to supply the demands, which pre-pandemic there were 200,000 visitors a month,” Morton said.\n\nIdaho\n\nIdaho Falls: State health officials say the number of newly confirmed coronavirus cases continues to drop, and the vast majority of the infections are occurring in unvaccinated people. Idaho has reported fewer than 200 new cases most days this month, the Post Register reports. In January, the state’s daily average of new cases was closer to 700 daily. “More than 90% of all cases have no record of being vaccinated that we know of,” one of Idaho’s top public health researchers, Dr. Kathryn Turner, said during an Idaho Department of Health and Welfare news conference Tuesday. The rate of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 has also dropped, declining 83% between January and May, said the state’s public health administrator, Elke Shaw-Tulloch. The drop in hospitalizations was particularly noteworthy for people ages 65 and up, who have the highest vaccination rate of all age groups in the state. But Idaho’s vaccination rates continue lagging behind national rates. Just 49% of all Idaho adults have been vaccinated, compared to more than 63% of adults nationally. Vaccinating 70% of all Idaho adults is probably the best-case scenario, state-paid pollsters recently concluded. It may take until late fall to reach that goal, Shaw-Tulloch said. “But it just depends on people’s personal actions,” Shaw-Tulloch said.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum will mark Juneteenth – the holiday commemorating the end of slavery in the United States – by displaying a rare signed copy of the Emancipation Proclamation. The copy of the proclamation that’s signed by Lincoln and Secretary of State William Seward will be displayed between June 15 and July 6. The original document is kept in the National Archives in Washington, D.C. Juneteenth – also known as Emancipation Day and Freedom Day – falls on June 19. On that day in 1865, more than two years after Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation during the Civil War, enslaved Blacks in Galveston, Texas, were freed with the arrival of federal troops. Though slavery was not considered fully abolished until the 13th Amendment six months later, Juneteenth has come to symbolize the end of slavery. In May, Illinois became one of several states to make it a state holiday. When the proclamation is displayed in the Treasures Gallery, windows along one side of the museum will feature a display about the history of Black Americans and their fight for full citizenship. The display includes a timeline running from 1787 to 2021, covering slavery in Illinois, a supposedly free state, a riot that targeted Blacks in Springfield, and the first Juneteenth celebration in the city.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A complaint filed with the Department of Homeland Security Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties claims immigrants’ lives are at risk in custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement at a county jail due to the lack of precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The National Immigrant Justice Center filed the complaint May 28 on behalf of two immigrant women in ICE custody at Clay County Jail in Brazil, Indiana. The complaint seeks an investigation into COVID-19 conditions at the jail. It alleges that immigrants who are tested for the coronavirus are not given their test results; that if they test positive, they are not given medication for pain; and that detainees are not given face masks or hand soap. Guards often don’t wear masks, and there are few to no social distancing measures in place, the complaint also alleges. “ICE continues to put their lives – and those of others detained at the jail – at risk by detaining people in the close quarters where social distancing is largely impossible,” the complaint says, “and withholding information regarding how those in custody can obtain COVID-19 testing.” In a statement, ICE public affairs officer Alethea Smock said testing complies with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: State traffic enforcement officials vowed Tuesday to crack down on motorists speeding, driving while drunk or distracted by cellphones in an effort to slow the rising traffic fatality rate. Iowa State Patrol Col. Nathan Fulk said officers have recently reported some of the most dangerous driving behaviors in the 85-year history of the patrol. He said excessive speed and impaired driving skyrocketed last year, pushing traffic fatalities higher than the previous year even as the pandemic reduced traffic volume by 12%. State officials reported nearly 1,500 citations written last year for speeds of 100 mph or more. The 119 fatalities so far this year are ahead of last year’s pace, and officials note traffic deaths often rise in the summer. In response, law enforcement will increase the presence of officers on roads through Saturday, looking for seatbelt violations, impaired driving, excessive speed and distracted driving. A task force of state and local law enforcement and transportation officials has been studying factors behind the increasing traffic fatalities. The group has recommended stepped-up enforcement, education for drivers to reinforce safe driving habits, and a study of road safety issues that could cause problems. The goal is to get traffic fatalities below 300 this year, something that hasn’t occurred in Iowa since 1925.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Hiring enough lifeguards to staff the city’s six public swimming pools has proved impossible in a pandemic year. “Usually I’m about 80% staffed by February,” said Brian Hill, Wichita’s aquatics director. “This year, I was about 10% staffed.” Lifeguarding took a hit last summer, with most gyms, water parks and community pools closed. Students who would normally work as guards took the summer off or found other jobs. Training classes were canceled. So were junior lifeguard programs for 11- to 14-year-olds. “That’s our pipeline,” Hill said. “In a lot of ways, we were kind of starting this summer from scratch.” In Johnson County, Roeland Park’s pool is open for limited hours because there aren’t enough guards. Prairie Village cut back its pool hours this summer amid the shortage. So will the city of Shawnee in Johnson County. “So much of it is kids growing up going to the pool every day,” said Joe Hutchinson, a high school swim coach who manages a private pool in east Wichita. “They see their older friends who are lifeguards, and they say, ‘I want to do that next summer,’ and then they start getting ready for that job and getting certified. Since there wasn’t the opportunity to see your friends be lifeguards last summer that new wave of lifeguards that normally fills in those empty spots just isn’t there.”\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Louisville Metro Police have cut the number of detectives assigned to investigate domestic violence cases – even as case numbers have climbed during the pandemic. Officials say officer shortages and rampant gun violence are to blame. The department “recently” implemented changes, it confirmed, including moving three sworn officers from the unit to assist patrol officers; looking to hire three retired investigators as civilians to work domestic violence cases; and hiring four more Victim Services Unit specialists to focus on domestic violence cases. Critics say the changes create a “real risk of victims falling through the cracks.” The numbers show that domestic violence is only getting worse in the city. As of June 2, LMPD records show the department has handled 1,853 fourth-degree assault offenses this year, a charge that stems from domestic violence incidents. That’s a 12.4% increase from the same time frame last year. Advocates and prosecutors have called on police Chief Erika Shields to reconsider the move, describing it as “counterintuitive” and potentially putting victims at greater risk. Jefferson County Attorney Mike O’Connell said in a May 26 letter he was “saddened” and warned reorganizing the domestic violence team at LMPD could hinder his staff’s ability to bring cases to court.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Lawmakers gave final passage Tuesday to a proposal requiring doctors to suggest to women taking the abortion pill that the drug-induced effort to terminate a pregnancy could be stopped midway through the process, a scientifically questionable claim. With a 69-25 vote, the state House agreed to a heavy Senate rewrite of the proposal and sent it to the governor’s desk. Passage came over objections from opponents who said the legislation pushed by anti-abortion organizations could provide inaccurate, possibly dangerous information to women. The bill by Rep. Beryl Amedee, R-Houma, is the latest in a long string of anti-abortion measures passed by Louisiana lawmakers seeking to lessen access to the procedure and to try to discourage women from seeking it. The nonsurgical medication abortion, which works during the first nine weeks of pregnancy, involves swallowing mifepristone, which causes an embryo to detach from the uterine wall. A second pill, misoprostol, is used two days later to cause contractions and push the embryo out of the uterus. Amedee’s legislation would require a doctor dispensing the two pills to provide a statement to the woman seeking the drug-induced abortion that says there may be “options available to assist you in continuing your pregnancy.”\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Summer weather has arrived, and New England tourists are hungry for a lobster roll or a whole cooked lobster – but they’re going to have to pay up. Lobster is more expensive than usual this season due to a limited supply, high demand and the reopening of the economy as the nation begins to move past the coronavirus pandemic. Consumers are headed back to seafood restaurants and markets for the first time in months, and the lobsters there to greet them are at a premium. Some Maine stores charged $17 or $18 per pound for live lobster in May – about twice the price from a year prior. Prices are lingering in the $13 or $14 range this month. Lobster is usually expensive in late spring, but this season has seen prices that are higher than typical. The wholesale price for live, 1.25-pound lobsters in the New England market was $9.01 per pound May 1, business publisher Urner Barry reported. That was about $2.70 per pound more than the previous May 1 and the highest price for that date in at least five years, the company reported. The high lobster prices are an indicator that customers are looking to get back out to restaurants and that high-end seafood is in high demand, said John Sackton, an industry analyst and founder of SeafoodNews.com.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: A June tradition of graduating high schoolers from across the region flocking to the beach was limited by the pandemic in 2020, but this year, businesses are open, and the community is braced for the huge influx of teenagers getting their first taste of freedom from adult supervision. The celebration in Ocean City, one of the prime destinations for recent grads from the Mid-Atlantic, is a double-edged sword for the city. On the one hand, so-called Senior Week – more like a month – marks the beginning of the tourist season, upon which the city relies for its economic survival. On the other, it is an invasion of thousands of 18-year-old kids hyped up on hormones and hubris that comes with believing in youthful invincibility. Last year’s Senior Week had attracted much smaller crowds than usual, with the COVID-19 pandemic still ramping up and restrictions on businesses in place. This year, seating limits in bars and restaurants have been lifted, along with mask orders for those outside. Inside, those who have been vaccinated may go maskless, according to a directive issued recently by the governor’s office. “We are expecting a big crowd because of pent-up demand,” said Steve Pastusak, chair of the city’s tourism advisory board. “They’re going to be coming out in full force, doing things they couldn’t do last year.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The Cape Cod Foundation is holding a virtual forum next week to address the lingering mental health needs of area residents even as the COVID-19 pandemic ebbs. “Mental and Behavioral Health Across Cape Cod” is scheduled for June 17. “For many, social isolation, feelings of uncertainty, emotional and physical loss, and the inability to access care have increased over the past year due to the pandemic,” Kristin O’Malley, president and CEO of the Cape Cod Foundation, said in a release. “In addition, unemployment, loss of housing, and food insecurity have added to the psychological burden of residents across every age and demographic, especially our most vulnerable populations.” Sign-ups are at the foundation’s website.\n\nMichigan\n\nPort Huron: A popular firework show could return a year after it was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. A notice to proceed with the show has been authorized as part of the Blue Water Festival, according to city manager James Freed. The total cost for Port Huron’s firework show is about $8,600. A $5,000 grant from the DTE Foundation for Blue Water Festival 2020 will be used. The city is looking to raise funds to pay the remaining costs. The festival is expected to be held in July. “I think after such a rough and tough year our residents, families and kids deserve to see a terrific fireworks’ show over our beautiful, vibrant and resilient city,” Freed said Wednesday in a release. “Fireworks shows were one of my fondest memories as a kid. We want this generation of kids to have those same memories.” Port Huron had prepaid half of the cost of last year’s firework show before it was canceled.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: City crews returned early Tuesday to an intersection where a memorial to George Floyd was assembled after his death last year and worked to reopen it to traffic by removing debris and makeshift barriers, only to have activists barricade the area again. Workers using front-end loaders and brooms arrived just before 5 a.m. and cleared the intersection where Floyd was killed, informally known as George Floyd Square, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reports. The intersection has been closed to traffic since Floyd’s death May 25, 2020, and some residents and businesses have expressed frustration that it has been closed for so long. Last Thursday, city crews removed concrete barriers that blocked traffic at 38th Street and Chicago Avenue, but community activists quickly put up makeshift barriers and resumed chanting the name of the Black man whose killing galvanized the racial justice movement. As soon as workers left the area Tuesday, activists moved back in. Mayor Jacob Frey and other city leaders pledged to reopen the intersection, but activist leaders have said they won’t step aside unless the city meets their 24 demands. Among them: recall the county prosecutor, fire the head of the state’s criminal investigative agency, and spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on programs to create jobs, combat racism and support affordable housing.\n\nMississippi\n\nOxford: Actor Morgan Freeman and a criminal justice professor at the University of Mississippi are donating $1 million to the university to establish a Center for Evidence-Based Policing and Reform, the university announced Tuesday. The center created with the donation from Freeman and professor Linda Keena will be the only one of its kind in Mississippi and one of only a few in the nation, the university said in its news release. The university’s Department of Criminal Justice and Legal Studies said the center eventually will train police from Mississippi and around the country. It will include training on how police can better engage the community in crime prevention. “Look at the past year in our country – that sums it up,” Freeman said in the news release. “It’s time we are equipping police officers with training and ensuring ‘law enforcement’ is not defined only as a gun and a stick. Policing should be about that phrase ‘To Serve’ found on most law enforcement vehicles.” University leaders plan to build relationships and share data with policing agencies, according to the release. And they plan to use the data to enhance the preparation of students in criminal justice.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A federal appeals court panel on Wednesday blocked the state from enforcing a sweeping abortion law that bans the procedure at or after eight weeks of pregnancy. A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis heard arguments in September in the legal battle over the 2019 law. The measure also would prohibit a woman from having an abortion because the fetus has Down syndrome. Yamelsie Rodríguez, president and CEO of Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region, called the ruling “a critical victory for Missourians.” “For now, we celebrate our continued ability to provide safe, legal abortion at the last remaining clinic in Missouri,” Rodriguez said in a statement. Republican Attorney General Eric Schmitt said in a statement that his son, Stephen, who has a rare genetic condition, autism and epilepsy, “has shown me the inherent beauty and dignity in all life, especially those with special needs. While we’re disappointed in the 8th Circuit’s decision, their decision does provide an avenue for this case to be heard by the Supreme Court, and we plan to seek review in the Supreme Court.” The lawsuit was filed by Reproductive Health Services, which operates the St. Louis abortion clinic, and the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: A man has been given a six-month suspended jail sentence for submitting a voter registration application under the name Miguel Raton, a rough Spanish translation of Mickey Mouse. Michael Winters of Gallatin County pleaded guilty Tuesday to falsifying information on voter registration application in early 2020, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports. District Judge Peter Ohman also fined Winters $250 and ordered him to complete 100 hours of community service. “This was a serious offense, and, obviously, with all that’s going on with elections now and election integrity, this is something that is obviously front and center,” Ohman said Tuesday. But “really what happened here is it demonstrated that the system does work.” Someone who filed a complaint against Winters with the U.S. Election Assistance Commission in June 2020 told investigators Winters had talked about how easy it would be to commit voter fraud. Winters received ballots for two elections under the name of Miguel Raton. Elections officials say he did not vote in either of them. Winters told an FBI agent he pinned the ballots to the wall of his shop as “trophies.” The agent took the ballots.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: State regulators have fined Sprint $50,000 for overcharging all its cellphone customers in the city for several years. The Nebraska Public Service Commission said the overcharges to help pay for 911 emergency services affected more than 77,000 Sprint customers and added up to more than $296,000. Regulators said Sprint charged 50 cents per month for every active phone line when it was supposed to be charging 45 cents per month for the 911 surcharge. Regulators said Sprint also mislabeled the 911 fee as “Omaha City Tax” on customer statements, according to the Omaha World-Herald. Commissioner Crystal Rhoades said the fine is “sending a message that carriers need to be more responsible to the consumer and that such blatant errors will not be tolerated.” Sprint has already issued a credit to current customers who were affected, and it is in the process of sending refund checks to former customers who closed their accounts.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The Reno-Sparks area posted a record high for taxable room revenue amid a bounce back in domestic travel as tourism continued its steady recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The $32.4 million in room tax revenue was the “best ever” recorded for the month of April, according to the Reno-Sparks Convention and Visitors Authority. The previous record for April was set in 2019, just before the pandemic, when Washoe County posted $32.2 million in taxable room revenue. The numbers include Reno, Sparks and Incline Village at Lake Tahoe. “The April data is in alignment with national studies showing pent-up travel demand, and consumer sentiment suggests that Reno Tahoe has the outdoor amenities and active nightlife that travelers are craving right now,” said Charles Harris, RSCVA president and CEO. Washoe County managed to beat the previous record for room tax despite its number of cash-occupied rooms – also known as room nights in the travel industry – being down from two years ago. The 243,986 room night numbers were down by 11.4% from the 275,513 seen two years ago. Instead, Washoe managed to make up the difference through an increase in room rates. The average daily rate in April was $132.80, up 13.5% from $116.97 two years ago.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The U.S. Marshals Service in New Hampshire will be the first in the country to incorporate body-worn cameras into deputy marshals’ uniforms. The Axon Body 3 cameras will arrive in Concord by the end of the summer, WMUR-TV reports. U.S. Marshal Nick Willard said he has been vocal about the need for body cameras. “In my time in service, I have often talked about police transparency,” he said. “I have often talked about the need of body-worn cameras. I have felt the necessity of body-worn cameras.” Willard said he wishes deputies were equipped with cameras last week when six deputies were shot at in Manchester while attempting to serve a warrant. He said he has not encountered resistance from deputies. “They expose bad cops, but they validate good cops,” he said. “They expose bad work, but they validate good work.” Willard added the cameras sometimes change the demeanor of a suspect and can help deescalate a situation. “Now they know they are on a body-worn camera, it may change their behavior,” he said. “They may be less aggressive because it could be used against them in court.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Reinfections, hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19 among fully vaccinated residents were all extremely rare over the first four months of the vaccination campaign, according to a study released Wednesday. Only 0.06% of fully vaccinated New Jerseyans became infected, the state health department study shows. That represents 1,319 “breakthrough cases” among more than 2.2 million fully vaccinated people from Dec. 15 to April 23. “The vaccines we have are not perfect, but they’re pretty close,” Dr. Ed Lifshitz, the state health department’s medical director, said at a briefing. “They’re literally lifesavers.” Of those breakthrough cases, 14 died, but only seven of the deaths were attributed to the coronavirus. In addition, 92 people with breakthrough cases were hospitalized, but only 30 of them were because of COVID-19, Lifshitz said. All of the hospitalizations and deaths were among people 50 and older. Half the deaths were in those 80 years and older, he said. The study “demonstrates overwhelmingly that vaccines work,” state Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli said. Another study by two researchers at the state’s largest hospital network – Hackensack Meridian Health – found 138 coronavirus cases among 26,000 of its fully vaccinated workers, she said. None became seriously ill.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: In the next academic year, the state’s lottery scholarship program will cover full tuition for eligible in-state students at public and tribal colleges and universities for the first time since 2015, the state Higher Education Department announced. The program will be funded at $63.5 million in the 2021-22 fiscal year, a 30% increase, with the additional money coming from several sources, officials said last week. The scholarships paid full tuition for eligible students from 1996 to 2015 before the program was reduced to levels as low as 60% due to circumstances that included rising tuition rates. For the coming year, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham appropriated $15.5 million to shore up the scholarships, while $37 million will come from projected lottery ticket sales. The rest of the money will be carried over from last year, the Santa Fe New Mexican reports. “This is what is needed at the tail end of a pandemic,” Higher Education Secretary Stephanie Rodriguez said. Officials are discussing ways to keep the scholarship at the 100% mark beyond next year, Rodriguez said.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: With the legislative session almost over, restaurants are urging state lawmakers to make their ability to sell alcohol with takeout orders permanent. Currently, the sales are allowed through monthly extensions of an executive order by Gov. Andrew Cuomo. The latest one runs through July 4, and it’s unclear whether it would be extended thereafter. Restaurants said offering take-out drinks was a boost to their businesses during the pandemic, when most went months without in-person dining. And even as they’ve reopened as the coronavirus wanes, carry-out drinks remain a popular option for diners. “The ability to sell one or two drinks to a customer to go home with their meal allowed diners to replicate the restaurant experience at home, increased servers’ check averages leading to higher tips and provided valuable revenue to struggling businesses,” the Empire State Restaurant & Tavern Association said in a memo in support of the bill. Whether the bill, which has been moving through the legislative committee process, will become law is uncertain. The measure is being opposed by the powerful liquor store industry, which has raised concerns about allowing carry-out sales permanently could cut into its revenue.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: The city has committed $2.1million toward funding reparations, an initiative it began last summer when it joined a number of U.S. cities that have voted to address their histories of racism and discrimination. The Asheville City Council approved a budget amendment Tuesday to pull the money from city land purchased in the 1970s as part of urban renewal programs that took apart Black communities. The council also adopted a proclamation declaring June 19 as Juneteenth, the date that marks the end of slavery in the U.S. “We must collectively strive to close gaps of immeasurable distance between us and affirm the promise of the Declaration of Independence that all people have the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,” Mayor Esther Manheimer said, reading the proclamation. Asheville passed its historic reparations in July 2020, apologizing for the city’s role in slavery, discrimination and denial of liberties to Black residents. The city manager was directed to establish a process for gathering recommendations to address the creation of generational wealth and economic mobility and opportunity in the Black community. The City Council has said the reparations do not require direct payments but would mandate investments in areas where Black residents face disparities.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: City leaders have killed a proposal to allow chickens within city limits. The Bismarck Tribune reports the City Commission denied a request Tuesday from the city Planning and Zoning Commission to hold a public hearing on a potential ordinance that would have allowed residents to keep up to four chickens. Mark Splonskowski was the only commissioner who supported holding a hearing. He said other cities allow chickens. “If it’s not intrinsically evil, why not give it a try?” he asked his fellow board members. But Commissioner Steve Marquardt said he was concerned about disposal of chicken feces and the cost of building city coops to house chickens that escape from their owners. He said commissioners had received emails from residents opposing the ordinance. “I think the city of Bismarck needs a lot of things,” Marquardt said. “But chickens are not one of them.” Mayor Steve Bakken said he had liability concerns. His dogs are trained to hunt birds, he said, and putting chickens next door to dogs could pose problems and lead to nuisance complaints.\n\nOhio\n\nHudson: A retired U.S. Army officer whose speech about freed Black slaves honoring fallen Civil War soldiers was censored by organizers of a Memorial Day ceremony will get another chance to deliver it. The American Legion Department of Ohio said it has invited retired Army Lt. Col. Barnard Kemter to speak next week at the organization’s Buckeye Boys State, an annual gathering that teaches young men about government. Kemter was speaking at a Memorial Day event hosted by a local American Legion post in northeastern Ohio when his microphone was turned off as he talked about the role Black people played in how Memorial Day began. Two of the event’s organizers later resigned under pressure after Ohio American Legion officials said the decision censoring the speech was premeditated and planned. The organizers of the ceremony in Hudson initially defended their decision, saying the section of the speech that was silenced was not relevant to the program’s theme of honoring the city’s veterans. The Ohio American Legion has temporarily suspended the post. A meeting is planned later this month to discuss its future.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Inmates began receiving special computer tablets this week as part of a Department of Corrections plan to provide secure tablets to everyone incarcerated in state prisons. The devices, specially designed by prisons communications company Securus Technologies, will include free content such as prison policies, access to a law library, some books, and educational and self-help materials. Inmates can also pay to receive music, movies, games and television programs, as well as to send and receive messages, including video messages, to and from their families. The tablets do not have unrestricted access to the internet. Usually, inmates wanting to receive educational or vocational training must be escorted to a classroom or program location. But inmates can now receive those services directly on the tablets, said Mike Carpenter, chief of technical services and operations at the Corrections Department. “The education and programming, that’s huge for us,” Carpenter said. On Tuesday, North Fork Correctional Center inmate Byron Robinson, who has been incarcerated since 2005 – the same year YouTube was founded – said the tablet was totally new to him. “I’ve never even touched one of these things until today,” Robinson said. “It’s mindboggling, really, how much this thing can do.”\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The Legislature has approved changes to the lyrics of the state song to remove racist language and make the lyrics more inclusive. House Concurrent Resolution 11, approved Monday by a vote of 47-6, modifies the lyrics, while keeping the same music of “Oregon, My Oregon.” If reflects the “significant cultural, historical, economic and societal evolution in Oregon” since the state song was adopted in 1927, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. The first verse, which referred to Oregon as “conquered and held by free men; fairest and the best,” was replaced with new lyrics emphasizing Oregon’s natural beauty and “rolling rivers.” There are other small changes throughout. In 1919, the Society of Oregon Composers held a contest for poets to submit their compositions “in which the beauties and the merits of the state are extolled,” according to an Oregonian article at the time. The winning entry was written by judge and former state representative J.A. Buchanan of Astoria. Henry Bernard Murtagh composed the music. The new lyrics were proposed by Beaverton resident Amy Shapiro, who said she first hesitated to sing it with her students when she worked as a music teacher and choir director at Portland Jewish Academy 30 years ago.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: For all the love Wawa has gotten thanks to the HBO hit TV show “Mare of Easttown,” the popular convenience store chain is giving a little back. To celebrate its newest store opening in Delaware County – where the Kate Winslet-led crime drama is set – Wawa is dedicating Thursday as “Mare of Easttown Day,” an homage to the show that introduced the world to the coffee and hoagies Pennsylvanians have loved for years. Customers of the relocated Upper Darby store will get to enjoy that coffee Thursday free of charge, and the first 100 customers will get a “Wawa Delco” T-shirt. British actress Winslet plays Mare Sheehan, a detective sergeant in Easttown – a fictional town just outside Philadelphia – who is investigating the murder of a teen mother while looking into the disappearance of another young girl. As Mare, the Oscar winner eats hoagies and drinks Wawa coffee, all in a close-to-perfect Delco accent. To turn into Mare, Winslet worked alongside Chester County Detective Christine Bleiler, who also served as a police technical adviser on the drama. Bleiler will be at the Wawa store Thursday ordering the very first limited-edition “Mare of Easttown Spicy Cheesesteak,” which the store called a nod to how spicy the show is. Local police and fire officials will also be honored at the event, and Wawa will donate money each to the charities of their choice, as well as $10,000 to the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNewport: Salve Regina University will require students to be vaccinated against COVID-19 before returning to campus next fall. The Catholic school in Newport announced Tuesday that all students, faculty and staff will be required to submit proof of immunization to the school no later than Aug. 1. Salve Regina joins Brown University, the University of Rhode Island, Providence College and several other schools in the state that will require students to be inoculated before participating in on-campus classes and activities in the fall. “We did not arrive at this decision lightly,” the school posted on its website. “In reviewing the American College Health Association and CDC recommendations for higher education institutions and in discussion with state health officials, it became clear that this additional safeguard was required to more fully protect our Salve Regina community and those with whom our members interact.” People with valid medical or religious reasons for not receiving the vaccine may request an exemption, the school said. Salve Regina has about 2,700 students.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state House on Wednesday put its final touches on a nearly $11 billion budget, spending more money than anticipated after the economic problems from the COVID-19 pandemic weren’t as bad as feared. The spending plan for the year starting in July includes raises for teachers, law enforcement officers and nearly every state employee. It fixes buildings at colleges and helps art centers and festivals hurt by social distancing. But it won’t include – at least for now – million-dollar drawings for people vaccinated against COVID-19. Nor it will have a $1,200 pandemic bonus for state employees making less than $50,000. House members took time during Tuesday’s debate to add a provision to the budget keeping public schools from requiring masks. And they put in a ban on colleges requiring students to take coronavirus tests or only allowing students who have been vaccinated to forgo masks. The Senate decided Tuesday that it would not agree with the House changes to the budget, so a conference committee will meet next week to finalize the plan. House Minority Leader Todd Rutherford, D-Columbia, removed a proposal to offer a $1 million prize for vaccinated residents and said he will bring it back up later using federal pandemic aid. The House did agree to a 3% raise for state employees, an increase over the 2% offered in the Senate’s budget.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The state health department has reclassified several hundred COVID-19 hospitalizations, reducing the number of patients who have been reported as having received hospital care for the disease caused by the coronavirus. That, in turn, has reduced the overall case hospitalization rate to below 6%, a big shift. In the early weeks of the pandemic, 1 out of every 10 cases resulted in a patient receiving hospital care. But as health providers got better at treating the disease, fewer people ended up in the hospital. Besides falling hospital rates, South Dakota has also seen a sharp reduction in the number of serious illnesses caused by COVID-19. For the first time in months, the number of people who were receiving intensive care fell to the single digits this week. As of Tuesday, only six COVID-19 patients in the entire state were occupying an intensive care unit bed. Meanwhile, the state has gone nearly two weeks without recording a new coronavirus death among its long-term care residents. By almost every measure, the pandemic in South Dakota has relented. The seven-day average for new cases is at its lowest since the opening weeks of the disease hitting the state in March 2020.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Rhodes College students will go back to in-person learning for the fall semester, but for those without their COVID-19 shots, it will cost them. Rhodes sent an email to students Tuesday saying the liberal arts college will charge unvaccinated students a $1,500 health and safety fee per semester to cover the costs of mandatory coronavirus testing. “Aligned with our long-standing practice and policy requiring health forms and vaccinations, the college fully intends to require the COVID-19 vaccination immediately upon FDA approval,” the email said. “This will be required for students, faculty, staff, vendors and campus partners.” Until the vaccines get official approval from the Food and Drug Administration, the college strongly recommends full inoculation for anyone who goes to campus, and flu vaccines are required for the fall. Those who do not get vaccines must pay the fee to cover the costs of the student’s weekly virus testing. Vice President for Student Life Meghan Harte Weyant, who also leads health and safety efforts, said the college invested in weekly asymptomatic testing for the spring semester, which led to a safer campus. Students can submit requests for medical or religious vaccine exemptions to Student Accessibility Services by Aug. 2.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Despite experts who say the state’s power grid remains vulnerable, Gov. Greg Abbott declared Tuesday that new reforms “fix all of the flaws” that caused February’s deadly winter blackout that left more than 4 million people without power in subfreezing weather. He was joined by fellow Republicans who defended it as a good deal for consumers, even though they gave no direct financial relief to families who were stuck with high energy bills or lost income as the lights and heat stayed off for days. Signing into law two sweeping overhauls in response to one of the largest power outages in U.S. history, Abbott asserted he and the GOP-controlled Legislature had delivered following one of the worst crises in his six years as governor. But even members of his own party say there is work still to be done. More than 4 million people lost power when temperatures plunged into single digits, icing power generators and buckling the state’s electric grid. State officials say they have confirmed at least 151 deaths blamed on the freeze and resulting outages, but the real toll is believed to be higher. “Bottom line is that everything that needed to be done was done to fix the power grid in Texas,” Abbott said. Energy experts disagree, saying that although lawmakers made significant changes that include mandates to “weatherize” power plants for extreme temperatures and new processes to avert communication failures, the reforms do not go far enough to assure a similar catastrophe won’t happen again.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: A committee created to consider a name change for Dixie State University voted Monday to choose a replacement that does not include the regional term many consider offensive because of its association with the Deep South and slavery. Dixie State University has been studying the impact of changing its name for nearly a year following a national outcry against racial injustice after the death of George Floyd. While several hurdles remain, the committee’s decision makes it likely that whatever name is ultimately recommended to the Legislature will not include the controversial term that has spurred months of protest and debate. The University Board of Trustees formed a committee in March to review options for the institution’s name under a process outlined in a bill Gov. Spencer Cox signed earlier this year. The committee collected feedback from a public survey, as well as students, university employees and community members before voting to ditch the Dixie name. The committee will reconvene next week to discuss specific names that performed well in focus groups and then choose one to recommend to the university’s Board of Trustees later this month. The name will then go to the Utah Board of Higher Education, which has until Nov. 1 to vote on whether to recommend the name to a legislative committee.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state’s congressional delegation has sent a letter to President Joe Biden urging him to work with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to allow additional travel between the United States and Canada. In the letter, dated Monday, Sens. Patrick Leahy, a Democrat, and Bernie Sanders, an independent, and Democratic U.S. Rep. Peter Welch also urged the president to work with Trudeau toward fully reopening the international border, which has been closed to most nonessential travel since March 2020. “Families throughout Vermont, especially those in our border communities, have gone well over a year without seeing loved ones across the border,” the letter said. “While negative economic and health impacts of this global pandemic are far from over, enabling more people to reconnect, work, and resume daily routines when it is safe to do so will go a long way to addressing these dual crises.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Terry McAuliffe, a longtime fixture of Democratic politics, handily won his party’s nomination for governor in his quest for a second term, setting up what’s expected to be a hotly contested general election against a wealthy businessman and political newcomer, GOP nominee Glenn Youngkin. In his victory speech Tuesday night, McAuliffe made the case that Youngkin is too conservative for a state that’s long been trending blue. “Let me be crystal clear: Glenn Youngkin is not a reasonable Republican,” said McAuliffe, who defeated four challengers to win the primary. Youngkin shot back, describing Virginia as a state that over the past two Democratic governorships has gotten less safe and more expensive while not offering enough economic opportunities. “We need a new kind of leader to bring a new day to Virginia,” Youngkin said in a statement. A longtime Democratic Party fundraiser and a close friend of Bill and Hillary Clinton, McAuliffe held office from 2014 to 2018. Like all Virginia governors, he was prohibited from seeking a consecutive term. He jumped into the race in December after deciding in 2019 against a run for president. Virginia is the only state in the nation with an open race for governor this year, and the contest is expected to draw outsized national attention.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A collection agency must return about $475,000 it collected improperly from up to 5,000 consumers after state Attorney General Bob Ferguson prevailed in a lawsuit alleging unlawful debt-collection practices. Ferguson’s office says Machol & Johannes must also forgive as much as $250,000 in fees and costs for hundreds of people and pay $414,000 to the attorney general’s office to cover investigation costs, The Seattle Times reports. Ferguson filed the lawsuit against Denver-based Machol & Johannes in King County Superior Court in 2020, after a King County Superior Court judge notified his office that the company had filed improper wage-garnishment applications. The agency violated Washington’s Consumer Protection Act and Collection Agency Act by unlawfully assessing fees and failing to provide consumers with information about legally required garnishment exemptions, according to the lawsuit. Machol & Johannes did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the newspaper. Eligible consumers do not need to contact the Attorney General’s Office or Machol & Johannes to receive restitution or debt relief. Refunds and relief of costs and fees will be determined by data contained in Machol & Johannes’ records.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state’s coal mine cleanup fund has no known backup plan if it goes insolvent, according to a new legislative audit. The report released Monday said that mine reclamation program within the state’s Department of Environmental Protection is at risk of insolvency due to the risk of bond revenues not raising enough to guarantee the fund’s future. Among several recommendations, the auditor calls on the department to not approve applications for permit renewals for companies that have not paid taxes for the special reclamation fund. Its review found that 70 mining companies that filed coal reclamation tax returns were delinquent on $5.3 million in total funds. Reclamation of shuttered coal mine sites is crucial to preventing environmental pollution and returning the land to its habitat. Contaminants can seep into waterways and harm wildlife if not properly handled after a mine closes. “West Virginia’s coal mining reclamation program will continue to require hundreds of millions of dollars to reclaim permit sites in accordance with federal regulations,” the audit said. “The program has no known contingency plans if the reclamation funds were to become insolvent.” Insolvency could also pose a dramatic hit to the state budget, and mismanagement of the funds could lead to federal control over the program, according to the audit.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: With progress stalled, the state is relaunching a multimedia public awareness campaign to encourage COVID-19 vaccinations. State health officials announced Tuesday that the “You Stop the Spread” campaign will ramp up with more ads on television, radio, billboards, transit, newspapers and social media platforms. Some ads will feature leaders of groups that in April received $6.2 million in grants to boost vaccinations among marginalized or underserved populations. Julie Willems Van Dijk, deputy secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, said the ads will also address myths about the vaccines, such as that they alter people’s DNA, cause infertility or make people get COVID-19. Racial and geographic disparities in COVID-19 vaccination persist, with the statewide rate about 45% lower among Blacks than whites. In addition to the multimedia campaign, the state health department is working with medical providers, community groups and health departments to keep providing a variety of immunization opportunities, Willems Van Dijk said. Thirteen states reportedly have already reached President Joe Biden’s goal of 70% by July 4, but Wisconsin likely won’t get there until mid-July, Willems Van Dijk said.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A legislative committee has voted to pursue legislation that would significantly change the way statewide elections are run as early as next year, including a bill that would create a ranked-choice system and another bill that would institute an open primary. The Legislature’s Joint Committee on Corporations, Elections and Political Subdivision voted Monday to draft the two bills after initially discussing legislation that would require a runoff if a candidate did not receive a certain portion of the vote, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. But many were unsure if that approach would be feasible by next year’s election. The effort to change the primary elections is gaining support because of the effort to unseat Republican Rep. Liz Cheney and the size of the last gubernatorial election. Republican Gov. Mark Gordon received less than 50% of the vote during the 2018 election but won after several candidates split the electorate. Critics worry about a similar result in the Republican House primary, which already has nine candidates. “Liz Cheney’s vote to hold the president accountable for his actions has really been the catalyst for Wyoming to say, ‘We need to address this issue as immediately as possible,’ ” said Republican state Rep. Dan Zwonitzer, who also is chair of the committee.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/06/23/space-squid-confederate-time-capsule-commutings-return-news-around-states/117191794/", "title": "Space squid, Confederate time capsule: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuscaloosa: The city is ordering most of its water customers to use less, saying a leak in a key water line is reducing how much water it can pump out. Mayor Walt Maddox on Sunday ordered conservation measures for areas south of the Black Warrior River, including the University of Alabama, the Mercedes-Benz assembly plant and four rural water systems outside the city limits. City officials said they believed pipes that carry untreated water from Lake Tuscaloosa to a water treatment plant were leaking somewhere along a 2-mile stretch. But floodwaters from Tropical Storm Claudette were covering much of the low-lying areas where the pipes run. Maddox said it could be several days before workers found the leak. Water treatment capacity had fallen from 40 million gallons a day to 22 million gallons, the mayor said. He ordered people to turn off sprinkler systems, not wash cars, not wash pavement and not fill swimming pools until further notice. “That should sustain us with water conservation,” he said.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: An Alabama museum will return works of art to two Alaskan Native American tribes that requested the items back in 2017, decades after they were acquired for collections. A vote by the Birmingham City Council cleared the way for the Birmingham Museum of Art to return items to the Tlingit and Haida tribes, WBHM reports. The groups requested the return of pieces under a 1990 law that requires institutions which receive federal funds to return Native American cultural items to the respective tribes. The director of the museum, Graham C. Boettcher, told the council that the museum no longer had a “a moral, ethical or legal claim under federal law” to the art. The museum has several Tlingit items as part of its collection, including several spoons, baskets and bentwood boxes. Nearly all of them were purchased by the museum in 1956. The museum also lists three works by Haida artists, including two screen prints by Freida Deising and a Reg Davidson totem pole, all of which were acquired in 1994. Members of the Haida Nation and the Tlingit Nation live in southeastern Alaska. A central tribal government represents more than 32,000 Tlingit and Haida members, according to the groups’ website.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: House Democrats refused to show up at the state Capitol on Tuesday, blocking debate on a budget and a major tax cut primarily benefiting the wealthy. The move kept the House short of the number of lawmakers required to conduct business, forcing Republican House leaders to delay budget work until Thursday, when all GOP lawmakers are expected to be at the Capitol. House Democratic Leader Reginald Bolding said Democrats and the public need more time to review proposed changes Republicans released shortly before the budget debate was scheduled to begin. “You can’t simultaneously ignore the wishes of half the state and then take us for granted to pass a partisan budget,” he said in a statement. Denying a quorum is a tactic increasingly being weaponized by the minority parties of state legislatures in an era of intense partisanship. That hasn’t previously been an issue in Arizona, where a quorum requires the presence of only a simple majority of lawmakers. But on Tuesday, several Republicans planned to vote remotely under rules created during the pandemic, allowing Democrats to exploit the absences.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Monday announced he is creating an office that will focus on outdoor recreation in the state. Hutchinson said the new office of outdoor recreation will be part of the state Department of Parks, Heritage and Tourism under the direction of Secretary Stacy Hurst, who will soon start a search for a director to lead the office. The Republican governor said he’s also creating a 10-person advisory board to help guide the new office. At a news conference with U.S. Rep. French Hill, Hutchinson also said the 459-acre Blue Mountain Natural Area site will be part of the state’s inventory of outdoor recreation sites, putting Arkansas in charge of all three mountains in the chain of Maumelle Pinnacles, along with Pinnacle Mountain and Rattlesnake Ridge. The Arkansas Natural Heritage Commission partnered with the Nature Conservancy to purchase Blue Mountain from PotlatchDeltic, a timberland owner and lumber manufacturer. Hutchinson also announced the state has signed a memorandum of understanding with the federal government to offer expanded recreation opportunities at Camp Ouachita and Lake Sylvia.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: COVID-19 vaccination rates for police and firefighting personnel in the city and for prison employees across the state are significantly lower than the average for other adults, raising concerns among medical ethicists and public safety leaders about whether unvaccinated first responders could become a threat to public health. While about 72% of adult Californians and 64% of Los Angeles residents 16 and older have received at least one vaccine dose, only about 51% of LA firefighters and 52% of the city’s police officers are at least partially vaccinated, the Los Angeles Times reports. Less than 30% of Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department staff have received vaccine doses through employee clinics, and about 54% of state corrections employees are at least partially vaccinated. The extent of the low vaccination rate is unclear because not all agencies keep track of who got their doses, whether through their workplace or elsewhere. Law enforcement analysts and ethicists said public safety workers should be allowed to make independent decisions about their health. However, they said the reluctance to get inoculated is a matter of public concern because they work in close spaces, such as jails and courthouses, and interact with some of the most vulnerable populations.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Gov. Jared Polis has signed three of six gun bills passed in the latest legislative session into law. The Denver Post reports the bills were all announced following a mass shooting at King Soopers in Boulder on March 22, when 10 people were killed. Earlier this year, Polis signed two other bills, setting regulations for safe storage of guns in homes and requirements for reporting lost or stolen firearms. One other gun bill, meant to keep firearms out of the hands of domestic abusers, awaits the governor’s signature. The three bills signed Saturday will require an expanded background check before a person can buy a gun; give about $3 million to the Colorado Department of Health and Environment for the first year to create the state’s first Office of Gun Violence Prevention, which will be tasked with promoting efforts to reduce gun violence; and reverse a ban that keeps local governments, such as cities and counties, from creating their own gun regulations. Local jurisdictions can only make ordinances that are stricter, not more lenient, than state law. Any regulations currently in place that are less restrictive are overturned.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration unveiled an $8 billion to $10 billion plan Monday that aims to reduce commuter rail times from Connecticut to New York City by as much as 25 minutes by 2035, while pledging in the meantime to make the trip from New Haven to the Big Apple 10 minutes faster as early as 2022. The announcement came on the same day Metro-North Railroad returned eight trains to the New Haven Line, as demand for commuter rail service increases as the region emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic. Another service increase is planned in August. “Connecticut is coming back from COVID-19. Commuters are returning to the rails,” Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz said during a news conference held at the Stratford Train Station to announce the Time for CT plan with Lamont and other officials. While much of the initiative is dependent upon passage of a massive federal infrastructure bill in Washington, state Department of Transportation Commissioner Joseph Giulietti said the state has already received enough federal funding to embark on some of the work needed to alleviate long-standing slowdowns along the rails. That includes improvements to signalization systems and movable bridges, as well as the creation of new sections of track that allow trains to pass one another.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The state’s minimum wage is expected to rise to $15 an hour by 2025. The Democrat-led state House voted along party lines Thursday to give final approval to a bill raising Delaware’s minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025. Democrats approved the measure after defeating half a dozen Republican amendments, including proposals to allow small businesses and nonprofits to pay 85% of the minimum wage and to require the controller general’s office to submit annual reports regarding the fiscal impact of the wage increases on the state budget and more broadly on the state economy. Democrats also rejected a proposal by one of their own party members, Rep. Sherae’a Moore of Middletown, to delay each of the annual wage increases for one year for businesses employing 20 or fewer workers. The bill was sent to Democratic Gov. John Carney, who is expected to sign it. The measure was one of the legislative priorities for several left-leaning progressives who were elected last year and were able to get veteran Democrats to sign on to their cause. “In the last 15 years, we’ve made 15 attempts to raise the minimum wage. Only three of them bore fractional (fruit),” said Wilmington Democrat Rep. Gerald Brady, chief House sponsor of the bill.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: D.C. Public Schools is combining graduations and vaccinations this week. The district plans to hold pop-up COVID-19 vaccine clinics at all its commencement ceremonies this week at Audi Field, WUSA-TV reports. While the class of 2021 gets to walk across the stage to receive diplomas, the graduates, friends and family can take time before and after the ceremony to get COVID-19 shots. The clinics are open to any graduate and their guests over the age of 12. On Friday, the district’s health department announced it’s giving away $51 gift cards to those who get their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine at select clinics. And the district also launched a new task force last week to encourage residents to get their shots.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Crime was down overall in the Sunshine State during 2020, but violent crime rose, according to statistics released by the state Monday. There were 1,285 murders in Florida last year, an increase of 260, or 14.7%, from 2019. Of those, 1,025 were committed with a gun, up 20.2% from the year before. Murders committed with a gun made up nearly 80% of the state’s total, according to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement’s annual crime report. In a year when many people worked at home or stayed home more often during the coronavirus pandemic, burglaries, robberies and larcenies dropped significantly. There were 13,439 robberies, a drop of 17% from 2019; 51,928 burglaries, down 17.8%; and 291,923 larcenies, down 18.5%. Florida also saw a drop in the number of reported rapes, from 8,439 in 2019 to 7,650 in 2020, or a decrease of 9.3%. Motor vehicle thefts also slightly dropped. Aggravated assaults increased by 9.5% from 55,333 in 2019 to 60,567 last year. Overall, factoring in the state’s growth in population, all crime was down 15.7% in 2020.\n\nGeorgia\n\nDecatur: The Sons of Confederate Veterans group has sued to return a 30-foot-high obelisk to a site in front of a courthouse in what a lawyer for the city calls “a lost cause.” The monument was taken down and moved to storage last year after a judge agreed with the city’s argument that it had become a threat to public safety during protests about racism and police brutality. The suit was filed Wednesday, two days short of a year after the monument’s removal, news outlets report. The group suggests city officials colluded to get around a state law protecting historic monuments, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. It contends the monument was not found to be a public nuisance. DeKalb County Judge Clarence Seeliger said in his ruling last year that it was “a figurative lightning rod for friction among citizens.” In his final order, in September, Seeliger said the obelisk should never be returned to the square. But “the world is full of controversy,” attorney Walker Chandler, who filed the lawsuit, told WXIA-TV. “And if we were to say anything that causes controversy is a public nuisance, that’s an endless road to go down.” In an email to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Decatur City Attorney Bryan Downs called the suit a “tardy, vexatious attack on properly entered rulings by a Georgia court of law. ... In short, it is a lost cause.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Dozens of baby squid from the state are in space for study. The baby Hawaiian bobtail squid were raised at the University of Hawaii’s Kewalo Marine Laboratory and were blasted into space earlier this month on a SpaceX resupply mission to the International Space Station. Researcher Jamie Foster, who completed her doctorate at the University of Hawaii, is studying how spaceflight affects the squid in hopes of bolstering human health during long space missions, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The squid have a symbiotic relationship with natural bacteria that help regulate their bioluminescence. When astronauts are in low gravity, their body’s relationship with microbes changes, said University of Hawaii professor Margaret McFall-Ngai, under whom Foster studied in the 1990s. “We have found that the symbiosis of humans with their microbes is perturbed in microgravity, and Jamie has shown that is true in squid,” McFall-Ngai said. “And, because it’s a simple system, she can get to the bottom of what’s going wrong.” The Kewalo Marine Laboratory breeds the squid for research projects around the world. The tiny animals are plentiful in Hawaiian waters and are about 3 inches long as adults. The squid are slated to come back to Earth in July.\n\nIdaho\n\nIdaho Falls: Less than half of nursing home workers in the state have been vaccinated against COVID-19, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The agency said 47.5% of Idaho nursing home workers were fully vaccinated by May 30, compared to more than 82% of residents in the facilities. The Post Register reports Idaho had the 17th-highest resident vaccination rate but 15th-lowest staff vaccination rate among states and territories. About 38% of Idaho’s 2,100 COVID-19 deaths are linked to long-term care facilities. Of all COVID-19 deaths in the state, 93% were among people 60 and older. About 75% of Idaho residents age 65 and over are at least partially vaccinated. Almost half of all Idaho adults are at least partially vaccinated, compared to 65% of all Americans.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A new podcast from the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum features conversations about legendary Illinois musicians and bands, sometimes with the performers themselves. The State of Sound podcast is a companion to an exhibit launched earlier this year at the Springfield-based museum, called “The State of Sound: A World of Music from Illinois.” It showcases the achievements and contributions of Illinois artists, including Muddy Waters, Earth Wind and Fire, and Chance the Rapper. The podcast is another way for people to explore the history of the state’s music, museum officials said. Episodes available now include discussions with Kevin Cronin from REO Speedwagon, Tim McIlrath from Rise Against, and Rosanna Goodman, daughter of singer-songwriter Steve Goodman. A new, official gallery guide includes dozens of photos of artifacts such as a red trumpet that belonged to Miles Davis and mementos John Prine carried on stage to help with his performance anxiety. “This exhibit is packed with sound, pictures and stories that we wanted to share with as many people as possible,” said Christina Shutt, executive director of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum. “The podcast will give people around the world a chance to hear those stories.”\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A Bloomfield woman plans to plead guilty Wednesday for her role in the U.S. Capitol riot after appealing to the court that she has since learned “what life is like for others in our country” from movies and books, including the films “Schindler’s List” and “Just Mercy.” Anna Morgan-Lloyd, 49, has agreed to plead guilty to one of her pending federal charges in the Jan. 6 insurrection in exchange for three years’ probation, $500 in restitution and community service. In a letter to the judge, Morgan-Lloyd apologized for entering the U.S. Capitol and said she feels “ashamed” about how the march turned violent on that day, which she previously described on Facebook as “the most exciting day.” She attached movie and book reports to her letter, summarizing “Schindler’s List” and “Just Mercy,” movies she said her attorney recommended. “I’ve learned that even though we live in a wonderful country things still need to improve,” Morgan-Lloyd wrote. “People of all colors should feel as safe as I do to walk down the street.” In “Schindler’s List,” protagonist Oskar Schindler diverts hundreds of Jews from sure death by employing them in his factory in Nazi-occupied Poland. In “Just Mercy,” Bryan Stevenson recalls his career representing disadvantaged clients and establishing the Equal Justice Initiative in 1989.\n\nIowa\n\nIndianola: The city recognized LGBT Pride Month for the first time Monday with an official proclamation at a City Council meeting. According to Indianola Mayor Pamela Pepper’s proclamation, “Pride Month is an opportunity for people to embrace who they are and to celebrate acceptance of diversity,” and the city should value everyone regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity and expression. LGBTQ Pride Month is recognized annually through the month of June to honor lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and other voices related to gender and sexuality, as well as to draw attention to the issues members of the community still face. Pepper has recently issued proclamations recognizing other holidays and months not normally recognized or celebrated by the city, including one to recognize Juneteenth ahead of the holiday’s official commemoration over the weekend. Pepper said recognizing more holidays makes clear that the city welcomes all people, regardless of race, ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender. She said the act is a small step the city can take amid efforts to reestablish a human and civil rights commission that was dissolved around 1998.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The Country Stampede returns this weekend after being canceled in 2020. The three-day festival will be held Thursday through Saturday at Heartland Motorsports Park. National and local country musicians are expected to play, and stampede president Wayne Rouse said this is the best lineup yet. “I hope people come out and enjoy all the great music,” Rouse said. “There will be a lot of great vendors out there.” Country Stampede officials learned a lot in 2019 about what works and doesn’t work for the venue where the festival takes place. And a year off because of the pandemic allowed for officials to make needed changes that will enhance festivalgoers’ experience. In 2019, muddy grounds caused by several inches of rain created a mess. Rouse said a new layout, an additional 300 acres and a larger festival area are all improvements made based on knowledge gained from that year. This year’s festival grounds have been designed to drain in the event of rain. Country music lovers will see performances from some of the biggest up-and-coming artists in the industry, including Ashley McBryde, Maddie and Tae, Mitchell Tenpenny, Blanco Brown and Gabby Barrett. Luke Combs, Sam Hunt and Riley Green will each headline one night of the festival. Hunt replaced Morgan Wallen, who’s been mired in controversy in the past year.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A man has sued his father’s estate over the effects of secondhand smoke on his health, five years after being left out of the will when his dad died. Hugo J. “Joe” Bobzien Jr. amassed a sizable fortune as president and CEO of American Commercial Barge Line, the nation’s largest barge operator. When Bobzien died March 30, 2016, at age 81, he left his estate to three of his children but gave nothing to his oldest child. The other siblings later speculated their father didn’t like how Michael treated his wife and a daughter, according to court filings. But now Michael Bobzien is trying to get his piece of the pie. In a lawsuit whose trial began Tuesday in Jefferson Circuit Court, Michael J. Bobzien, 63, says his father destroyed his health by chain-smoking Lucky Strikes, Carltons and cigars. In what is believed to be the first secondhand-smoke lawsuit filed by a child against a parent, Bobzien claims he is suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other ailments caused by being “forcibly, knowingly, intentionally, wantonly, chronically and recklessly” subjected to his father’s ever-present cloud of smoke while growing up in Louisville. Bobzien, an occupational therapist before he was disabled by his diseases, is seeking as much as $50 million for his pain and expected shortened life span.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state continues to see major racial gaps in which students take high school classes for college credit, an education consultant told public school and college leaders. The Advocate reports the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education and the Board of Regents received a report showing 22% of Black students take dual enrollment courses, compared to 42% of white students. The percentage of students enrolled in the classes drops as the percentage of Black students in a school rises, according to the data from Adam Lowe, a consultant with Education Strategy Group. The first annual report on dual enrollment came in a meeting between the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, which oversees K-12 public schools, and the Board of Regents, the state’s higher education policy-making panel. “To develop talent and eliminate equity gaps in higher education, much greater intentionality and commitment is needed from all high schools, school systems, colleges and universities in harnessing these successful programs for the benefit of students of color, those from low-income households, first-generation students and special education students,” the report said. Louisiana has long lagged other states in the number of high school students who earn college credentials, The Advocate reports.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state will investigate potential new uses for its dormant rail corridors. Gov. Janet Mills recently signed into law a proposal that directs the Maine Department of Transportation to evaluate possible uses for the state-owned corridors. The department will eventually submit a report to the Legislature. Democratic Rep. Art Bell of Yarmouth, who proposed the bill, said Monday that he is “hopeful that it will provide an opportunity to reimagine the way we interact with miles of dormant, state-owned rail corridors, lying fallow.” Democrats in the state said the transportation agency will create a transportation plan that will serve as a framework as it looks to create new opportunities for outdoor recreation in Maine. That plan will include potential uses for the rail corridors.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The city has once again delayed implementing its ban on single-use plastic bags. The Baltimore Sun reports the city is now giving retailers until Oct. 1 to comply with the ordinance. Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott said more time is needed to distribute reusable bags and to educate community members. “Now that Baltimore is beginning to emerge from the pandemic and recover from its impacts, we recognize that retailers and residents could benefit from additional time to adopt this important change,” Scott said in a news release. This is the second time the ban has been pushed back. In January the effective date was moved to July 9 because of the economic hardships created by the coronavirus pandemic. The ban requires shoppers at grocery stores, restaurants and other retailers to bring their own reusable bags. Otherwise, they must purchase a paper or compostable bag for 5 cents. “We had hoped that by summer, everything would have been more amenable to the rollout,” said the city’s director of sustainability, Lisa McNeilly. “But what we’ve seen is that there continued to be some concerns from retailers about using reusable bags and having the capacity for it.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The area’s notoriously frustrating traffic dried up in March 2020 as many people started working remotely from home, and businesses closed. Now, it’s pretty much back to pre-pandemic levels. “Traffic, for all intents and purposes, is back to about 2019 levels on most roadways in Massachusetts at this point,” Highway Administrator Jonathan Gulliver said in a presentation to the state Department of Transportation’s board Monday, The Boston Globe reports. Traffic on the Massachusetts Turnpike is still “running a little bit lower” than before COVID-19 hit, Gulliver said, particularly closer to Boston. And fewer vehicles are traveling through the tunnels to and from Logan International Airport. The morning and evening rush hours are still crowded, but Gulliver said they do not last as long as they did before the pandemic. “I think we’re in for a really major adjustment period that’s going to occur throughout the fall and early winter before things settle,” Gulliver said. The use of ride-hailing services plummeted last year, with such companies providing about 35 million rides that started in Massachusetts – a 62% drop statewide from the 91.1 million rides started in 2019, according to reports released by the state Department of Public Utilities.\n\nMichigan\n\nMeridian Township: The state is fully open again. After facing 15 months of capacity restrictions and being hit by the country’s worst surge of coronavirus infections this spring, restaurants, entertainment businesses and other venues can operate at 100% occupancy – instead of 50% – as of Tuesday. Limits on large indoor gatherings such as weddings and funerals are gone. So is a broad requirement that the unvaccinated be masked indoors, a rule that remains in about a dozen states. Unvaccinated teen athletes will no longer have to undergo weekly coronavirus testing. Michigan is among the last states to lift gathering caps, which has frustrated the business community. Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and public health officials have said the restrictions were needed until enough people could be vaccinated in a state with about 21,900 suspected virus-related deaths. Last year, the governor faced an alleged plot to kidnap her over COVID-19 rules after drawing the ire of then-President Donald Trump, who tweeted calls to “LIBERATE” Michigan. “It’s time to play. It’s time to have fun again,” said Jordan Munsters, co-founder and president of High Caliber Karting and Entertainment, an indoor action park near Lansing where adults can race go-karts, throw axes and smash stuff to smithereens.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Gov. Tim Walz has requested funding to outfit Minnesota State Patrol troopers and officers working at the state Capitol with body cameras. The $7.5 million to buy and maintain the cameras for the officers and troopers is contained in a transportation funding package that could come up for a vote later this week. The bill also includes funding to add nearly two dozen state troopers and a dozen additional Capitol security officers to the detail, Minnesota Public Radio reports. Body cameras are standard for many local police departments, but the state has been slower in adding them to its forces. Capitol security has been a serious concern over the past year. A tall, chain-link fence surrounded the building as protests turned violent in the aftermath of George Floyd’s death in May 2020. Crews took down the fence earlier this month, and the Capitol reopened to the public for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic took hold in March 2020.\n\nMississippi\n\nNatchez: The city is now part of a trail commemorating what was then a nationwide tour by a French general who had participated in both the American and French revolutions. The Marquis de Lafayette visited Natchez on April 18, 1825, during the second and final year of a tour made at the invitation of President James Monroe and the U.S. Congress. During those two years, Lafayette stopped at 320 cities and towns in the 24 states then in the union, Lafayette Trail founder James Icher said. He said he hopes eventually to have 175 markers, including one at Le Havre, the port from which Lafayette departed to return to France. About 40 markers have been approved since the project started in 2017, with about 25 installed in 13 states so far, he said. A marker describing Lafayette’s stay in Natchez was unveiled last week at a lot overlooking the Mississippi River, The Natchez Democrat reports. The Historic Natchez Foundation and the Daughters of the American Revolution worked with The Lafayette Trail Inc. on the project. Two families offered the property, foundation executive director Carter Burns said. When Lafayette made his tour, the 50th anniversary of the American Revolution’s end was nearing. Lafayette, who had been 19 when he first came to America, was “the last surviving general of the Continental Army,” Icher said.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Changes in the way the city’s police record crime statistics have prevented the department from publicly publishing crime data for nearly six months, officials said. The problem is related to a switch the department made in December to a new way of tracking crime, the National Incident-Based Reporting System. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports the change was made to comply with new reporting requirements from the FBI which has said it required the change to help it improve the statistics it keeps and offer a more complete picture of crime. The city is still working on a way to resume publishing monthly incident data. Switching to the new reporting system required an overhaul of the department’s records software. The city started taking bids on that job in 2019 and hired a company to install new software in 2019. Police department spokeswoman Michelle Woodling said the project to report data publicly using the new system is behind schedule. But she said anyone can still request crime data under public records laws. Researcher Christopher Prenner, who is a sociologist at St. Louis University, said the department used to have better transparency than most other police agencies in the region.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A commission governing wolf hunting in the state is considering new wolf management rules that would make it easier to take the animals after the Legislature passed several laws earlier this year to encourage additional wolf hunting. The Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks already expects the number of wolves in the state to decrease from about 1,150 to between 900 and 950 wolves following a particularly successful hunting season. Over 320 wolves were harvested during the 2020 hunting season – significantly more than the preceding eight-year average of 242 wolves per year, according to a report released by the department. Still, the department believes the state’s wolf population can support increased wolf hunting without leading to adverse biological effects, according to the report. The fish and wildlife commission – which governs hunting regulations – is expected to meet Thursday to hear public comment on proposed rules released last week to implement laws passed by the Legislature. The department proposed adopting several new measures, including increasing the number of wolves an individual can hunt to between five and 10, allowing snaring during trapping season and night hunting on private lands, using baits for hunting and trapping, and extending the season dates.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The number of new COVID-19 cases continued to decrease last week in the state, which currently has one of the lowest rate of new cases in the nation. For the eighth week in a row, Nebraska reported fewer coronavirus cases than the week before, the Omaha World-Herald reports. The state reported 168 new COVID-19 cases last week, according to data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That is down from 234 cases the week prior and 254 the week before that. At the peak last fall, Nebraska reported 16,740 new cases during the week of Nov. 20. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Nebraska also decreased over the past two weeks, going from 40 new cases per day June 6 to 31.14 new cases per day Sunday. Over the past two weeks, Nebraska reported 21.61 new cases per every 100,000 people in the state, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The only states with lower rates of new cases over that period were Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, South Dakota and Vermont. The number of people vaccinated against COVID-19 continues to slowly increase in the state. As of Friday, 63.4% of Nebraska’s population 18 and older had received at least one dose of a vaccine. That’s up from 63% the week before.\n\nNevada\n\nElko: Rural residents and local law enforcement over the weekend celebrated decisions by two county commissions to become members of a group that believes sheriffs have the final say on any given law’s constitutionality. Hundreds of people gathered for festivities in Elko City Park on Sunday as the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association presented Elko and Lander county commissioners with a plaque to honor their membership, making them the first local governments to join, the Elko Daily Free Press reports. “You know what I train sheriffs to do? Kick ’em the hell out of your county,” association founder Richard Mack told an applauding crowd, referring to criticism of federal government and the Internal Revenue Service. Mack, a former sheriff from rural Arizona who is also involved in the Oath Keepers militia movement, denounced white supremacy and compared sheriffs’ bucking of federal laws to Rosa Parks’ civil disobedience on a bus in 1955. Founded in 2011, the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association believes county sheriffs have a duty to interpret and uphold the Constitution that supersedes other elected officials up to the president. It is against federal gun laws and COVID-19 restrictions and sees sheriffs as a final defense against government overreach.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: As children get ready for summer camp, federal COVID-19 response funds are being used to offer mental health training for camp counselors. The Department of Education is partnering with the New Hampshire Community Behavioral Mental Health Association to provide the training. Also, the 10 community mental health centers around the state will have staff on site at camp locations weekly to provide mental health support for children. The effort is a part of the department’s “Rekindling Curiosity: Every Kid Goes to Camp” program, which offers families camp-tuition support. “In spite of the heroic efforts by so many over this past year, so many children across New Hampshire have experienced anxiety and trauma during the COVID-19 pandemic,” Frank Edelblut, commissioner of education, said in a statement Tuesday. “The Rekindle Curiosity program will simply give many of our children the opportunity to be a kid again and build some childhood memories.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: The state is investing $200,000 in a center to help Atlantic City and New Jersey become a national hub for the billion-dollar competitive video game industry, known as esports. The New Jersey Economic Development Authority and Stockton University on Tuesday signed an agreement to establish an esports Innovation Center at the university’s Atlantic City campus. The authority will provide staff support for the Innovation Center, which will also include leaders in the esports industry. It was the latest manifestation of New Jersey’s interest in being not just a player but a leader in the fast-growing field. Newzoo, a research firm that tracks the esports industry, projects it will generate $1.08 billion in global revenue this year, an increase of 14.5% over last year. “I was shocked when I saw the numbers,” said Brian Sabina, the authority’s chief economic growth officer. “It’s the fastest-growing college sport in America. Nearly 500 million people tune in to watch esports events.” The center is designed to create new academic and workforce development opportunities and to support local economic development. It plans to identify industrywide technology development opportunities and to host “hack-a-thons” and similar coding challenges focused on creating innovative solutions.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlamogordo: Officials in southern New Mexico are seeing an increase in pets surrendered and expect numbers to keep rising. In 2020, Alamogordo Animal Control took in 1,260 animals, saw 563 adopted and euthanized 36, according to Alamogordo Police Department data. The Otero County Animal Shelter took in 1,605 animals, saw 542 adopted and euthanized 364 last year, according to the shelter’s own data. Officials with both organizations expected the number of surrendered animals to increase post-pandemic as pet owners find their way back to offices and away from home. “It’s post-COVID-19 stuff; everyone was home and had time for the dog, and now everyone is going back to work, and we’re getting the same stories, you know?” Alamogordo Animal Control Manager Dwaine Martinez said. He said a surge in pet surrenders was already noted. Alamogordo Animal Control and Kitty City hold regular adoption events at White Sands Mall nearly every other Saturday. “We’ve seen a little bit of returns, but I don’t think it’s been any increase of what it would have been without COVID-19,” Kitty City Director Kathy Denton said. Under the rescue’s return policy, it works with the adopter to find out what issues may have arisen, Denton said.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Gov. Andrew Cuomo has signed legislation requiring general hospitals to seek input from nurses and other staff in creating staffing plans that are to include specific guidelines on how many patients each nurse is assigned. The new law requires hospitals to form committees composed of registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, ancillary staff members providing direct patient care, and hospital administrators to form the staffing plans. Hospital staffing committees must adopted their first staffing plans and submit them to the state health department by July 1, 2022. It’s unclear how the law will play out in non-unionized workplaces. Lawmakers passed the legislation in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which put a strain on staffing and resources at many hospitals throughout New York. Supporters of the law want to boost staffing levels. The original bill would have mandated statewide minimum staffing levels, but those were negotiated out. “This legislation requires hospitals to create committees that include the very same staff who treat patients on the ground every single day and come up with plans that take their concerns into consideration when allocating staff,” Cuomo said in a statement.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Republicans in the state Senate unveiled a two-year state budget proposal Monday that sticks to earlier spending limits even with recent news of a massive revenue windfall. They instead earmark billions more now for savings, with plans for deeper tax cuts and more construction projects to follow the rest of the decade. The measure also offers pay raises and one-time bonuses to public school teachers and state employees, although the permanent raises fall short of what Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper proposed in his budget in March. The bill, which is expected to pass through the chamber by Friday, seeks to spend $25.7 billion in state funds in the year starting July 1 and $26.6 billion the following year, in keeping with a spending cap that senators settled on with House Republicans this month. However, state economists predicted last week that the state would have $6.5 billion more at its disposal over the next two years above and beyond what was anticipated, beginning with an extra $1.9 billion in state coffers by June 30. Still, senators say they’re committed to the cap – otherwise concerned that much of the cash influx attributed to a resurgent post-pandemic economy can’t be counted on in the long term to pay for permanent initiatives.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Legislative leaders on Tuesday dismissed criticism of new limits on emergency spending by a governor-led panel, saying they have no interest in repealing or amending the law. Republican Senate Majority Leader Rich Wardner said in an interview that criticism that the new law could hamper the state’s ability to address emergency spending is unwarranted. “I don’t think this is a life-or-death thing,” Wardner said. “We can live with this.” The law, passed shortly before the GOP-led Legislature adjourned in April, effectively furthers an ongoing battle between Gov. Doug Burgum and the Legislature, which has long argued that it decides spending matters and that the second-term Republican has stepped too far onto its turf. The Legislature easily overrode Burgum’s veto of the bill that he said “clearly violates the separation of powers doctrine” and would be unconstitutional. Burgum has declined to say if he would challenge the law in court. Democratic Senate Minority Leader Joan Heckaman said in an interview that she supports the law. “It is OK for us to do this,” she said. “Otherwise, we don’t know what’s being spent where.”\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The coronavirus pandemic appears to have triggered more smoking among smokers in the region and prompted 1 in 10 former smokers to light up again, a newly released survey shows. Tobacco use by Cincinnati area adults had declined for more than 20 years, from 35% in 1999 to 19% in 2018. “But the COVID-19 pandemic stalled progress,” officials at Interact for Health said in a news release Tuesday. The percentage of adult current smokers in the region was fairly stable between 2018 (19%) and 2020 (21%), the organization said. In the wake of the new poll results, Interact for Health, a Norwood-based nonprofit that partnered with the University of Cincinnati Institute for Policy Research on the survey, is offering grants for tobacco-use cessation projects in the Cincinnati area. The Greater Cincinnati COVID-19 Health Issues Survey found that 23% of responding smokers said they smoked more frequently during the pandemic and that 9% of those who had quit started smoking again last year. The survey, conducted between Oct. 7 and Nov. 17, 2020, polled a random sample of 879 adults from the Cincinnati region, including an oversample of Black residents, interviewed by phone. The potential margin of error is plus or minus 3.3 percentage points, researchers said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A big boost is coming to efforts to “restart the arts” in Oklahoma, as nonprofit cultural organizations struggle to overcome the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Kirkpatrick Family Fund has announced a $1 million commitment to Allied Arts over a three-year period to assist local nonprofit arts organizations recover and regain forward momentum. “As we emerge out of a pandemic year, the Kirkpatrick Family Fund is committed to helping restore the educational, visual, and performing arts that are vital to a thriving society and economy,” Kirkpatrick Family Fund President Christian Keesee said in a statement. Allied Arts found staggering financial losses when it surveyed 39 central Oklahoma cultural organizations about their operations between March 2020 and February 2021. The local impact of the pandemic was more than $21.2 million in revenue losses for these nonprofits, even after the groups received almost $12 million in COVID-19 assistance. “And that’s not even including the ripple-effect spending, which is looking at the true economic impact,” Allied Arts President and CEO Deborah McAuliffe Senner said. “It’s for those special events and occasions that people are getting their nails done, their hair done, a new dress. All of that was lost.”\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: With the state and federal eviction moratorium set to expire at the end of June, lawmakers passed an added safety net for struggling tenants Tuesday that will “pause” some evictions. Under the “Safe Harbor” amendment on Senate Bill 278, tenants who are unable to pay their July or August rent would not be evicted for 60 days if they provide proof to their landlord that they’ve applied for rental assistance through Oregon Housing and Community Services. The amended bill, which passed in the House 56-2 and in the Senate 26-3, was sent to Gov. Kate Brown’s desk to be signed. An eviction moratorium has been in place in Oregon since April 2020. In addition, last month lawmakers voted to extend the grace period for past due rent during the moratorium, allowing tenants to have until Feb. 28, 2022, to pay back rent. While the governor announced earlier this month that she was extending the state’s mortgage foreclosure moratorium through September, she said she did not have the authority to extend the eviction moratorium. “That means, by law, Oregon’s eviction moratorium will expire on June 30,” Brown said. Officials had warned that as the moratorium expired, the state would likely see a mass wave of evictions.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state locks up far too many first-time and low-level youth offenders, with Black youth in particular disproportionately yanked from their homes and prosecuted as adults, according to a governmental task force that made recommendations Tuesday to reform juvenile justice in the state. “Serious racial disparities pervade Pennsylvania’s juvenile justice system,” the bipartisan Pennsylvania Juvenile Justice Task Force said in its report, adding that changes are urgently needed to make the state’s juvenile justice system more fair and more effective. A substantial percentage of young people who commit a minor crime and are considered at low risk of reoffending are nevertheless removed from home and placed in a residential facility, the group found in its 16-month review. The practice is widespread despite research showing that out-of-home placement is “generally not effective at reducing recidivism for most youth – and can instead be counterproductive,” the report said. Policymakers found widespread geographic and racial disparities in how youth offenders are treated, with Black youths more likely than white youths to be removed from home and prosecuted in adult court.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Rhode Island Infrastructure Bank has approved a $400,000 loan to help in the redevelopment of a brownfields site in Pawtucket. The loan will finance environmental remediation work as part of the larger Nexus Lofts project that will include 27 affordable market-rate apartments with ground floor office and retail space, the bank said in a statement. “This $400,000 loan for site remediation work at the Nexus Lofts project will help catalyze further development in the surrounding buildings,” infrastructure bank CEO Jeffrey Diehl said in a statement. Co-developer Michael Leshinsky called the loan a critical part of the project. The Rhode Island Infrastructure Bank is the state’s central hub for financing infrastructure improvements for municipalities, businesses and homeowners.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Lawmakers are considering a bill to let mental health professionals refuse to provide care that violates their religious beliefs in response to an ordinance banning conversion therapy for minors in the capital city. The Senate Medical Affairs subcommittee heard testimony on the legislation Monday but didn’t take a vote. The state already has such medical conscience protections in place for doctors and other health care providers, allowing them to opt out of providing nonemergency services to people when it contradicts their religious, moral, ethical or philosophical beliefs or principles. The legislation would expand those protections to mental health professionals, said bill sponsor Sen. Josh Kimbrell, R-Spartanburg. The bill is a direct response to Columbia’s new ordinance barring attempts by licensed therapists and counselors to change the sexual orientation of minors. Opponents say the bill would harm LGBTQ individuals and make health care more difficult to access for many marginalized and rural South Carolinians. Kimbrell previously asked South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson to block the Columbia measure, which was passed last week and is reported to be the first of its kind in the state.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The state’s largest health care providers proposed Monday that lawmakers drop part of the requirement for people seeking medical marijuana identification cards to obtain a physician’s recommendation to use the drug. Under the proposal, physicians would still need to certify that patients have conditions such as severe pain, seizures or multiple sclerosis that would qualify them for a medical marijuana ID. But they would not need to specifically recommend that medical marijuana be used to treat the condition. The proposal was welcomed by medical marijuana advocates, who have worried that patients will have a difficult time getting medical pot recommendations. Doctors have expressed hesitancy about recommending medical marijuana as the state prepares to legalize it. Although a voter-passed law legalizing medical marijuana takes effect July 1, the full medical cannabis program is still in flux. The state has until November to start issuing ID cards, meaning people wouldn’t be able to legally buy medical cannabis until then. In the meantime, legislators are planning changes to the law. Sarah Aker, director of fiscal policy at the South Dakota Association of Healthcare Organizations, said doctors might be more comfortable writing certifications if they didn’t specifically recommend using cannabis.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Justin Timberlake was back in his hometown, virtually, as he videoconferenced into a workshop with students of the Stax Music Academy. Timberlake and a team of his associated producers, musicians and industry figures helped guide a two-month creative class and mentorship program. Eight Stax Music Academy students, working as teams, were invited to take part in the “All Star Song Lab.” On Thursday evening, the Memphis-born pop star celebrated the program’s completion with the students and their parents during an event in which the songs they wrote and recorded as part of the program were played. Although Timberlake had conducted a similar workshop in 2019 in person at the academy, the pandemic forced this year’s more expansive effort to take place through computers. Two summers ago, as part of a Levi’s funded initiative, the company and Timberlake installed a creative space called “The Song Lab” in the Stax Music Academy building in South Memphis. That August, Timberlake surprised students with a two-day workshop that also featured noted producers Timbaland and Rob Knox and Memphis guitarist Elliot Ives. Timberlake also pledged to contribute $100,000 toward a scholarship fund for SMA students.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The veto period from the regular legislative session has ended with Gov. Greg Abbott blocking 20 bills from becoming law, including efforts to protect dogs from dangerous restraints and allow police to issue citations for trespassing. Abbott also vetoed legislation requiring middle schools and high schools to provide instruction on preventing child abuse, family violence and dating violence. Though the subjects are important, Senate Bill 1109 “fails to recognize the right of parents to opt their children out of the instruction,” Abbott said in a statement accompanying his veto. “I have vetoed similar legislation before on this ground, because we must safeguard parental rights regarding this type of instruction.” The governor also took exception to SB 474, which sought to prohibit owners from tethering unattended dogs outdoors without providing access to adequate shelter, shade and water, among other protocols. “Texas is no place for this kind of micromanaging and overcriminalization,” Abbott wrote, saying that animal cruelty laws already protect dogs. The Texas Humane Legislative Network spent six years working toward passage of the bill, and its members were devastated by the veto, Executive Director Shelby Bobosky said.\n\nUtah\n\nMoab: Arches National Park is on track to have its busiest year ever, and that increase in visitation has caused the park to close its gates more than 80 times so far in 2021. Two other popular national parks in the West – Rocky Mountain and Yosemite – implemented reservation systems last year due to the pandemic. Both brought reservations back this summer in anticipation of record visitation. Park advocates along with Moab and Grand County officials say a similar system could help alleviate congestion and protect Arches. But efforts to implement a timed-entry system there have failed in the past. Lines and closures have been a problem at Arches since about 2016, according to Joette Langianese, director of a nonprofit called Friends of Arches and Canyonlands Parks that helps raise funds and advocate for both parks. Visitation dropped a bit last year because of the pandemic, but she said tourists are back in full force this year, and they’re wreaking havoc on the park, littering and wandering off paths. Langianese said those are the kinds of things rangers are supposed to monitor, but the sheer number of visitors is making it hard. She said a reservation system would spread visitors out over the course of the day during the high season so that the park isn’t swamped. “Let’s just try it, see how it works,” Langianese said.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state is ending its pandemic-related emergency housing in hotels and motels for some of the homeless population because the program is not sustainable, hotel capacity is shrinking, and it was never meant to be a permanent solution, Human Services Secretary Mike Smith said Tuesday. Roughly 700 people, or about a third of the homeless people put up in motels during the coronavirus pandemic, will no longer be eligible July 1, officials estimate. “This was possible because the public health and travel restrictions essentially closed Vermont tourism, and hotels and motels stepped up,” Smith said during the governor’s weekly coronavirus briefing. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is reimbursing the state for the nearly $79 million cost of the program, he said. It was projected to rise to $108 million in fiscal year 2022 if changes weren’t made while federal reimbursement is uncertain, he said. The Legislature asked the Human Services Agency to create a work group to come up with a transition plan, Smith said. The plan was accepted by the Legislature and includes a more expansive program than before the pandemic – estimated to cost $41 million, compared to $6 million pre-pandemic, he said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: If a court clears the way, the state expects to remove not just a soaring statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from Richmond’s historic Monument Avenue but also a little-known piece of history tucked inside the massive sculpture’s base: a 134-year-old time capsule. Historical records and recent imaging tests suggest the presence of the time capsule, which some have speculated might contain a rare, valuable and historically significant photo of deceased President Abraham Lincoln. “Anyone who has an interest in Civil War history or Richmond history would be very intrigued by this item,” said Dale Brumfield, a local historian and author who has conducted extensive research on the aged copper receptacle and rumored photo. The removal work is contingent on the resolution of two still-pending lawsuits seeking to keep the monument in place. The bronze equestrian statue of Lee was one of five enormous Confederate tributes along Monument Avenue and the only one that belonged to the state. Like many other cities across the South, Richmond removed the figures on its monuments last summer amid nationwide protests against racial injustice and criticism that the statues are symbols of white supremacy that should not occupy public places.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: The medical school at Washington State University has received full accreditation, the final step in an academic journey that took nearly six years. The Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine, in Spokane, on Tuesday received full accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education, which accredits medical degree programs in the U.S. and Canada. “Achieving full accreditation marks the culmination of a journey that began the day we started the Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine,” said John Tomkowiak, founding dean of the medical school named for the late WSU president. The effort started in 2015, after Gov. Jay Inslee signed a bill that gave WSU authority to create a medical school. That overturned a previous law that had been in place for nearly 100 years prohibiting the creation of a new public medical school in the state. In 2016, the LCME granted preliminary accreditation to the WSU College of Medicine, which allowed the college to begin recruiting students and accepting applications for the college’s inaugural class of 2021. The college was granted provisional accreditation in 2019. Accreditation is a peer-review process that determines whether a medical school’s program meets established standards.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Lawmakers will convene Thursday to take up $250 million in spending proposed by Gov. Jim Justice after a “tremendous” budget surplus. The Republican governor has suggested moving the millions to a wide variety of state departments, from tourism to natural resources. There are proposed upgrades to correctional facilities and expansions to some West Virginia State Parks. The Legislature will meet at noon to act on the funds. Earlier this month, lawmakers met to pour federal funds and extra state cash into road repairs, health care and education programs such as school lunches. Those efforts included about $902 million in federal funds received through pandemic relief legislation signed into law by President Joe Biden. Much of that funding came through grants directed by the federal government to be spent on programs such as substance abuse prevention, aid for needy families and child care services. Another $150 million from a state budget surplus was dedicated to fund 702 miles of road paving and projects on 40 bridges across all 55 counties.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Federal officials have designated a huge swath of the state’s Lake Michigan coastline as a National Marine Sanctuary to protect historic shipwrecks in the area, Gov. Tony Evers’ office announced Tuesday. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will publish regulations designating 962 square miles from Kewaunee County south to Ozaukee County as a sanctuary, Evers’ office said. The designation will protect 36 shipwrecks, 21 of which are on the National Register of Historic Places. Evers’ office said research suggests the area may include as many as 60 additional shipwrecks. The designation is subject to congressional and gubernatorial review. Evers said his administration is “really excited” about the designation, according to comments posted on NOAA’s website. The shipwreck sanctuary would become the 15th marine sanctuary NOAA has established. The network encompasses more than 600,000 square miles of marine and Great Lakes waters. Then-Gov. Scott Walker nominated the Lake Michigan area as a sanctuary in 2014. Boats would be prohibited from anchoring on shipwrecks in the sanctuary, and the sanctuary could draw tourists to the area, but beyond that the designation appears to have little practical effect.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Drivers were caught speeding less last year in Wyoming, but those who got nabbed were going faster than usual. Citations for speeding fell 15% in 2020, but there were 29% more citations for people driving over 100 mph, according to the Wyoming Highway Patrol. While highway traffic was down during the coronavirus pandemic, the drivers out there “felt that they could be going faster,” patrol Capt. David Wagener said. Law enforcement gave out nearly 1,500 citations in the state last year for “excessive speeding,” defined as going 15 mph or more above the posted speed limit. That was more than 300 more tickets for excessive speed than the number issued in 2019, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Driving too fast, especially in foul weather, is a leading factor in Wyoming’s serious accidents. More than 1,600 such crashes in the state in the last decade involved excessive speeding.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/01/29/atari-hotel-wienermobile-warning-goat-mayors-rival-news-around-states/41104037/", "title": "Atari hotel, Wienermobile warning, goat mayor's K-9 rival: News from ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nOpelika: The city is developing a new a system of pedestrian and bicycle paths. The Opelika City Council recently voted to hire a Birmingham firm to develop a master plan for the path system, The Opelika-Auburn News reports. The aim is to create a network of paths that get people where they want to go, City Planning Director Matt Mosley said. Sain Associates will be paid $150,000 by the city, which will recoup 80% of that cost through a state transportation grant, the newspaper reports. By using a map of the city, the firm will be able to identify potential paths, while also taking into account other infrastructure plans the city may have in mind for those areas, City Engineer Scott Parker said. The project is separate from the Creekline Trails multipurpose path plan, Parker said.\n\nAlaska\n\nBethel: Two animal groups plan to help a small village clear out all its stray dogs, officials said. Bethel Friends of Canines and Alaskan Animal Rescue Friends hope to catch and remove the wandering animals from Tuntutuliak on Friday, Alaska’s Energy Desk reports. After volunteers vaccinate the dogs, some will be given to homes in Bethel, while most will be transported to animal rescues in Anchorage, officials said. Tuntutuliak residents should keep their pets inside during the sweep so they are not mistaken for strays, coordinator Jesslyn Elliott said. The organizations said the village’s traditional council contacted them with a request to help remove the dogs. Ravn Air Group, Grant Aviation Inc. and Northern Air Cargo LLC are expected to transport dog kennels to the area and donate space to fly the dogs to Anchorage, while a website has been set up to help collect funding for the effort.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Atari is bringing its virtual experience to life with video game-themed hotels, and the first location will be in the Valley of the Sun. The first Atari Hotel is slated to break ground this year. The gaming pioneer, known for classic arcade games such as Asteroids and Pong as well as the Atari 2600 console, plans to build in downtown Phoenix, says Shelly Murphy of GSD Group. Phoenix is ideal because it’s close to Los Angeles, Las Vegas and San Francisco, and it’s where the hotels’ developers, GSD Group and Truth North Studio, are located, Murphy says. Fans of gaming can sign up online to become Atari Hotel members and get discounts on hotel stays, apparel and events. The site will host national esports competitions and local tournaments and offer spaces for private parties. Local visitors won’t need to have a hotel reservation to play games there, Murphy says.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A federal appeals court on Monday ruled against Arkansas preventing candidates for state office from accepting campaign contributions more than two years before an election, blocking the restriction from being enforced. A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a judge’s decision to grant a preliminary injunction against the state’s “blackout period.” A Pulaski County woman had sued over the restriction, and her attorneys argued it prevented her from exercising her First Amendment right to contribute money to candidates she wants to support in the 2022 election. The court questioned the state’s argument that the blackout period helps prevent corruption or the appearance of corruption.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: A billionaire who has been fighting for more than a decade to keep a secluded beach to himself has filed a new complaint in his lawsuit against the state and San Mateo County for allegedly harassing him and violating his property rights. In his new complaint filed Friday in San Francisco, Venture capitalist Vinod Khosla accuses top officials with the California Coastal Commission and State Lands Commission of trying to force the billionaire to let the public onto his property to use Martins Beach, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. The complaint also names San Mateo County Sheriff Carlos Bolanos and Steve Monowitz, the director of the San Mateo County Planning and Building Department, alleging they all engaged in “a concerted effort … to single out, coerce, and harass one coastal property owner for refusing to cede its private property rights.”\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: Wolves are officially back in the Centennial State. Though Colorado Parks and Wildlife recently announced that a likely wolf pack had been confirmed in the state following a late October sighting in Moffat County in northwestern Colorado, the agency now has further evidence bolstering wolves’ return. Wildlife officers spotted about six wolves Jan. 19 while investigating an animal carcass surrounded by large, wolflike tracks in the northwest corner of Moffat County, according to a news release. During the investigation, the officers “were surprised when they heard distinct howls within the area,” according to the release. Using binoculars, they spotted the wolves about 2 miles away from the carcass. By the time they got to the site, the animals were gone, but the officers found large tracks from what appeared to be at least six animals. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis called the officers’ sighting “historic.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nMontville: For decades the Montville High School athletic teams have competed as the “Indians” with the blessing of the Mohegans, the Native American tribe that traces its local history back centuries and today operates one of the world’s biggest casinos. But last week, the Mohegan Tribe announced it no longer supports the use of Indian-related team names. The reversal has unsettled many in the town, which has considered itself immune to controversies stirred by Native American mascots elsewhere because of its close ties to the federally recognized tribe. Not only is the tribe behind Mohegan Sun a major presence in town and a booster of its athletic programs, but many tribal members have been among the students to wear the black and orange of the Montville Indians. Mayor Ronald McDaniel said the school system will follow up with the tribe, but the name has never been a source of friction.\n\nDelaware\n\nNew Castle: Frontier Airlines will soon end the state’s status as the only one in the country without commercial air service. Frontier announced Tuesday that it will begin offering nonstop flights from Wilmington-New Castle Airport to Orlando, Florida, starting May 14. The flights will be offered during the summer on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays. Delaware has been the only state without commercial airline service since Frontier left in June 2015 after a two-year run. Denver-based Frontier, an ultra-low-cost airline, first began service in Delaware in July 2013. It once offered flights from Wilmington-New Castle to Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Detroit, Houston and three Florida destinations. It later limited its Delaware flights to Orlando and Tampa before ceasing operations completely in June 2015.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Metropolitan Police Department has announced a new policy that will prohibit the arrest of children 12 and under as part of an effort to limit juvenile arrests in the city, WUSA-TV reports. The department says it has recognized that juveniles and adults are physically and psychologically different, and cases involving an interaction between an officer and a child can have a lasting impact. MPD officials say they want to make sure that juvenile encounters with police are respectful and that officers are aware of the developmental differences in young people. MPD plans to provide officer training such as de-escalation, adolescent brain development, and trauma-informed policing to better protect and serve the residents and young people in the district.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The state could turn to the sky to fight Burmese pythons on the ground under a bill a Senate committee unanimously approved Monday to allow two state agencies to use drones in the effort to eradicate invasive plants and animals. The bill would create an exception to a current law that prohibits law enforcement from using drones to gather information and bans state agencies from using drones to gather images on private land. It would allow the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and the Florida Forest Service to fly drones to manage and eradicate invasion species on public lands. Sen. Ben Albritton said drones would also help the agencies spot lygodium, a fern native to Asia that’s destroying Florida’s natural vegetation. The wildlife agency’s website warns that lygodium spreads rapidly and is a “severe threat” to Everglades tree islands and puts other forests at greater risk for wildfires because it serves as a fire ladder.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: High school students would face a cap on the number of college courses the state would pay for under a bill that passed the state Senate on Tuesday. House Bill 444 passed on a 34-18 vote and now moves to the House for more debate. Gov. Brian Kemp and a number of lawmakers say the cost of Georgia’s dual enrollment program, which pays for college courses for high schoolers, is growing too quickly. Most students would be limited to 30 hours of college credit, what a student typically has to take to reach college sophomore status. Most Democrats opposed the bill, saying that there are better ways to control costs than an arbitrary cap and that reducing funding could burden students. The state would pay for only regular academic courses in English and language arts, mathematics, science, social studies and foreign languages. It also would pay for technical courses in one of 17 state-designated career pathways.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Scientists will decide whether to establish a captive breeding program on the U.S. mainland in an attempt to prevent the extinction of a bird species only found on Maui, officials say. A decision about the plan to save the endangered kiwikiu is expected at a meeting of project partners Thursday, The Hawaii Star-Advertiser reports. A nonprofit bird facility on the mainland has expressed interest in a kiwikiu captive-breeding program, officials say. Also known as the Maui parrotbill, the population of yellow and olive-green forest birds has dwindled to fewer than 300. The Maui Forest Bird Recovery Project halted a program to establish a population on the windward slopes of Maui’s Haleakala volcano after mosquito-borne avian malaria killed 10 of 13 birds set to be released in October, including one that died before it was set free. The final three are missing and presumed dead.\n\nIdaho\n\nDonnelly: Authorities say 25 people were hospitalized for carbon monoxide poisoning while staying at a vacation rental home in this mountain town. Donnelly Rural Fire Protection Chief Juan Bonilla says firefighters were called to the vacation home about 6:30 a.m. Monday and found the occupants complaining of headaches and nausea. Two adults and two children were initially taken by ambulance to a hospital in McCall. Once health care workers realized they had symptoms consistent with carbon monoxide poisoning, fire crews tested the air in the home and found above-normal levels, Bonilla said. That’s when the other 21 residents were taken to the hospital as well. Officials say 21 of the people staying at the home have since been treated and released. “We averted a horrific tragedy,” St. Luke’s Hospital spokeswoman Laura Crawford said.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Underprivileged areas in the city will receive an estimated $20 million investment for revitalization efforts that prioritize affordable housing and economic development, Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced Monday. Fifth Third Bank is putting money into “Opportunity Zone” neighborhoods in the city’s South and West sides. The bank’s commitment is part of the federal program that uses tax incentives to encourage private investment in financially destitute communities. “It’s designed to help transform some of our nation’s most challenged communities,” Mitchell Feiger, chairman and CEO of Fifth Third, said at a news conference on the South Side. “I’m confident it will have that impact here.” Feiger said the funding is intended for projects that can “transform affordable housing, revitalize the local retail economy and create jobs.” Specific projects will be unveiled in the coming months, officials said.\n\nIndiana\n\nGary: A man fishing from a northwestern Indiana bridge reeled in an apparent live grenade, prompting a road closure until the device was removed by a bomb squad. A Gary police officer who was called to the Little Calumet River bridge Monday evening to investigate learned that a man who had been fishing from the bridge pulled up what seemed to be a live grenade, The (Northwest Indiana) Times reports. The road that traverses the bridge was temporarily closed off, and the Porter County Bomb Squad was called for assistance. The bomb squad took possession of the grenade without incident, Gary Police Lt. Dawn Westerfield said. Authorities were investigating how and when the grenade ended up in the river in the city located about 30 miles southeast of Chicago.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Angered by a flag observing Transgender Day that briefly flew over the state Capitol, Republican lawmakers moved forward Monday with a bill that would limit the types of flags state and local governments can display. Republicans moved the bill from a subcommittee to a full committee for consideration. It would allow only the flag of the United States, the state flag, a prisoner of war/missing in action flag, and a flag of the city, county or school district from being flown at government buildings. A flag observing Transgender Day flew over the Capitol for less than five minutes in November at the request of Iowa Safe Schools, a group advocating for a safer environment for LGBTQ youth. Some Republican lawmakers objected and promised to introduce legislation. Republican Sen. Jake Chapman said there must be limits, raising the possibility of a KKK or Nazi flag being flown above the Capitol.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: The University of Kansas Medical Center is testing a male contraceptive gel that men apply to their shoulders. The school’s research institution is conducting a clinical trial for the contraceptive and searching for couples to participate. Dr. Ajay Nangia, the center’s vice chair of urology, is a collaborating investigator of the study. “I think what we’re finding is in the big picture there’s a big need for a male contraceptive,” Nangia told the Lawrence Journal-World. The gel is a mixture of Nestorone and testosterone. Nestorone is a synthetic progestin that blocks the production of male hormones needed to generate sperm. The testosterone in the gel replaces testosterone usually produced in the male body. A nonprofit called The Population Council and the National Institute of Health are partnering to create the gel.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A bill that would require doctors and other health workers to provide life-sustaining care for an infant born alive after a failed abortion attempt was approved by the state Senate on Monday. The measure sailed through the Senate on a 32-0 vote and heads to the House next. It’s the latest in a series of abortion-related bills to surface in the Republican-dominated Legislature in recent years. The bill would require health care workers to give “medically appropriate and reasonable life-saving and life-sustaining medical care and treatment” to protect the lives of newborns, including any infant born after a failed abortion. Sen. Whitney Westerfield, the bill’s lead sponsor, said last week that he wasn’t aware of any instances in which an infant was born alive in Kentucky from a failed abortion. The American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky has said the legislation is based on “false claims” and has “nothing to do with how abortion care actually works.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The Bayou Country Superfest is hanging up its cowboy boots and spurs. In a tweet Monday, organizers of the 10-year-old country music festival announced that the Memorial Day weekend event “will be on hiatus until further notice.” The festival began in Baton Rouge, briefly switched to New Orleans, then returned to Baton Rouge over its decadelong tenure. Last year’s event drew about 50,000 people to Tiger Stadium in Louisiana’s capital city – but that was a smaller crowd than in previous years. At its peak, 135,000 people attended Bayou Country Superfest in 2014. “We thank the fans who came for the party, and the event sponsors who helped make the Festival a Memorial Day Weekend tradition,” the organizers posted on Twitter. Some of the biggest names in country music played the festival over the years, such as George Strait, Tim McGraw, Miranda Lambert and Carrie Underwood.\n\nMaine\n\nOrono: The University of Maine System board of trustees has voted for the University of Southern Maine to enter negotiations for a proposed $100 million career center and residence hall. The trustees on Monday unanimously approved “the largest single investment” in the University of Southern Maine’s history, university president Glenn Cummings said. The proposed 577-bed dormitory includes single-occupancy rooms, studios and larger apartments with multiple bedrooms. The proposal estimates students would pay $800 to $1,200 per room per month. Construction would begin at the university’s Portland campus this summer and be completed by the fall of 2022, the Portland Press Herald reports. The board of trustees also approved a $1.7 million project to expand the Wishcamper parking lot and help replace the approximately 160 parking spots that will be lost because of the construction.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Emergency operators in Anne Arundel County are switching to a 24-hour shift schedule in hopes the change will ease fatigue. Starting Thursday, operators will work 24 hours and then have 72 hours off, Fire Chief Trisha Wolford told the Capital Gazette. She said operators were looking for new shifts because working two 10-hour shifts during the day followed by two 14-hour shifts at night made it difficult to maintain proper sleep schedules. “The operators said (they) want to come off of 10s and 14s. They said they can’t get a sleep pattern and are exhausted,” Wolford said. Wolford said the move could help with operator retention. The change was put to a vote and was “passed overwhelmingly,” said Mike Akers, president of AFSCME Local 582. The new shift structure would give workers an hour break during the day and a five-hour break at night. In addition to a lounge area and a workout room, there are beds available for operators to take a nap.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Emerson College is investigating racist graffiti directed at Asian students that was found in a dormitory, administrators said. Employees at the Little Building found derogatory words written on multiple doors Friday, according to an email sent by Emerson’s president, Lee Pelton, on Sunday. He did not specify what words were written. Pelton said the graffiti is the second report of offensive language being directed at Asian students in that dorm. Four swastikas were found drawn in stairwells in another dormitory Tuesday. The students directly affected in the Little Building have been offered support, Pelton said. Other students in the residence hall are also receiving guidance on community standards and bias. “Such cowardly acts will not change who we are,” Pelton wrote in the email. “Emerson will remain a welcoming place for all, not only in theory but in practice.”\n\nMichigan\n\nPontiac: Volunteers and local groups plan to install a new monument at a cemetery that will carry the names of people who died in state asylums and whose graves are currently marked by small, numbered stones. The monument will include the names of 283 patients and be installed this spring at the historic Oak Hill Cemetery in the southeastern Michigan city of Pontiac, The Oakland Press reports. Volunteers and the Better Pontiac Community Development Corporation have spent four years raising the $5,000 needed for the monument. The Oakland County Pioneer and Historical Society also raised $2,650 during last year’s Oak Hill Cemetery Walk for the project. The graves date back to the late 1800s. The monument will have a decorative front, and the names of those buried there will be on the back. The original stone graves will remain in place as volunteers work on new landscaping for the area. The groups hope to install the monument before Memorial Day.\n\nMinnesota\n\nCloquet: The Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa will now require permits for most people to access its lands. The band said Monday that the policy is a way to “better manage and conserve” resources on about 41,000 acres of land on the Fond du Lac Reservation in northeastern Minnesota. “Over the years, we have seen an enormous amount of stress placed on these fragile ecosystems,” Thomas Howes, the band’s natural resources program manager, said in a statement. “Issues such as illegal garbage dumping, ATV traffic and overall growth in population have the potential to take their toll on wildlife and vegetation.” Permits will cost $25 for 30-day access and $100 per year. Access was previously allowed without a permit, the Star Tribune reports. Band members, their spouses and descendants, and reservation allotment owners will be granted permits at no charge.\n\nMississippi\n\nFulton: For 32 hours, 10-year-old Mikylah Blackburn was held hostage over a year ago by the man who authorities said killed her father. She has now been recognized for using her cellphone to communicate with officials, which a sheriff’s office says saved the lives of two deputies. Blackburn, now 11, received a certificate of bravery, a police badge and other items Monday from the Itawamba County Sheriff’s Office, WTVA-TV reports. In December 2018, Nathan Shepard killed the girl’s father, Paul Blackburn, then held the girl hostage, the sheriff’s office said. The girl used her phone to tell authorities what was going on in the house, including that Shepard had a gun. “If you hadn’t have called dispatch and told the two people out there not to come in, he would have went in,” Itawamba County Sheriff Chris Dickinson said Monday, gesturing to a deputy. A SWAT team entered the home, and Shepard was killed, ending the standoff. Blackburn was rescued safely.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: The state plans to cut more than 1,700 beds at prisons as a result of a drop in inmates. Department of Corrections spokeswoman Karen Pojmann said the number of prisoners has dropped from more than 33,000 in 2017 to about 26,000 as of Friday. She attributed the drop to changes in Missouri criminal laws that led judges to sentence more people to probation instead of prison time. Beds are being eliminated at the Algoa, Boonville, Tipton, Farmington and Northeast correctional centers, as well as the Western Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center. Pojmann said the cuts mean the agency no longer needs to fill about 130 vacant full-time staff jobs. She said reducing beds is expected to save about $6.5 million and will allow the agency to avoid another $6.6 million in needed maintenance projects. Pojmann says the department wants to reinvest that money into building repairs and other projects aimed at increasing safety.\n\nMontana\n\nButte: Atlantic Richfield has scrapped a proposal to build a second water treatment plant to lower the level of acidic, metal-laden water that has collected in a former copper mining pit. There were concerns that reducing the water levels in Berkeley Pit could destabilize portions of the walls of the pit, Cameron Nazminia, director of state and local affairs for Atlantic Richfield, told The Montana Standard. Atlantic Richfield, which is owned by BP, suggested the additional water treatment last summer after after a tailings dam failed in Brazil in January 2019, killing 270 people. The idea was that if the tailings dam at Berkeley Pit failed, the pit would have enough room to hold the additional water. Berkeley Pit began filling with water after Atlantic Richfield turned off underground pumps in 1982. Atlantic Richfield/BP and Montana Resources are responsible to maintain the water level in the pit below the level at which it would enter Butte’s groundwater.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission has scheduled workshops for youth fishing instructors. Instructors are part of the Youth Fishing Program, a statewide team of volunteers and Game and Parks staffers who host educational fishing events. The volunteers will have access to Game and Parks’ loaner fishing equipment and educational materials for events. They also will receive program incentives. Training will take place in Lincoln at the Nebraska Game and Parks Outdoor Education Center on Feb. 2, March 29 and April 26, from 2 to 6 p.m. A workshop is scheduled to run from 6 to 9 p.m. May 6 at the Fort Kearny State Historical Park Visitors Center. Contact Larry Pape online to register.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Airbnb says stays in and around the city increased 19% last year compared with a year earlier, even though residential short-term rentals are illegal in much of the area. The Las Vegas Sun reports company figures showed 882,000 guest arrivals in Clark County in 2019, with more than $138 million collected by Airbnb hosts. That was up from about $100 million in 2018. The most lucrative weekend was during the Electric Daisy Carnival music festival in mid-May. Residential short-term rentals are illegal in unincorporated Clark County and North Las Vegas, while Henderson and Las Vegas allow them with restrictions. The Sun said county officials investigated more than 1,000 short-term rental violation cases last year, levied nearly $900,000 in fines and placed liens on 68 properties deemed to be in violation county short-term rental rules.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nNorth Woodstock: A woman says the operators of a seasonal attraction of ice structures failed to control runoff and flooded her basement with more than 15,000 gallons of water – and she worries it will happen again this spring. Kelly Trinkle alleges in a lawsuit against Ice Castles that last April, snow and ice melt from the attraction pooled in her backyard in North Woodstock and flooded her basement with 16 inches of water, New Hampshire Public Radio reports. Trinkle is seeking $100,000 in damages but says her largest concern is not the lawsuit or the flooding but what will happen this spring. A lawyer for Ice Castles denied that the structures flooded Trinkle’s basement, writing to NHPR that they were “largely still in ice form” when the flooding happened. “Due to the topography of the land, the water that flooded the Trinkles’ basement came from a large watershed,” the lawyer wrote.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state’s residents could see their water bills go up under a plan advanced by lawmakers Monday that calls for replacing all underground lead pipes that taint water before it flows into schools, businesses and homes across the state. The legislation would require water providers to identify lead pipes in their systems and to share the cost of replacing the entire pipe, even the portion on private property, with customers. Who should fund the pipe replacement was debated in a Senate committee Monday, even among supporters of the bill who called it a solution to a public health crisis. Lead is an invisible metal that can leach from pipes, typically found in older homes, and cause permanent brain damage and developmental delays in children. Lawmakers have promised action to remove lead after water filters in Newark failed to remove it from water in three homes last summer and following a USA TODAY Network report that identified 250,000 children exposed to lead in their schools.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state is considering new funding for research into treating addiction with injectable opioids to help address long-term dependency on heroin and other opioids. A bill from Democratic state Rep. Miguel Garcia would provide $150,000 to the University of New Mexico for a demonstration project focused on injectable opioids including pharmaceutical-grade heroin or the drug hydromorphone that is routinely prescribed for pain. Opioid and heroin use has plagued some New Mexico communities for generations. The state has pioneered a series of policies aimed at combating opioid addiction, including becoming the first state to require law enforcement agencies to provide officers with overdose antidote kits. The state has a prescription monitoring database to prevent overlapping drug sales and has expanded access to naloxone, a drug that can reverse overdoses.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state could have one of the most lenient marijuana possession thresholds in the nation if an alternative legalization proposal is passed this session. The bill, sponsored by state Sen. Liz Krueger and Assemblymember Crystal Peoples-Stokes, both Democrats, would allow people over 21 years old to have 3 ounces of marijuana. Supporters of the proposal say higher possession thresholds would help prevent people from getting wrapped up in the criminal justice system. A competing proposal from Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo, which lawmakers are debating, would only allow dispensaries to sell 1 ounce of marijuana per person on a daily basis. The governor’s office says the 1 ounce threshold is largely the status quo among other states that have legalized the drug. Under the plan included in Cuomo’s budget, people caught smoking marijuana in public could face a $125 fine.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A new book by the founding director of North Carolina African American Heritage Commission teaches children about the history of African Americans’ contributions to the state. “My N.C. from A to Z” was written by Michelle Lanier, who advocated for legislation that created the commission, according to a news release from the state Department of Natural and Cultural Releases. She then served as its founding executive director. In 2018 Lanier became the first African American director of North Carolina’s Division of State Historic Sites. Each letter of the alphabet represents African American people and places rooted in North Carolina. For example, “B” stands for Black Wall Street, which was a four-block area in Durham where African American enterprise thrived in the late 1800s and early 1900s. “T” stands for Thomas Day of Milton, a furniture maker in the 1800s whose pieces are still collected today.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: The North Dakota State football team will be returning to the White House for a second year in a row after winning another FCS national championship. Sen. Kevin Cramer tweeted over the weekend that President Donald Trump invited the team for a return visit after its perfect 16-0 season. The Bison are the FCS national champion for a record eighth time after defeating James Madison 28-20 to close out the season earlier this month in Texas. It’s the team’s third straight national championship. Cramer says details of the visit are still being worked out.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Individuals convicted of trying to buy sex or trafficking women for sex would be placed on a publicly accessible database for five years, under legislation introduced in the state House. The legislation backed by Attorney General David Yost is aimed at the demand side of prostitution, according to supporters of the bill. “Under current law, it is not difficult for someone caught soliciting a prostitute to keep that information hidden from friends, family and their employer,” said Rep. Cindy Abrams, a Republican from Harrison in suburban Cincinnati. Co-sponsor Rep. Rick Carfagna, a Republican from Genoa Township in suburban Columbus, said the bill could provide the deterrent needed to stop people from soliciting sex. Individuals would automatically drop off the database if five years pass without another conviction.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Legislature will consider new rules that would raise the student performance standards for schools to operate on a four-day workweek. The Oklahoma State Board of Education voted Thursday in favor of adopting the new standards starting in the 2021-22 school year. The rules would still need the approval of the Legislature, which opens its session Monday, The Oklahoman reports. To qualify for a four-day week, elementary and middle schools would have to score at least a C in academic growth for math and English language arts on annual Oklahoma State Report Cards. The report cards measure school performance across several indicators that include academic achievement and growth, chronic absenteeism, progress in English language proficiency evaluations, post-secondary opportunities and graduation.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The City Council is reconsidering its homeless camping ban. Since the ban took effect in mid-December, the city has been scrambling to find options for where to put the roughly 300 homeless people who have been living on downtown sidewalks. Councilor Tom Anderson moved to have the council consider limiting its camping ban to downtown, city parks and residentially zoned neighborhoods at its Feb. 10 meeting. Anderson said he also isn’t opposed to looking at the tabled sit-lie ordinance, which would prohibit people from gathering on sidewalks in downtown as they have been. But altering the camping ban wouldn’t set up a tent city in Salem, either. The city looked at possible locations for a temporary shelter.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A monument honoring voting rights for African American men and women will soon be built on the state Capitol grounds. The monument will also commemorate former residents of the Old Eighth Ward, a black community in Harrisburg that was demolished to make way for the state Capitol Complex. The monument will be located on the Capitol grounds outside the K. Leroy Irvis Office Building, PennLive.com reports. The multipurpose monument, called “A Gathering at the Crossroads,” will feature four bronze, life-size statues of abolitionists and orators who fought for equal rights. The orators – William Howard Day, Thomas Morris Chester, Jacob T. Compton, and Francis Ellen Walker Harper – will be gathered around a pedestal inscribed with the names of 100 leaders of the Old Eighth Ward. Groundbreaking for the $400,000 monument will be held March 25, and the dedication is scheduled for June 15.\n\nRhode Island\n\nJamestown: A loop road that goes around a lighthouse at a state park has become so dangerously eroded that is it being closed to vehicular traffic, state environmental officials announced Tuesday. The road surrounding the lighthouse at Beavertail State Park in Jamestown will be closed to vehicles starting Monday, although it will remain accessible to pedestrians, the Department of Environmental Management said in a statement. “Residual damage from Superstorm Sandy along with erosion and storm surge intensified by climate change-driven sea level rise have caused dangerous washouts along the perimeter road and the surrounding pedestrian path” at the waterfront park at the southern tip of Jamestown, the department said. Posts and chains have been installed at the closure area, along with signs directing pedestrian traffic to continue to access the loop.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A bill allowing people to use a shopping service to buy beer and wine as well as groceries and have them delivered to their car is a step closer to being passed. The Senate Judiciary Committee approved the bill Tuesday after agreeing to changes including prohibiting the sale of chilled beer or wine that might be more tempting to drink on the way home. The bill also requires employees to check the identification of the person picking up the alcohol and record the ID and the time and date of the purchase. Supporters of the bill said a number of other Southern states already allow beer and wine with online grocery buying, and it is inconvenient to force a customer to have all their food delivered but then go inside for beer and wine. The bill now heads to the full state Senate.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Officials say more than 14 million people visited the state last year, marking the tenth consecutive year of growth for its tourism industry. The Department of Tourism said 2019 saw a record level of visitors, spending and economic impact. The number of visitors increased by about 3% from the prior year. Visitors spent about $4 billion, accounting for 5.2% of the state’s economy, according to the department’s annual report. Officials say more than 55,000 jobs are supported by the tourism industry, or 8.8% of all South Dakota jobs. The majority of tourists, or 10.7 million, visited South Dakota’s state and national parks, which include the Black Hills National Forest.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Newly revealed police records show a white officer charged with fatally shooting an armed black man who was running away had been reprimanded by supervisors months earlier for not shooting another armed suspect in a similar case. Officer Andrew Delke, 25, had been on the city’s police force for about a year when he used a stun gun to arrest an armed suspect, Terry Crowell, who ran from him in November 2017, WPLN News reports. Sgt. Matthew Boguskie later held an “informal counseling session” with him, telling Delke he should have used his firearm, the records state. Delke told the sergeant he didn’t pull his service weapon because of what he called “the hostile climate towards police use of force throughout the country.” He also told Boguskie that at the time he was thinking of Officer Josh Lippert, the former Nashville officer who shot Jocques Clemmons, a black man, after a traffic stop.\n\nTexas\n\nSan Antonio: A mother who says her 2-year-old son was seriously injured when a glass ketchup bottle fell on his head from a fifth-floor balcony of a hotel is suing the establishment for at least $1 million. Cassandra DeLa Cruz’s lawsuit says her son, Jacob Francisco, suffered serious injuries to his neck, brain and other parts of his body Aug. 18, 2018, when he was struck by the bottle as she pushed him past the Omni La Mansion Del Rio hotel in a stroller. The lawsuit names the hotel; its Dallas-based parent, Omni Hotels & Resorts; and its owner, TRT Holdings of Irving, as defendants. The suit says Jacob has received medical treatment since the bottle fell on him, and his “injuries may be permanent in nature.” The San Antonio Police Department says two people in a hotel room said they had been eating burgers on the balcony, and one of them said he may have accidentally knocked the 2.25-ounce Heinz ketchup bottle over the edge.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: State leaders repealed a tax reform package Tuesday that had come under widespread criticism. The Legislature approved and Republican Gov. Gary Herbert signed the repeal shortly after state elections officials reported that enough voter signatures had been verified to put a citizen referendum seeking to repeal the tax reform on the November ballot, the Deseret News reports. The House voted 70-1 and the Senate voted 27-0 on the repeal bill sponsored by Republican House Majority Leader Francis Gibson. Herbert signed it soon after. The tax reform package included reducing income taxes while raising sales taxes on food, gas and some services. Gibson acknowledged that many residents opposed the move. More than 117,000 verified referendum signatures were published, surpassing the required amount by about 1,000, officials said.\n\nVermont\n\nFair Haven: It’s Lincoln the goat versus Sammy the dog in the race for the town’s honorary mayor. The Nubian goat had won the post last year after the town manager came up with the pet mayor election to raise money to rehabilitate a community playground and get kids civically involved. “In Fair Haven, just like everywhere else, voter participation is not always as high as we want it,” Town Manager Joe Gunter says. Resident Cheryl Daviau says the race has gotten children involved in the election process. Her granddaughter got her picture taken with the goat mayor and loved it, she says. To up the ante, this year the police chief nominated K-9 Sammy, a German shepherd who visits local schools daily with a resource officer, attends concerts in the park and is beloved around town. Both Lincoln and Sammy are popular, so it could be a tight race. The election will be held March 3.\n\nVirginia\n\nVirginia Beach: A local commission is recommending that a Confederate monument in the city shouldn’t be removed but instead that historical context should be added in a new park and a second statue erected to honor African American heritage. The Virginia Beach Historic Preservation Commission planned to make its recommendation to the City Council on Tuesday, The Virginian-Pilot reports. The plan also suggests looking into whether a museum could be built nearby to tell a more “inclusive story” of the community’s history. The committee estimated the park and a second statue could cost up to $320,000, but the group will ask the council for an initial $50,000 for the project, the newspaper reports. Virginia prohibits local governments from removing memorials for war veterans, but Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring has questioned the law, and Gov. Ralph Northam also said he supports amending it.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: Bills to allow sports betting at Indian casinos in the state, including events like the Super Bowl and the World Series, have been introduced in the Legislature. The bills would allow owners of the 29 Indian casinos in the state to open Las Vegas-style sports books. However, a company that operates 19 private card rooms in Washington is crying foul. Maverick Gaming owner Eric Persson says the company should also be allowed to provide sports betting, including electronic betting using cellphones or computers. “That’s what the consumer wants,” Persson told the House Commerce and Gaming Committee on Monday afternoon. The committee heard testimony about the proposal but did not take a vote. Another hearing on sports betting is scheduled for Thursday before a Senate committee.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: In what they acknowledged is a long-shot bid, Gov. Jim Justice and Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. urged unhappy Virginia counties Tuesday to secede and join a neighboring state where Democrats aren’t in charge. Both Justice, a Republican in a state where the GOP dominates the Legislature, and Falwell, whose university is in Lynchburg, Virginia, said the invitation to join West Virginia sends a valid message. “If you’re not truly happy where you are, we stand with open arms to take you from Virginia or anywhere where you may be,” Justice said. “We stand strongly behind the Second Amendment, and we stand strongly for the unborn.” This month, the West Virginia House of Delegates and Senate introduced resolutions inviting parts of Virginia to join West Virginia.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWaukesha: Oscar Mayer’s iconic Wienermobile got a grilling from a sheriff’s deputy because the driver of the giant hot dog failed to give enough room to another car on the road with emergency lights. The deputy pulled over the Wienermobile and gave the driver a verbal warning for not following the law, the Waukesha Sheriff’s Office said in a tweet posted Monday. It showed a picture of the sheriff’s deputy’s SUV parked behind the Wienermobile with the hashtags #MoveOver #SlowDown #Wienermobile. Traffic laws require vehicles to move out of the lane closest to another car that is on the side of the road with emergency lights flashing. The first Weinermobile was created in 1936, and it has gone through several iterations since then.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The governor is reiterating his support for a statewide lodging tax to boost revenue. A lodging tax is the only new tax he would support, Gov. Mark Gordon said Friday. It would make Wyoming’s tourism promotion efforts more self-sufficient, Gordon told reporters at the Wyoming Press Association’s winter convention in Casper. A 5% statewide lodging tax passed the Wyoming House but failed in the Senate in 2019, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. The tax would have generated about $20 million a year. A four-week legislative session devoted primarily to the state budget begins Feb. 10.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/05/12/capital-reopening-free-rides-vaccine-theft-news-around-states/116148140/", "title": "Capital reopening, free rides: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Gov. Kay Ivey will end the state’s participation in federal unemployment programs geared to the pandemic, including supplements to jobless benefits and a suspension of a work-search requirement. The state will withdraw from the program June 19, the governor’s office said in a statement Monday. Applications for the pandemic-related benefits will be processed until then. The decision means the state will withdraw from programs that provided an additional $300 weekly payment in unemployment insurance; extended benefits to self-employed, gig workers and part-time workers; extended benefits for those who’ve exhausted regular benefits; and provided an additional $100 benefit to people with mixed earnings. “Among other factors, increased unemployment assistance, which was meant to be a short-term relief program during emergency related shutdowns, is now contributing to a labor shortage that is compromising the continuation of our economic recovery,” Ivey said in a statement. Studies have suggested the increased unemployment benefit has not affected job searches. Economists and staffing officials say individuals caring for family members with illness or supervising children learning from home may be contributing to the shortage of workers for advertised positions.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The Alaska House passed a version of the state operating budget Monday that leaves for later debate over how much to pay residents from the state’s oil-wealth fund for this year’s dividend. Time to resolve that debate is running out in the current legislative session, set to end May 19 unless lawmakers vote to give themselves up to an extra 10 days. The process is playing out later than usual: Often the House, which traditionally gets first dibs over the Senate on reworking the governor’s budget proposal, passes its version of the budget in March. But it took the House a month to organize after the session started in January. The bipartisan coalition in control of the House has the bare minimum needed for a majority, 21 members. Another factor has been funds from a federal pandemic relief aid package that the state is expecting. Guidance on use of the funds was released Monday. Jeff Turner, a spokesperson for Gov. Mike Dunleavy, said it will take time to review the material “and determine the best path forward.” Dunleavy had proposed an initial outline for the expected $1 billion. The House version of the budget proposed spending 70%; both proposals came before the guidelines were issued.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A legislator is likening state messages encouraging residents to get a COVID-19 shot to communism. COVID-19 vaccines are not mandatory in Arizona. But on digital billboards situated on state highways, the government has been urging residents to get vaccinated as a way of returning to normal life. State Sen. Kelly Townsend, R-Mesa, shared on social media last week that she thinks the signs are government overreach and similar to China, which has a one-party government – the Communist Party of China. “Want to return to normal? Get vaccinated,” says the digital billboard message that Townsend photographed and included in a tweet Thursday. “Seen in Communist China today,” Townsend wrote in the tweet accompanying the photo. “Oops, I mean Arizona.” The Oxford Dictionary defines “communism” as a political theory derived from Karl Marx that advocates class war leading to a society where property is publicly owned, and each person works and is paid according to their abilities and needs.\n\nArkansas\n\nSpringdale: Tyson Foods says it’s raising wages to combat absenteeism and worker turnover at its plants as U.S. demand for chicken soars. The Springdale-based company, which processes 20% of U.S. beef, chicken and pork, said Monday that absentee rates are about 50% higher than they were before the pandemic. Government stimulus payments and enhanced unemployment benefits have made it harder to keep some workers, the company said. Health concerns and child care issues have also been a factor. “It takes about six days right now to get five days’ worth of work done,” said Donnie King, Tyson’s chief operating officer, during a conference call Monday with investors. To combat COVID-19, Tyson began vaccinating workers in February through clinics at more than 100 sites. The company said Monday that it has vaccinated more than 42,000 employees, or about one-third of its workforce. Tyson said it’s also offering vaccines to team members’ families when possible. Tyson said it’s raising wages and implementing more flexible scheduling in order to keep its plants staffed. Executives did not elaborate on the percentage pay hikes workers were being given, and a company spokesman was unable to provide further details. “There’s not a magic bullet here. We’re looking at all kinds of things, trying to generate worker-driven solutions,” King said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Aided by an astonishing nearly $76 billion budget surplus, Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday proposed tax rebates of up to $1,100 for millions of households and more than $7 billion to help people affected by the pandemic cover rent and utilities. It was Newsom’s first in a weeklong rollout of pandemic recovery proposals totaling $100 billion, which could boost his political fortunes as he faces a likely recall election later this year. His opponents accused him of pandering and said the state would be better served by broader tax reforms. “Direct stimulus checks going into people’s pockets and direct relief – that’s meaningful,” Newsom said from a community organization in a disadvantaged Oakland neighborhood. Under his plan, roughly 11 million low- and middle-income Californians would see direct, one-time payments. Taxpayers making between $30,000 and $75,000 a year would get a $600 payment. Households making up to $75,000 with at least one child would get an extra $500 payment. The proposal builds on earlier payments to the lowest-income Californians and immigrants who pay taxes but did not get federal stimulus payments, including those living in the country illegally. The projected $75.7 billion surplus is largely due to taxes paid by rich Californians who generally did well during the pandemic.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state already had some of the hottest real estate markets in the nation. Now, lumber prices – up 250% compared to a year ago – are contributing to a price surge that shows no sign of slowing. Predictions of a pandemic-related housing slowdown never came to pass. Instead, the opposite happened. “The combination of the lockdowns and more time spent at home made people realize they wanted to live in a home that met their evolving needs,” economist Ali Wolf, with the housing market research firm Zonda, told The Denver Post. By December, new home contract sales were 43% above the same period a year earlier, according to Zonda. Now, 86% of builders report major lumber supply disruptions, and 96% report recent price increases associated with lumber costs, according to Zonda. The lumber price surge is also affecting remodeling. Deborah Cowles, of Centennial, put off replacing an old fence during the coronavirus pandemic, only to have contractors increase their price quotes by $1,000 or more a year later. Contractors also couldn’t guarantee they could get the type of wood she wanted, Cowles said. “It’s really caught us off guard,” she said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont announced Monday that 71% of adult residents have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. The state tops the nation when it comes to the percentage of fully vaccinated adults and is among the top five states in getting at least one shot in arms, the governor’s office said. About half of Connecticut’s 16- and 17 year-olds have gotten a shot, putting the vaccine rate for the total population at 57%, Lamont said. The numbers are much higher for those 45 and above (80%) and 65 and older (92%), he said. “What that means is that 45 and above, we’re very close to what they call herd immunity,” Lamont said. “I know that’s a moving target. But you add that 80% who have been vaccinated along with those who were previously infected over the last year or have some antibodies, we’re in pretty good shape.” The state did record 17 more COVID-19-related deaths over the weekend, bringing the total to 8,154 throughout the pandemic. But Lamont said hospitalizations fell by 29 patients to 280, the lowest total in more than seven months. He said that if the metrics continue to trend in the direction they are now going, Connecticut could be “back to normal” within a matter of months. “The fall, we’ll see if there are variants or anything that make us worry, but right now I think it’s a good summer,” he said.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Firefly Music Festival is planning to reduce capacity by about half of the usual level to about 45,000 fans this fall, state officials said – a reduced capacity that would make it the smallest since the festival’s 2012 debut. But details about other possible COVID-19-related precautions and restrictions have largely been undecided. State health officials will begin the detailed planning process with festival organizers later this month. Firefly dropped its 93-act lineup Monday for the Sept. 23-26 camping-and-music event, featuring headliners Billie Eilish, The Killers, Tame Impala and Lizzo. The Delaware Division of Public Health’s Jamie Mack said he and other health experts will be examining several factors including the state’s vaccination rate, new coronavirus cases and hospitalizations when determining what precautions will be in place. With cases dropping – the state’s seven-day average of new cases has decreased 44% from 304 to 169 in the past month – there is reason to be hopeful. “Over the last couple of weeks, we’ve seen a lot of these factors moving in a positive direction, and we’re optimistic they will continue that way through the summer, especially as we see more people get vaccinated,” said Mack, the state’s environmental health director. Nearly 40% of the state is fully vaccinated.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The city is emerging from its pandemic quarantine. With coronavirus numbers dropping, officials in the nation’s capital have announced a reopening timeline that would see all indoor capacity limits eliminated by early June, but with mask requirements still in place. Mayor Muriel Bowser unveiled a two-stage plan Monday, with capacity restrictions on most indoor activities lifting May 21, with the exception of bars, nightclubs and entertainment venues. Those final categories would see their capacity limits removed by June 11. The two dates represent a pair of major crossroads moments for Washington, both for the daily lives of its residents and for its hospitality-heavy economy, driven by tourism and conventions. “We are quickly and enthusiastically approaching containment level of the virus in our jurisdiction,” said Health Department Director Dr. LaQuandra Nesbitt. “But in the ensuing weeks, we continue to need to remain vigilant.” Virus metrics show daily case rates are down to levels not seen since last summer. Nesbitt said contract tracing for new cases “would remain a 24/7 operation.” Bowser also announced that the overflow field hospital that took over Washington’s convention center last year would be dismantled. “I’m grateful we never had to use it,” she said.\n\nFlorida\n\nNaples: The number of variant cases of the coronavirus is rising in Southwest Florida, heightening concern among some medical officials that there will be a summer spike. While the daily number of new COVID-19 cases is dropping, Florida still leads the nation in new infections as those caused by mutated strains of the coronavirus skyrocket, according to the latest reports from state health officials. The number of people in Florida infected with a variant strain of the virus increased 77% in the past three weeks, and the number of deaths nearly tripled to 73, state health officials report. Lee County has seen 204 variant cases; that’s up 26% from 162 cases since April 27, according to the latest state data through May 5. The county ranks 12th among the 67 counties in the state for its number of variant cases, the data shows. Collier County ranks 16th in the state with 153 variant cases, up 28% from 120 cases in late April. All but a handful of the Southwest Florida cases have been the B.1.1.7 strain out of the United Kingdom that is the dominant one among the six circulating in Florida. Of the 12,242 people in the state who have tested positive for one of the variants, 6,175 are in Palm Beach, Broward or Miami-Dade counties, the state’s three most populous counties.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: After announcing last week that he plans to require people receiving unemployment benefits to resume searching for work, the state’s labor commissioner now says he’s considering cutting federal benefits to the jobless in an effort to push them back into the workforce. Kersha Cartwright, a spokesperson for elected Republican Mark Butler, said Butler and Gov. Brian Kemp met Monday and discussed possibilities such as cutting the $300-a-week federal supplement to unemployed workers or cutting off special federal benefits to people not usually eligible for state unemployment. “I think the governor’s office and the commissioner are agreed that a major reduction in some programs, if not all programs, is needed,” Cartwright said. “Everything’s on the table for discussion.” Mallory Blount, a spokesperson for Kemp, said residents could “expect final decisions on timing and other specifics in the coming days.” Butler has the legal authority to reject the benefits but is consulting with Kemp. Butler could also decrease the amount of money someone can earn and still qualify for benefits. Butler set that amount at $300 a week when the pandemic began, meaning people who are working reduced hours can still qualify for the $300-a-week federal boost.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state’s vaccine passport program for interisland travel has begun. The program launch allows people who received their COVID-19 shots in Hawaii to skip coronavirus testing and quarantine rules for travel between the islands, Hawaii News Now reports. Officials have easy access to state vaccination records that can be quickly verified, so only those who have been fully vaccinated at clinics in the islands can participate. The governor said he hopes to open the program to out-of-state visitors and trans-Pacific travelers later this year. “We don’t have a firm timeline on trans-Pacific. The challenge is about verification – about vaccination done in other states,” Gov. David Ige said. “We’ve been working with a couple of other private-sector partners about working to get access to the state vaccination records, and we believe that that would help them to get vaccination records in other states as well.” People participating in the program must be more than two weeks out from their final COVID-19 vaccine shot. Health officials report about 40% of Hawaii’s population is fully vaccinated. Anyone flying into the state still has to produce a negative coronavirus test to bypass a 10-day quarantine rule.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state will receive $1.1 billion in the latest round of coronavirus relief money in two separate payments, the U.S. Treasury Department announced Monday, with state officials saying the money could be used to substantially bolster water, sewer and broadband infrastructure. The $350 billion program is part of President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package that became law in March. Administration officials say payments could begin going out in the coming days. In addition to the money coming to the state, Idaho’s nine largest cities will get a total of $124 million, while 190 cities with populations of typically less than 50,000 will get $108 million. Counties will get another $314 million. The distribution is based on population. Alex Adams, Republican Gov. Brad Little’s budget chief, said his initial take on the announcement and a 150-page document outlining how the money can be spent contained two surprises. First, Adams said, is that the plan allows the money to be allocated by December 2024, with the projects complete by the end of 2026. The second surprise is that Idaho is getting about $90 million less than expected, apparently the result of its economy improving, as a portion of the federal money distribution is based on Idaho’s unemployment rate.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The state, working with business and labor organizations, plans to offer COVID-19 vaccinations to workers at offices, officials announced Monday. The initiative is being prompted by the return to offices of thousands of workers forced home by the pandemic. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said Monday that having vaccines available where people are working makes getting a shot very convenient. The effort will launch in mid-May with the opening of 10 vaccination sites in Chicago, Schaumburg and Rockford. The clinics, staffed by Walgreen pharmacists, offer two-dose vaccinations and will also take walk-ins. State officials are encouraging Illinois building operators interested in hosting additional clinics to contact the Illinois Department of Public Health directly or to contact the Building Owners and Managers Association. “With enhanced air quality and ventilation, advanced cleanliness procedures, and reconfigurations, our buildings have been prepared to welcome tenants back to the office for over a year,” Building Owners and Managers Association executive director Farzin Parang said in a statement. While announcing the vaccination plans at a Chicago bank, Pritzker acknowledged Illinois has reached a vaccination plateau, as most people eager to be vaccinated have already received their shots.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The city will remain under a mask mandate and other COVID-19 restrictions as local officials endorsed those measures after the Legislature nullified such orders previously issued by county health officers. The new state law that took effect immediately Monday allows local COVID-19 restrictions tougher than those issued statewide only upon approval of elected county commissioners or city councils. The Democratic-controlled Indianapolis council voted 19-5 along party lines Monday night to keep the mask mandate and rules that restrict restaurants to 75% indoor capacity and bars to 50% capacity. Democratic council member Maggie Lewis said it was important for the council to support Marion County’s health officer as the expert on what precautions should be taken. Republican legislators overrode a veto by GOP Gov. Eric Holcomb to enact the new law, arguing that it provides a “check and balance” protecting the rights of business owners. Local elected officials must now endorse restrictions for other cities including South Bend, Elkhart and Bloomington that have been in place since Holcomb rescinded the statewide mask order in early April. County commissioners in northern Indiana’s Elkhart County have said they don’t intend to endorse the tougher rules ordered by the county health officer.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Gov. Kim Reynolds announced Tuesday that Iowa will join a bevy of Republican-led states ending pandemic-related federal programs that give extra cash to unemployed workers. The state will end the federal boosts, including an additional $300-a-week unemployment payment, Reynolds said in a news release. That benefit was scheduled to run through early September. Reynolds said in the announcement that the benefits are causing a labor shortage in the state and hindering its economy. “Now that our businesses and schools have reopened, these payments are discouraging people from returning to work,” the Republican governor said. “Our unemployment rate is at 3.7%, vaccines are available to anyone who wants one, and we have more jobs available than unemployed people.” But supporters of the federal unemployment programs point to other factors, including parents who don’t have child care and people reluctant to take jobs in service industries that require contact with the public for fear of contracting COVID-19. The federal benefits will end June 12, Reynolds said. Regular, pre-pandemic unemployment benefits will remain available.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: More than 2 million COVID-19 shots have been administered in the state, officials reported Monday, as the federal government detailed plans to distribute nearly $1 billion in aid to Kansas’ cities and counties. The state health department said 39.5% of residents had received at least one vaccine dose. Meanwhile, the U.S. Treasury Department spelled out for the first time how it would distribute a majority of the aid from a federal coronavirus relief measure that became law in March. The state will receive $1.6 billion from the allocation. Its 105 counties will receive a total of $566 million, distributed $194 per resident. Another $427 million go to cities, with 10 major cities sharing $260 million. Meanwhile, Kansas State University is altering its mask policy for outdoor settings, citing recent guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that Americans don’t need to cover their faces anymore when they’re outdoors unless they are in a big crowd. WIBW-TV reports that starting May 17, people who are fully vaccinated can participate in outdoor campus activities and recreation without a mask, except in crowded settings and venues. The university in Manhattan said masks still will be required in all indoor spaces on university property.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Starting May 28, bars and restaurants will no longer need to abide by a curfew, and bar seating will be allowed, Gov. Andy Beshear announced Monday. Bars and restaurants have had several curfews during the pandemic to help keep crowds down and COVID-19 at bay. In August, Beshear set a 10 p.m. last call curfew and closing time of 11 p.m. On Sept. 15, that curfew was moved to 11 p.m. with a closing time of midnight. In March, he announced a last call curfew of midnight and a closing time of 1 a.m. “I want everybody to remember that we have been and we’re going to be loosening these restrictions,” the Democratic governor said. “But be reasonable. ... Just because you can doesn’t mean you should. Look at your own facilities, look at the ability for air to move in and out, look at what your vaccination rates are in your county and what your incident rates are, and try to make good decisions. I know everybody wants to protect their clientele, those that they serve.” Also on May 28, maximum capacity for events with 1,000 or fewer people is increasing to 75%, and the limit is rising to 60% for more than 1,000.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Consumers could get wine shipped directly from manufacturers under a bill that narrowly won passage Monday in the state House. Current law prohibits wine manufacturers from shipping wine directly to a consumer unless the purchase is made in person at the winery, or unless the manufacturer doesn’t have a wholesale agreement to sell in the state through stores and other sites. Rep. Joseph Orgeron, R-Larose, said 44 other states allow similar direct shipments of wine without such conditions. He said his proposal would increase consumer access. Opponents suggest the change could damage wholesalers and the retailers that sell wine. Lawmakers sent the proposal to the Senate with a 53-40 vote – exactly the minimum it needed to pass. The vote was unanimous for a second alcohol measure that would let restaurants sell prepackaged, pre-measured, “ready-to-drink” alcoholic beverages for delivery. Rep. John Illg, R-River Ridge, said the measure would help the state’s ailing restaurant industry as it struggles to recover amid the pandemic. A 95-0 vote sent that bill to the Senate for debate.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A Republican lawmaker has been barred from inviting guests into the Maine State House after violating rules by hosting an out-of-state activist who spread conspiracy theories about the coronavirus. Rep. Shelley Rudnicki, of Fairfield, was disciplined by legislative leaders after bringing Naomi Wolf and a camera operator into the State House on April 28 while lawmakers were convened at the Augusta Civic Center, the Bangor Daily News reports. They approached Gov. Janet Mills’ office suite and were told to leave by the governor’s chief of staff. Wolf has been touring the country to advocate for the end of pandemic restrictions. She has questioned the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines and suggested they could be used to implant microchips in people. The Legislative Council voted 6-4 to revoke Rudnicki’s guest privileges, and a letter from House Speaker Ryan Fecteau, a Democrat, said she “explicitly disregarded” the policy put in place during the pandemic. The policy, adopted in February, permits lawmakers to bring two constituents into the State House to meet in their offices as long as they check with staff to ensure space is free. Rudnicki said she has been trying to meet with Mills through other channels. She disagreed that Wolf should not be allowed in the building because she does not live in her district.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Businessman Mike Rosenbaum announced Tuesday that he’s seeking the Democratic nomination for governor. Rosenbaum, 49, is the founder of the companies Catalyte and Arena. He has focused on building systems using data to project how well people will perform in a specific position or company. He said Maryland needs a governor to build a more inclusive post-COVID-19 economy. Rosenbaum served in the U.S. State Department, where he worked on trade issues. He also served in the White House under former President Bill Clinton as an economist focusing on tech, labor, urban and rural policy for the Council of Economic Advisers.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The Red Sox, Celtics and Bruins can now welcome more fans as the state continues to ease restrictions aimed at thwarting the spread of the coronavirus. Indoor and outdoor stadiums, arenas and ballparks, which had been limited to 12% capacity, are allowed to increase capacity to 25%. Amusement parks, theme parks and outdoor water parks are also allowed to welcome more visitors, up to 50% capacity, as long as they have a safety plan approved by the state Department of Public Health. Road races and other outdoor organized amateur or professional sporting events can also resume. Supermarkets and other retailers are no longer required to maintain special hours for seniors, and singing is allowed indoors with strict distancing requirements in place. Restrictions are being relaxed as more people get vaccinated against COVID-19. As of Sunday, more than 2.9 million people in Massachusetts had been fully vaccinated, according to the health department. More than 3.8 million residents have received at least first doses. To make getting a shot easier, the state will allow walk-up vaccinations at six mass vaccination sites.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state on Monday surpassed a 55% COVID-19 vaccination rate, reaching a milestone that will lead to the automatic easing of in-person work restrictions in two weeks. Employers currently must prohibit on-site work if employees’ jobs can feasibly be done remotely. The state anticipates lifting the rule May 24, said COVID-19 workplace safety director Sean Egan. The 55% benchmark is the first of four under a plan outlined by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer less than two weeks ago. “If you’ve gotten your safe, effective vaccine, thank you. And if you haven’t yet, I encourage you to speak to your doctor or your friends or family who’ve been vaccinated to learn about their experiences,” the Democrat said in a video. At a 60% vaccination rate, capacity at sports stadiums, banquet halls, conference centers and funeral homes will rise to 25% after two weeks – and 50% at gyms. Restaurants and bars will no longer have an 11 p.m. curfew. All indoor capacity limits will be lifted after 65% of eligible people have one shot, though social distancing will remain. At 70%, the state will rescind its mask and gatherings order and stop imposing broad mitigation measures barring unanticipated circumstances, such as vaccine-resistant coronavirus variants. The state could delay eased restrictions in regions with high case rates.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Suburban police are investigating the theft of COVID-19 vaccines after a man recorded and posted videos on social media of him walking away with vials of what he called “poison” and said he had plans to have the vaccines tested at a lab. Allina Health told police the man, who has been identified by law enforcement as Thomas Humphrey, took a vial of the Pfizer vaccine from a clinic in Oakdale on May 4 and left before officers arrived. The 32-year-old St. Paul man recorded the alleged theft, as well as one the next day at a CVS pharmacy, the location of which is not known, the St. Paul Pioneer Press reports. The videos were on Humphrey’s Facebook page early Monday, before they were either deleted or removed from public view. The videos generated hundreds of comments on Humphrey’s page. One of the videos shows him sitting down with a nurse at the Allina clinic, then grabbing the Pfizer vaccine before he stands up and yells at others not to get the vaccine because it would kill them. In the CVS pharmacy video, Humphrey takes a vial of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine from a box that a worker handed him, then walks out of the store, despite pleas from workers not to leave.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: State legislators are not in session now, so it could be months before they start deciding how to spend $1.8 billion in the latest round of pandemic relief from the federal government. Mississippi will receive part of the money this year and the rest next year. “I think it’s going to take some time to fully inspect and understand what’s included,” Mississippi Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Briggs Hopson said Monday. The U.S. Treasury Department said state and local governments may use the money for public health, including efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. They may use it to address economic problems that the pandemic has caused for workers, households, small businesses, industries and government. They also may use some of the money to replace tax revenue that was lost because of the pandemic and to provide extra pay for essential workers. Other acceptable uses are for improvements to water and sewer systems and expansion of broadband access, the Treasury Department said. States are not allowed to use the money to cut taxes, shore up pension funds or rainy day funds, make payments on long-term debt or pay off legal settlements. Mississippi legislators’ next regular session begins in January. Republican Gov. Tate Reeves could call them into special session, if he wants.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: Republican Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt on Tuesday filed a lawsuit challenging St. Louis County’s COVID-19 restrictions, citing concerns about their impact on religion, education and the freedom of residents. The lawsuit filed in St. Louis County Circuit Court names Democratic County Executive Sam Page, the county’s health department and its director, Dr. Faisal Khan. It seeks an injunction to end the restrictions. “From requiring a mask outdoors to subjecting citizens to government pre-approval for private events, enough is enough,” Schmitt said in a news release. “The seemingly unending control over people’s lives must end. Vaccines are widely available to all adults – it’s past time for St. Louis County to lift these restrictions, and that’s why I filed suit today.” Page’s spokesman, Doug Moore, said litigation related to public health orders is common across the country, “and St. Louis County has been successful in defending every legal challenge around public health orders. Our legal foundation is sound.” The lawsuit is the latest of several filed by Schmitt, who announced in March that he will seek the GOP nomination for U.S. Senate in 2022. His announcement came weeks after incumbent Republican Sen. Roy Blunt announced he would not seek reelection.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: The state on Tuesday reported 167 new coronavirus cases, bringing the total number of active cases to 1,028. There have been 1,593 deaths from COVID-19 and 107,486 recoveries. Hospitals across Montana have 69 COVID-19 patients out of 5,122 total hospitalizations for the disease since the pandemic began. The state administered 2,764 new coronavirus tests since Monday. Cascade County on Tuesday reported 36 new cases. The county has administered 50,691 total doses of COVID-19 vaccine, and 24,276 residents have been fully immunized. Great Falls Public Schools as of Monday had 17 active COVID-19 cases. The state has administered 750,025 doses of COVID-19 vaccine, and 352,991 Montanans have been fully immunized. Gallatin County reported 37 new cases, Yellowstone County reported 29, Lewis and Clark added 11, and Flathead County added six.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The pace of vaccinations in the state has slowed significantly over the past month. The state said 49,016 COVID-19 vaccine doses were administered in Nebraska last week. That continues the steady decline seen in recent weeks, when roughly 70,000 and 93,000 doses were administered. The latest weekly total of vaccine doses is less than one-quarter of the mid-April peak of 211,057 doses in a single week. Health officials said 49.9% of the state’s population over the age of 16 has now been vaccinated, and 1.55 million doses have been administered statewide since December. But demand for the shots has weakened across the state. The state reported 411 new coronavirus cases and one death Tuesday to give Nebraska a total of 221,911 cases and 2,247 deaths since the pandemic began. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Nebraska decreased over the past two weeks, going from 317.00 new cases per day April 25 to 182.14 new cases per day Sunday.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The casino long known as the Stratosphere announced Monday that it has lifted most coronavirus pandemic restrictions and moved to 100% capacity on its casino floor after meeting Nevada Gaming Control Board requirements. STRAT Hotel, Casino & SkyPod owner Golden Entertainment Inc. said it provided COVID-19 vaccinations at on-site casino clinics for employees and their families. Property Vice President and General Manager Stephen Thayer said masks still will be required for workers and guests at the iconic tallest tower on Las Vegas Boulevard. Golden Entertainment bought the 2,427-room STRAT in late 2017 and has been renovating the 25-year-old property. The tower is 1,149 feet high and features sightseeing, a restaurant with a 360-degree rotating dining room and several thrill rides. The Wynn Las Vegas, Encore and Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas got approval last week from regulators to lift capacity and physical distancing limits and remove clear plastic separators from gambling tables. They showed the Gaming Control Board that at least 80% of their employees had received at least one shot of a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A recent COVID-19 outbreak at the Sullivan County nursing home has led some officials to consider compensation changes for staff and mandatory vaccinations for employees. The outbreak, which started last month, has affected staff and residents at the home in Unity, including some who were fully vaccinated. Last year, the county instituted a compensation program for employees in quarantine, paying them two-thirds of wages for a missed day of work. The Eagle Times reports that under a new proposal, only vaccinated employees will still be eligible for this compensation, said Derek Ferland, county manager. Unvaccinated employees who contract the coronavirus will have to use their sick or vacation days to continue getting paid. “It’s not that we’re trying to be mean about it,” Ferland said. “(But) as long as there are hosts, the virus continues to do its thing. And the number of hosts is directly proportional to the number of people who are not vaccinated.” Currently, 92% of the county home’s residents and 75% of staff are fully vaccinated.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state’s daily rate of COVID-19 vaccinations has plummeted so much in recent weeks that it’s casting doubt on whether Gov. Phil Murphy will meet his goal to fully vaccinate 4.7 million adults by the end of June, and he says bribing residents to get a shot isn’t out of the question. New Jersey needs to administer 280,000 first doses each week in May to reach its goal, which is key to ushering in a return to normalcy this summer, said Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli. But in the first seven days of May, only 121,000 first doses of Pfizer and Moderna were administered, according to a review of state data. That represents a 64% decline from the first week of April, when 340,000 first doses were administered. “We’re going to have to scrap to get there, almost certainly,” Murphy said of his goal at a briefing Monday. NJ Transit unveiled a plan last week to offer two free round-trip rides to vaccination sites. More than 30 breweries are offering a free beer to those who get their shots in May. And in what may be the most lucrative incentive, Rowan University in South Jersey took the unprecedented step last week of giving vaccinated students $1,000 off their fall tuition and housing bills. “Are we willing to bribe people to get vaccinated? Everything is on the table,” Murphy said Monday.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Transportation officials say roadside litter has become a persistent issue for the state, compounded by new types of debris amid the pandemic, so they’re reviving the “Toss No Mas” campaign with a new twist. State Transportation Secretary Mike Sandoval said Monday that his agency has nearly 900 boots on the ground picking up trash and debris year-round. The day after a stretch of road is cleaned, he said, new trash shows up. “During the pandemic, the problem seemed to get worse. PPE was found everywhere,” he said, referring to personal protective equipment used to curb the spread of the coronavirus. “We are asking for everyone’s help.” The campaign will include the messages “Can the Trash” and “Tie it. Tarp it. Pick it up.” Officials said they found that the largest litter accumulations come from people not tying up their garbage bags, tarping their loads, or picking up dropped debris or litter. The “Toss No Mas” campaign was created in the ’90’s by Cooney-Watson Productions. Santa Fe songwriter Jim Terr wrote a memorable song with an anti-litter public service message. Taos musician Michael Hearne was then brought on to sing a soulful version of the song, and it became a well-known anthem across New Mexico. The modernization of the campaign includes a new jingle for the radio.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: As the pace of vaccinations has slowed, officials are trying a mix of mandates and incentives to overcome hesitancy, including free subway rides. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the state can’t mandate COVID-19 vaccines until they get full approval from the federal government. If that happens, New York will require students of the state’s and New York City’s public university and college systems to get vaccinated to attend in-person classes this fall, Cuomo said in a Monday press conference in New York City. “If you must have a vaccine, get it now,” Cuomo said. “If you have to get it anyway.” And anyone who gets vaccinated at one of six New York City subway stations from Wednesday through Sunday will receive a free seven-day MetroCard, New York City Transit Interim President Sarah Feinberg said. Feinberg said subway ridership reached a recent high of 2.23 million riders Friday. The Long Island Railroad and Metro-North are also offering vaccination sites at two stations in Ossining and Hempstead. Those who get inoculated can receive two free one-way trips. Cuomo and transit officials said they hope pop-up sites will increase vaccination rates and ease riders’ minds as New York City’s subways prepare to resume 24/7, around-the-clock operations next Monday.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: State House members on Monday approved a plan to curb the governor’s ability to mandate COVID-19 vaccines through executive action – a power Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper has shown no desire to exercise. The measure put forward by Rep. Keith Kidwell, R-Beaufort, would also bar state public health authorities and licensing agencies from requiring North Carolinians to get vaccinated in order to obtain a license. It’s perhaps the most mild of a string of anti-vaccination proposals brought forward by Republican state lawmakers. The measure passed 75-38 with support from 10 Democrats and all GOP members present and now heads to the Senate. Cooper has strongly encouraged residents to get vaccinated but has been reluctant to mandate it or turn it into a hot-button political issue. He and his health secretary, Dr. Mandy Cohen, have instead promoted a message of a quicker return to summer activities once more people get vaccinated. They have also vowed to ease pandemic restrictions, such as the indoor mask mandate, once two-thirds of adults in the state have gotten at least one COVID-19 dose. Still, some GOP lawmakers say they wish Kidwell’s proposal would have gone further, preventing schools and child care facilities from requiring the vaccines.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum announced Monday that the state will terminate its participation in the federal government’s pandemic-related unemployment assistance programs, effective June 19. Burgum said in a statement that ending the $300 weekly federal supplemental benefit is meant “to help address the ongoing workforce shortage across the state.” North Dakota had 16,396 online job openings in April, which was nearly 50% more than the same period in 2020 and represents the state’s largest number of online job openings since July 2015, according to Job Service North Dakota. Burgum said more than 8,300 people are claiming unemployment benefits under the programs North Dakota is terminating June 19. He said the programs have paid out more than $700 million in unemployment benefits, though 29% of federal program claimants live out of state. “Federal funds provided a safety net to our unemployed workers during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, and now that open jobs are surpassing pre-pandemic levels, we believe that reemployment is the best recovery plan for North Dakota‘s economic health,” said Bryan Klipfel, executive director of Job Service North Dakota.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state will receive nearly $5.4 billion in aid as part of Democratic President Joe Biden’s larger $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, with another nearly $6.6 billion going directly to counties, cities and townships, the U.S. Treasury Department said Monday. Thirty-seven cities and townships and all 88 counties will receive the payments. State and local governments can use the money for relief from the public health crisis. The funding also can be used to offset harm to workers, small businesses and affected industries; to invest in water, sewer and broadband systems; and to replace lost public-sector revenue, according to guidance from the Treasury Department. Essential workers also can qualify for premium pay under the program. What officials can’t do with the money is use it to cut taxes, pay down debt or bolster the state rainy day fund. Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost, a Republican, called Treasury’s directives on the money akin to “fantasy fiction.” GOP Gov. Mike DeWine has recommended to the Legislature using a portion of its the relief dollars to pay off the unemployment compensation insurance loan the state owes to the federal government. Under Treasury guidelines, states can use the money to replenish their unemployment insurance trust funds up to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: State health officials are preparing to offer COVID-19 shots to adolescents, now that children ages 12 through 15 can qualify for the Pfizer vaccine. The Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of the vaccine for use in that age group Monday afternoon. Before shots begin, a federal vaccine advisory committee will meet to discuss whether to endorse the move, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will decide whether to adopt the committee’s recommendation, according to the Associated Press. Once approval is official, the Oklahoma State Health Department plans to be able to start giving vaccinations to children in that age group immediately, said Keith Reed, deputy commissioner of health. The state will turn on registration access for the younger age group through the state vaccine scheduling portal once the federal vaccine advisory committee makes its recommendation to the CDC, Reed said. Some individual providers, like Clyde Pharmacy in Oklahoma City, are already scheduling appointments for teens in anticipation of the vaccine being approved for the younger age group. The Oklahoma City-County Health Department plans to work with Oklahoma City Public Schools to survey families about how and whether they plan to vaccinate their children.\n\nOregon\n\nEugene: The University of Oregon and Western Oregon University say students will be required to get COVID-19 vaccines by this fall, joining other colleges in the Northwest that have made the same announcement. “The requirement will help us to reach the highest level of protection possible, reduce infections and protect the health and safety of our university community and the communities we serve. Individuals will be able to request exemptions for medical and non-medical reasons,” the University of Oregon said in a tweet Monday. The state’s flagship public university, located in Eugene, has about 18,000 undergraduate students. Meanwhile, WOU officials announced during a virtual session Monday that vaccinations will be required for students and employees who either study or work in person at the university’s Monmouth or Salem campuses for the fall term. Oregon State University is among the other institutions of higher education that will require COVID-19 vaccinations this fall.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: As the Philadelphia Flyers put shots on goal Monday night, they were also pushing shots into arms. The Flyers and Penn Medicine teamed up to offer COVID-19 vaccines to fans attending Monday’s regular season finale against the New Jersey Devils at Wells Fargo Center. Anyone getting the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine also received a voucher for two free tickets to a Flyers game next season. Meanwhile, about 750,000 Pennsylvania children are expected to become eligible for Pfizer’s COVID-19 shot after U.S. regulators expanded the use of the two-dose vaccine to 12- to 15-year-olds, state health officials said Tuesday. Health providers in Pennsylvania could begin vaccinating people in that age group later this week after a federal vaccine advisory committee signs off as expected. The state Health Department said vaccine providers should follow their existing policies for vaccinating minors, which requires parental consent in Pennsylvania. The administration of Gov. Tom Wolf has said it will lift a statewide mask mandate once at least 70% of adult residents are fully vaccinated. Statewide, about 45.6% of people age 18 and older had been fully vaccinated as of Tuesday, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state expects to start offering Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine to children ages 12 to 15 later this week now that the Food and Drug Administration has authorized its use for that age group, state officials said Tuesday. The announcement came during a news conference at Rhode Island Hospital to celebrate the fact that more than 1 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in the state. The state’s first vaccine against the disease caused by the coronavirus was given at the hospital in mid-December. “I don’t think anyone would have ever thought on Dec. 14 that we would have 1 million shots in the arms on May 11,” Gov. Daniel McKee said. Eligible children, with parental consent, were expected to be able to sign up for a shot at the state’s current vaccination sites later Tuesday, and there are also plans to bring vaccination clinics to schools, officials said. “We are so excited that we can expand to this younger age,” said Dr. Nicole Alexander-Scott, director of the state Department of Health. “Because children could not get vaccinated and because we are seeing these more contagious variants of COVID-19, we have seen an increase in our proportion of cases in children. So the timing right now is perfect.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state and local governments are getting nearly $2.5 billion in new federal coronavirus aid, as South Carolina begins to phase out a different federal jobless benefit the governor says is disincentivizing people to return to the workplace. The funds announced this week are part of a $350 billion allocation being distributed to state and local governments, a piece of President Joe Biden’s larger $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package that became law in March. All of South Carolina’s 46 counties and some cities will get the money, which could soon begin arriving in state and local hands, according to the White House. Treasury Department guidance listed broad categories for spending the funds, like public health costs, or offsetting harm from the downturn to workers, small businesses and affected industries. Money can also replace lost public sector revenues and be invested in water, sewer and broadband internet. The distribution comes as South Carolina phases out its participation in another federal coronavirus aid component. Last week, Gov. Henry McMaster announced that, beginning June 30, the state will opt out of the federal unemployment programs that have been providing extra money to jobless residents, in light of “unprecedented” workforce shortages across the state.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The average number of new coronavirus infections in the state fell to its lowest level since July, with 125 new cases reported Tuesday. Those cases were recorded over the weekend and brought the seven-day average to 66 cases per day, the lowest number since July 25. No new deaths were reported, leaving the statewide total of people who have died with COVID-19 at 1,981. Minnehaha County residents accounted for 26 new infections. Lincoln County had 13 positive cases. Brown County reported 10 new infections and Codington County four. Active infections decreased to 1,100 as the state reported an additional 236 people recovered from COVID-19. The number of people in state hospital beds with COVID-19 fell to 66. Of those, 21 were receiving intensive care, and 15 were on ventilators. Out of the 123,435 people in the state who have tested positive for the virus, about 6% have received hospital care. A total of 335,301 people in the state have received at least one COVID-19 vaccine through the South Dakota Department of Health’s immunization program and the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program. That number does not include immunizations through Indian Health Service or Veterans Affairs.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state is withdrawing from a $300 weekly unemployment supplement program, a decision by Gov. Bill Lee that comes as many Republicans argue the additional funds allow low-wage workers to make more money while staying at home. Lee informed the U.S. Department of Labor of the decision Tuesday, joining several other Southern states in refusing the additional payments for unemployed people. “We will no longer participate in federal pandemic unemployment programs because Tennesseans have access to more than 250,000 jobs in our state,” Lee said in a statement about the decision. The federal unemployment assistance programs will end July 3, Lee wrote to Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh. Tennessee pays up to $275 weekly for unemployed individuals, ranking it among the lowest in the country and significantly below the national average of $387. Combined with the current $300 federal supplement – a drop from a $600 a week offered last year – Tennesseans receiving unemployment benefits are now receiving about $575 weekly, the equivalent of $14.38 per hour for a 40-hour week. The federal minimum wage, which hasn’t been raised in more than a decade, is $7.25 per hour, though many argue a living wage would be in the $15-$20 range.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state House gave final approval Tuesday to a bill that would curb the governor’s powers during a pandemic, a response to criticism from both Republicans and Democrats over Gov. Greg Abbott’s use of disaster powers during the coronavirus pandemic. The Pandemic Response Act, approved 104-39, would create an oversight committee with powers to strike down any order, waiver or suspension. It now heads to the Senate. “We must now take what we have learned this past year in dealing with a pandemic and set a different framework in dealing with future pandemics,” Rep. Dustin Burrows, R-Lubbock, an author of the bill, told members as he introduced the legislation Monday evening. “As a baseline in a pandemic, you will not government your way out of it. Government does not have the solutions and doesn’t have the expertise to find all the solutions to fix all the problems.” Under the bill, the governor would still have the ability to suspend state laws and trump decisions by local officials, which kept some Democrats from voting in favor of the bill. Abbott has received criticism from Democrats and local officials throughout the pandemic for not giving mayors and county judges more authority to issue their own orders, including the ability to mandate masks and reduce occupancy rates at businesses.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Head Start, a free, federally funded program that promotes early childhood development and education for low-income families, is expanding its presence to the St. George area thanks to a local family. SUU Head Start is affiliated with Southern Utah University and helps low-income families prepare their children for kindergarten. Even those who don’t meet the low-income bracket can use the program for free. SUU Head Start offers preschool services in Beaver, Iron, Millard and Washington counties, with a history in Cedar City that goes back about 30 years and about 15 years in St. George. But Head Start had to leave its old River Road location and hasn’t been back in St. George for a few years, said Tina Baker, the local Head Start Enrollment and Recruitment specialist. As a federally funded program, Head Start can’t own its buildings, so it relies on others in the community to help. So members of the local Staheli family volunteered to build Head Start its own place at a new site located in Washington City at the Staheli Cottontown Village. The pandemic posed an issue for some of the families who use the program in Cedar City. “We had to go virtual, but it’s so important to have that connection,” Baker said.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: With new precautions in place and after a sharply curtailed 2020 season, sailors and paddlers of all ages and skill levels can once again converge at the Community Sailing Center. A phased reopening has been announced, in accordance with pandemic precautions. For another few days, the action is only open to high school racing teams, the nonprofit reported. Sailing camps and “floating classrooms” begin this week; the introductory “First Sails” program casts off in mid-June. Adult group activities and courses will gradually be reintroduced over the summer, catching a full wind by July 12. Schedules and programming follow or exceed current state health guidelines and are subject to changes, the center said. Among the new rules: Pickups and drop-offs will be staggered. Everyone must wear a mask at all times through June 18. And all adults must wear masks through July 11. In addition to its new schedule, the center announced this year its first-ever Sailing Diversity Access scholarships for 10 campers whose racial or ethnic background has historically excluded them from the sport.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Taxpayers have just days left to file their individual income taxes with the state. The filing and payment deadline for submitting tax returns is Monday, May 17. The typical May 1 deadline was extended this year to match the new Internal Revenue Service deadline for federal tax filings. Tax Commissioner Craig Burns said in a news release that the state is encouraging taxpayers to file electronically and request refunds via direct deposit. It typically takes up to four weeks to process an electronically filed return and up to eight weeks to process a paper return. State officials said that this year, due to COVID-19 protocols, it will likely take even longer for a paper return to move through the system. For those who miss the filing deadline, Virginia has an automatic, six-month filing extension. No application is required. Taxpayers still need to pay any taxes owed on time to avoid additional penalties and interest.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The Seattle-Tacoma International Airport is piloting a new virtual queuing program and touchless check-in kiosk system in order to streamline the travel experience, improve physical distancing and reduce congestion at peak travel times. The new SEA Spot Saver program will allow travelers to make digital reservations for Transportation Security Administration general screening security checkpoints either at their terminal or 24 hours ahead of the flight online. Once in the virtual queue, passengers can drop off bags, grab a coffee or say goodbye to loved ones while awaiting a notification that it’s their turn for screening, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reports. The new service, free for all passengers, will only be available at at checkpoints 2 and 5 from 4 a.m. to noon daily. At checkpoint 2, passengers will scan a QR code with their phone and follow text message prompts that will give them their estimated wait time. At checkpoint 5, Alaska Airlines passengers can either sign up ahead of time online or on site for a screening appointment. The program can serve up to 50% of passengers going through general security screening, airport officials said. Sea-Tac is one of the first in the country to test the new queuing technology. The pilot program will run through Aug. 31.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Marshall University is holding its Jazz Camp through virtual sessions again this year, for students ages 13 and up. Jazz-MU-Tazz camp is usually a six-day camp for high school musicians, but due to the coronavirus pandemic and safety guidelines, the university said the sessions will be offered virtually at 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. daily. The sessions will be livestreamed through the Marshall University Jazz Facebook page. The event will be held June 14-18. The university’s jazz studies program hosts the camp. Topics to be covered include jazz improvisation, jazz theory, listening skills and instrument/section master classes by members of the Marshall jazz faculty. Registration is $75. Students can register online.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state will receive $700 million less than initially expected in federal coronavirus relief money, and it will arrive in two payments a year apart – news that Gov. Tony Evers and U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin said Tuesday was problematic. The state was informed Monday of the split in payments and the total it would receive. Evers and Baldwin asked U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Tuesday to reconsider breaking the funding into two. “This will significantly reduce the funding that will be available for Wisconsin’s current pandemic response operations and to continue to meet immediate needs and restore economic well-being,” Baldwin and Evers wrote. The Democratic governor has emphasized wanting to spend the money quickly to help those most hurt by the pandemic. He has cited that desire for speed in vetoing GOP-authored bills that dictated how the money would be spent. The governor has sole authority in deciding how to spend the money. Republicans who control the Legislature have called on Evers to meet with them to discuss how the money should be spent. Rep. Mark Born, co-chairman of the Legislature’s budget committee, renewed that call Tuesday.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Officials in the Natrona County School District have asked the state health department to exempt it from a requirement that masks be worn in K-12 schools, the Casper Star-Tribune reports.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/05/12"}]}

And does that mean ...", "text": "People who follow and forecast gas prices haven’t seen a truly “normal” year in a while. Next year could be that year.\n\nPump prices fell dramatically in pandemic-plagued 2020, recovered in 2021 and spiked dramatically amid the Ukraine invasion and runaway inflation of 2022.\n\nBy comparison, 2023 has unfolded somewhat more predictably at the pump, despite lingering inflation and war in the Middle East.\n\nExperts hope for even more stability in 2024, with fuel prices starting lower and staying lower than in 2023.\n\n“We’re getting back to sort of normalcy when it comes to pump prices,” said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, a gas-price tracking service.\n\nProtect your assets: Best high-yield savings accounts of 2023\n\nGas prices at American pumps tend to follow a seasonal cycle\n\nIn a normal year, gas prices follow a seasonal cycle, bottoming out in the depth of winter, when people drive less, and rising steadily through spring and summer, when temperatures are warmer, days are longer, and Americans drive more.\n\nThat is more or less what happened in 2023. Gas prices started the year around $3.20 a gallon, federal data show, surged past $3.75 a gallon from late July through September, then retreated to the $3 range in December, yielding the cheapest fuel of the year.\n\n“I like to tell people that there’s an American energy calendar that people can follow,” said Devin Gladden, spokesperson for AAA.\n\nPump prices should remain low through December and may even fall further in January, forecasters say. The start of each year generally brings a low ebb of car and truck travel. And gas is cheaper to refine in winter because refiners use a less costly formula in cold weather.\n\n“You’re going to hear a lot of chatter at holiday cocktail parties about, ‘Oh, isn’t gas cheaper,’” said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service.\n\nIf gas prices follow the normal seasonal cycle in 2024, pump prices will follow a gently sloping arc from January through December. That is essentially what happened in 2023. Some forecasters expect a similar pattern in 2024 but with slightly lower prices.\n\n“I think it’ll be more of a normal year,” Kloza said. “Let’s hope so. I think demand in the United States for gasoline will be about what it was this year, maybe a little lower. There’s plenty of supply.”\n\nIf you plot next year's gas prices on a graph, 'the 2024 line will be below the 2023 line'\n\nIf you plot pump prices on a graph, as someone at AAA is bound to do, “the 2024 line will be below the 2023 line,” Gladden said.\n\nBut that forecast comes with caveats.\n\nThe biggest one, perhaps, is the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas.\n\nGas prices actually fell in the weeks following the start of the Israel-Hamas War in October. Israel and Palestine are not major oil producers, even though they sit in an oil-rich region.\n\nThings might change, fuel experts say, if the conflict were to widen, drawing in countries with larger oil footprints, such as Iran.\n\n“In some ways, the big cliffhanger will be around geopolitical tensions,” Gladden said.\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 sent gas prices soaring. Average prices rose by more than a dollar per gallon in the months that followed, reaching a record-high $5 in June.\n\nThat war isn’t over. Yet, De Haan and other forecasters don’t see it posing much of a threat to pump prices in 2024.\n\n“Time is a major healer,” De Haan said. “And the more time we put on Russia’s war on Ukraine, even though it’s continuing, the risk of further situational changes has been reduced. . . . We now have seen this war being waged for almost two years. The flow of oil has continued.”\n\nA colder winter could mean lower gas prices in January\n\nWeather ranks as another pump-price imponderable.\n\nIs a soft landing in sight?What the Fed funds rate and mortgage rates are hinting at\n\nA milder winter should keep gas prices “about where they are,” Gladden said. Motorists will drive more, counterbalancing a decline in demand for heating fuel.\n\n“If the weather gets worse,” by contrast, “we could see a lower price at the beginning of the year than we saw as the lowest price of this year.”\n\nThe lowest recorded fuel price for this year “ends up becoming the floor for next year,” Gladden said.\n\nThe lowest price of this year may be yet to come. The average pump price dipped to $3.10 on Dec. 14.\n\n“It’s quite normal to see the lowest prices of the year between Dec. 15 and Feb. 15, and we’re on that trajectory this year,” Kloza said. “We’re entering kind of a six- to eight-week period when we produce more gasoline than we use.”\n\nKloza predicts that the average price for gas in 2023 will be “about $3.52 a gallon” by the time the ball drops in Times Square. He and other experts predict that average gas prices in 2024 will be slightly lower.\n\nNext year “should be a little bit more friendly at the pump,” De Haan said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2023/12/20/2024-snap-benefits-increase/71975285007/", "title": "SNAP benefits increase 12.5% for 2024: What to know about food ...", "text": "The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, provides food benefits to eligible low-income families.

But they want to see a longer string of data that shows inflation is continuing to ease and won't stabilize at the current level.\n\n\"It's a highly consequential decision to start the process of dialing back (economic) restraint,\" Powell said. \"We want to get that right.\"\n\nKathy Bostjancic, chief economist of Nationwide, expects the first rate decrease in May.\n\n\"Inflation will be the key reason for them to reduce the fed funds target range, but we also expect slower employment and a mild recession unfolding mid-year,\" Bostjancic, who is among a minority of economists still forecasting a downturn in 2024.\n\nThe Fed on Wednesday broadly upgraded its economic outlook after a strong fourth quarter, noting that activity “has been expanding at a solid pace.”\n\nWhat is the key interest rate?\n\nWednesday’s decision leaves the Fed’s benchmark short-term rate at a 23-year high of 5.25% to 5.5% following a flurry of aggressive hikes aimed at taming the nation’s sharpest inflation spike in four decades. The central bank has left the federal funds rate unchanged since July as consumer price increases have slowed more dramatically.\n\nBy standing pat for a fourth straight meeting Wednesday, the Fed provides another reprieve to consumers who still face higher borrowing costs for credit cards, adjustable-rate mortgages and other loans since officials launched their inflation fight in early 2022. Yet many Americans, especially seniors, are being helped by healthy bank savings yields after years of meager returns.\n\nAre rate cuts coming?\n\nThere’s little doubt that a slide in rates is on the way. In December, the Fed forecast three quarter-point cuts this year, more than anticipated, further stoking an S&P 500 stock index that was already vaulting toward a new record on the pullback of inflation and the prospect of lower rates. Futures markets now foresee as many as six rate cuts.\n\nBut exactly when the Fed will begin to reverse the historic run-up in borrowing costs and how swiftly it will do so is a thornier question.\n\nPolicymakers have been wrestling with how to respond to the unusual tandem of tumbling inflation and a solidly growing economy. Normally, easing price increases are triggered by substantially slowing consumer demand and economic growth.\n\nThis time is different. Pandemic-related product and labor shortages sparked the inflation spike and their resolution has allowed price gains to stabilize, economists say.\n\nWhat is the inflation rate right now?\n\nIn December, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure – the personal consumption expenditures index – rose 2.6% annually, down from a high of 7% in summer 2022. A core measure that excludes volatile food and energy items and that the Fed watches more closely dipped to 2.9%, the lowest since March 2021 but still above officials’ 2% goal.\n\nAnd yearly wage growth, which feeds into inflation, fell to 4.3% in the last three months of 2023 from 4.5% the prior quarter, according to a key gauge of pay increases released Wednesday.\n\nIs the US economy strong right now?\n\nMeanwhile, though, the economy grew at a sturdy 3.3% annual rate in the fourth quarter and a healthy 2.5% for all of 2023. Americans have opened their wallets, shrugging off still elevated prices and borrowing costs, largely as a result of hefty pay increases. And while employment growth has been gradually slowing, the economy added a robust 216,000 jobs in December.\n\nMany forecasters believe growth will slow to just under 2% this year as households feel the strains of high interest rates, record credit card debt and dwindling pandemic-related savings. That would still be a respectable showing, but some experts continue to predict a mild recession.\n\nA few months ago, Powell said officials were concerned that a persistently strong economy and job market could lead the Fed to raise rates or keep them high on the risk they could push inflation higher even if price gains were currently moderating. But Powell said officials now believe that in the post-pandemic environment, a strong economy and falling inflation can co-exist. A healing supply chain and a recovering labor supply have allowed price increases to moderate even as the economy has stayed resilient, he said.\n\n\"We don't see that as a problem,\" he said.\n\nThe favorable economy also means the Fed can afford to be patient as it weighs rate cuts, some officials say. In a recent speech, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said the central bank should move “methodically and carefully,” adding, “With economic activity and labor markets in good shape and inflation coming down gradually to 2%, I see no reason to move as quickly or cut as rapidly as in the past.”\n\nCould inflation go back up?\n\nBarclays is among economic research firms that also note it’s too soon to proclaim victory over inflation. Wage growth has moderated as a rebound in immigration has expanded the pool of available workers. But there are signs the increase in the labor supply has peaked, meaning the upward pressure on wages could resume. And while the gauge released Wednesday showed easing pay increases, another measure of hourly pay gains ticked up in December.\n\nMeanwhile, there’s a risk that the supply chain snarls that triggered inflation in the early days of the pandemic could flare again because of military conflict in the Red Sea, Barclays says.\n\nYet there may also be risks to moving too slowly. The inflation drop-off means interest rates after adjusting for inflation are more restrictive than the Fed would like, potentially hampering the economy more than is needed to bring price gains under control.\n\nAnd there are signs the labor market is wobbling, says Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle.\n\nJust a handful of industries have added jobs recently, including government, health care and restaurants, and hotels. Some of those sectors aren’t as sensitive to the ups and downs of the economy and interest rates. But they’re also volatile.\n\nWaiting too long to cut rates could cause \"weakening economic activity and employment,\" Powell acknowledged.\n\nFor more on interest rates and the economy, keep reading:\n\nWill interest rates fall on my credit cards?\n\nCredit card interest rates are unlikely to fall significantly in the months to come, experts say, because banks will be loath to reduce them.\n\nCredit card debt is a record $1.08 trillion, and delinquency rates have been rising. If the economy slows sharply, delinquencies may turn into charge-offs that banks take as losses.\n\nIf you have good credit, though, you may get lucky: The credit card marketplace remains competitive, and card issuers may offer attractive rates to applicants with high credit scores.\n\n– Medora Lee\n\nHow will the Fed’s actions (or inaction) affect the stock market?\n\nStocks were up and down on Wednesday. Over the longer term, however, the prospect that the Federal Reserve is done raising interest rates has been a boon for the stock market and for your 401(k).\n\nOver the last 10 rate hike cycles, dating to 1974, the S&P 500 index rose an average of 14.3% in the 12 months that followed the Fed’s final rate increase, according to an analysis by Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group.\n\nThe message? Investors really like it when the central bank stops beating them over the head with rate hikes. That may explain why the market has hit record territory in recent weeks.\n\n– Paul Davidson\n\nHow do Americans feel about the economy?\n\nConsumer confidence in the U.S. economy, while low, reached its highest point in two years on the latest Gallup Economic Confidence Index, released Tuesday.\n\nPolling in January put the Gallup index at -26 on a scale that runs from -100 to +100, summarizing whether America thinks the economy is getting better or worse.\n\nThe index hovered around plus-40 just before the 2020 pandemic shutdown, then plummeted to a low of -58 in June 2022, when inflation reached a historic high. The metric has gradually recovered in the months since.\n\n– Daniel de Visé\n\nFederal Reserve meetings 2024\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee next meets on March 19 and 20.

That kind of growth likely means the Fed will have achieved a coveted “soft landing” by restraining the economy enough to tamp down inflation without triggering a recession.\n\nSuch an outcome could boost President Joe Biden's reelection chances in November, while a slump could deal a significant blow. The surveyed economists reckon there’s a 42% chance of a downturn in 2024 - still historically high, but lower than earlier estimates.\n\nSeveral experts upgraded their outlook after retail sales over the holidays came in stronger than expected, giving the economy more momentum heading into the current quarter.\n\n– Paul Davidson\n\nWhat is the current inflation rate?\n\nIn December, overall prices rose 3.4% from a year earlier, according to the Labor Department’s consumer price index. On a monthly basis, costs increased 0.3% from November to December after virtually flatlining in the previous two months.\n\nInflation is easing from its 40-year high of 9.1%, reached in June 2022, but the downward path has been bumpy. A more gradual descent in consumer prices could prompt the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates higher for longer.

But even if you're sleep-deprived and haven't left your home in months, you still have to find the time to prepare a return.\n\nWith a new child, your taxes will get more complicated. But the flip side is you may qualify for a slew of new tax credits and deductions.\n\nHere's what new parents need to know for the 2024 tax season:\n\nGet a Social Security card for your child\n\nThe first order of business is to make sure your child has a Social Security number, said John Karls, a tax partner at Armanino, a national tax advisory firm. \"You can't claim your child as a dependent on your tax return if they don't have a Social Security number.\"\n\nIf you don't already have one for your child, you should apply now. But it could take awhile for the Social Security Administration to verify your child's birth certificate and identity, so Karls recommends filing for a six-month tax extension while you wait.\n\nWhen can you file taxes this year?Here's when the 2024 tax season opens.\n\nTax season 2024:Tax deadlines to keep in mind with Tax Day coming up\n\nHead of household status\n\nIf you're a single parent, for tax purposes you're considered the head of the household. That means you'll be able to claim a $20,800 standard deduction versus a $13,850 standard deduction for single filers without dependents.\n\nThere are also separate, more favorable tax brackets for heads of households.\n\nImportantly, the IRS won't automatically recognize that you're a single parent and thereby qualify for head-of-household status. You'll have to manually check a box yourself, or inform your tax preparer.\n\nIf you're married and cover more than half of your child's expenses, you would also be considered a head of household, but only if you file separately from your spouse.\n\nHow much do you get back in taxes for a child in 2023?\n\nGenerally, people think having a child will automatically lower their tax bill or trigger a larger refund. But in many cases, it depends on your income. Lower-income taxpayers are generally eligible for more generous tax credits and deductions after having or adopting a child, said Jim Daniels, a CPA and managing director at UHY Advisors, a tax and consulting services firm.\n\nAdoption tax credit\n\nIf you adopted a child in 2023, you may be able to qualify for a credit of up to $15,950 in adoption-related expenses you incurred per child. This could include adoption-related attorney fees, adoption fees, traveling expenses and more.\n\nTo claim the full credit, your modified adjusted gross income, which is generally close to your adjusted gross income, must be below $239,230. After that, the credit phases out and is not available for people who have a modified gross adjusted income of $279,230.\n\nThe credit is not refundable, meaning if you don't owe any taxes, you won't be able to claim the credit. However, you can carry it forward to reduce your tax liability in the future.\n\nHow much is the Child Tax Credit this year? What are the qualifications?\n\nIf you became a parent in 2023, you could qualify for the Child Tax Credit if you have an adjusted gross income of less than $200,000 or less than $400,000 if you're filing a joint return with a spouse.\n\nChild and dependent care credit income limit\n\nIf you are employed and pay for child care services, you may qualify for the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit. To qualify, you must have earned income in 2023 and have work-related care expenses, among other rules. You can seek the credit for up to $3,000 of expenses for one child, $6,000 for two or more children. The actual credit is a percentage of those expenses. See IRS Publication 503 for the formulas.\n\nEITC qualifications\n\nHaving a child could make you eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit. If you have one child and your adjusted gross income was $46,560 (filing alone) or $53,120 (filing jointly with a spouse), you could claim up to $3,995 in a refundable tax credit.\n\nMake adjustments to your W-4 withholding\n\nFinally, if you haven't already, you should make sure to fill out a new W-4 form if you have an employer, to reflect that you now have a dependent. This will likely lower the refund you get next year, but it will increase the size of your paychecks going forward, Daniels said, because less money will be withheld.\n\nMore of your 2024 tax season questions answered\n\nNew Federal tax brackets for 2023-2024.

It would raise Delmarva Power's total electric distribution rates $72.3 million annually, or roughly 25%.\n\nTo raise distribution rates, utilities must go through the Public Service Commission. Over several months, the utility's request is scrutinized by the commission, which hears arguments from Delaware's Public Advocate and other \"interveners,\" as well as public comment. The sides often work toward a compromise between the utility's and public advocate's positions decided by the commission.\n\nHere's what you need to know.\n\nHow much will my Delmarva Power bill increase?\n\nDelmarva Power wants to raise rates for space heating customers — customers that use electricity to heat their homes — by 13.2%, an addition of more than $11 to an average monthly bill. Residential customers who use another source for heat face a 10.6% increase, equivalent to a $10.41 per month increase for a typical customer.\n\nDelmarva Power spokesperson Zach Chizar said the company determined the revenue required to cover the costs of residential space heating customers had fallen behind that of non-space heating residential customers.\n\nThe rate increase is a combination of a requested distribution rate increase and the Distribution System Improvement Charge. DSIC, started in 2019, is placed on customer bills to provide a more routine way to pay for infrastructure and reliability expenses. It adjusts every six months and is automatically folded into the rate request.\n\nThe proposed cost increases will go into effect on July 15 but are subject to a refund based on the Public Service Commission's decision. A law passed by the General Assembly in 2018 allows utilities to implement the charges as the case is proceeding so they can recover costs related to capital improvements and associated expenses.\n\nWhy does Delmarva Power want to raise rates?\n\nThe company says the most significant factors driving its proposed rate increases are inflation, investments in system reliability and safety and increased costs to \"harden\" the grid against more frequent severe weather.\n\nIn their application to the Public Service Commission, Delmarva Power cites the impact of Tropical Storm Isaias and other severe weather events in 2020 that affected thousands of customers. The company expects the effects of climate change to make these events more frequent in future years.\n\nThe storms occurred after Delmarva Power's last rate increase request, which was submitted in March 2020. The company says it has since invested in its system to \"mitigate flood risks,\" repair and replace equipment damaged from storms and modernize.\n\nAccording to an infrastructure plan prepared for the commission, Delmarva Power is planning more than $430 million worth of improvements through 2024. A large component of the improvements is replacing decades-old wooden poles with larger steel poles, Chizar said.\n\n\"[The rate increases] are necessary for us in order to continue to provide the reliable service our customers expect,\" Chizar said.\n\nAnother element of Delmarva Power's argument is that as remote and hybrid work and electric transportation proliferate in future years, customer expectations for reliability will increase. The company's application also says that having a financially strong utility benefits customers by allowing the company to attract capital on \"reasonable terms.\" If Delmarva Power is viewed as a more risky investment, it could face challenges accessing needed funds, which would increase costs for customers.\n\nWhat is the Public Advocate's position?\n\nThe Public Advocate has been trying to reel in Delmarva Power's spending for several years to keep rates manageable.\n\n\"While we acknowledge reliability is extremely important, we are also very cognizant of affordability for customers,\" Delaware Public Advocate Andrew Slater said. \"This is one of the largest requests we've ever seen.\"\n\n\"They see inflation as a significant issue for them. I'd like to point out that inflation is a big issue for customers,\" Slater added. \"We need to really make sure we keep rates affordable for customers.\"\n\nDelmarva Power's merger with Exelon in 2016 capped spending for several years, but since those caps were lifted, spending has increased significantly. The planned $430 million spending through 2024 represents an increase of 155% over Delmarva Power's 2019 plant spending, according to the Public Advocate division.\n\nSlater said Delmarva Power's reliability already rates among the best in the nation. He argued at some point the continued investment reaches \"diminishing returns,\" and said the commission needs to make sure what is being invested is \"to the benefit of customers.\"\n\nSlater said the investments will increase sales, which is good for the utility, but from the customers' perspective, the state needs to continue to consider energy efficiency and renewable sources. He suggested \"non-wire alternatives\" should be a larger part of the state's approach moving forward.\n\n\"We are going through a generational shift in energy and we need to be prepared for that,\" Slater said. \"We need to have a wholistic approach to distribution planning.\"\n\nChizar said that although Delmarva Power has strong reliability now \"it's not just if we don't touch it, it's going to be perfect.\" He said they need to continue to upgrade and repair equipment to maintain reliability. He cited the company's payment assistance programs when asked about the impact on customers’ finances.\n\nWhen did Delmarva Power electric rates last increase?\n\nThe Public Service Commission approved a $16.7 million increase on Aug. 5, 2021. Delmarva Power had asked for an increase of $24.4 million.\n\nAre there rate increases for natural gas customers?\n\nDelmarva Power filed requests for electric and natural gas rate increases separately.\n\nThe company in March requested a $19.5 million natural gas increase, equaling a monthly increase of about $11 for typical customers. The increase went into effect on a temporary basis on Aug. 14. Natural gas supply rates have increased nearly 60% over the past two years, according to the Division of the Public Advocate.\n\nWhen and where are there opportunities for public comment?\n\nWritten comments may be sent by mail to Delaware Public Service Commission, Docket No. 22-0897, 861 Silver Lake Blvd., Suite 100, Dover, DE 19904, or by email to psc@delaware.gov. The Public Service Commission will hold an in-person public comment session once a procedural schedule is established.\n\nHow can I get help with my Delmarva Power bill?\n\nThe Delaware Energy Assistance Program offers grants to homeowners and renters to help pay for home heating and cooling. The state administers the program through Catholic Charities with money from the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program.

Here's why.", "text": "Soda. Pop. Whatever you call the bubbly beverage, you probably have noticed the price increase in recent years.\n\nWhat hasn’t increased? Inflation is at a 40-year high, and soft drink lovers haven’t been spared the cost when buying bottles or cans.\n\n“It’s upwards of $7 a 12-pack. No way. That’s just ridiculous,” said 42-year-old Rachel Hatfield, a retail worker from Canal Fulton.\n\n“We don't even buy it anymore. I used to enjoy one, maybe two a day. But even before inflation, I wouldn't purchase it unless there was a three for $10 or $12 deal going on. I can get two gallons of gas for the price of a 12-pack; I simply can't justify that in my already tight budget.\"\n\nThe cost of soda has gone up 45 percent in less than four years\n\nThe average cost of a 12-ounce can in a 12-pack of soda was 35 cents in January 2019. Now, the average cost for the same beverage is 51 cents, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That’s a more than 45% increase in less than four years.\n\nAt Target in Jackson Township, the cost of a 12-pack of Diet Pepsi was $4.99 in September 2020. The price was the same nine months later. But by September 2021, the cost for the same 12-pack rose to $5.49. And as of Sept. 1, the cost is now at $6.69 for that same 12-pack. It has a slight edge compared to a 12-pack of Diet Coke, which retails at $6.79.\n\nInflation:Supply chain, logistics and inflation hamper Diebold Nixdorf, company reduces 2022 outlook\n\n“$7 for a 12 pack. That’s just stupid money,” North Canton resident and local Airbnb host Rebecca Dunn shared in an informal poll on Instagram regarding soda price increases.\n\nLouisville resident and local teacher Kaytlin McCoy agrees that prices are out of control.\n\n“My husband and I are the only soda drinkers in our house. We both teach and use it as a quick, sugar-free caffeine fix during the school day, since we also only drink zero sugar. With the prices going up, it’s really cutting into our grocery budget, so now we limit ourselves to one to two cans per day,” 33-year-old McCoy said.\n\n“I understand we can just stop drinking it to save some money, but we both work full time and each have a master's degree. There’s no reason why we can’t ‘splurge’ a little. The prices, though, are just asinine.”\n\nMcCoy also mentioned that the cheapest place they have found to buy soda is Sam’s Club in Jackson Township, which is a trek from their Louisville home, so they have to make trips worthwhile and stock up on other goods.\n\nSave money at the grocery store:Save money at the grocery store. Foods to buy, meals to make to keep costs low\n\nShopping online from local retailers Acme Fresh Market and Fishers Foods will cost you even more than big-box stores. A 12-pack of Diet Pepsi costs $7.99 at both stores, while Diet Coke’s 12-pack of cans will run you $8.99 at Acme and $7.99 at Fishers.\n\nWhat's behind the rising soda prices?\n\nWhat’s causing the alarming increase?\n\nInflation can be blamed for part of it, but that’s not the whole story behind the skyrocketing prices.\n\nThe price increases started in early 2020, when people were panic buying because of the pandemic. Prices continued to rise in the soda industry thanks to the cost of aluminum increasing. According to Reuters in an early 2021 report, the cost of aluminum climbed about 60% over the course of a year.\n\nGrocery delivery:Which grocery stores offer curbside, delivery in Stark County?\n\nInflation caused prices to rise across all categories, but soda prices have continued to go up at overwhelming rates.\n\nEven with the price increase, beverage giants, like PepsiCo Inc. and Coca-Cola Co., haven’t seen a decrease in demand, according to Reuters. Because there isn’t much competition in the beverage industry outside of these two huge corporations, they likely will raise the rates even higher.\n\nDuring the second-quarter earnings call for Coca-Cola Co., Chairman and CEO James Quincey mentioned that consumer elasticities held up better than expected for the year to-date. But the company will be closely watching for changes in consumer behavior “as the average cost of the consumer basket continues to go up,” said Quincey.\n\nEven with all the turmoil with prices caused by the pandemic, Coca-Cola Co. has bounced back and hopes to continue growing.\n\n“We have managed a broad-based recovery coming out of the pandemic, our five-year average organic revenue growth rate is at the top end of our long-term growth target of 4% to 6%, which is a proof point of our transformed and strengthened organization,” Quincey said. “As we look to the second half of the year, we will continue to focus on raising the bar on the elements of our flywheels for top-line growth.”\n\nCoca-Cola Co. CFO and Executive Vice President John Murphy chimed in that the company will be closely monitoring consumer behavior and will adapt accordingly, possibly meaning prices could dip. But soda drinkers shouldn’t get their hopes up just yet.\n\n“Other costs, including wages, transportation, media and operating expenses are also increasing and adding incremental pressures,” Murphy said, which likely means costs will be pushed to the consumer.\n\nHow much is too much? When will consumers not be willing to pay the price?\n\nIt looks like the duopoly of PepsiCo Inc. and Coca-Cola Co. are willing to find out. According to Reuters, PepsiCo said it “expects fiscal 2022 core revenue to rise 10%, compared with a previous forecast of an 8% increase.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/02/13/january-cpi-report-inflation/72575311007/", "title": "January CPI report shows inflation continues to fall", "text": "Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Consumer inflation in the United States cooled last month yet remained elevated in the latest sign that the pandemic-fueled price surge is only gradually and fitfully coming under control.\n\nTuesday’s report from the Labor Department showed that the consumer price index rose 0.3% from December to January, up from a 0.2% increase the previous month. Compared with a year ago, prices are up 3.1%.\n\nThat is less than the 3.4% figure in December and far below the 9.1% inflation peak in mid-2022. Yet the latest reading is still well above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target level at a time when public frustration with inflation has become a pivotal issue in President Joe Biden’s bid for re-election.\n\nExcluding the volatile food and energy categories, so-called core prices climbed 0.4% last month, up from 0.3% in December and 3.9% over the past 12 months. Core inflation is watched especially closely because it typically provides a better read of where inflation is likely headed.\n\nA lower Social Security bump?COLA is seen falling, leaving seniors struggling and paying more tax\n\nProtect your assets: Best high-yield savings accounts of 2023\n\nTuesday's report showed that the drivers of inflation have decisively shifted from goods, like used cars, gasoline and groceries, which are now falling in price or rising much more slowly, to services, including hotel rooms, restaurant meals and medical care. That shift could raise concerns for the Fed, because services inflation typically takes longer to cool.\n\nAt his most recent news conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell singled out persistently high services prices as a concern and said the central bank's policymakers want services inflation to ease further before starting to cut their key interest rate.\n\n“There’s still some inflation in the system that’s going to take some time to work through,” said Omair Sharif, founder of Inflation Insights, a research firm. “This justifies the Fed wanting to wait and see how things are going to go.\"\n\nBiden administration officials frequently note that inflation has plummeted since pandemic-related supply disruptions and significant government aid sent it soaring three years ago. And a raft of forward-looking data suggests that inflation will continue to cool.\n\nThe pace of wage growth has slowed, which reduces the pressure on companies to raise prices to offset higher labor costs. And consumers and business owners collectively expect lower inflation in the coming months and years, a trend that can itself hold down price increases.\n\nStill, even as it nears the Fed’s target level, many Americans remain exasperated that average prices are still about 19% higher than they were when Biden took office.\n\n“We have concerns,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Tuesday, about the weaker-than-expected inflation report. She cautioned, however, against reading too much into monthly figures, noting that inflation is down by two-thirds since its peak and core inflation is its lowest since 2021.\n\n“But we certainly understand that there's more work to be done to lower costs,” she said.\n\nGas, groceries, services costing more\n\nFrom December to January, average national gas prices tumbled 3.3%, the government said. Yet so far this month, the average price has climbed higher, rising 15 cents to $3.23 a gallon as of Tuesday, according to AAA.\n\nGrocery prices rose 0.4% from December to January, the biggest such rise in a year, though compared with 12 months earlier, food prices are up just 1.2%.\n\nBut the costs of services — including auto insurance, apartment rents, and concert tickets — are still rising faster than they did before the pandemic and keeping overall inflation persistently high. The cost of car insurance has soared more than 20%, on average, compared with a year ago.\n\nSuch price spikes are causing heartburn for many consumers. Bill Milligan of Atlanta said he was stunned last month to find that the cost of insuring one of his cars had soared nearly 30% compared to six months earlier.\n\n“I was going, ‘What the hell is that?’” Milligan said he thought when he saw the charge on his bank statement.\n\nMilligan, a 46-year-old software architect, called his insurance company, which confirmed that the price increase didn’t reflect any recent tickets or accidents and said he was still receiving a discount for insuring several cars at once.\n\n“And they’re like, ‘Yeah, sorry, it’s just the price of everything is going up,’ ” Milligan said.\n\nMilligan, who said he received a substantial pay raise last year, acknowledged that financially he is still doing fine.\n\n“I can’t complain about this,” he said, referring to inflation overall.\n\nBut as with many Americans, higher prices have caused him to worry about the future. He wonders how his oldest of three daughters, who wants to become a schoolteacher, will live on an educator’s salary with costs having risen so high.\n\nFed will likely stay cautious about rate cuts\n\nThe mixed data released Tuesday will likely reinforce the caution of Fed officials, who have said they’re pleased with the progress in sharply reducing inflation but want to see further evidence before feeling confident that it’s sustainably headed back to their 2% target.\n\nBefore the report, Wall Street traders had priced in a 61% probability for a rate cut in May. But after Tuesday's inflation data, that probability had sunk to roughly 39%. Most economists still think the Fed will start cutting its rate in June from its 22-year-high of roughly 5.4%.\n\nAnother driver of high prices has been housing costs, particularly the price of home ownership. It rose 0.6% from December to January, the biggest one-month jump since April. That measure is 6.2% higher than it was a year earlier.\n\nThe cost of apartment rents increased 0.4% last month. Along with a 1.8% jump in hotel costs just in January, overall housing costs rose 0.6% last month and accounted for two-thirds of the total rise in month-to-month inflation.\n\nBut housing costs should slow in the coming months. The price of new apartment leases has been declining steadily as new apartment buildings have been completed. It can take months for the drop in new lease prices to feed through into the government's data.\n\nAt the same time, economists say that inflation in health care services is likely to stay high. The cost of hospital services jumped 1.6% just from December to January. Doctors' services rose 0.6%.\n\nSharif said those increases likely reflected, in part, sharp pay gains in recent years for nurses and other in-demand medical workers, such as anesthesiologists and radiologists.\n\nThe Fed raised its key rate 11 times, from March 2022 to July of last year, in a concerted drive to defeat high inflation. The result has been much higher borrowing rates for businesses and consumers, including for mortgages and auto loans. Rate cuts, whenever they happen, would eventually lead to lower borrowing costs for many categories of loans.\n\nLower borrowing costs could boost economic growth. But a strong economy may also pose a challenge for the Fed because faster growth can accelerate wages and consumer spending. If businesses aren’t able to keep up with greater customer demand, they typically respond by raising prices, which would worsen inflation.\n\nIn the final three months of last year, the economy grew at an unexpectedly rapid 3.3% annual rate. There are signs that growth remains healthy so far in 2024. Businesses engaged in a burst of hiring last month. Surveys of manufacturing companies found that new orders rose in January. And services companies reported an uptick in sales.\n\nDow drops after inflation report\n\nU.S. stocks are falling Tuesday after worse-than-expected inflation data forced investors to question hopes that have sent Wall Street to record heights.\n\nThe S&P 500 was 1.2% lower in midday trading as traders delayed their forecasts for when the Federal Reserve will deliver the cuts to interest rates they crave so much. The hotter-than-expected inflation report may have put the final nail into hopes that the first cut could arrive in March. It also pushed many forecasts past May into June, according to data from CME Group.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 480 points, or 1.2%, from its record set a day earlier. The Nasdaq composite, which has been flirting with its all-time high set in 2021, was down 1.3%, as of 11 a.m. Eastern time.\n\nHigh interest rates hurt all kinds of investments, and they tend to particularly hurt high-growth stocks like technology companies. A 1.6% drop for Microsoft and 1.3% dip for Amazon were two of the heaviest weights on the market.\n\nThe losses were widespread, with roughly 90% of stocks in the S&P 500 falling in a wipeout. Stocks of smaller companies fell even more than the rest of the market because high interest rates could hurt them more than their bigger rivals by making it more difficult to borrow cash. The Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks dropped 3.1%.\n\nSome analysts warned the inflation data could mean not only a delay to rate cuts but also the possibility that the Fed would raise rates further. The Fed has already pulled its main interest rate to the highest level since 2001 in hopes of grinding down high inflation. High rates work by slowing the overall economy and hurting prices for investments.\n\nContributing: Joey Garrison of USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/13"}]}
